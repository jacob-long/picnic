          "authors": "Aimane Benammar",
          "abstract": "High dimensional omics, longitudinal clinical data, and surveillance streams are now routine in translational research, yet reproducibility and governance often lag behind. We present a framework developed at Institut Pasteur that makes analysis auditable, portable, and privacy preserving. It couples containerised Nextflow/Snakemake pipelines for bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics with rigorous quality control, ComBat batch harmonisation that preserves biological covariates, and a biostatistics layer (generalised linear and mixed effects models, Cox survival, hierarchical components) with explicit false discovery rate control. An epidemiology module computes vaccine effectiveness (VE), attack rates, effective reproduction number Rt, and case control odds ratios with robust intervals. Metadata follow FAIR principles and map to HL7 FHIR resources; identifiers are pseudonymised under role based access control. On synthetic exemplars shaped by real cohort constraints, we report concrete outcomes: batch attributable variance drops from 18.7% to 3.9%, differential expression signals remain stable, a LASSO gene expression signature achieves outer fold ROC AUC 0.81 ± 0.02 with calibration slope 0.98 and intercept 0.01, VE rises from 0.63 to 0.79 as Rt falls from 1.14 to 0.89, and covariate imbalance (median SMD) reduces from 0.21 to 0.06 after matching. End to end runs reproduce byte identically across laptops and HPC under Docker. The framework is a conservative baseline for clinical bioinformatics and methods teaching, not a medical device.",

          "authors": "Alex O. Holcombe; Rasmus Pedersen; Malgorzata Lagisz; Pietro Pollo; Marton Kovacs; Mohammad Hosseini",
          "abstract": "Crediting of research contributions is critical for career advancement and the allocation of research funding. However, some research contributors are mentioned only in an acknowledgments section, which results in relatively little recognition, because acknowledged contributions are not indexed by scholarly databases. Here, we contextualize this shortfall in terms of the broader contributorship movement to recognize specific research contributions rather than relying on the broad, vague, and sometimes restrictive concept of academic authorship. After reviewing three routes that advance contributorship, we focus on enhancing the function and usefulness of acknowledgments sections, proposing that: 1) when acknowledging individuals, authors include their ORCID numbers (subject to the acknowledgees’ approval); 2) publishers solicit identities of acknowledgees in a similar way to how they do so for authors in their submission portals; and 3) publishers include metadata (e.g. full names, ORCID, roles) of acknowledgees in JATS-XML files. Implementing any of these steps could lead some scholarly databases to index non-author contributors. The ensuing increase in visibility for research contributors such as technicians and library professionals should result in greater recognition of their roles, including by those who allocate resources.",

          "authors": "Stephan Bruns; Chris Gabriel Islam; Helmut Herwartz; Thomas Kneib; Robert Malina",
          "abstract": "Researchers face incentives to write up their empirical findings in a way that maximizes publication success. We analyze the language of journal articles and its association with statistical significance to explore questionable research practices at the stage of writing up articles, using 140,606 articles from health, biology, psychology, economics, and multidisciplinary journals over 32 years. For most disciplines, a higher share of non-significant main findings is associated with more hedging and negative striking words, fewer positive striking words, and fewer superlatives. We neither find evidence that authors upsell ambiguous results using sensational language nor that ambiguous results are written up less readably. Contrarily, articles with a higher share of statistically significant main findings are written up more sensationally. We find that emphasis on (marginal) statistical significance increases with the share of non-significant main findings, reflecting a dichotomized interpretation of p-values based on arbitrary thresholds. Particularly, p-excuses give the impression of statistical significance when the finding is actually not significant, consistent with the notion of 'spin'. This study provides empirical insights that might help researchers to self-reflect on writing up empirical findings. More training and fewer incentives to sell findings using sensational language and spin can help to improve academic writing.",

          "authors": "Scott C Edmunds; Nicole Nogoy; Qing Lan; Hongfang Zhang; Yannan Fan; Hongling Zhou; Chris J Armit",
          "abstract": "The increasing use of AI-based approaches such as machine learning (ML) across diverse scientific fields presents challenges for reproducibly disseminating and assessing research. As ML becomes integral to a growing range of computationally intensive applications (e.g. clinical research), there is a critical need for transparent reporting methods to ensure both comprehensibility and the reproducibility of the supporting studies. There are a growing number of standards, checklists and guidelines enabling more standardized reporting of ML research, but the proliferation and complexity of these make them challenging to use. Particularly in assessment and peer review, which has to date, been an ad hoc process that has struggled to throw light on increasingly complicated computational supporting methods that are otherwise unintelligible to other researchers. Taking the publication process beyond these black boxes, GigaScience Press has experimented with integrating many of these ML-standards into the publication process. Having a broad-scope that necessitated looking at more generalist and automated approaches. Here, we map the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) standards, and outline our adoption of the DOME recommendations for Machine Learning in biology. We developed a publishing workflow that integrates the DOME Data Stewardship Wizard and DOME Registry tools into the peer-review and publication process. From this case study we provide journal authors, reviewers and Editors examples of approaches, workflows and strategies to more logically disseminate and review ML research. Demonstrating the need for continued dialogue and collaboration among various ML communities to create unified, comprehensive standards, to enhance the credibility, sustainability and impact of ML-based scientific research.",

          "authors": "Patrick Vu",
          "abstract": "In a canonical model of the publication process, I show that the interaction between standard error corrections and selective publication can inadvertently increase bias in published studies. This occurs because larger standard errors raise the bar for statistical significance, exacerbating publication bias. I examine this phenomenon in difference-in-differences studies, where clustering is associated with a near doubling of effect sizes. Using an empirical model, I find that clustering led to large improvements in coverage but also sizable increases in bias. Nonetheless, clustering is welfare-improving from a decision-theoretic standpoint, as more accurate belief updating outweighs the costs of increased publication bias.",

          "authors": "Tamas Krivachy",
          "abstract": "We show that citation metrics of journal articles in many of the online-only Springer Nature journals and associated ones are distorted, going back to articles from 2001. We find that most likely due to an API response error, there are many incorrect references which typically lead to Article Number 1 of a given Volume. Among others, the issue affects journals such as Scientific Reports, Nature Communications, Communications journals, Cell Death &amp; Disease, Light: Science &amp; Applications, as well as many BMC, Discovery and npj journals. Beyond the negative effect of introducing incorrect reference information, this distorts the citation statistics of articles in these journals, with a few articles being massively over-cited compared to their peers, while many lose citations; e.g. both in Scientific Reports and in Nature Communications, 5 of the 10 top cited articles have article numbers of 1. We validate the distorted statistics by assessing data from multiple scientific literature databases: Crossref, OpenCitations, Semantic Scholar, and the journals' websites. The issue primarily arises from the inconsistent transition from page-based referencing of articles to article number-based referencing, as well as the improper handling of the change in the publisher's article metadata API. It seems that the most pressing problem has been present since approximately 2011, which we estimate affects the citation count of millions of authors.",

          "abstract": "Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is a normally distributed personality trait reflecting sensitivity to stimuli. However, despite societal interest, it is unclear how SPS relates to Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here we aimed to 1) explore the relation between SPS and ADHD traits, and their respective subdimensions, 2) compare people with and without an ADHD diagnosis on SPS subdimensions, 3) assess relations between SPS and several ADHD-related strengths. 496 adults were recruited from the general population via the online platform Prolific. Participants filled in questionnaires on SPS (Highly Sensitive Person Scale with subdimensions: ease of excitation, low sensory threshold, aesthetic sensitivity), ADHD traits (Adult ADHD Self Report scale with subdimensions: inventiveness, hyperactivity-impulsivity), and nine questionnaires on ADHD-related strengths. We performed correlation and case-control analysis. SPS and subdimensions correlated positively with ADHD traits and subdimensions. Furthermore, people with an ADHD diagnosis scored higher on SPS than those without. SPS correlated positively with the ADHD-related strengths of hyperfocus and cognitive flexibility, and the SPS aesthetic sensitivity subdimension additionally with curiosity, humour, and empathy; these associations remained significant correcting for ADHD traits. Concluding, SPS and ADHD positively associated, using continuous and case-control analyses. SPS also positively correlated with several strengths.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness has been associated with several detrimental effects for individuals and societies, making it a priority for monitoring across the European Union. While many loneliness measures currently exist, notable gaps exist regarding knowledge of their psychometric structure, reliability, comparability, and validity, particularly as it pertains to their suitability for EU-wide population surveys. Relying on data from the EU Loneliness Survey covering the 27 EU member states (N=25,646), we examined the factor structure, internal consistency, measurement invariance, and construct validity of the six-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS-6), the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (T-ILS), and a single-item measure of loneliness. Our analyses followed a two-step process, with exploratory analyses conducted in an exploratory fold, followed by pre-registered confirmatory analyses in a confirmatory fold. The DJGLS-6 showed a sufficient fit to a two-factor structure in 11 countries, sufficient internal consistency across all 27 countries, scalar invariance for a cluster of five countries, metric invariance for a cluster of eight countries, no invariance for a cluster of 17 countries, and sufficient construct validity for 25 countries. The T-ILS showed a sufficient fit to a one-factor structure in 23 countries, sufficient internal consistency across all 27 countries, scalar invariance across all 27 countries, and sufficient construct validity for 21 countries. Finally, the single-item measure of loneliness demonstrated sufficient construct validity in 19 countries. Overall, these findings suggest that the T-ILS may currently be the most suitable measure for monitoring loneliness across the European Union.",

          "abstract": "When people have conflicting goals, they sometimes use intentional misunderstandings (loopholes) to get around direct defiance. Both adults and children expect exploiting loopholes to be less costly than non-compliance (Bridgers et al., 2021; Bridgers et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023). However, the mitigating effect of loopholes may not hold if they are used to dodge a moral obligation. Here, we replicated the finding that loopholes are less costly than non-compliance in neutral contexts, but found that loopholes were as bad as non-compliance in moral contexts (Experiment 1, N = 360). We then directly compared the behaviors to see if, in moral contexts, exploiting a loophole might be even worse than non-compliance (Experiment 2, N=150). We replicated the finding that loopholes are more exonerating in neutral than moral contexts, and that moral context has a differential effect, but did not find a reversal (Experiment 2, N=150). Finally, we assessed three negative indirect costs of loopholes (blame, permissibility, and offense) and again found a differential effect of moral context (Experiment 3, N = 453). We discuss why using loopholes in moral violations may be uniquely unacceptable.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Figueroa; Merrick Robinson Osborne; Sa-kiera Tiarra Jolynn Hudson",
          "abstract": "Arbitrary social hierarchies permeate our working lives in ways not always visible, introducing anti-egalitarian norms which stymie productivity. Reviewing bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We contend that the literatures converge on a single, sobering logic: because organizations are embedded in—and seek legitimacy from—broader socio-historical contexts, the same arbitrary hierarchies that stratify societies are naturally imported into organizational life. At the same time, individuals are motivated to obscure the influence of these hierarchies to reduce psychological distress. We leverage institutional theory and systems psychodynamics to map how organizations are at the crux of external pressures (from society) and upward pressure (from employees) which both perpetuate and obfuscate the replication of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in organizations. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the commonplace or subtle nature of the microaggression to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – anti-egalitarian organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in their workplace.",

          "abstract": "The effect of parent-adolescent conflict on emotional well-being has been well-documented. However, daily processes related to conflict and positive and negative affect have been overlooked. We tested the mutual effects between parent-adolescent conflict and affect in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries between 14 to 21 days to rate their positive and negative affect, and conflict interactions between October 2021 and August 2023. The participants were mostly from families with high socioeconomic status, most of the parents were biological mothers, and over half of the parents were Caucasian. Adolescents were between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.37, SD = 1.28). We tested the daily associations between negative/positive affect and conflict interactions in one dynamic structural equation model (DSEM). Contrary to our expectations, greater adolescent negative affect on a day was associated with lower parent-reported conflict next day. Further, both within- and between-family level correlations between adolescent and parent negative and positive affect were significant. Greater parent and adolescent conflict was related to lower positive and greater negative affect for parents and adolescents. Thus, while both same-day and mean-level associations over time indicate that conflicts are linked to poorer affective well-being, and parents may have made efforts to improve their affect the following day in an attempt to compensate for the conflicts experienced the day before. Further, this effort was appeared to be driven by the adolescents’ rather than the parents’ emotional experiences.",

          "abstract": "A recently published pilot study, \"Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Chronic Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder in Syrian Refugee Women – A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study\" by Timotaos\nBasmaji (2025), demonstrated the effectiveness of culturally adapted Virtual Reality\nExposure Therapy (VRET) in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among\nSyrian refugee women residing in Lebanon. The intervention resulted in a mean reduction of\n30.75 points on the PCL-5, exceeding typical outcomes reported in the literature. This brief\nreport explores a contextual factor not addressed in the original analysis: the impact of trauma\nreactivation due to concurrent regional conflict. During baseline assessment, participants were\nexposed to war-related media coverage and escalating hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel,\nlikely triggering symptom spikes. Drawing on trauma theory and neuroscience, this report\nintroduces and coins the reactivation-enhanced therapeutic response hypothesis, suggesting\nthat symptom elevation may prime emotional memory systems for deeper reconsolidation during\ntherapy. These findings underscore the importance of crisis-sensitive timing and highlight the\nneed for rapid-access trauma interventions during reactivation windows in humanitarian settings.",

          "abstract": "Real-world assets---such as projects, jobs, skills, or relationships---change endogenously with continued investment, often improving at variable rates. These structural dynamics pose a challenge: How do we decide what asset to invest in and when to divest from an underperforming asset? In this paper, we propose a normative model of asset selection and switching. We hypothesize that people use Bayesian function learning to infer invariant, structural parameters underlying changes in asset performance, and choose assets based on forecasted final performances at a task-specific time horizon. We test the model in four experiments ($N = 460$) that manipulate the setup (selection versus switching), time horizons, and statistical properties of asset performance trajectories. The Bayesian forecasting model consistently outperforms myopic alternatives inspired by foraging and study time allocation, which instead assume direct continuation of recent observations and rely solely on them. Our results highlight a distinctive form of future-looking cognition: humans anticipate how their own actions will shape future asset performance, and draw on representations of underlying structural dynamics to inform their current choices. The Bayesian probabilistic forecasting model therefore offers a principled computational account of how humans make decisions with lasting consequences.",

          "authors": "Cyrus Fletcher Kirkman; Robert Tsai; Ikponmwosa Pat-Osagie; Julius Rodriguez; Tianxing Guo; Megan Cady; Aaron Blaisdell",
          "abstract": "Operant boxes are fundamental tools for studying animal behavior in laboratory settings. While commercial operant boxes offer standardized designs and software for immediate use, they come with significant drawbacks, including high start-up and maintenance costs, limited software flexibility, restricted experimental design options, time-intensive daily operation, and rigid data structures. The constraints posed by commercial operant boxes have constrained the scope and applications of animal research for decades. Custom-made operant boxes combat these limitations but historically have only been accessible to labs with dedicated engineering expertise and/or high budgets. The rise of accessible consumer electronic technologies like Raspberry Pi microcomputers, open-source software, and advanced search and inference tools (e.g., large language models) has made it feasible for non-experts to create cost-effective, customizable operant boxes. Recent projects have laid out their own blueprint designs for affordable open-source operant boxes, but many of these are simply proof-of-concept or isolated to specific experimental applications. We outline key considerations for custom designing versatile, low-cost, and robust multi-operant box systems by discussing our designs for a Raspberry Pi-powered pigeon operant box, equipped with touchscreen capabilities and modular stimulus control. This system features components sourced online, requires no specialized tools/skills (e.g., no soldering or intensive software for hardware interaction), and obviates the need for extended electrical engineering knowledge. Utilized hardware and software systems are highly adaptable, enabling precise customization for a wide range of tasks, behaviors, and experimental organisms. We also provide a streamlined framework for implementing cloud connectivity, version-controlled code design, automated data synchronization across multiple boxes using modern cloud platforms, and scalability for larger or smaller systems. Furthermore, this system costs a fraction (approximately 4%) of commercial alternatives. Our system's versatility is demonstrated through its application to diverse behavioral studies in pigeons, rats, humans, and even plants. Finally, we explore the integration of large language models for software development and troubleshooting, highlighting their potential to further simplify and enhance custom operant box systems.",

          "abstract": "Prediction errors (PE) are thought to drive associative learning. While neural signals consistent with PE encoding have been identified, the expression of PE in psychophysiological indices remains debated. Here, we sought to fill this gap by investigating responses to unconditioned stimulus (US) occurrence and probability in skin conductance responses (SCR), pupil size responses (PSR), heart period responses (HPR), and respiration amplitude responses (RAR). Data set 1 consisted of 8 published studies (N1 = 264) using differential fear conditioning with partial reinforcement (50%), and novel data set 2 (N2 = 29) parametrically varied US probability (20%/50%/80%). Across both data sets, all data modalities showed differential response to the US compared to US omission. In data set 1, there was evidence for responses to unexpected US omission in all modalities, but no responses were consistent with signed PE encoding. Similarly, data set 2 provided no evidence that US or US omission responses scaled with outcome probability, which is incompatible with PE encoding. In conclusion, all recorded psychophysiological signals responded strongly to US and less strongly to unexpected US omission, with no evidence of a signed prediction error encoding.",

We have four broad replies. First, the 'dark' trait literature has been far from responsible in their use of this term. Second, there is good precedent for replacing popular, problematic terms such that no loss is incurred by the field. Third, we did indeed provide empirical evidence to substantiate our claims regarding stigma associated with the term 'dark'. Fourth, growth of a term or research area is not inherently good.

Far fewer used AI for interpretive or diagnostic purposes, and none relied on it to generate entire reports. Nearly all users (94%) edited AI-generated content before use. On average, practitioners who used AI for report writing saved 6.3 hours per week (95% CI: 4.6–8.1), more than double the savings of those using AI for other tasks (≈3 hours).

          "authors": "Catherine Culot; Joran Engelschenschilt; Sarah Garfinkel; Wim Gevers; Wim Notebaert",
          "abstract": "According to Fechner’s law, perceived sensations increase logarithmically with stimulus intensity. In the context of exercise, rising physical effort is therefore accompanied by increasingly salient bodily signals such as heart rate. Interoception, the sensing of internal bodily states, supports adaptive responses to these changing demands, for instance, by guiding the regulation of exertion. Beyond physical regulation, interoceptive signals have also been proposed to inform higher-order monitoring processes, such as error detection. Yet it remains unclear whether acute exercise sharpens cardiac interoception and whether enhanced access to bodily signals translates into greater awareness of errors. In a within-subject design, 36 healthy adults completed two tasks while cycling at low versus moderate intensity: a Heart Rate Discrimination Task assessing cardiac interoceptive accuracy and insight, and a Go/No-Go task measuring error awareness through post-error reports. Moderate effort selectively improved interoceptive accuracy (threshold closer to true heart rate), without changes in precision of lapse rate. Physical effort also made participants more confident in their interoceptive judgments, but this confidence increase was unrelated to actual accuracy. In the Go/No-Go task, commission errors were more frequent during cycling, yet the proportion of consciously detected errors was unaffected. Interoceptive performance did not reliably predict error awareness. These results indicate that acute exercise recalibrates cardiac interoception, likely by enhancing the salience of afferent signals, but does not strengthen higher-order monitoring of action. Error-related cardiac responses may thus reflect affective or orienting processes rather than a causal basis for awareness.",

          "abstract": "Human decision-making plays a critical role in distinguishing real from artificially-generated synthetic content. These decisions are particularly important when classifying faces and voices due to the rich personal and social information that they hold, meaning synthetic faces and voices, commonly known as \"deepfakes\" are frequently used for identity theft, financial fraud, and misinformation campaigns. It is currently unknown whether detection of real versus synthetic content is modality-specific, or whether it generalizes across sensory domains. We conducted a preregistered study in which participants classified real and AI-generated synthetic faces and voices. Overall classification accuracy was 65% for faces and 54% for voices. Using signal detection theory to analyze individuals' ability to classify stimuli, we observed no evidence of a domain-general effect, indicating that detection ability may not generalize across face and voice domains and is instead, domain-specific. Participants' confidence tracked accuracy for faces but not for voices, suggesting that metacognitive insight may also be modality-specific. Findings are discussed in terms of whether detection of synthetic content is underpinned by its own cognitive and social mechanisms, or whether classification is driven purely by domain-specific abilities. In applied settings, including forensic, legal, and security, it is vital to recognize that expertise in detecting synthetic content might be modality specific.",

          "abstract": "Many parents lie to their children. Because prominent socialization theories hypothesize that children learn about lying via parental modeling of lying or honesty, it is important to examine whether parental lying affects children’s lying behavior. While there is empirical evidence for the modeling effect of lying by an experimenter on child’s lying, a modeling effect has never been studied in parent-child dyads. The current preregistered study is the first to manipulate parental lying to examine its effects on children’s polite lying. Parents (n = 105) were randomly assigned to a lie- or truth-condition where they told a polite lie or the truth about a drawing of an experimenter in front of their child. Polite lying of their 4- to 8-year-old was subsequently assessed in the disappointing gift paradigm where children received an undesired gift from the same experimenter. Our results demonstrated no effect of parental modeling of lying or honesty on child’s polite lying. The results are discussed in context of parent-child history of interactions, the societal norms around polite lying, and socialization messages conveyed from parental modeling. Although we do not find evidence for a direct effect of parental modeling of polite lying on child polite lying, future research is warranted to explore the effect of parental modeling on child lying in alternative experimental designs, the potential effect of parental modeling of lying for other types of lies and beyond the experimental context.",

          "abstract": "In controversial ethical issues professional obligations may conflict with personal values. Actors may assume roles that do not correspond with their personal values.  We examined actors in the theater play \"Gott\" by Ferdinand von Schirach dealing with assisted suicide. We investigated how actors perceive the arguments, identify with their roles, and deal with role conflicts. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the complete cast of a production of “Gott” in Switzerland and used qualitative content analysis to answer our research questions. Articulating arguments positively influenced actors' perceived attitudes toward assisted suicide, aiding in the formation of their own stance, and shifting their perceptions of affected individuals. In contrast, one actress whose role did not produce arguments had difficulties forming her attitude. Being unable to form an attitude can lead to moral distress. Identification with the roles was highly individual, but most actors identified with their roles. Unlike prior work that assumed negative effects of complete role identification on actors, we demonstrated that experienced actors can maintain psychological boundaries while engaging deeply with complex moral narratives.",

          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, or ‘cumulative cultural evolution’, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to (i) engage in costly innovation and (ii) whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was impossible, preferences for information sharing declined to levels comparable to non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we used an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model was applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learned to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results showed that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Healthy individuals typically update their self-beliefs more in response to desirable than to undesirable social feedback. While this positivity bias is well-documented in real-life interactions, it remains unknown whether merely simulating social feedback elicits a similar effect and how the subjective realism of such simulated experiences influences self-belief updating. In two online studies (exploratory pilot n=37; preregistered replication n=85), participants rated themselves and an average person on personality traits both before and after vividly imagining receiving desirable or undesirable social feedback. They also rated how realistic each simulated feedback felt. Using linear mixed-effects modeling, the preregistered replication confirmed that mental simulation alone can elicit positively biased self-belief updating: participants integrated simulated desirable feedback more than undesirable feedback. Notably, this positivity bias reversed when updating beliefs about an average person, underscoring the self-specific nature of this cognitive phenomenon. Critically, simulated desirable feedback was perceived as more realistic than undesirable feedback—particularly when directed at the self—and this heightened realism reliably predicted the extent of belief revision. Together, our findings uncover mental simulation and subjective realism as key cognitive mechanisms underpinning asymmetric self-belief updating, shedding light on how simulated experiences shape self-perception—with broad implications for cognition, motivation, and psychological well-being.",

In non-autistic individuals, increased synchrony adversely affects self-regulation abilities. Yet, synchronization in autistic individuals has primarily been examined in conversational contexts. Methods: In this study, 33 autistic and 33 non-autistic adults performed a dyadic movement task in which participants were asked to “have a conversation without words”, only by improvising movements. Using an inertial sensor-based motion channel system, we investigated interpersonal synchrony. Results: Our findings indicated that autistic, non-autistic, and mixed dyads exhibited consistent levels of synchronization. Although all three dyad groups exhibited a reduction in negative affect after the task, positive affect increased solely for the non-autistic participants. Furthermore, all three dyads exhibited enhanced self-regulation, albeit to a lesser extent among the non-autistic participants. Conclusion: Our results indicate that when interpersonal synchronization is assessed during spontaneous whole-body movements rather than verbal conversations, autistic persons may synchronize to the same degree as non-autistic dyads, regardless of whether they interact with another autistic or non-autistic person.",

Data from 330 participants (Nwomen = 215), aged 18 years or older were analyzed. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original eight-factor structure with acceptable model fit, and the Turkish version demonstrated strong reliability and validity. All emotions except powerlessness correlated with emotional affinity toward nature, supporting convergent validity, while distinct associations with affective reactivity confirmed divergent validity. Climate anger, sorrow, anxiety, and enthusiasm were positively associated with pro-climate behaviors, while contempt showed negative associations across all behavioral measures. Gender differences largely aligned with previous findings, with women reporting higher levels of most emotions except contempt. The relationship between climate emotions and well-being showed nuanced associations: contempt correlated negatively with well-being, whereas anger, anxiety, and sorrow showed small positive correlations. These findings indicate that climate emotions are multidimensional constructs that reflect both adaptive and motivational processes, and the Turkish ICE provides a robust instrument for future cross-cultural research on the psychological dimensions of climate change.",

However, it is unclear how parent-child mismatches in educational aspirations evolve over time. Here, we examine (1) the prevalence of mismatching aspirations across school grades 3–9 (ages 8–15), (2) their stability over time, and (3) whether converging aspirations tend to converge to parents’ or to children’s aspirations. We also investigate (4) whether parent-child mismatches in aspirations depend on the opportunities that a child is afforded in an education system that sorts pupils into distinct tracks, thus shaping educational trajectories and final educational attainment. We use data from two German National Educational Panel Study cohorts (“kindergarten cohort”: N=4,217; “5th grade cohort”: N=3,908). Findings indicate that in school grade 3, 30% of parent-child dyads have mismatching aspirations; this percentage shrinks to 14-22% across grades 4–9. Mismatching aspirations are relatively instable, indeed much less stable over time than matching aspirations. Among younger children, aspirations mostly converge to their parents’ aspirations. Among older children, aspirations tend to converge in both directions. We also find that parent-child mismatches in aspirations vary considerably according to the educational track that the child ends up attending in secondary school. We conclude that parents and children incorporate the educational opportunities afforded to the child into their aspirations; aspiration mismatches evolve over time and as a result of institutional influences.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancements of generative AI (GenAI) technologies have brought the issue of data manipulation to a whole new level. Now individuals can easily create highly realistic fabricated media, including videos, audio, and images, that are increasingly difficult to detect. These developments raise broad societal concerns, particularly in legal contexts, where authenticity of evidence is central to ensuring fairness. This review links documented legal cases to psychological research on memory distortion and false confessions to explore how AI-generated evidence affects individuals’ perception and sense of self and the consequences in a legal context. Decades of research have shown that memory’s vulnerability to suggestion, especially highlighting the power of personalized misinformation. Even in the pre-AI era, studies have shown how false memories have been induced using suggestion and simple media manipulations and how these have led to false confessions. GenAI adds another level of concern, yet no research directly examines its potential to distort memory and to elicit false confessions. This paper identifies urgent questions: How does AI-generated evidence impact memory? How can individuals ensure authenticity of the evidence confronting them? And how can legal systems prepare for the erosion of trust brought upon by this uncertainty? Proposed solutions like watermarking and implementation of authenticity protocols offer partial relief; however, the rapid advancements make sure that no definitive safeguards can be implemented. Understanding how GenAI interacts with our memory vulnerabilities is critical not only for legal psychology but for safeguarding the integrity of justice in today’s digitally mediated society.\n\nKeywords: Generative AI, deepfakes, memory distortion, legal psychology, false confessions, trust in evidence",

We apply this methodology to analyse the results of three recognition memory experiments that vary the number of study presentations, study-test modality, focused vs. divided attention, and read vs. generate. In each case, the data are well-described by a shift representable model with a recovered distributional form revealing a negative skew consistent with the extreme value or Gumbel distribution. We propose that if these results can be generalised across different experiments, it becomes possible to define a standard unit of measurement of familiarity.

Third, we review predictors and moderators of responses to identify the conditions that help predict when and how groups and group members react in specific ways. Evidence shows that perceived intergroup threats often lead to negative outcomes such as polarization and negative emotions, while fostering positive intragroup effects. In contrast, perceived intragroup threats, while emotionally challenging and potentially weakening the ingroup, may improve intergroup relations.

          "abstract": "Our environment is saturated with different types of distractions, yet digital distractions have emerged as some of the most prevalent in modern education, particularly for college students who are constantly interrupted by digital distractions while trying to focus on their academic workload. These distractions, ranging from smartphone notifications to multitasking on multiple devices, can detract from academic pursuits and lead to decreased academic performance. Our attention is limited and scarce, so the ability to suppress such distractions is crucial for academic success. This study aims to investigate the relationship between individual differences in engagement with digital distractions and performance on an attentional suppression task, as well as their impact on grade point average (GPA). Specifically, we assessed whether engaging in digital distractions, as measured by the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS), along with the ability to ignore distractors in favor of target stimuli, affect academic outcomes like GPA. We hypothesized that individuals who were more susceptible to digital distractions and who were less efficient in attentional suppression tasks would exhibit lower GPAs compared to their counterparts who manage distractions better. The analysis investigated how SDS scores and performance on an attentional suppression task collectively predict GPA among college students. Surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between SDS scores and performance on the attentional suppression task, nor between SDS scores and GPA. While this study contributes to the growing literature on how digital distractions influence students’ academic focus and offers guidance for supporting academic performance in the face of widespread digital interruptions, the findings also suggest that real-world distraction may be driven by more complex mechanisms than cognitive distractor suppression alone.",

          "abstract": "This review systematically investigated preregistered studies concerning extra-sensory perception (ESP) and mind-matter interaction (micro psychokinesis, PK). The primary aims were to evaluate their outcomes and compare the percentage of positive findings with those observed in mainstream psychology. Our methodology adhered to the PRISMA Guidelines. We searched major preregistration repositories, including the Open Science Framework and the Koestler Parapsychology Unit (KPU) Study Registry, and relevant meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria focused on completed studies with available preregistration and final results only for confirmatory hypotheses. A positive outcome was defined as the support of at least one confirmatory hypothesis, strictly following preregistered procedures and statistics without deviation. A total of 46 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 17 studies (36.9%) reported a positive outcome. Interestingly, and contrary to some expectations, a broader comparison indicated that preregistered studies concerning ESP and PK did not necessarily exhibit a much lower proportion of confirmed hypotheses when compared to results for preregistered studies in mainstream psychology.",

However, such tasks poorly characterise the quality of experience, or qualia, for short. To characterise attentional effects on qualia, we combined a dual-task attention paradigm with similarity rating tasks to examine whether relational structures of qualia are altered by top-down attentional amplification. Under the same physical input, withdrawing attention collapsed the structures of qualia of letters (N=14) and red/green bisected disks (N=14), but not of faces (N=13), as quantified via a novel unsupervised optimal transport alignment technique. Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks. Our novel approach that combines similarity ratings, quantitative alignment and attentional perturbation is a powerful new approach to elucidate the structural properties of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions are influenced by personality traits such as approach-avoidance motives. However, it remains unclear how traits, states, and interpersonal perceptions interact to shape everyday social experiences – and for whom their interactions are most consequential. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing personality-in-context models and identifying mechanisms underlying deficits in interpersonal functioning. A two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment was conducted with 136 participants (N = 3,991 social interactions), who reported on motivational states, partner perceptions, and interaction preferences. The combined model integrating traits, states, and perceptions best predicted interaction preferences. Higher approach-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted increased interaction preference, whereas avoidance-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted lower interaction preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that maladaptive interpersonal functioning amplified the negative effects of avoidance trait and state motives on social evaluations. Integrating trait and state perspectives offers valuable insights for understanding social functioning, particularly in individuals at risk for interpersonal difficulties.",

          "abstract": "Lucid dreaming (LD) – in which dreamers become aware that they are currently dreaming – has gained increasing attention in consciousness studies, yet its fine-grained experiential dynamics remain undercharacterized. We conducted in-depth micro-phenomenological interviews on 22 signal-verified lucid dreams experienced in a controlled sleep-laboratory setting, mapping within-episode dynamics from the first recalled moments, through the emergence of lucid insight, and into post-onset periods of sustained or lost lucidity.\nAcross episodes, temporal dynamics were highly variable, and we observed diverse phenomenological clusters at every stage. Lucidity sometimes appeared as an abrupt shift from non-lucidity, but most often built up gradually via extended pre-lucid engagement, ranging from curiosity-driven exploration to distress-driven affective escalation. Lucidity was often precipitated by specific triggers, including reality testing behaviors, identification of mismatches, and recognition of incorporated external sensory cues, administered by researchers with the aim of inducing lucidity. The emergence of lucidity itself could be experienced as a sudden or gradual process, and could be accompanied by diverse affective states. Post-onset periods ranged from stable lucid states of active exploration or receptive observation to more fragile states culminating in the collapse of the dream world. Eye signals were variably embedded in these dynamics and often shaped dream experience, for example by contributing to the emergence and maintenance of lucidity or destabilizing the dream.\nMethodologically, our findings demonstrate that micro-phenomenological interviews – originally developed for the study of waking experience – can be effectively adapted for LD research. Conceptually, they highlight diverse forms of meta-awareness, pre-lucidity, metacognitive processing, and agency in LD, and show that variability and complexity are intrinsic features of dream lucidity rather than noise. Practically, moving beyond binary classifications and attending to the fine-grained temporal and structural dynamics of LD can allow future research to harness LD as a dynamic window into the emergence of insight, metacognition, and agency during sleep.",

Although researchers have emphasized its importance across multiple sectors, its existing measures have methodological limitations and are often overly content-specific (e.g., trusting a supervisor). Building on prior work that identified and content-validated a preliminary item pool, the present research developed and validated a new, rigorously tested trustfulness scale. Across multiple studies (total N = 3,048), we prioritized modern psychometric practices by first evaluating items directly before conducting structural analyses. Using multi-occasion and multi-rater data, we reduced the scale’s content redundancy, maximized its content breadth and reliability, and assessed its consensual validity. We then evaluated the scale’s structure through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and compared its psychometric properties to existing trustfulness measures and to similar but distinct constructs, allowing for tests of convergent and discriminant validity. We present the final product which we call the Trustfulness Redundant-free Short Test (TRST); a 6-item scale consisting of two factors (i.e., Trust Beliefs and Suspicion of Others) that evaluates trustfulness in an efficient and psychometrically sound way.",

          "abstract": "Current theories and models of bipolar disorder mostly attempt at explaining one spatial or temporal scale of abnormalities. There is a lack of testable, multi-scale (both temporally and spatially) integrated models ranging from cellular levels to behavior and explaining pathological phenomena in bipolar disorder occurring from milliseconds to months. \nWe here introduce the Homeostatic Dysregulation model of Bipolar Disorder(HDBD). The HDBD primary assumption is that BD results from an alteration in homeostatic processes in the brain across scales, leading to a heightened sensitivity to external perturbations and an impairment to get back to normal levels, ultimately leading to major mood episodes and switches. This lack of homeostatic regulation would encompass neuronal excitability, neural networks, circadian rhythms, emotion processing and mood itself. The HDBD model thus reconciles observations performed at various spatial and temporal scales. To be tested and challenged, the HD-BD model requires “long-phenotyping” data of patients with bipolar disorder. This model also yields new validators of animal models along with therapeutic predictions. This first integrated, multi-scale model, may represent a step towards redefinition of bipolar disorder as a central nervous system homeostasis disorder.",

          "abstract": "Questions about whether humans possess a dedicated “number sense” have shaped theories of numerical cognition for decades. The classic perspective proposes that numerosity is extracted directly from the environment and encoded independently of other magnitudes such as area, density, or duration. In this chapter, we review accumulating evidence that challenges this independence—and, thus, the supposed abstract nature of numerosity representations. We introduce a Perceptual Interdependence account, in which numerical and non-numerical magnitudes are jointly encoded within perception, with interactions emerging early in processing. We draw on developmental, comparative, and computational research showing that number primacy (i.e., its privileged status over non-numerical magnitudes) is neither the developmental nor evolutionary default.  Instead, the relative weighting of number versus other magnitudes varies with experience, context, and attentional demands. We argue that attention plays a key role in selectively tuning integrated magnitude representations for decision-making, offering a bridge between perceptual representations of numerosity and later-emerging symbolic number concepts. This perspective reframes non-symbolic number as a perceptual construct—one that emerges from integrated magnitude processing rather than a standalone core system.",

I begin by reviewing core fMRI fundamentals, including the biophysics of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, key limitations, and trade-offs relative to other neuroimaging modalities. I then outline three broad classes of fMRI designs commonly used in affective science: task-based paradigms that model specific affective processes through experimental manipulations; resting-state paradigms that characterize intrinsic functional architecture; and naturalistic paradigms that leverage complex, dynamic stimuli such as films or narratives to better approximate real-world affective experience. Finally, I survey a set of analytic approaches that can be paired with these designs, including mass-univariate contrast testing, decoding, voxel-wise encoding models, connectome-based predictive modeling, graph theoretic methods, regional homogeneity, and intersubject correlation analysis. For each, I describe how the method works, practical implementation considerations, and the kinds of inferences it affords about affective phenomena. Collectively, these tools illustrate the expanding methodological repertoire available for mapping emotion onto brain function.",

It is unclear whether these strategies are also beneficial for the binding of object features in visual memory and how their benefits may vary with age. In these experiments, participants learned object images through either drawing a copy of the image, writing a description of the image, tracing the image, or simply studying the image. Subsequently, participants had an old/new recognition test and a test of object feature binding (indicating where the object was located and what color the object was). This experiment was conducted with younger adults and older adults. For the younger adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for both object recognition and object feature binding. For the older adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for object recognition, while studying and describing were the best strategies for object feature binding. For both groups, tracing was not beneficial for feature binding. Overall, these results show that the optimal learning strategy depends on the way the information will be tested and the learner population.",

The strongest and most consistent predictor of high-quality mentoring is perceived psychological similarity (e.g., shared attitudes) between mentees and their mentors, yet little is known about how these perceptions develop over time. Using longitudinal data and latent state-trait modeling, we examined how undergraduate mentees' perceived psychological similarity and the mentoring support they received from their faculty mentors influence one another. Most of the variance in psychological similarity reflected stable, trait-like tendencies, whereas a smaller portion of the variation was due to occasion-specific fluctuations. By contrast, most of the variance in mentoring support was state-like, due to occasion-specific fluctuations. Cross-lagged panel analyses revealed that early increases in psychological similarity predicted later perceptions of mentor support within the same academic year, whereas earlier mentor support consistently predicted future psychological similarity, both within and across academic years. These results suggest bidirectional, though asymmetric, temporal associations between psychological similarity and mentoring support. Undergraduates’ momentary beliefs that their mentor was a role model were associated with greater mentorship support, independent of their feelings of psychological similarity. These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal methods for capturing the dynamic, time-sensitive nature of mentoring relationships.",

The first section of the paper discusses how group labels conceal the educational and health disparities faced by Asian Americans and Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Americans. The diverse Asian ethnic groups face different disparities, such as uneven rates of college graduation and cancer prognosis, that are hidden by the overly broad Asian American label and the associated model minority stereotype.

          "abstract": "Background: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of learning difficulties, which may reflect shared risk factors, ADHD symptoms hindering learning, or learning difficulties increasing ADHD symptoms. We aimed to map rates of co-occurrence among ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and reading comprehension difficulties and to investigate directional influences between ADHD symptoms and reading fluency, arithmetic, and reading comprehension.\nMethods: Reading fluency, arithmetic, and reading comprehension were assessed longitudinally in approximately 2,000 Finnish children across Grades 1 to 9 (ages 7–16). Attention/hyperactivity symptoms were measured with teacher ratings (Grades 1–4) and self-reports (Grades 6–9). ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and reading comprehension difficulties were based on a 10th percentile cut-off. Directionality between ADHD symptoms and academic skills was examined using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to separate stable traits from time-specific states.\nResults: Children with ADHD were 1.14 to 1.75 times more likely to have a learning difficulty, whereas those with one learning difficulty were 4.32 to 4.62 times more likely to have another. The RI-CLPMs showed consistent autoregressive effects across all domains, indicating stable within-person variation over time. At the between-person level (i.e., trait), academic skills were negatively related to ADHD symptoms, especially those reported by teachers. At the within-person level (i.e., state), ADHD symptoms were unrelated to reading fluency and arithmetic. However, at multiple time points, cross-lagged effects emerged from ADHD symptoms to subsequent reading comprehension, indicating that elevated ADHD symptoms predicted subsequent declines in reading comprehension.   \nConclusions: Learning difficulties co-occurred more frequently with each other (homotypic) than with ADHD (heterotypic co-occurrence). Both ADHD symptoms and learning difficulties showed trait-like stability. After accounting for these, ADHD symptoms were no longer linked to reading fluency or arithmetic. However, more ADHD symptoms predicted later declines in reading comprehension, likely because comprehension requires sustained attention—often impaired in children with hyperactivity and inattention.",

          "abstract": "Existing theories of human performance struggle to adequately explain the emergence of extreme positive and negative outcomes and the heavy-tailed distributions they consistently produce. Static, trait-based models and linear frameworks are often insufficient to capture the dynamic, self-reinforcing processes that drive individuals toward exceptional achievement or severe counter-productivity. This paper introduces a recursive theory of human performance grounded in the concept of “strange loops,” self-referential feedback cycles where identity and performance co-evolve. We argue that performance is generated through a recursive process of action, symbolic feedback interpretation, and adaptive identity construction. The “symbolic” nature of this feedback refers to its capacity to convey meaning about one's identity, status, and narrative role, beyond its objective or task-specific content. Positive feedback loops create upward spirals of achievement, while negative loops create downward spirals of counter-productive behavior, both driven by the same underlying amplification mechanism. This symmetrical process explains the full spectrum of performance and possible heavy-tailed distributions including why performance distributions can be heavy-tailed. We integrate this recursive model with the established CORE framework of performance and outline its fundamental propositions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive roadmap for the theory's empirical validation, detailing specific study designs, methodological considerations, and falsifiability criteria, offering a new agenda for performance theory and performance model research.",

          "authors": "Gabriele Torino; Raffaella Calati; Paolo Brambilla; Giuseppe Delvecchio",
          "abstract": "The new generation of suicide models diverges from previous theories by embracing the ideation-to-action framework. Among these, the Integrated Motivational-Volitional (IMV) model and the Three Step Theory (3ST) elucidate the circumstances under which suicidal ideation arises and the subsequent transition from thoughts to behaviour. This systematic review aimed to compare the two models and assess the validity of each of their phases. Four electronic databases were searched for studies published after 2011 for the IMV model and after 2015 for the 3ST, yielding a total of 65 eligible articles. Among these, 51 focused on the IMV model, 12 on the 3ST, and two examined both models. Overall, while the IMV model was significantly more extensively studied than the 3ST, both models received partial support, which varied according to their respective phases or steps. The formation of suicidal ideation was robustly supported; however, the transition to action yielded conflicting findings, primarily due to operational and ethical challenges inherent in suicidology. Regarding the IMV model, our review underscores the necessity for further research that tests all three phases of the IMV together and addresses understudied variables, particularly the threat-to-self, motivational, and volitional moderators. The main limitations identified within the 3ST literature were largely related to the inconsistent operationalization of key variables and the use of inappropriate measurement instruments, which impeded a comprehensive assessment of the implicated factors, especially concerning pain and connectedness facets.",

While there are no commonly agreed criteria for classifying individuals with DP, most researchers utilize self-report measures as an essential part. Here, we report the outcome from two teams who independently examined and tried to improve the most widely used tool in the field: the 20-item Prosopagnosia Index (PI20). The two teams arrived at a 13-item solution (PI13) and a 5-item solution (PI5), respectively. Joining forces, we tested both abbreviated versions and the original PI20 in a prospective investigation, with the aim of validating and comparing the tools. We found that PI5 and PI13 provide valid and reliable assessment of face recognition problems, and we recommend PI5 as a screening tool for face recognition problems with potential for use in clinical settings, while PI13 may be better suited for research on individual differences in face recognition.",

Results indicated that AI is not perceived homogeneously; rather, distinct clusters emerged in each framework. Perceptions of different AIs seem to be primarily organised along two dimensions: competence (people’s perception of an AI’s capacity to perform intended functions) and subjectivity (people’s perception of an AI’s ability to simulate having subjective experiences).

          "abstract": "Young men tend to be more conservative than young women. It is often suggested that this ‘youth gender gap’ is a generational phenomenon that can be attributed to recent developments such as the rise of the online manosphere and the far right. This study, however, proposes an alternative interpretation drawing from the developmental psychological ‘gender intensification theory,’ which holds that gender roles temporarily intensify during adolescence as biological, social, and cognitive changes heighten pressure from socialization agents to fit gender-role stereotypes. Supporting this explanation, 22 years of ESS data demonstrate that the interaction between gender and age peaks in middle adolescence, narrows during late adolescence, and mostly disappears in early adulthood. Moreover, this youth gender gap has not widened over time since 2002. These findings challenge claims of a generational rise of conservative men. Instead, the youth gender gap appears to be rooted in the typical psychosocial development of adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Why do uninvolved bystanders punish norm violations less harshly than victims? This longstanding puzzle lies at the heart of theories of fairness and cooperation. Prior accounts suggest that bystanders are less sensitive to unfairness than victims when reacting to fairness norm violations. Across three experiments, we tested this assumption by directly comparing third-party punishment (TPP) and second-party punishment (SPP). In Experiment 1 (N = 234), both fairness-related factors (harm, intention) and interest-related factors (cost) shaped punishment, yet bystanders consistently punished less than victims. Experiment 2 (N = 105) showed that bystanders and victims perceived unfairness similarly, but third parties punished less, decided faster, and displayed reduced decision conflict. Through computational modeling, Experiment 3 (N = 139) revealed that interest-driven motives—self-interest consideration and cost-ratio-based inequality disregarding—accounted for the punishment gap, whereas fairness-driven motives played a secondary role. Moreover, interest-driven motives shaped the initial bias against intervention, prompting bystanders to reach rejection decisions faster. Together, these findings challenge fairness-centered explanations and demonstrate that third parties intervene less, not because they fail to recognize unfairness, but because they are more sensitive to the personal costs of sanctioning. This conclusion refines motivational theories of norm enforcement and highlights how institutional mechanisms that lower the costs of intervention may promote stronger collective action to uphold social norms.",

This allows a general way to model and correct for these types of errors. Any situation where multiple true scores get collapsed can be understood with this model. We discuss how existing approaches fit into this general framework (e.g., scoring binary responses using Item Response Theory), and sketch the broader range of situations where the model can be applied. Discretization errors have the capacity of organizing, guide modelling, and furthering our understanding about an extensive class of errors beyond classical ones, that psychological researchers frequently encounter.",

Two studies examined these processes across different time frames. In a ten-day ecological momentary assessment with 133 individuals with probable SAD, daily stressors and all comparison components (frequency, discrepancy, impact) were positively linked to social anxiety, both between and within individuals. Additionally, comparison affective and behavioral impact were significant within-person mediators.

To address this question, we tested whether curiosity is associated with three dimensions of well-being: happiness, meaning in life, and psychological richness (a dimension of well-being characterized by diverse, perspective-changing experiences). Across six studies, psychological richness was consistently associated with curiosity, whereas happiness and meaning in life were not. Individuals leading psychologically richer lives self-reported greater curious tendencies (Studies 1–3; N = 5,363 across 13 countries) and exhibited greater behavioral indicators of curiosity, including more frequent exploratory behaviors in a two-week daily diary (Study 4; N = 203) and greater willingness to learn information in a laboratory setting (Study 5; N = 272). Finally, Study 6 (N = 451) demonstrated that individuals induced to value psychological richness showed greater willingness to learn compared to those in the control condition. Together, these findings suggest that curiosity is closely linked to well-being—particularly through its association with psychological richness.",

          "authors": "Jianghao Liu",
          "abstract": "Mental imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. In this theory paper, I propose an attention-based model of conscious imagery (“the attention model”), in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds visual features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access. This hierarchical processing of conscious imagery appears to be supported by a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down modulation, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal attention networks and the fusiform gyrus. Overall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of sensory representation. It offers a testable neuromechanistic account bridging research on imagery and consciousness, motivating future research on unconscious and conscious processing of internal representations.",

The successor representation, a predictive map that encodes expected future state occupancy, has been proposed as one way such maps might be computed in the brain, but its policy dependence severely limits flexible planning. We introduce a new model, the successor representation with importance sampling (SR-IS), which combines temporal-difference learning with importance sampling to construct policy-independent predictive maps. SR-IS learns the structure of the environment without being constrained by the agent’s current decision policy. These representations can be efficiently updated when the environment changes, enabling rapid behavioral adaptation. We show that SR-IS outperforms existing models in planning tasks and provides a better account of the graded biases in human replanning that previous models could not explain. This work bridges theories of predictive maps with observed planning behavior and offers new insights into flexible decision-making in the brain.",

The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Although perceptual similarity is highly contextual, visual similarity of characters (letters) is typically investigated using stimuli that do not control for contextual effects, e.g., comparison of pairs, identification of single characters. Moreover, most character similarity studies focus on a single typeface (font) or study under conditions that are detrimental to the quality of the designs (e.g., low resolution or low contrast), which makes it challenging to generalize their findings. To obtain data that permit a more detailed and realistic enquiry of character similarity relationships, the study reported in this paper used a contextual similarity task. Participants were presented with character triplets and asked to pick the odd one out, thus judging the remaining characters as more similar. To demonstrate the method’s robustness and transferability across scripts, this cognitively simple yet challenging task was used with a diverse selection of typefaces, world scripts, and participants (n = 1721). The results showed that the contextual similarity task is sensitive to the effects of typeface design and elicits similarity judgements that are hard to predict using pairwise data. Comparisons across groups of participants showed effects of design expertise, nativity, and fluency in relevant scripts.",

          "abstract": "The lexicality effect, better memory for words than for non-words, is a hallmark of verbal short-term memory and a clear demonstration that prior linguistic experience supports immediate recall. However, how this effect depends on participants’ proficiency with the language itself remains poorly understood. Across two experiments, we examined how language proficiency shapes immediate memory for French high- and low-frequency materials in three groups: Bilingual French L1 speakers, Bilingual English L1 speakers, and English monolinguals. In Experiment 1 (serial recall), the lexicality advantage was largest for Bilingual French L1 participants, reduced or reversed for Bilingual English L1 participants, and inverted for English monolinguals. In Experiment 2 (order reconstruction), which substantially minimizes item-based retrieval demands, a similar albeit muted pattern emerged, indicating that linguistic experience influences memory even when redintegration demands are low. To explain these findings, we extended the Embedded Computational Framework of Memory (eCFM) by varying the representational richness of participants’ lexical spaces. The model reproduced all key empirical patterns, showing that differences in the availability of semantic and orthographic dimensions are sufficient to generate the observed gradient across proficiency groups. These results provide a mechanistic account of how language experience and bilingualism shape the structure of the lexicality effect, linking long-term representational richness to performance in short-term memory tasks.",

Drawing from Beck’s original work on “core beliefs” and integrating previously disparate literatures including appraisals, mindsets, and primals, we present an integrated, technical definition of CORE beliefs as beliefs about the Characteristics of Relative Essence of a topic in which the modifier ascribed to that topic is adjectival, simple, and evaluative (e.g., the world is dangerous; I am incompetent; stress is enhancing; my body is capable). By focusing on modifiers rather than topic, our theory aids field organization, hypothesis generation, accelerated cumulative science, and increased precision in belief intervention. In the future, we hope that all psychological researchers, no matter one’s subdiscipline or outcome of interest, can contribute to a single, cumulative science of beliefs. The notion—that beliefs are not merely reactions to our experience but a cause of it—deserves a matured science equal to the task.",

          "abstract": "Background: Neuroscientific and survey studies have pointed to the existence of ´pain-intrusions´ in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), i.e., medically unexplained re-experiencing of peritraumatic pain in the same body regions as during the traumatic event, possibly explaining the high comorbidity between PTSD and chronic pain. Previous survey studies in trauma-survivors have assessed pain-intrusions by directly asking about pain as a re-experience of the traumatic event—an approach susceptible to expectancy effects. \nObjective: Here, we systematically assessed chronic and peritraumatic pain to investigate to what degree chronic pain occurs in the same body regions as during the traumatic event. To shed further light on chronic pain as a re-experiencing symptom, we analyzed the role of PTSD symptoms and established predictors of intrusive re-experiencing (e.g., cumulative traumatic experiences, younger age at the earliest traumatic event, peritraumatic distress and dissociation, and trait rumination and anxiety sensitivity). \nMethod: In a pre-registered online study, survivors of psychologically traumatizing events (N=330) reported chronic and peritraumatic pain in 108 predefined body regions, PTSD symptoms, and re-experiencing predictors. \nResults: Eleven percent of participants experienced pain-intrusions (i.e., chronic pain in the same body region as during the traumatic event). Experienced (vs. non-experienced) peritraumatic pain increased the likelihood of chronic pain in the same (odds-ratio=2.94), but not across all (odds-ratio=1.36) body regions. PTSD symptom severity and all assessed re-experiencing risk factors predicted pain-intrusion occurrence. Most participants with pain-intrusions were convinced of a trauma-related origin. \nConclusion: Results support the notion that posttraumatic chronic pain may in part constitute pain re-experiencing associated with PTSD symptomatology, and that these pain-intrusions share risk factors with other re-experiencing symptoms.",

          "authors": "Niels Vanhasbroeck; Kenny Yu; Sigert Ariens",
          "abstract": "In recent years, the case has been made to move from narrative accounts of psychological theories to rigorous mathematical descriptions thereof. Yet, a persistent tension remains in how the models that result from the formalization of psychological theories are to be evaluated -- whether by their theoretical elegance, their ability to reproduce established phenomena, or their quantitative fit to empirical data. This paper challenges an exclusive use of validation paradigms that are based on phenomena or data alone as evaluative unit by reexamining the relationships between theory, phenomena, and data. We argue that testing the tenability of a theory or model while placing too much emphasis on only phenomena or data is inherently fallible. Instead, we argue that both phenomena and data should occupy a central role in theory testing. This perspective demands that models make substantive and explanatory claims while engaging with the full structure of empirical observations. This perspective not only clarifies the dynamic interdependence among theory, phenomena, and data, but also establishes a principled basis for cumulative, iterative scientific progress in psychological science.",

          "abstract": "Introduction Predictive processing (PP) accounts conceptualize perception as an interaction \nbetween top-down predictions and bottom-up sensory inputs. In the visual domain, low spatial \nfrequencies (LSF) convey coarse information, supporting early predictions, refined by high \nspatial frequencies (HSF). Emotional expressions may thus be processed coarse-to-fine (CtF), \nalthough evidence remains inconsistent. \nMethods Across two online experiments (N=56), participants judged the valence (positive/ \nnegative) of unambiguous (happy, sad) and ambiguous (morphed) faces filtered in LSF or HSF, \nand presented in CtF or fine-to-coarse (FtC) sequences. As sad faces were poorly recognized in \nExp. 1 (LSF cutoff = 4.6 cpi), Exp. 2 used a higher cutoff (9.2 cpi). \nResults Contrary to our CtF hypothesis, HSF and FtC sequences led to more accurate and faster \nresponses to happy and sad faces (Exp 1.) than LSF and CtF sequences, but only for happy faces \nin Exp. 2. In Exp. 1, positive mood facilitated positive morph interpretations, while in Exp. 2, \nLSF morphs showed faster and more frequent negative categorizations. \nConclusion Findings varied with small methodological changes, highlighting that emotional \nface perception is highly complex. Unlike the robust CtF pattern in scene perception, our results \nchallenge a CtF account for facial expressions and suggest that SF manipulations alone may not \nprobe predictive mechanisms in emotional perception.",

Understanding their development is crucial to tracing the emergence of meaning in communication and language. Existing research has focused on deictic gestures and their predictive role in language acquisition, yet the development of iconic, conventional, and non-referential gestures remains understudied. We longitudinally examined gesture repertoire and use in six infants aged 12 to 36 months) using an ethological framework adapted from nonhuman primate research. Across 3,627 gesture tokens, deictic gestures dominated both repertoire and usage frequency, while non-referential gestures declined with age. Deictic and non-referential repertoires were comparatively larger, but iconic gestures increased developmentally. From 18-months, novel semantic (descriptions of object attributes, abstract concepts, and shared information) and pragmatic (asking questions) functions emerged through diverse gesture forms; iconic gestures significantly drive meaning expansion. These results document the gradual emergence of gesture functions and meanings in early communication.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral accounts of altruism have focused on costly reward and costly punishment. A third facet is expressed here as costly countercontrol, defined as persistent counteraction of dominant reinforcement schemes for the benefit of others. While this form of behavior is inherently risky, it involves behavioral reversal, and if it spreads, it can trigger long-term collective benefits through sociocultural transformation. In a game scenario, it could be operationalized as establishment of other-benefiting behavioral rules despite socially enforced contingencies to the opposite. Different from moral and civil courage, it is conceptualized here from a behaviorist standpoint. Examples from real life include whistleblowing and principled dissent in support of a moral cause. The article explores the challenges of assessing such behavior and reviews selected paradigms that contain its main components. Lastly, the limitations of current artificial intelligence systems in generating countercontrol are discussed, thereby highlighting the uniquely human capacity for this antagonistic form of altruism.",

          "authors": "Pritpal Kaur",
          "abstract": "This study explores the psychological impact of chronic illness in rural and low-resource communities. It focuses on the mind-body connection. The phenomenological approach has been used, and eight rural women with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma, and thyroid disorder were interviewed to understand their lived experiences. The thematic analysis revealed five main themes: daily challenges and emotional burden; coping and adaptation strategies; family and community support; mind-body connection; and the need for better support systems. The findings indicate that chronic illness deeply affects the emotional, physical and social well-being of the person. The participants demonstrated resilience through faith, family support, and acceptance. However, they also faced stigma, fear, and limited access to healthcare. The study highlights the need for culturally sensitive, community-based, and holistic interventions that integrate psychological care into rural health services. There is also a need to incorporate emotional and spiritual dimensions into healthcare to improve quality of life and promote overall well-being in rural and low-resource settings.",

          "authors": "Yongzhong Wu; jinhua tang",
          "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between adolescent academic burden and depression in adulthood in China, where academic pressure is a growing concern. It overcomes the limitations of prior research that mainly relied on subjective assessments of academic burden by introducing objective measures such as test frequency, daily study hours, off-school tutoring hours, sleep, and exercise time. Results indicate a significant association between higher academic burden in adolescence and higher depression scores in adulthood (r = 0.112, p &lt; 0.01). Specifically, for each unit increase in academic burden, the odds of experiencing higher depression increase by 20.3% (OR = 1.203, p &lt; 0.001). It is more interesting to find that parental involvement moderated this relationship, with positive parental attitudes negatively correlated with depression (r = -0.320, p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the interaction between academic burden and positive parental involvement significantly reduced depression risk (r = -0.231, p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, sleep quality and physical activity were found to mitigate the negative psychological effects of academic stress. This study emphasizes the crucial role of positive parental involvement in mitigating the risk of depression associated with academic burden in adulthood. It suggests that fostering supportive parental engagement is essential, while schools and governments should also focus on reducing academic pressure to protect mental health.",

          "authors": "Rachael Miller; Megan Lambert; Drew Altschul; Vedrana Šlipogor; Julia Espinosa",
          "abstract": "Big team science networks are large-scale, collaborative and global initiatives that pool intellectual and material resources to answer a common scientific question, while increasing transparency, inclusivity and replicability in research. In animal cognition and behaviour, these networks emerged in response to the replicability crisis, addressing limitations such as small sample sizes, taxonomic biases and restricted species and researcher representation. Examples of established animal-focussed networks include ManyPrimates, ManyBirds and ManyDogs, which collectively engage hundreds of collaborators across continents, countries, species and research sites. These initiatives have already produced empirical work, commentaries and reviews, demonstrating proof-of-concept and offering a model for comparative, cross-species science. While big team science offers opportunities for advancing scientific knowledge and promoting inclusive culture, leading such networks, particularly as early-career researchers, comes with challenges. We identify three key challenges shaping early-career researchers' leadership in big team science: 1. Power dynamics, “Reviewer 2” and challenging behaviour, 2. Communication, relationship-building and community trust in globally distributed teams, 3. Confidence, motivation and experience required to manage simultaneous roles as scientists, leaders and administrators. These issues can delay research progress, risk reputational harm and contribute to stress or burnout, particularly for early-career researchers navigating job precarity and career progression. We outline practical solutions, including transparent governance, clear authorship criteria, inclusive communication strategies, and the need for mentorship and early leadership training. We highlight the importance of securing funding to sustain long-term governance of big team science projects, and the vital role that senior researchers have in supporting, rather than overshadowing, early-career leaders. Ultimately, big team science complements traditional single-lab, PI-driven approaches, promoting inclusivity, diversity and collaboration over competition. Our collective experience suggests that big team science leadership, though it can be high-risk, is also among the most rewarding and transformative experiences of an academic career.",

          "abstract": "The first year for international students is often stressful as they adjust to a new cultural and educational environment. To better understand and address these challenges, this two-wave longitudinal study investigated how cultural distance, stress during cultural adaptation (i.e., acculturative stress), and academic social support may be related to academic stress among students in the Netherlands. The initial assessment (NT1 = 195) revealed that students perceiving greater cultural disparities between their home and the host culture experienced heightened acculturative stress, leading to increased academic stress. In the subsequent assessment (NT2 = 99), we examined changes in acculturative stress over three months and its correlation with changes in academic stress. Our results revealed that a reduction in acculturative stress from T1 to T2 corresponded with a decrease in academic stress only among individuals with strong academic social support. This suggests the importance of employing domain-specific coping mechanisms for managing stress and emphasizes the need for establishing social support systems within academic institutions. These systems can aid students in navigating academic challenges and fostering connections within educational environments.",

          "abstract": "Forgetting is a fundamental feature of human memory, yet important questions remain about how long-term memories become vulnerable to interference. While previous research has focused on interference between intentionally learned long-term memory traces, it is less known whether such interference can be induced via working memory. The present study addressed this question across two experiments using a novel paradigm combining a long-term and a working memory task. Participants first encoded object–location associations into long-term memory, then completed a working memory task in which the same objects reappeared in the same or shifted locations (60° or 120°), or were absent, before performing a final long-term memory test. Interference induced through the working memory task impaired long-term memory retrieval. This effect was driven by swap errors: participants occasionally reported the task-irrelevant working memory location instead of the long-term memory one. Experiment 2 further showed that both maintenance and test of interfering information in working memory disrupted long-term memory, with testing producing the strongest effects. These findings demonstrate that long-term memories can be disrupted via working memory, suggesting that intentional encoding into long-term memory is not required for interference to occur. We discuss these findings in light of an asymmetric gate between working and long-term memory.",

          "abstract": "Four studies evaluated probed mind-blanking reports, an off-task conscious state ostensibly experienced as an absence of thought and subjective experience. We examined whether people make mind-blanking reports to indicate uncertainty about their preceding thoughts, rather than to communicate an experienced “blank;” we also assessed whether subjects used “blank” to refer to the absence of experience, or rather an unclear, diffuse form of experience. U.S.-based Prolific participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions that differed in thought-probe response options, which included or did not include “I-don’t-know” and “mind-blanking” options in Study 1a, 1b, and 2 (Ns = 463–790). Within an online go/no-go task, we tested whether different response options yielded different rates of mind-blanking and I-don’t-know reports. That is, would mind-blanking rates be higher when an “I don’t know” response option was not available, suggesting that mind-blanking reports indicate uncertainty? Would rates of I-don’t-know reports be lower when the “mind-blanking” option was unavailable? Neither mind-blanking nor I-don’t-know report rates differed significantly between probe-type conditions. Subjects were also confident and quick in their mind-blanking reports, with confidence ratings and report latencies matching other off-task thought categories. Subjects don’t use mind-blanking reports to reflect uncertainty. Study 3 (N = 415) extended our construct-validity investigation to the phenomenology of mind-blanking by separating “mind-blanking” response options into “unclear or foggy thoughts” versus “complete absence of experience.” Unclear thoughts accounted for 3% of thought reports, versus 1% reflecting no experience, suggesting that “blanking” more often reflects diffuse than absent subjective states.",

          "abstract": "Pronouns that precede their antecedents are called cataphors. Upon encountering a cataphor, comprehenders engage in an active, eager search for its antecedent later in the sentence. The processing of cataphoric dependencies has been used to probe comprehenders’ incremental expectations and how grammatical knowledge guides those expectations. Past experiments have investigated whether knowledge of Binding Principles B and C constrain comprehenders’ initial expectations for coreference or whether grammatical knowledge applies at a delay. Although studies suggest that the Binding Principles B and C influence the earliest stages of cataphor resolution, recent findings have called into question whether the main experimental paradigm used to test the time-course of constraint-sensitivity – self-paced reading – has the necessary temporal precision to adjudicate between competing accounts. In this paper we investigate the application of Principle B during cataphor processing using eye-tracking-while-reading, an experimental paradigm with more fine-grained temporal sensitivity. Our results converge with prior findings that Principle B strongly constrains active cataphor resolution. We end by discussing how to model Principle B sensitivity via predictions made at the level of the discourse representation.",

          "authors": "Nicola Cogan",
          "abstract": "Background: Frontline workers across health, emergency, and social care sectors are repeatedly exposed to distressing events and chronic stressors as part of their occupational roles. Unlike single-event trauma, these cumulative exposures can lead to enduring psychological and physiological strain. Traditional diagnostic frameworks, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were never designed to capture the persistent and layered nature of such occupational trauma.\nObjective: This commentary introduces the concept of Persistent Traumatic Stress Exposure (PTSE), a framework that reconceptualises trauma among frontline workers as an occupational exposure rather than an individual disorder. It aims to reorient understanding, responsibility, and intervention from a purely clinical lens toward systemic, cultural, and organisational domains.\nMethod: Drawing on contemporary evidence and theoretical models of trauma, including organisational and moral injury frameworks, PTSE is presented as an integrative paradigm. It synthesises findings from health, emergency, and social care settings to illustrate how repeated exposure, moral dissonance, and institutional pressures contribute to cumulative psychological harm.\nResults: The PTSE framework highlights that psychological injury may accrue across shifts, careers, and lifetimes, calling for embedded, preventive, and real-time supports that protect mental health as proactively as physical safety. It shifts the focus from vulnerability to exposure, emphasising that trauma prevention and recovery require organisational accountability and trauma-informed systems.\nConclusions: PTSE challenges prevailing stigma by framing trauma as a predictable occupational hazard rather than a personal weakness. It offers a more humane and contextually accurate paradigm that aligns with modern occupational health perspectives, informing practice, policy, and culture. In doing so, it honours the lived realities of those who serve on the frontline and advocates for sustained, systemic investment in psychological safety and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Arbitrary social hierarchies permeate our working lives in ways not always visible, introducing anti-egalitarian norms which stymie productivity. Reviewing bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We contend that the literatures converge on a single, sobering logic: because organizations are embedded in—and seek legitimacy from—broader socio-historical contexts, the same arbitrary hierarchies that stratify societies are naturally imported into organizational life. At the same time, individuals are motivated to obscure the influence of these hierarchies to reduce psychological distress. We leverage institutional theory and systems psychodynamics to map how organizations are at the crux of external pressures (from society) and upward pressure (from employees) which both perpetuate and obfuscate the replication of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in organizations. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the commonplace or subtle nature of the microaggression to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – anti-egalitarian organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in their workplace.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in cognitive science is whether cognitive control recruits domain-general or domain-specific processes. A useful paradigm to study this is the congruency sequence effect, which reflects the reduced impact of congruency after an incongruent trial. Many studies examined the congruency sequence effect across task in order to investigate domain generality. However, differences in how task dissimilarity was manipulated led to different conclusions about the nature of adaptive control. Therefore, we conducted a systematic, preregistered meta-analysis of 169 experiments (229 effect sizes). On average, the cross-task congruency sequence effect (Hedges’ gz = 0.252) decreased as task dissimilarity increased, with some factors influencing adaptive control more than others. Especially when tasks used a different response modality or conflict arose from different irrelevant stimulus dimensions, we observed a decreased cross-task congruency sequence effect, suggesting adaptive control is both action-oriented and involves distractor suppression. Notably, however, when tasks shared the same conflict type, larger congruency sequence effects were observed when stimulus and response sets were distinct rather than partially overlapping. Together, these findings refine current theories by pointing to a central role for the different motor modalities, distractor suppression, and shared versus separate task representations, moving beyond a simple domain-general versus domain-specific distinction.\n\nKeywords: meta analysis, conflict adaptation, congruency sequence effect, domain generality, cognitive control",

          "abstract": "Influential models of person perception posit that group-based information holds more influence than individuating information in impression formation. Presumably, this is due to the spontaneous and effortless activation of group versus individual-specific information. Consistent with the cognitive miser metaphor, this advantage should be exacerbated when forming more automatic evaluations about others. Challenging these assumptions, Navon and Bar-Anan (2023, JESP) reported that evaluative impressions rely more on individuating than group information when making impressions about members of newly learned social groups. Furthermore, this advantage was reported on both self-report and indirect measures tapping into more automatic evaluations. In the present research, we identify several limitations in that previous research and examine the dominance question in two experiments (Ns = 605; 657) employing a stronger design, improved structural fit between measures, and more robust analytical tests. We found a clear advantage of individuating information on both types of measures. This finding was observed despite the use of a very perceptually salient cue signaling group membership (i.e., skin tone) and impression formation instructions aimed at group rather than individuating impressions. Implications for dominant theories of person perception are discussed, as well as methodological implications for the study of more versus less automatic evaluations.",

          "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference unify perception, action, and learning within a single variational framework, yet they remain silent on why there is phenomenal experience at all. Awareness-First Theory (AFT) proposes an ontological inversion: rather than deriving consciousness from non-experiential dynamics, it takes awareness as ontologically primitive—taken as the base datum rather than something to be explained by physical states—and formalises it as a differentiable field of awareness, denoted (A, g_A). A Coherence Principle—expressed as the variational stationarity condition “delta A = 0”—governs lawful differentiations within this field and preserves the core phenomenological invariants of unity, binding, temporal continuity, and reflexive presence. The familiar variational laws then appear as embedded projections: “delta S = 0” (least action) for physics and “delta F = 0” (free-energy stationarity) for inference. Subbeings (local bounded centres of coherent differentiation), defined by Markov blankets, are local equilibria of the global coherence field; their inferential activity sustains rather than produces awareness. A Qualia Mapping Function links differentiations in awareness to measurable information-geometric structures. AFT predicts lawful dissociations between coherence (“delta A”) and inference (“delta F”) - as in dreaming, illusion, psychedelics, and meditation, where phenomenological unity persists despite inferential error. It thereby unifies phenomenology, physics, and cognition within a single variational hierarchy (delta S and delta F as subsets of delta A), dissolves the explanatory gap by grounding experience in its own coherence, and resolves the combination problem by making unity fundamental, a variational calculus of Being underlying all appearance.",

          "abstract": "Reward valuation and reward and punishment learning are key constructs relevant for understanding and intervening on mental illness. These constructs are frequently measured with behavioral tasks such as intertemporal choice tasks, measuring delay discounting, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), measuring reward and punishment learning. Delay discounting refers to how people value delayed outcomes, with steep discounting (i.e., delayed outcomes holding little value) considered a form of impulsive decision-making. Reward and punishment learning refers to how people adjust their decision behavior in response to rewards and punishments, with deficits indicating atypical reward and punishment processing related to clinical outcomes such as substance abuse. In this study, we tested the association between delay discounting and reward and punishment learning among adults (N = 299) from the United States that completed an intertemporal choice task and the play-or-pass IGT. We fit a joint model to the task data to simultaneously estimate parameters from the hyperbolic discounting model (for the intertemporal choice task) with parameters from a reinforcement learning model (for the play-or-pass IGT). The joint model also included parameters capturing cross-task associations between model parameters. Our results indicate that steep delay discounting is negatively associated with punishment learning. That is, people who do not value delayed outcomes also show less learning from punishment. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving our assessment of reward valuation and reward and punishment learning as constructs relevant to mental illness.",

          "abstract": "Background: Attitudes towards menstruation are shaped by cultural and social norms and can result in misperceptions, impacting women’s health. Yet, research on cultural differences in menstrual experiences remains limited. \nObjectives: This study aimed to examine whether South Asian and White British women living in the UK differ in menstrual experiences, with a focus on menstrual health, menstrual literacy, stigma-related factors, and ethnic microaggressions in the healthcare context. \nDesign: White British (n = 153) and South Asian (n = 153) menstruating women living in the UK participated in a preregistered cross-sectional online survey. \nMethods: Menstrual health was assessed via menstrual distress, symptom management, and hygiene behaviors. Menstrual stigma was measured through affective internalized stigma, internalized stigma of seeking help, secrecy, and avoidance behaviors. \nResults: In addition to differences in menstrual health (menstrual pain, symptom management, hygiene behaviors), South Asian women reported lower menstrual literacy than White British women. South Asians also reported greater secrecy as well as stronger avoidance behaviors related to discussing menstruation and engaging in daily activities while menstruating, but also more positive emotions towards menstruation. Additionally, they experienced more ethnic microaggressions in healthcare. Secrecy and microaggressions mediated the effect of ethnic group on self-stigma of seeking help. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest cultural differences in menstrual health, literacy and stigma, emphasizing the need for inclusive health education and stigma-reduction interventions. Addressing menstrual literacy gaps and tackling stigma in family and healthcare settings may improve support for South Asian women in the UK.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between acute physical exercise and decision-making remains debated, with evidence leaning towards an inverted U-shaped curve during increasing acute physical exertion. This study examined behavioural and computational markers of decision-making across three increasing cycling intensities during a conflict task. Thirty-one participants completed the Eriksen Flanker task at light, moderate, and heavy exercise intensities. Throughout the experiment, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and lactate concentrations were measured. These physiological measures linearly increased with intensities, confirming our protocol. Results indicated that reaction times decreased, while accuracy remained stable. Diffusion Model for Conflict (DMC) analyses showed that drift rate followed the hypothesised inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at moderate intensity, suggesting optimal evidence accumulation at this workload. Decision boundaries decreased linearly with intensity, indicating less cautious responding under higher exertion. This partially supports arousal-based models such as the Yerkes-Dodson law, highlighting moderate intensity as a potential “sweet spot” for decision-making. The integration of computational modelling provides novel insight into how intensity levels of acute exercise modulate cognitive processes. This has implications for sports performance, training strategies, and high-stakes professions requiring rapid decisions under physical stress.",

This qualitative study sought to address this gap by contributing to a better understanding of how the concept of well-being at work is experienced by people with disabilities in sheltered employment, drawing on the Demand-Induced Stain Compensation-Recovery model and theories of recovery at work. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 workers with intellectual disabilities and nine supervisors who support them in their daily work to capture their respective perspectives. A rigorous thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews was conducted by combining deductive and inductive approaches with a double-coding of certain interviews. The results globally highlighted the specific nature of job demands and job resources in sheltered employment settings, the presence of work recovery processes, and relevant indicators for assessing well-being at work in this population. In addition, a number of individual factors—either facilitating or limiting—were identified as influencing the workplace experience of this population. These findings, while demonstrating the relevance of the models considered, also underscore the need for future research to empirically test the theoretical relationships, using designs adapted to this population.",

          "abstract": "Unlike spatial attention, the role of rhythmic temporal attention in visual awareness remains less explored. To address this issue, we investigated how rhythmic temporal attention operates with exogenous spatial attention during detection of near-threshold Gabor patch targets. Targets appeared after a series of placeholders flickering either regularly or irregularly in the left or right visual field. Each target was equally likely to occur at the same location as the rhythmic stream (spatially attended trial) or the opposite location (unattended trial). Participants first made a detection response, followed by a localization judgment. Target visibility was calibrated to 50% in Experiment 1 and 75% in Experiment 2. At 50% visibility, spatial attention induced a more conservative response criterion for unattended compared to attended trials. Unexpectedly, irregular rhythms enhanced perceptual sensitivity relative to regular rhythms. At 75% visibility, rhythms had no effect on perceptual sensitivity, whereas spatial attention improved perceptual sensitivity, sped responses, and maintained a more conservative response pattern for unattended trials.  In follow-up experiments with fully visible (100%) targets, responses were faster after regular rhythms, but only when the localization response was removed, suggesting that rhythmic temporal sequences primarily facilitated response preparation under simplified task demands. Overall, these results call for caution in attributing a direct role of rhythmic temporal attention to visual awareness, at least under the current rhythmic sequences and in the presence of spatial uncertainty, while confirming a key role for exogenous spatial attention in enhancing conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Qualia, the subjective qualities of experience, pose a fundamental challenge to scientific explanation. A promising recent approach is to characterize qualia by their relational structures rather than their intrinsic nature. Assuming the structure of qualia is characterized by the geometry of neural representations, we posit that this geometry is fundamentally organized by symmetry. We propose that the principal bundle, induced by a symmetry group $G$ acting on a neural network's state space, is the essential mathematical object that provides a complete and rigorous characterization of this geometric structure. The core mathematical principle is that, for a $G$-equivariant network, its state space partitions into a quotient space $Q$ and orbits induced by the group $G$. This framework reveals a three-level hierarchy for characterizing qualia. First, the choice of the symmetry group $G$ itself defines the fundamental nature of the qualia modality (e.g., vision versus audition). Second, we identify a qualia signature with a point in the quotient space $Q$ (e.g., perceiving the signature ``cat''), representing the invariant identity of a percept. Third, we identify a qualia attribute with a position on a specific orbit (e.g., the cat's location), representing its continuous variations. This framework uncovers a powerful duality: the geometry of the orbits is rigid, inheriting the structure of the group $G$, which explains the stable relational structure of qualia attributes. In contrast, the geometry of the quotient space is plastic, allowing the relationships between qualia signatures to be shaped by learning. This geometric hierarchy provides a unified language for explaining the structure of perceptual experience. Furthermore, our framework generates empirical predictions and a clear research strategy for characterizing qualia, offering a path to a deeper scientific understanding of subjective experience.",

          "abstract": "Audiobooks offer an increasingly popular and accessible medium for engaging with book language. Here, we asked whether greater enjoyment of an audiobook is associated with better comprehension and motivation toward narratives, and whether aspects of the narrator’s voice can modulate the experience and outcomes of audiobook listening. In Experiment 1, participants heard audiobook excerpts produced by a highly-naturalistic synthesised voice.\nAfter each excerpt, participants rated their listening enjoyment, answered a multiple-choice content comprehension question, and finally chose whether to wait to hear more of the narrative (or skip to the next one). We found that greater enjoyment was associated with increased probability of correct comprehension and waiting. Building on previous findings for book reading, we therefore show that the enhancing effects of moment-to-moment fluctuations in book enjoyment generalise across written and spoken modalities. In Experiment 2, participants heard the same audiobook excerpts, now narrated by 2 different synthesised voices that significantly differed in perceived pleasantness. Here, we demonstrated higher ratings of enjoyment for excerpts read by the more pleasant-sounding voice. In Experiment 3, we harnessed personalised voice cloning to further show that audiobook enjoyment was greater when listening to personally-familiar narrators (self, friend), compared with unfamiliar narrators. Our findings offer new evidence for the rewarding role of voice identity perception in spoken language perception, and present interesting implications for how personalised narrators could improve engagement with spoken book language.",

Children’s sensitivity to rote behavior increased with development, with consistent competence emerging around age 7. Rote behavior was also associated with worse teaching. These results indicate when and how reasoning about automatic behavior matters to children’s perception of others, and suggest novel extensions to models of Theory of Mind.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study conducted a preliminary naturalistic effectiveness evaluation of Individualised Metacognitive Therapy (MCT+) delivered via videoconferencing for individuals with bipolar I disorder in a real-world clinical setting in Chile. It also explored how therapist characteristics—specifically mentalisation capacity—influence the therapeutic alliance in digital psychotherapy.\nMethods: A longitudinal quantitative case series design was implemented across 14 therapist–patient dyads. Patients received 12 weekly sessions of MCT+ online. Standardised measures assessed anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), metacognitive beliefs (MCQ-30), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). Therapeutic Alliance was tracked session-by-session (WAI-S). Therapist mentalisation and attachment were evaluated at baseline (MASC-SP, RFQ-8, ECR-12). Changes in outcome measures were analysed using paired t-tests, effect sizes (Cohen’s d), correlations, Reliable Change Indices (RCI), and hierarchical linear modelling. \nResults: Across the intervention, there were significant decreases in anxiety (d = 0.64) and improvements in metacognitive beliefs (d = 0.37). Depression showed a modest improvement (d = 0.34), while changes in quality of life were negligible (d = –0.21). Hierarchical modelling indicated a significant interaction between automatic and controlled mentalisation (b = –0.45, p = .008), suggesting that flexible adjustment supported therapeutic alliance development. Attachment style showed no significant associations with the alliance (largest unadjusted effect: ρ = –.54, p = .073; all adjusted ps &gt; .99).\nConclusions: Digital MCT+ showed preliminary effectiveness in reducing anxiety and maladaptive metacognitive beliefs among individuals with bipolar disorder, with more limited effects on depression and quality of life. Importantly, therapist mentalisation flexibility—the capacity to shift between automatic and controlled modes, or the mentalisation switch—emerged as a central mechanism for alliance-building and engagement in digital contexts, highlighting a key target for clinical training and future research.\nKeywords: therapeutic alliance, bipolar disorder, digital psychotherapy, MCT+, therapist mentalisation, reflective functioning, mentalisation, metacognitive therapy",

          "abstract": "Facial temperature has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Previous research indicates that nose-tip temperature increases with parasympathetic activation, whereas periorbital temperature reflects sympathetic arousal. However, facial thermal fluctuations during resting state have not yet been systematically investigated, which represents the aim of the present study. \n Here we examined the relationship between regional facial temperature - measured from nose-tip and periorbital regions using functional infrared thermal imaging - and cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed by high-frequency (HF) power and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heart rate variability (HRV). Analyses included (i) grand-average correlations to identify overarching physiological patterns, (ii) within-subject correlations to explore the strength of individual-level associations, and (iii) between-subject correlations to examine inter-individual variability of the cardiac and thermal signals. \nAcross 32 participants during a 13.5-min resting-state session, HF power showed a positive association with nose-tip and a negative association with periorbital temperature, whereas RMSSD showed weaker effects. A differential temperature index (nose-tip minus periorbital) was the most robust correlate of HF power.  These findings suggest that facial thermal dynamics mirror vagal modulation at rest and that the differential index converging the information from different facial areas may provide a sensitive, contactless indicator of autonomic activity.",

          "abstract": "Pleasure is a central element of how physical exercise is experienced, and it depends on the perceived physical demands of the activity. Recent evidence suggests that the prediction error of perceived exertion (PEexert), defined as the discrepancy between anticipated and experienced effort, shapes pleasure experienced during exercise. Understanding how both individual and contextual factors influence this process is, therefore, critical. The present study examined whether repeated exposure to the same exercise route, thereby increasing route familiarity, reduces PEexert and modulates its association with running pleasure. Forty-seven participants completed four runs at a self-selected intensity along the same forest trail. Using this within-subjects design, familiarity was operationalized as repeated runs on the identical route. At each session, participants reported their prospective and retrospective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) that created the PEexert index, confidence in prospective RPE, retrospective running pleasure, and pre- and post-run state-anxiety. Running speed and heart rate were measured. Tolerance to physical effort, physical activity level, and prior familiarity with the trail were also assessed. Linear mixed models showed that PEexert significantly decreased after the first run and stabilized in the next runs; indicating that repeated exposure to the same route reduced the discrepancy between anticipated and experienced exertion. In turn, more positive PEexert (runs feeling easier than expected) was associated with higher running pleasure and greater reductions in state-anxiety. Crucially, route familiarity reduced PEexert but did not change the strength of the PEexert-pleasure association. These findings suggest that growing familiarity with an exercise environment refines effort prediction without altering the core affective mechanism linking prediction error to the pleasure of running.",

          "abstract": "Background: Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS)—such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin—are increasingly used as sugar substitutes to enhance food palatability without additional caloric intake. While the metabolic effects of NNS are well documented, their potential cognitive and socio-emotional consequences remain unclear. \nObjective: This study investigated the associations between chronic NNS and sugar consumption, cognitive performance, and socio-emotional behaviors in healthy young adults, while controlling for sugar intake to isolate substance-specific effects.\nMethods: A total of 291 French adults aged 18-30 years completed five computerized tasks assessing decision-making and emotion regulation: the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Game of Dice Task (GDT), the binary dictator game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Daily NNS and sugar intakes were estimated using quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Logistic mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the effects of NNS and sugar intake on choice probabilities, rigidity scores, and response times.\nResults: Higher NNS intake was associated with increased selection of the riskiest options under explicit risk in the GDT (p = 0.04) but did not affect decision-making in the IGT. Conversely, higher sugar intake was positively associated with selecting the advantageous yet risky option compared to both disadvantageous (p = 0.04) and advantageous non-risky (p = 0.02) options during the early ambiguity (learning) phase of the IGT. Sugar intake also tended to increase selection of the riskiest option (versus the safest option) under explicit risk. NNS intake was further linked to shorter mean response times across IGT trials (p = 0.04) and showed a trend toward higher rigidity scores at the end of the task, whereas sugar intake predicted longer response times (p &lt; 0.01) and tended to decrease rigidity scores. Neither NNS nor sugar intake significantly influenced altruism, cooperation, or emotion regulation.\nConclusion: Chronic NNS and sugar consumption appear to differentially modulate decision-making processes under explicit and experiential risk, without significantly impacting social or emotional behaviors. These findings underscore the need for longitudinal and neuroimaging studies to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying sweetener-related behavioral modulation.",

          "abstract": "Recent theories of interoceptive inference suggest that individuals use bodily signals to guide behavior, comparing predictive models of internal states with ascending interoceptive input. Although interoceptive accuracy has been shown to influence both decision-making and physiological activation, empirical evidence on how interoceptive abilities concurrently shape behavioral and physiological responses during socio-economic games, such as the Ultimatum Game, remains limited. This study explores the impact of interoceptive accuracy on decision-making and autonomic responses during a modified Ultimatum Game. Participants received offers with varying formats to modulate attentional engagement, while heart rate responses were recorded between offer presentation and decision-making. Results confirm previous findings that unfair offers evoke a stronger cardiac orienting response, especially when the attentional engagement was low. Importantly, interoceptive accuracy was positively related with coherent behavioral and physiological patterns: individuals were more likely to reject unfair offers and showed greater heart rate deceleration in response to them. These findings suggest that individuals with higher interoceptive accuracy integrate bodily feedback more effectively, resulting in heightened sensitivity to social norm violations. These data support the hypothesis that interoceptive precision enhances coherence across behavioral and physiological domains, particularly in socially normative contexts. This coherence is likely shaped by long-term social learning, pointing to the relevance of interoception in structuring adaptive behavior over time.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents learn to navigate increasingly complex social environments, where flexible and efficient\ncognitive mechanisms are needed to behave adaptively. Prominent theories of cognitive maturation suggest\nthat adolescents’ decision-making is noisier than adults’ and that their decisions can be swayed by irrelevant\ninformation. By contrast, here, we suggest that cognitive development also allows them to increasingly use\ncombinatorial representations of social input. This manifests in emergent use of abstract social basis\nfunctions across adolescent development. Social basis functions represent combinations of individuals’\ninteractions (e.g., patterns of cooperation and competition) and allow for efficient information compression.\nIn a novel in-person group decision-making experiment with adolescents (n = 50) and young adults (n =\n50), we confirmed a counterintuitive set of predictions derived from the basis function model: Adults made\nmore accurate decisions than adolescents, but, in parallel, they increasingly made a specific type of decision\nerror more frequently than adolescents. They ‘mixed up’ relevant and irrelevant players as a function of the\ngroup structure of the task. Using multi-attribute drift diffusion modelling, we show that the observed age\ndifferences are consistent with a stronger influence of the group structure during social decision-making in\nadults. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive development during adolescence involves\nfundamental shifts in the use of abstract social representations generally and in the use of combinatorial\nsocial basis functions in particular.",

          "abstract": "Healthcare professionals tend to overprescribe antibiotics despite knowing the risks of antibiotic resistance. This tendency, amplified under diagnostic uncertainty and patient pressure, suggests that mechanisms beyond lack of risk awareness or knowledge sustain overprescription. One such mechanism may be willful ignorance—deliberately avoiding information about the consequences of one’s prescribing decisions. By allowing healthcare professionals to justify immediate antibiotic prescriptions that prioritize short-term self-interests over long-term collective benefits, willful ignorance may contribute to persistent overprescribing. Despite its practical relevance, this psychological mechanism has not yet been empirically investigated in the context of antibiotic prescribing. To test this empirically, we conducted a preregistered online experiment with healthcare professionals (N = 698) from the United States and the United Kingdom. Participants completed an adapted version of the Moral Wiggle Room Task, a behavioral decision-making paradigm designed to investigate willful ignorance. This task compares choices across a full information condition with low diagnostic uncertainty, and a hidden information condition with high diagnostic uncertainty that can be voluntarily reduced. The results support the presence of willful ignorance in antibiotic prescribing. Healthcare professionals were more likely to prescribe antibiotics immediately in the hidden vs. full information condition. Even healthcare professionals who voluntarily reduced diagnostic uncertainty prescribed more antibiotics immediately than those who received diagnostic information involuntarily. These results highlight the role of willful ignorance in antibiotic prescribing and suggest practical implications for policymaking, such as promoting transparent environments to guide appropriate antibiotic prescription choices.",

          "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 10 - 13%. It is being studied by mental health professionals, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners, and computer science communities due to its growing prevalence. However, the lack of a survey article highlighting the study approaches of these communities is still a knowledge transfer impediment between the communities. This survey article aims to bridge the gap by providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of the existing SAD research from all these communities.\n \n We have discussed the existing SAD assessment techniques and focused on leveraging digital technologies to detect SAD. Furthermore, we have grouped the existing literature based on the study approach into two groups (i.e., lab and field). For each group, we have discussed the research methodologies followed to attain respective objectives. We have emphasized on the field studies owing to the growing use of digital devices, especially smartphones, and wearables, for understanding SAD.   This template simplifies and summarizes the use of artificial intelligence to predict and detect SAD using digitally captured data. In addition to the existing digital SAD psychotherapy, we have also discussed mHealth interventions that use smartphones and wearables to manage mental disorders. Finally, we have discussed challenges and future directions with possible solutions that can be incorporated into future SAD study designs.",

We examined whether the effectiveness of an attentional focus depends on the precision of metacognitive representations of the attended movement aspect. Amateur guitarists (N = 65, 52 valid metacognitive estimates) played a melody under internal, external and no-focus instructions. We assessed pitch and rhythm accuracy, and estimated participants’ ability to monitor two movement aspects corresponding to the attentional foci: internal/visual (finger positions) and external/tonal (pitch outcomes). Against our expectations, and challenging dominant accounts, focusing externally did not improve musical performance, nor was it moderated by metacognitive ability. Exploratory analyses revealed no interaction with expertise. Interestingly, participants demonstrated greater metacognitive precision for internal/visual information than external/tonal.",

Yet, even though attention is one of the most thoroughly studied phenomena in\ncognitive psychology, and known to strongly modulate behavior, relatively little is known\nabout how attention influences the processing of sensory consequences of our own\nactions. We show that when participants’ attention was sufficiently strongly directed to a\nvisual task, many individuals (50% out of 34) failed to notice that the pitch of their own\nvoice was unexpectedly and significantly pitch shifted (75 cents; the individuals had no\ntrouble detecting the pitch shift when they knew to expect it).

In this paper, we argue that VGs can serve as a “gym” for learning and habituating ethical behaviours, by acting as cognitive prostheses and arenas for ethical experimentation. One strength of VGs highlighted is their ability to adapt to unique cognitive styles. Our approach involves categorising VGs according to the affordances they provide for ethical engagement, including value formation, identity negotiation, and ethical habituation. Against the backdrop of a chaotic and fluctuating world, VGs provide a crucible for ethical rehearsal, world-building and identity formation, lending to a conceptual understanding of VGs as technologies of the moral self.",

          "abstract": "Research into the neural mechanisms of consciousness has so far mainly progressed through human neuroscience. However, most of the available techniques for use in human subjects lack the ability to probe the underlying neuron- and circuit-level mechanisms. Animal experiments offer a promising solution to these limitations. In particular, experiments in rodents allow us to combine large-scale neuronal recordings with the causal manipulations of neuronal activity. Although non-human species cannot verbally report their subjective experiences, behavioral indicators of consciousness have proven to be reliable across species, and the range of behavioral tests available for rodents has grown substantially. This chapter reviews recent advances in using rodents for consciousness research, emphasizing how microcircuit-level studies have the potential to majorly expand theoretical frameworks. We will highlight two key aspects that make rodents particularly valuable for consciousness science: novel behavioral assays and perturbational methods such as optogenetics. Ultimately, we aim to provide evidence that experiments in rodents need to become part of the standard toolbox for consciousness science, complementing and expanding insights gained from human experiments.",

Research suggests that a significant number of CYP experiencing attendance difficulties are neurodivergent, and that these CYP experience very high levels of school distress. While there have been several qualitative studies on the experiences of CYP who struggle with attendance, there is less evidence on the lived experience of parents/carers who have children struggling to attend school. In this study, 44 parents/carers of CYP were interviewed about their experiences of having a neurodivergent child who struggled to attend school. Four themes were identified using thematic analysis: ‘Misalignment between mainstream demands and neurodivergent pupils’ needs’, ‘A fragile and dysfunctional support system’, ‘Distress takes over the lives of families’, and ‘Driving change: What do we want from our children’s education?’. These themes highlight how the misalignment between CYP’s needs and the mainstream school environment, combined with a lack of appropriate support, contributes to significant impacts on families. Parents/carers called for changes in their child’s current school provision, as well as wider changes to make the UK education system more inclusive for neurodivergent pupils. Overall, this study provides timely insights from a substantial number of parents/carers, who are important informants about neurodivergent CYP’s school distress and attendance difficulties.",

          "abstract": "The idea that racial prejudice contributes to discrimination not only deliberately but also in a more automatic fashion has been one of the most prominent topics in social psychological research in the last 30 years. Much of the evidence for theories of automatic prejudice stems from the use of indirect measures of implicit attitudes, yet meta-analyses give differing estimates regarding the predictive validity of such measures. The present adversarial collaboration provides a test of the relationships between prominent measures of implicit racial attitudes and discriminatory behavior using a set of established lab-based paradigms using a sample of White Americans (N = 2114). Using structural equation models that can account for measurement error, frequentist and Bayesian multiverse analyses confirmed that White Americans’ performance on indirect measures correlate modestly with these behavioral outcomes, and explain unique variance (~2.5%) beyond direct, self-report measures of racial attitudes. At the same time, self-report measures exhibited greater predictive and incremental validity than indirect measures (explaining ~45% of the variance) despite behavioral measures of discrimination displaying weak internal reliability. Results provided some support for greater predictive and incremental validity for indirect measures among participants scoring relatively low on measures of executive function and motivation to control prejudice. These results lend themselves to both relatively optimistic and pessimistic interpretations concerning scientific and practical significance. All collaborators agree that the best path forward is collaborative and focused on the generalizability of implicit racial attitudes to high-accountability organizational settings.",

Here, we followed upon that suggestion. In Study 1, non-experts (N = 125) predicted higher truth ratings for trivia previously paired with positive than negative pictures. Consistent with Study 1’s predictions, this “Truth Beliefs Conditioning\" effect was observed in Study 3 (N = 186), which overcame two limitations of Study 2 (N = 187), in which the effect was not significant. This supports our claim that folk mental representations about treatment effects can be usefully probed for discovering new psychological phenomena.

Appraisal of company was associated with affect however, did not moderate its relationship with screen use. The sample skewness leaned majority female, white, and not in receipt of free school meals and therefore not fully representative of the UK population, limiting the generalisability of the findings.

Since it was originally proposed as a methodological approach, no PAS labels, instructions or display are currently official. Authors tend to adapt this scale to their experimental tasks often without specifying their PAS properties or without providing adequate justification for the modifications. In this work, we tested how “choosing your own PAS” affects response-process validity both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the same  unconscious working memory (WM) task as in Franco-Martínez et al. (in press) replication. In a preregistered 2×2×2 between-subjects design (N = 176), we manipulated: PAS Version (Original vs New labels, updated based on pilot participants’ reports), Examples (With brief demonstrations of PAS = 4 and PAS = 1 trials vs Without them), and Display (Scale&amp;Text shown onscreen trial-by-trial vs ScaleOnly). In a post-experiment PAS questionnaire participants were asked to qualitatively report how they recalled and interpreted the scale. The unconscious WM effect and its reliability were robust under the Version and Examples manipulations, but presenting the New Version and/or With Examples increased the proportion of valid trials, enhancing statistical power. Although the unconscious WM effect increased in the ScaleOnly Display, the qualitative evidence suggests participants in this condition tend to forget the PAS labels and ultimately use them differently from intended. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for the use of PAS and a post-experiment PAS questionnaire to evaluate its validity.",

In this context, biodiversity conservation, when aligned with climate objectives, may receive broader public support than direct climate policies. However, the links between biodiversity values and wider cultural worldviews remain poorly understood. We investigated this relationship using a nationwide survey (N = 1,133) in Japan. Individuals with hierarchical worldviews perceived climate change risks as lower and tended to be less supportive of climate policies. The negative association between hierarchical worldviews and perceived biodiversity risks or support for biodiversity policies was weaker, and no direct association was found for biodiversity conservation measures unrelated to climate. Higher general scientific knowledge was associated with greater support for biodiversity policies linked to climate policy. Framing climate initiatives via biodiversity conservation may reduce culturally driven resistance.

Cognitive reserve (CR) may protect against trauma-related cognitive deficits, but CR's moderating role in relationships between trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and cognition is unclear. \nMethods: We examined 745 community-dwelling middle aged to older adults (50-86 years) who completed assessments of traumatic event exposure (Life Events Checklist for DSM-5), post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL-5), cognitive performance, and CR proxies (Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire and verbal intelligence). \nResults: Higher CR scores protected against cognitive performance deficits correlated with both greater exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and were associated with reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms associated with greater traumatic event exposure. Moderated mediation analysis revealed that for individuals with lower CR, the negative cognitive effects associated with traumatic events were mediated through post-traumatic stress symptoms, while this indirect effect became non-significant at higher CR levels. CR proxies showed different protective effects by trauma type, with higher CR buffering against poorer cognitive performance associated with natural/accidental traumas. \nDiscussion: These findings suggest that interventions targeting modifiable CR components may build resilience against trauma's psychological and cognitive impacts throughout the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "For over a century, researchers have documented robust individual differences in people’s ability to think creatively. Today, however, generative AI appears to democratize creativity, potentially minimizing individual differences by offering powerful tools for anyone to generate ideas, stories, and more. Do individual differences still matter for creativity when everyone has access to the same advanced technology? Across two studies (N = 442), we tested whether two individual factors—creative ability (assessed via idea generation and story-writing tasks) and general intelligence (assessed via reasoning and knowledge tests)—predict performance in creative collaboration with large language models (LLMs). We isolate for the first time a latent construct for AI-assisted creativity, unique and separable from creativity without AI. Study 1 found that baseline creative writing ability strongly predicted AI-assisted story writing with GPT- 4o (β = .42): people who wrote more original stories without AI also wrote better stories with AI. Study 2 replicated and extended this finding, showing that people who were more creative (β = .39) and intelligent (β = .35) in general performed better on entirely different creative tasks done with AI assistance. Thus, people with more creative task expertise (Study 1) and those with higher baseline cognitive abilities (Study 2) produced more original ideas, despite all participants having equal access to a powerful LLM. Our findings suggest that the successful use of generative AI may preserve individual differences in human creativity and intelligence, highlighting implications for education and the future of creative work.",

However, in those tasks, participants were explicitly instructed to ignore gaze and face stimuli, which may have minimized or even eliminated the effect of the face mask on gaze-related behavior. To address this limitation, the present study revisited the effect of face masks on joint attention using a spatial Stroop task, in which participants explicitly judged the gaze direction of a lateralized face. We compared the reversed congruency effect elicited by masked and unmasked faces, which has been attributed to joint attention. Across three experiments and a combined analysis, face masks did not affect the magnitude of the reversed congruency effect. These results reinforce the idea that gaze-triggered joint attention is robust enough to override the presence of face masks, highlighting the stability of human social attention even under conditions of limited facial visibility.",

It stems from the increasing professional and administrative demands faced by lecturers, which have an impact on their occupational well-being, as well as the need for proactive behaviors such as championing behavior as a form of adaptation to institutional change. The theoretical review highlights that championing behavior can strengthen lecturers' psychological well-being by increasing their sense of meaning, autonomy, and social support. This study uses a quantitative approach with a survey method and criterion sampling technique and uses instruments that have undergone validity and reliability tests with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Cronbach's Alpha, and Composite Reliability through SPSS ver. 30.0 software. Simple linear regression analysis shows that championing behavior has a positive and significant effect on occupational well-being (β = 0.592; p &lt; 0.001), indicating that lecturers with proactive and innovative behavior tend to have higher occupational well-being.

          "abstract": "Autistic traits are frequently associated with depressive symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in this association still need further examination. The present study explored chain mediation pathways, examining the impact of camouflaging autistic traits on the self and its subsequent influence on depressive symptoms. According to the diathesis-stress models, the dynamic interactionist model of vulnerability, the dual vulnerability model, the disconnect theory, and the unified model of depression, the present study examined two potential chain mediation pathways (i.e., social camouflaging - self-concept clarity and social camouflaging - self-disgust) of the association between autistic traits and depressive symptoms. Four hundred sixty-three undergraduate and graduate students completed an online survey measuring autistic traits, depressive symptoms, social camouflaging, self-concept clarity, and self-disgust. Autistic traits were directly and indirectly associated with increased depressive symptoms in the general population. Specifically, autistic traits were related to depressive symptoms through the chain mediation pathways of social camouflaging to self-concept clarity and social camouflaging to self-disgust. The results demonstrate the relationship between autistic traits and depressive symptoms when individuals engage in social camouflaging, particularly focusing on self-aspects (i.e., self-concept clarity and self-disgust). These findings underscore the complexities of mental health challenges associated with camouflaging autistic traits and highlight the importance of considering self-factors as critical intervention points for depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the influence of workload on educators’ job crafting among educators in East Java, Indonesia. Job crafting is a proactive process in which employees redesign their tasks to find greater meaning and satisfaction, which is instrumental in meeting the challenges posed by the changing demands of education. Data were collected online between September 24–29, 2024, from 85 educators selected through purposive sampling, ensuring all participants had at least one year of teaching experience. The sample comprised 20 males (23.53%) and 65 females (76.47%), with teaching experience ranging from 3 to 30 years. Descriptive statistics indicated an average workload score of 94.89 (SD = 7.66) and an average job crafting score of 76.92 (SD = 26.04). Reliability testing showed strong internal consistency of the measurement tools, while regression analysis using SPSS 27.0.1 confirmed that workload significantly predicted job crafting (β = 0.486, p &lt; 0.001), explaining 23.6% of the variance.This finding highlight how the dual role of workload can both challenge and encourage proactive adaptation in work practices. These findings highlight the dual role of workload, which can act both as a stressor and as a catalyst for proactive adaptation in work practices. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how workload dynamics shape job crafting among educators, offering practical insights for improving teacher welfare and performance in the Indonesian education context.",

          "authors": "Kyung Hee Kim",
          "abstract": "Measurement is the foundation of scientific inference, yet educational and psychological research often relies on instruments that are abbreviated, selectively administered, or modified without evidence that the resulting scores remain valid. This measurement fragmentation alters what a test measures, weakens the interpretability of its scores, and undermines the comparability and reproducibility of findings. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing emphasize that validity is version-specific and must be demonstrated for each distinct form of an instrument; reliability alone cannot establish valid interpretation. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) offer a clear illustration of these issues. When administered in full, the TTCT has demonstrated strong construct representation and long-term predictive validity across cultures and decades. However, many researchers use only one or two TTCT activities or substitute unvalidated short forms, assuming that the validity of the complete instrument transfers to these modified versions. Such practices yield findings that reflect the limitations of the altered test rather than the properties of creative thinking, often leading to unwarranted criticisms of the TTCT or of creativity assessment more broadly. This article situates the TTCT within wider meta-scientific concerns and provides recommendations for improving measurement practice, including version-specific validation, comprehensive reporting of measurement decisions, and transparency in test materials. Addressing measurement fragmentation is essential for producing interpretable, replicable, and theoretically meaningful research.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated gambling behaviors as a predictor of depressive symptoms among undergraduate students at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, while examining gender differences and the moderating effect of age on this relationship. Employing a cross-sectional design, 400 participants were selected through simple random sampling from multiple faculties. Data collection utilized a questionnaire comprising demographic information and two standardized instruments: the problem gambling severity index (Ferris and Wynne, 2001) and the Beck's Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961). Results revealed that gambling behaviors significantly predicted depressive symptoms (β = .546, t = 12.993, p &lt; .001), explaining 29.8% of the variance in depression scores. Gender analysis showed that female participants reported significantly higher depression scores (M = 34.15, SD = 17.31) compared to male participants (M = 31.39, SD = 7.91), t(398) = -1.998, p &lt; .001. Age emerged as a significant moderator of the gambling-depression relationship, F(1, 396) = 652.9209, p &lt; .001, accounting for an additional 35.5% variance (ΔR² = .3553). Conditional effects analysis revealed that participants aged 36-45 years demonstrated the strongest relationship between gambling behaviors and depressive symptoms (β = 1.9687, p &lt; .001), indicating heightened vulnerability in this age group. These findings highlight the substantial psychological impact of gambling behaviors on mental health among Nigerian university students, emphasizing gender disparities and age-related vulnerabilities. The results underscore the need for targeted mental health interventions and age-appropriate prevention strategies in educational settings to address gambling-related depression.\nKeyword: Gambling, depression, university students, gender, age.",

          "abstract": "Virtue science has expanded significantly in recent decades but has focused almost exclusively on measurement at the individual level, ignoring the environments that shape character formation. Addressing this gap, we aimed to develop and validate the Character Climate Scale (CCS) to capture the moral ecology of higher education environments. Across ten studies (N &gt; 1,600) at five U.S. institutions the CCS was designed and refined to capture students’ perceptions of the moral ecology of their university as expressed through peers, professors, courses, co-curricular activities and personal formation experiences. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the hypothesized higher-order Character Climate factor and a five-factor structure capturing core domains of moral ecology. The CCS showed strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, with stable structure across institutional contexts. The final 23-item CCS provides a robust, practical tool for assessing and tracking the moral ecology of education environments. It also enables institutions to evaluate virtue development efforts, identify strengths and growth areas, and monitor change over time, ultimately advancing virtue science and practice by situating moral development within its environmental context.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with psychosis have reduced social networks; however, little is known about whether social networks change over time, particularly after an acute episode requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, longitudinal associations between social network engagement, symptom severity, and the impact of illness duration remains unclear. Using linear mixed models controlling for age and sex, we analyzed self-reported social network engagement, positive and negative symptom severity, and self-reported paranoia in individuals with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD; N = 68) during six months following psychiatric hospitalization and compared them with non-clinical participants (NC; N = 70). SSD participants reported significantly lower social network scores than NC participants at every time point (ps &lt;.001), and significantly greater disruption in friendship than family ties (p = .012). Social networks remained stable over time in both groups (ps &gt;.05), regardless of illness stage in the SSD group (ps &gt;.05). Notably, lower social engagement with family at baseline predicted greater increases in paranoia over time (pcorrected = .048). Conversely, more severe paranoia at baseline predicted greater reductions in friend networks over time (pcorrected &lt; .001). Finally, social network related to negative symptom severity at baseline (pcorrected =.01) and longitudinally (ps&lt;.02). These findings suggest that clinical severity may influence the social network disruptions commonly found in psychotic disorders, especially during vulnerable periods of recovery following a psychotic exacerbation. Ultimately, this highlights the need for tailored post-discharge interventions that address social network deficits, particularly within families and in the context of severe paranoia.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period marked by heightened engagement with questions of identity and belonging, which can create significant challenges for young people’s mental health and social functioning. Sport is a key context in which these identity-related challenges are negotiated, with the potential to foster a meaningful sense of social identity. However, sport environments can also involve social exclusion, bullying, and other adverse group dynamics. As a result, the quality of the social environment, and the strength of the social identity it affords, depends critically on how leaders shape and manage that environment. Guided by the social identity approach to leadership, the present study examined whether identity leadership enacted by coaches and peer leaders supports adolescents’ positive functioning, operationalised as well-being and commitment to their team, by strengthening their identification with the team. Using data from 3,540 athletes aged 12 to 17 across 11 countries, we found that identity leadership from both coaches and peer leaders was positively associated with team identification, which in turn was linked to better mental health and stronger team commitment. These associations were largely consistent across countries, age groups, and genders. Taken together, the findings highlight that adolescent development is fundamentally a process of social identity development and identify identity leadership as a robust lever for supporting healthy adolescent development.",

          "abstract": "Conversation is one of the most powerful tools that people have for building and maintaining social connections. How does conversation bring two minds together? Here we tracked the neural dynamics between dyads during real-time conversation using fMRI hyperscanning, where both people were scanned simultaneously, to explore whether and how conversation aligns brains. Dyads engaged in natural, free-flowing conversation as they co-constructed the content of their dialogue. In a control condition, partners read aloud scripted dialogue from another dyad’s conversation, preserving the turn-taking structure while removing the co-construction. To examine neural alignment, we compared whole-brain intersubject correlation between partners in each condition, assessing both synchronous and predictive neural dynamics. Results showed that naturalistic conversation led to significant widespread neural alignment across brain regions implicated in attention, affect, executive control, and social cognition, compared to scripted conversation. Temporally refined analyses showed that during naturalistic conversation, relative to scripted conversation, both speakers and listeners anticipated each other within a short temporal window, with brain activity preceding their partner’s in the same neural systems. Conversation may help people communicate by aligning neural activity. This work lays the foundation for future research into how neural alignment allows people to create shared understanding and form social bonds.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive theories on trauma memory postulate that trauma-related intrusions are associated with more data-driven and less contextual processing. However, contextualisation can be enhanced via verbalization, suggesting that verbalizing traumatic material should reduce the number of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms and processes. Methods: In this experimental study, participants watched different trauma films and were instructed to verbalize the contents of each film clip, to visually imagine them, or to let their mind wander freely. Intrusions were measured via a diary and an intrusion provocation task applied three days after film presentation, and general trauma-relevant symptoms were assessed with the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist (PCL-5). Thought suppression was measured twice, i.e., before and after the experimental manipulation. During a memory processing task, participants were asked to recall the film clips, and their performance was evaluated based on the number of details they accurately remembered as well as the time it took them to do so. Results: No group differences emerged regarding the number of intrusions, PCL-5 scores, memory processing task outcomes, levels of thought suppression or data driven processing. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that intrusion frequency (i.e., diary intrusions, provoked intrusions, PCL-5) was positively correlated with thought suppression pre- and post-manipulation. Conclusion: The verbalization task did not result in a reduction of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms. However, results further underline the relationship between thought suppression and intrusions.",

          "abstract": "Number word learning offers a unique window into the nature of cognition. Number words are not only abstract in nature, but they are defined by their participation in a rich system of logical inferences that transcend our perceptual experience of the world. Numerate children as young as 5 years of age can reason about relations between large exact number words despite being unable to perceptually discriminate the quantities they represent. And they can reason about infinite magnitudes, despite never having experienced them. How do these intuitions arise in cognition if not through the senses? Although developmental psychologists have made remarkable progress in documenting the stages according to which children learn number words and the principles that govern their use, the cognitive origins of this knowledge remains poorly understood. I argue that strong nativist accounts lack a workable causal theory that describes the role that innate primitives might play during development and actual learning episodes. I then reconsider constructivist accounts that seek to explain how children might create new representational resources that have greater expressive power than precursor states.",

However, the use of the cap is incompatible with curly to coiled hair textures, as the electrode cannot reliably reach the scalp. This problem disproportionately impacts specific ethnicities. \n\nNew Method:\nWe developed the Universal Electroencephalography Clip (UE-C) for data collection across hair types, to combat the (hopefully) unintended racial bias in EEG methods. We tested responses from auditory and visual modalities to examine the signal from different areas of the scalp.  57 individuals (37 straight to wavy hair; 20 curly to coiled hair) listened to auditory clicks presented at 4Hz and viewed grating patterns that reversed contrast at 4 and 6Hz, separately, while EEG was recorded, first with the UE-C and then with the cap. The percent of epochs kept following artifact rejection and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) were calculated. ANOVAs and percent signal gain were used to compare the UE-C with the cap.\n\nResults:\nThe UE-C retained more visual-site epochs (7% for straight to wavy, 32% for curly to coiled) and enhanced 4-Hz SNR (p = .01), with negligible effects at auditory sites. \n\nComparison with existing methods: \nAt the visual electrode site, the UE-C retained more data and yielded better signal quality than the cap, despite hair texture. Auditory-site data were comparable between methods.\n\nConclusions:\nThese findings offer a step forward toward correcting the hair bias in EEG materials.",

          "abstract": "Interoception is increasingly recognized as a transdiagnostic impairment in mental health, partly due to its central role in affective processes. However, it remains unclear what components are captured by self-reported interoception and how they overlap with emotional awareness and regulation, hindering interpretation and reliable associations with psychopathology. The current study addresses this by situating the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness–2 (MAIA-2) relative to established affective measures to clarify its components and their relationships with psychopathology.\nIn a transdiagnostic community sample (N=544), network analysis investigated whether subscales from the MAIA-2, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale – 20, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire form cross-measure communities, reflecting divergent components. Structural equation modeling (SEM) further assessed coherence of the communities and associations with dimensional psychopathology (Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form).\nNetwork analyses revealed three communities: Primary Interoception (noticing body signals), Secondary Interoception (responses to body signals), and Affective Distance (poor awareness and acceptance of affect). SEM supported these as coherent components with unique patterns of relationships with dimensional psychopathology. Secondary Interoception and Affective Distance components were particularly associated with psychopathology. Notably, MAIA-2 subscales participated in all three communities and replicated community-level psychopathology relationships.\nBy clarifying the complex structure of the interoceptive–affective construct space, particularly in relation to the MAIA-2, this work improves interpretation of self-report findings and highlights where interoception aligns with or diverges from affective processes. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for more precise hypotheses, clearer characterization of interoceptive components relevant to psychopathology, and ultimately, better identification of intervention targets.",

Study 1 demonstrates that from age 5, children prefer affiliating with rule challengers who engage in good trouble by protesting unfair, arbitrary rules and norms. Study 2 reveals that by 7-8 years, children's endorsement of breaking unfair rules is moderated by the consequences of protest, with decreasing support as the severity of consequences increases. Cross-cultural comparisons between US and Indian cohorts show no significant differences in children’s developing understanding of norm flexibility and arbitrariness. Lastly, contrary to our hypothesis, when protest carries consequences, children believe that advantaged individuals—rather than those directly affected by unfairness—should bear the responsibility of engaging in good trouble.",

          "authors": "Roxy Grace Lafon",
          "abstract": "Huntington’s disease (HD) and bipolar disorder (BD) share overlapping psychiatric features, including mood instability, irritability, and depressive symptoms. This overlap often leads to delayed or incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate treatment, and confusion across psychiatry and neurology. This paper critically examines current diagnostic practices and their limitations in distinguishing HD from BD. It analyzes clinical symptom overlap, the central role of genetic testing in HD, and structured psychiatric and biomarker approaches for BD. Drawing on recent research, the paper proposes a dual-path diagnostic model: a neurogenetic pathway for HD and a structured psychiatric and biomarker pathway for BD. This framework aims to enhance early differentiation, reduce misdiagnosis, and support precision-based interventions. Emerging gene therapy research further underscores the importance of accurate early diagnosis, both for clinical care and for the successful application of disease-modifying treatments. Together, these strategies advocate for a future in which HD and BD are recognized as biologically distinct conditions with tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming counselor education, yet frameworks for preparing counselors-in-training (CITs) to use AI remain limited. This article introduces the developmental AI literacy framework (DALF), a conceptual model integrating developmental theory, professional identity formation, and AI literacy. The DALF reframes AI literacy as a developmental competency comprising intentional AI use, critical evaluation, ethical engagement, and awareness of professional identity. The framework outlines three stages, including foundational awareness, reflective application, and integrated professionalization, that parallel CITs’ growth from dependence to autonomy. Pedagogical, developmental, and research implications are provided to guide ethical and reflective AI integration in counselor education.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Relying on theory and evidence is a tenet of health intervention planning. Beyond these principles, it is important to understand how theory and the available evidence are combined and inform subsequent steps in the process. This article presents an integrated process model for designing health interventions using behavioral insights and Human-centered Design (HCD). To illustrate the model, we describe its application in developing an educational intervention addressing older adults’ influenza and pneumococcal vaccination behavior. Methods: A representative survey assessed psychological, health information, demographic, and lifestyle determinants. HCD methods, e.g., personas, were used to combine the findings. The perception and memory effects of three different intervention ideas were tested with an experiment and qualitative interviews, followed by the implementation and evaluation of a final intervention idea. Open science principles were used to facilitate transparency. Results: Following the process model, the final intervention idea “For the Plus in life” was chosen, that met the criteria of good recall, recognition, and positive evaluations. The intervention portrayed the protection of oneself and others and emphasized an improved quality of life by avoiding illness. Preliminary evaluation results after implementation in two consecutive years show that the intervention fulfilled important outcomes. Discussion: The process model demonstrates how to combine behavior-oriented theory and evidence to develop a data-driven, human-centered educational health intervention. The model provides a practical guide for public health practitioners to combine and implement data at different steps in health intervention planning.\nTrial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Register Klinische Studien) DRKS00012653.",

          "abstract": "Leadership that helps young people cultivate a shared sense of “us” is likely to be especially important for supporting healthy adolescent development. Yet research in this area has progressed slowly, in part because, until recently, no validated tool existed to assess identity leadership in youth populations. Addressing this gap, Butalia et al. (2024) developed the coach-referent Identity Leadership Inventory for Youth (ILI-Y) and provided initial validation in a UK sample of youth athletes. The present study builds on this work by evaluating the ILI-Y’s validity and reliability across a broader set of culturally diverse countries. Crucially, it also extends the measure by validating a parallel version designed to assess identity leadership among leaders within the team (e.g., captains).We drew on cross-sectional data from 4,095 adolescent athletes aged 12–17 years (M = 14.51, SD = 1.64) across 13 countries. Results supported a four-factor structure consistent with the identity leadership framework, along with strong evidence for internal consistency, measurement invariance, and discriminant, criterion, and incremental validity. These results held for both the coach and captain versions. Together, these findings advance identity leadership research and offer a developmentally appropriate, cross-culturally validated tool for assessing and supporting leadership in youth sport, with potential applications in other youth contexts.",

          "abstract": "Reading seems smooth and effortless, but this appearance is deceiving: In the process of extracting a meaning from a text, our eyes linger much more on some words than others, and we often reread earlier portions of the text. These disruptions are particularly common in syntactically challenging sentences. What explains this complex pattern of eye movements? One prominent hypothesis explains these patterns as a special case of the impact of a word's predictability (its surprisal) on the difficulty of recognizing the word. An alternative hypothesis attributes these disruptions to syntactic structure-building operations that apply after word recognition. Earlier attempts to address this debate have been inconclusive because of small numbers of participants, coarse measurements that are ill-suited to disentangling these competing views, and a limited range of predictability estimates. Here, we conduct a large-scale study (n = 368) examining eye movements during the reading of syntactically challenging sentences, using 407 types of predictability estimates from large language models with multiple architectures and training settings. We find a stark dissociation: Early reading measures are well approximated by language model surprisal, but syntactic disambiguation incurs a significant additional cost, reflected in an increase in rereading that is not explained by surprisal. We further show that when rereading parts of the sentence, readers strategically target the words most useful to amend the structure of the sentence. We conclude that linguistic knowledge guides moment-by-moment reading in two dissociable ways: Forward reading is driven by the word's surprisal, and backward reading reflects syntactic structure building operations.",

          "abstract": "The inclusiveness of immersion education, such as CLIL, for atypically developing pupils remains understudied. At the same time, immersion learning has been argued to impose high attentional and executive control demands. From this perspective, children already experiencing difficulties in these cognitive abilities, such as children with ADHD, might be at greater risk in immersion education. To address this issue empirically, 26 fifth and sixth-grade pupils with ADHD and 41 typically developing controls were recruited in CLIL and non-CLIL programs, and compared across attentional, executive, linguistic, and academic measures. Our findings do not support the claim that CLIL would only host the mildest forms of ADHD, nor that CLIL would pose additional cognitive and academic challenges for children with ADHD. On the contrary, we conclude that CLIL may offer a valuable opportunity for foreign-language learning, also for pupils with developmental disorders.",

However, the potential to capitalize on the collective commonness of rare disease to achieve the large samples often required by psychometric methodologies is insufficiently tapped. Our goal was to identify synergies that may accelerate clinical outcome assessment development for conditions known to impact neurodevelopment. Thus, we conducted the first systematic review of patient focused drug development (PFDD) meeting reports, an important source of direct input from patients and caregivers into the drug development process. \nMethods: Sixteen reports on rare conditions affecting neurodevelopment were identified. The responses to two survey items, “top three most troublesome symptoms” and “top three ideal treatment targets,” were coded into general concepts and the endorsement rates were aggregated across the conditions.\nResults: Full consensus about any individual troublesome symptom or treatment target was rare for any condition. Three conditions had no concept that exceeded 30% endorsement. However, for 11 of the 16 conditions, at least 30% of the respondents endorsed the developmental concepts of Communication or Cognitive/Developmental as a most troublesome symptom and as an ideal treatment target. \nConclusions: This empirical support for the shared prioritization of developmental concepts across heterogeneous conditions represents an important first step in unifying endpoint development efforts to promote clinical trial readiness in rare disease.",

          "abstract": "Auditory discrimination can be electrophysiologically measured by the mismatch response (MMR). Whereas in adults, this response occurs with a negative polarity (mismatch negativity; MMN), in infants it may either occur with a positive (pMMR) or a negative polarity (nMMR). Infant age has been identified as a key factor influencing MMR polarity, as the pMMR seems to change towards an adult-like nMMR with increasing age. It has also been suggested that pMMR and nMMR reflect different underlying processes, and growing evidence suggests that age triggers these processes in concert with other individual and methodological factors. The current review assessed the factors influencing the discrimination of speech sound contrasts in 0- to 24-month-old typically developing monolingual infants, with focus on vowels, consonants as well as lexical tones. We found that the MMR polarity is affected not only by age but also by interindividual, experimental, and data-analysis factors. Based on our findings, we offer methodological considerations for developmental EEG researchers for each study phase. In sum, our systematic approach disentangling the factors affecting the MMR polarity elucidates the processes underlying pMMR and nMMR and thus informs future study design and data interpretation in the widespread application of the MMR in developmental studies.",

          "authors": "Leonie Seidel; Astrid Endrup Iversen; Konstantina Kilteni; Janina Seubert",
          "abstract": "Processing of contaminants in odour mixtures is influenced by their categorisation into food and non-food categories. For example, we previously found that participants were more likely to perceive food odours as contaminated by non-food odours than vice versa, and that this effect was robust to changes in explicit task instructions. However, due to the mixing of food and non-food components, processing differences between categories were not captured by this task design and thus remain to be explored.  In the current pre-registered study, we address this knowledge gap by determining the effects of attention on the perception of odour mixtures containing only food or non-food components. Participants (N = 24) assessed the perceived dominance of a target odour within an odour mixture. Response times to all odours increased towards the dilution series’ midpoint and were faster for food odour compared to non-food odour mixtures. Perceived target dominance increased linearly for non-food targets but exhibited a sigmoidal shape with a steeper slope (smaller just-noticeable difference) for food targets. This implies that distinguishing two food odours was easier than distinguishing between two non-food odours, likely due to definitions higher relevance of distinct object category boundaries subserving contamination avoidance. At the same time, contamination sensitivity might be lower for non-foods, allowing for greater tolerance of deviations. Attention did not influence the perception of non-food but did so for ambivalent food mixtures and when the target was completely absent.",

It has been reported for a range of tasks for symbolic representations of number (e.g., digits), but evidence for SNARC effects for non-symbolic representations of number (i.e., quantities of objects) is mixed and usually restricted to tasks where numerical properties are relevant. Here, we report six studies where participants made color decisions to circles. We manipulated the stimuli so that displays formed structured, familiar patterns (dice-like arrangements, Experiments 1-2), structured but unfamiliar patterns (symmetrical arrangements, Experiments 3-4), or unstructured and unfamiliar patterns (scattered arrangements, Experiments 5-6). We additionally manipulated whether aggregate surface area was controlled or uncontrolled and whether individual elements within displays remained constant in size or differed across the experiment. The SNARC effect was present when (1) circles were arranged in a structured familiar manner, or (2) aggregate surface area increased congruently with quantity, although some effects were weak by Bayesian standards. Our results are consistent with the view that non-symbolic quantities offer a route to magnitude and its spatial representations, but that this may be modulated by the consistency of high- and low-level visual cues to magnitude.",

          "abstract": "Teachers' social-emotional and instructional (SEI) characteristics shape classroom functioning and student outcomes, yet most research relies exclusively on teacher self-reports, potentially overlooking discrepancies between teachers' self-perceptions and students' lived experiences. This study addresses this gap by examining: (1) agreement between teacher self-ratings and student evaluations across 16 SEI characteristics, (2) associations between student-rated teacher characteristics and student well-being, and (3) optimal levels of teacher behaviors using Too Little/Too Much (TLTM) scaling methodology. Data were collected from 143 secondary school teachers and 1,993 students (ages 11-20) in Flanders, Belgium. Teachers completed self-evaluations of their SEI characteristics, while students rated their teachers using identical items and reported on their own well-being. Results revealed weak to moderate agreement between teacher and student ratings (ICCs: -.02 to .19), with teachers and students differing significantly in their latent mean ratings. Multilevel analyses showed that 9% of variance in student well-being was attributable to teacher-level factors. Four student-rated teacher characteristics showed significant curvilinear associations with student well-being: emotional self-regulation, teaching tempo, trust in students, and growth mindset beliefs. These inverted U-shaped relationships suggest that moderate levels optimize student well-being, while both deficits and excesses relate to poorer outcomes. Notably, teacher self-ratings did not predict student outcomes. These findings underscore the value of student perspectives in evaluating teaching quality and suggest that effective teaching requires balancing rather than maximizing certain behaviors.",

This study examined the relationship between interpersonal variability and personality functioning using multilevel modeling (MLM), as well as the unique explanatory power of interpersonal variability beyond its mean level. This study employs a hybrid design that integrates a longitudinal approach with experience sampling features, collecting monthly data on significant interpersonal interactions from 342 adults over six months. Personality functioning was assessed with the Level of Personality Functioning Scale Self-Report (LPFS-SR), and interpersonal behaviors (submissive behavior, quarrelsome behavior, perceived other’s behavior) and interpersonal affects (positive and negative affect) were assessed with self-report measures. Results showed that variability in quarrelsome behavior, perceived other's behavior, and negative affect were significantly associated with personality functioning at both within-person and between-person levels. However, the relationships between variability in submissive behavior, positive affect, and personality functioning diverged at each level. Moreover, variability in submissive behavior and perceived other's behavior accounted for additional variance beyond mean levels. Overall, the results of this study suggest the importance of considering not only the degree but also the temporal variability of interpersonal behaviors and affects in constructing personalized models of personality pathology. Furthermore, they highlight the need to consider distinct results at within-person and between-person levels, with broader implications for clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Teaching is an emotionally demanding profession with alarmingly high early-career attrition rates. Understanding which individual differences predict successful adaptation during the critical transition from teacher education to professional practice is essential for supporting teacher retention and well-being. This longitudinal study examined how personality traits, academic motivation, and emotion regulation strategies measured at the beginning of teacher education (T1) predicted professional outcomes approximately four years later during early-career teaching (T2). Participants were 311 Belgian preservice teachers (79.4% women; Mage = 19.9 years) who completed assessments at program entry and follow-up surveys (n = 93) after entering the workforce. Results revealed that personality traits demonstrated the strongest predictive validity. Extraversion predicted multiple positive outcomes, including better classroom management, student engagement, emotional self-regulation, stress resilience, and lower turnover intentions. Conscientiousness predicted professional commitment, while Open-Mindedness was associated with creative and culturally responsive teaching but paradoxically also with higher burnout symptoms. Neuroticism predicted greater burnout. Contrary to expectations, initial academic motivation did not significantly predict study completion or job satisfaction. Emotion regulation strategies showed domain-specific effects: cognitive reappraisal predicted higher job satisfaction, while expressive suppression predicted lower satisfaction, though only when controlling for personality. These findings highlight personality traits—particularly Extraversion—as robust early indicators of teacher adjustment and suggest that teacher education programs should consider incorporating personality-informed support strategies to facilitate successful transitions into the profession.",

However, little is known about how it operates across cultures. Drawing on a cross-national dataset of 164 football teams from eight countries (N = 2,807 players and coaches), this study used social network analysis to examine whether and how leadership structures vary as a function of power-distance. Although shared leadership was observed across all cultures, it was notably more prevalent in high power-distance contexts. This pattern held consistently across leadership roles (task, motivational, social, and external) and across different levels of analysis (team- and country-level power-distance). To understand this pattern, we examined whether cross-cultural differences could be attributed to the perceived quality of formal leaders or the average quality of the peer leadership group. There was little variation on these indicators, suggesting that the greater prevalence of shared leadership in high power-distance cultures was primarily driven by higher overall peer leadership quality. These findings challenge prevailing theories and suggest that shared leadership is not culturally contingent. Accordingly, the principles of shared leadership can and should be taught, implemented, and promoted across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Irritability is a transdiagnostic symptom proposed to be characterized by heightened negative affect (i.e., frustration) and maladaptive responses to frustrative nonreward (FNR). Although FNR typically elicits adaptive behavioral adjustments, the neural mechanisms that support these adjustments and their trial-by-trial dynamics remain unexplored. Midfrontal theta power, a key marker of expectancy violation and cognitive control, is a strong candidate for indexing these mechanisms and their role in supporting adaptive responses. We investigated how fluctuations in midfrontal theta power following FNR relate to subsequent behavioral adjustments and whether these associations are moderated by individual differences in irritability and state frustration. Methods: Young adults completed a validated frustration paradigm and self-reported their irritability and state frustration. A multivariate approach was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of single-trial theta activity. Linear mixed-effects models tested whether trial-by-trial theta power and feedback type (win vs. FNR) predicted reaction time on the following trial. Results: Higher theta power following FNR, but not win feedback, was associated with faster reaction times on the next trial, suggesting that theta oscillations support adaptive behavioral adjustments to frustrative outcomes. Reduced theta power to FNR was linked to greater self-reported frustration, while trait irritability and state frustration did not moderate the theta-behavior association. Conclusion: Midfrontal theta power increased following FNR and predicted faster subsequent responses, highlighting its role in adaptive adjustment to unexpected reward loss. These findings enhance understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting coping with frustration and suggest this process may be less effective under heightened subjective frustration.",

          "abstract": "The Reliable Change Index (RCI) is a tool for evaluating change at the individual level. It compliments standard group-level change estimates and is central to evaluating clinical significance for interventions. In principle, the RCI provides common criteria for evaluating individual change. However, current practices use sample-specific estimates to create these criteria. Because sample estimates are subject to sampling error, these criteria are also subject to sampling error and therefore differ across studies. We illustrate how current practices can lead to differing criteria for reliable change and use simulations to identify the impact of sampling error on the RCI. Excessive error in the RCI began for the average sample when N &lt; 30, and samples only comfortably avoided the risk of excessive error when N &gt; 100. Finally, small errors in estimating a measure’s reliability sometimes had profound effects on the RCI. Recommendations on use of the RCI are provided.",

          "abstract": "Domestic heating is a substantial contributor to carbon emissions, so the adoption of efficient heating solutions, using renewable energy sources, is needed to support many countries in achieving net-zero commitments. District heat networks (DHNs) are recognised as a key component of urban energy infrastructure in the transition to low-carbon energy. However, it is critical to understand and overcome barriers to adoption for end-users, to ensure DHNs can be implemented at the pace and scale needed to support sustainability ambitions. Non-technical barriers, including social acceptance and behaviour change, are important issues which need to be addressed to promote end-user uptake of DHN technology, particularly with respect to retrofit projects. Here, we used an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, whereby a pilot resident survey informed a qualitative study which sought to understand the barriers and facilitators to DHN connection among residents from two low-rise neighbourhoods targeted for DHN retrofit. The Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model was used to elucidate the data obtained. The analyses revealed that resident knowledge and understanding of DHNs is poor, but that provision of informational resources will promote both information seeking and intention to connect to the DHN. Community involvement in DHN initiatives was identified as an important facilitator of DHN engagement. Perceptions of DHN costs and environmental benefits were further determinants of resident perceptions of the DHN. To facilitate policy development, nine behaviour change techniques are proposed for incorporation into interventions aimed at leveraging the identified facilitators and overcoming barriers to DHN connection.",

          "abstract": "Decisions under risk can be characterized by two complementary but distinct behavioral variables: the propensity to choose the expected value-maximizing option and the tendency to select the risky option. Human reinforcement learning (RL) research has traditionally focused more on the former (maximization), providing many insights into how fundamental features of the learning environment influence behavior. For instance, previous studies have shown that counterfactual feedback about unchosen options exerts a strong influence on maximization. However, comparatively little is known about scenarios in which maximization and risk propensity are assessed orthogonally and simultaneously. To address this gap, we designed a series of RL experiments in which we manipulated key factors, including the feedback information regime (partial vs. complete) and the relative expected values of risky and safe options. Contrary to the conventional assumption that “more information is better,” our results clearly show that, in such contexts, the effect of foregone outcomes on risk preference outweighs its influence on maximization. We further compared RL choices with description-based versions of the same decision problems. While replicating established findings on the description–experience gap, we found that complete information had little impact on its expression, suggesting that this gap does not arise primarily from instant feedback or insufficient outcome sampling.",

This allows a general way to model and correct for these types of errors. Any situation where multiple true scores get collapsed can be understood with this model. We discuss how existing approaches fit into this general framework (e.g., scoring binary responses using Item Response Theory), and sketch the broader range of situations where the model can be applied. Discretization errors have the capacity of organizing, guide modelling, and furthering our understanding about an extensive class of errors beyond classical ones, that psychological researchers frequently encounter.",

We examine techno-optimism — here defined as the belief that technology will largely solve the problems caused by climate change — among scientists using survey data from N = 9,199 scientists across 115 countries. Our findings show that techno-optimism is most prevalent among scientists in applied and natural sciences, and among those with right-leaning political views. Techno-optimistic scientists are substantially less likely to engage in civic climate action (28% lower) or make high-impact lifestyle changes (20% lower). These results suggest that techno-optimistic worldviews within science may inadvertently constrain the behavioral and cultural shifts required for effective climate action.",

          "authors": "Camille Eustache; Sylvie Granon; Sabrina Teyssier; Nicolas Darcel",
          "abstract": "Background: Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS)—such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin—are increasingly used as sugar substitutes to enhance food palatability without additional caloric intake. While the metabolic effects of NNS are well documented, their potential cognitive and socio-emotional consequences remain unclear. \nObjective: This study investigated the associations between chronic NNS and sugar consumption, cognitive performance, and socio-emotional behaviors in healthy young adults, while controlling for sugar intake to isolate substance-specific effects.\nMethods: A total of 291 French adults aged 18-30 years completed five computerized tasks assessing decision-making and emotion regulation: the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Game of Dice Task (GDT), the binary dictator game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Daily NNS and sugar intakes were estimated using quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Logistic mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the effects of NNS and sugar intake on choice probabilities, rigidity scores, and response times.\nResults: Higher NNS intake was associated with increased selection of the riskiest options under explicit risk in the GDT (p = 0.04) but did not affect decision-making in the IGT. Conversely, higher sugar intake was positively associated with selecting the advantageous yet risky option compared to both disadvantageous (p = 0.04) and advantageous non-risky (p = 0.02) options during the early ambiguity (learning) phase of the IGT. Sugar intake also tended to increase selection of the riskiest option (versus the safest option) under explicit risk. NNS intake was further linked to shorter mean response times across IGT trials (p = 0.04) and showed a trend toward higher rigidity scores at the end of the task, whereas sugar intake predicted longer response times (p &lt; 0.01) and tended to decrease rigidity scores. Neither NNS nor sugar intake significantly influenced altruism, cooperation, or emotion regulation.\nConclusion: Chronic NNS and sugar consumption appear to differentially modulate decision-making processes under explicit and experiential risk, without significantly impacting social or emotional behaviors. These findings underscore the need for longitudinal and neuroimaging studies to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying sweetener-related behavioral modulation.",

While extensive research exists on how humans recognize different emotions, little is known about how people assess emotional intensity. Through a preliminary survey and seven multi-site studies (n = 2,866), we demonstrate that despite believing they gauge emotions accurately, systematic discrepancies emerge: individuals tend to rate others' emotions as more intense than those individuals rate themselves, particularly for negative emotions. This bias persists across text-based interactions, recorded videos, and live conversations, with both strangers and romantic partners. Interestingly, while people report preferring accurate judgments of their own emotional intensity, the discrepancy may serve adaptive functions, predicting higher empathic responses with strangers and greater relationship satisfaction in romantic relationships. These findings advance understanding of discrepancies in interpersonal emotional perception, highlighting their potential adaptive roles and providing insight into how they shape our social world and relationship outcomes.",

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to understand why people join small-team action on the climate crisis and what makes them effective. Over 7 weeks, college students (N = 79) received training, acted in small teams, and responded to open-ended questions about their plans, actions and reasoning alongside survey-based self-reported beliefs. At 6 months, follow-up interviews were conducted. From a rich set of results there were two main take-aways. First, to understand the psychology of collective action, it is critical to measure real-world action in addition to intentions and beliefs. Here we found that even these highly motivated participants only translated 52% of their intentions to verified action in Study 1 and 66% in Study 2; therefore, merely measuring intentions would provide an incomplete picture. And whereas self- and collective efficacy survey scales showed significant increases, these changes did not relate to verified action. Second, in the context of a real-world collective action study, this study shows that it is possible to derive psychological variables bottom-up, from the data, rather than only relying on psychological variables that are derived top-down from theories in the literature. Across both studies, a psychological construct which we term “social obligation” was significantly related to action. This construct, which also connotes commitment to one’s group or the norms by which one’s group works, is not readily featured in existing collective action research. These results may be useful for social movement organizers, and for advancing psychological theories of real-world collective action.",

But whether LKM can reduce loneliness, and whether this corresponds to higher levels of trait empathy, state empathy, and/or neural empathic responding, has not been assessed. In this pre-registered mixed-design randomized controlled trial, 108 participants completed LKM or active control training. Loneliness and trait empathy were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Neural empathic responding was measured in 54 participants during functional MRI by computing the multi-voxel pattern similarity between experiencing and observing both pain and fearful anticipation of pain. Both interventions reduced loneliness, but not trait empathy, which failed to support the hypothesis that LKM is effective in reducing loneliness by increasing empathy. Furthermore, we found no credible evidence that loneliness is associated with differences in neural empathic responding or state empathy for pain. However, loneliness was associated with lower self-reported empathy. Together, these results suggest that lonelier individuals simulate others’ experiences but may not subjectively perceive themselves as empathetic, emphasizing the potential of loneliness interventions that address maladaptive social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Operant boxes are fundamental tools for studying animal behavior in laboratory settings. While commercial operant boxes offer standardized designs and software for immediate use, they come with significant drawbacks, including high start-up and maintenance costs, limited software flexibility, restricted experimental design options, time-intensive daily operation, and rigid data structures. The constraints posed by commercial operant boxes have constrained the scope and applications of animal research for decades. Custom-made operant boxes combat these limitations but historically have only been accessible to labs with dedicated engineering expertise and/or high budgets. The rise of accessible consumer electronic technologies like Raspberry Pi microcomputers, open-source software, and advanced search and inference tools (e.g., large language models) has made it feasible for non-experts to create cost-effective, customizable operant boxes. Recent projects have laid out their own blueprint designs for affordable open-source operant boxes, but many of these are simply proof-of-concept or isolated to specific experimental applications. We outline key considerations for custom designing versatile, low-cost, and robust multi-operant box systems by discussing our designs for a Raspberry Pi-powered pigeon operant box, equipped with touchscreen capabilities and modular stimulus control. This system features components sourced online, requires no specialized tools/skills (e.g., no soldering or intensive software for hardware interaction), and obviates the need for extended electrical engineering knowledge. Utilized hardware and software systems are highly adaptable, enabling precise customization for a wide range of tasks, behaviors, and experimental organisms. We also provide a streamlined framework for implementing cloud connectivity, version-controlled code design, automated data synchronization across multiple boxes using modern cloud platforms, and scalability for larger or smaller systems. Furthermore, this system costs a fraction (approximately 4%) of commercial alternatives. Our system's versatility is demonstrated through its application to diverse behavioral studies in pigeons, rats, humans, and even plants. Finally, we explore the integration of large language models for software development and troubleshooting, highlighting their potential to further simplify and enhance custom operant box systems.",

Past research linked stronger physiological responses to threat and disgust with conservatism, suggesting a neurobiological basis for ideology. However, replication failures cast doubt on a direct link between physiology and political attitudes. Given interoception’s role in awareness and emotion regulation, we tested whether interoceptive sensibility (i.e., awareness of internal bodily states) moderates the relationship between disgust sensitivity and ideology. Using survey data from 632 participants, we found that disgust sensitivity predicted conservative ideology, but this association was moderated by interoceptive sensibility. Among those with lower interoception, higher disgust sensitivity increased the likelihood of identifying as conservative, and lower disgust with being liberal. This relationship disappeared among those with higher interoception. We suggest individuals with lower interoception are more susceptible to socially constructed associations between physiological states and ideology. These findings lay the groundwork for more mechanistic, replicable research on psychophysiological antecedents of political cognition.",

By establishing a symbiotic microbiota environment capable of self-regeneration, and by transiently modulating hormonal and cellular pathways, the human body may achieve a sustained metabolic phenotype independent of external pharmacological control.

Among navigational deficits, older adults have been shown to demonstrate deficits in utilizing allocentric (i.e., world-centered) information and rely on egocentric (i.e., body-centered) cues during navigation, resulting in reference frame bias. We investigated naturalistic navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation in younger adults (N = 30) and older adults (N = 30) using a city-like virtual reality wayfinding task (NavCity) across multiple within-session exposures, paired with a NavCity Allocentric Representation Assessment (NARA). Older adults demonstrated significantly lower navigation performance compared to younger adults including traveling greater distances, taking longer navigation times, moving at slower speeds, and exhibiting longer dwell times while navigating. Despite aging-related differences, both age groups showed similar rates of performance improvement across exposure blocks. Following repeated NavCity exposures, older adults demonstrated lower allocentric knowledge formation, but both age groups demonstrated significant associations with navigation performance. Notably, substantial heterogeneity was observed within the older adult group, with a bimodal distribution in NARA scores that split older adults into higher- and lower-performing subgroups, which corresponded to differences in navigation performance independent of chronological age. Higher-performing older adults exhibited navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation comparable to younger adults, while lower-performing older adults showed persistent deficits in both navigation performance and allocentric knowledge formation despite repeated exposures. These findings suggest  that aging-related navigation decline is not uniform and highlight the possibility of combined virtual navigation and allocentric assessment tasks as potential sensitive, early indicators of aging-related declines in spatial navigation ability.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Castillo; Joshua Miller; Colin Vize; David A Baranger; Donald R Lynam",
          "abstract": "Two-way interaction effects in linear regression occur when the relation between two variables changes depending on the level of a third. Despite their frequent use, interactions are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately and test for statistical significance due to small effect sizes and low reliability. This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to establish stability thresholds for two-way interactions between continuous variables across combinations of reliability (.7–1.0), main effect size (.1–.5), collinearity (.1–.5), and interaction effect size (.05–.2). Stability was defined as the consistency of estimated effect sizes across repeated samples of the same size from the same population and operationalized using modified definitions of the Corridor of Stability (COS) and Point of Stability (POS) from Schönbrodt and Perugini (2013). Results show that the stability of interaction estimates is primarily determined by sample size and predictor reliability. The case representing a realistic psychology field study, where researchers have limited control over variables, stabilized at n = 3,800, requiring 72% statistical power. At n &lt; 100, 11%–45% of the estimates were incorrectly signed (i.e., negative when the true effect was positive). Most psychology studies enroll far fewer than 500 participants, and our results indicate many published interactions may be unstable. It should be noted that analyses involving highly reliable predictors, such as group assignment in experimental designs, may stabilize at lower sample sizes as they attenuate the expected effect size less than variables with more measurement error. Researchers are encouraged to avoid routine tests of two-way interactions unless sample size and reliability are adequate and hypotheses are specified a priori.",

Specifically, it explores the pathways that lead professionals to engage in this work, the values underpinning their career choices, and how their motivations influence their practice. Design/methodology/approach - This study employed a qualitative descriptive design to examine clinicians' perspectives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nineteen mental health clinicians working in Canadian community-based organizations that serve equity-deserving groups. Participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews explored clinicians’ backgrounds, motivations, and approaches to mental health care. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, allowing for the identification of key themes that capture participants’ experiences. Findings - four themes emerged from the data and are presented: 1) Personal background; 2) diverse needs and mental health awareness; 3) reduce stigma and stereotypes; and 4) current equity imitates. The findings highlight how participants’ personal and professional experiences are deeply intertwined with their motivations to address systemic inequities. This, in turn, translates into their clinical practices, where they prioritize cultural humility, cultural responsiveness and the co-creation of safe therapeutic spaces.  Originality/value - By contributing to a nuanced understanding of these dynamics, this research aims to highlight the need for greater diversity amongst the mental health care system and promote greater inclusive and equitable services. It highlights the transformative potential of integrating cultural humility and intersectionality into mental health care.

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

          "abstract": "The perception of voluntariness in task failure during extreme physical effort is debated in endurance sports. This study tested whether power meter data availability affects perceived voluntariness and performance in cyclists accustomed to power meters. Forty trained cyclists completed two counterbalanced maximal incremental tests: one without feedback and one with real-time power visualization. Confirmatory analyses showed that power visualization increased maximal aerobic power (MAP) without affecting VO2MAX, maximal heart rate, RPE, or perceived voluntariness. Exploratory analyses revealed an order effect: participants who first performed the test with power data perceived their decision to stop as more voluntary in that condition compared to the subsequent no-feedback test. This effect was absent in the reverse order group. No order effects were found for other variables. Cyclists’ performance judgments aligned with actual MAP differences. These findings show that access to power data enhances MAP. Although the main analysis pointed to a null effect on perceived voluntariness of the decision to stop, an exploratory order effect suggested that removing power data after prior exposure reduces perceived control over task failure decisions, warranting further investigation. This study highlights the role of performance feedback in shaping objective and subjective performance in cycling.",

          "abstract": "Faces serve as gateways of impression formation during human interactions and are widely used in psychological research. To test these questions, researchers often rely on databases of photographs of adults’ and children’s faces for stimuli. Although the value of these resources is clear, there are some limitations, especially for research using children’s images as stimuli. This manuscript introduces a novel alternative to those databases: AI-Faces by Illinois, a fully open-access (CC-BY-NC-4.0) database of 1,152 photorealistic, AI-generated images depicting child faces. All images, norming data, and Online Supplemental Material are freely available on OSF (https://osf.io/vurm5/). These images vary systematically by perceived age (3, 6, 10, 15 years), gender (boy, girl), race/ethnicity (Black, East Asian, Latine, Middle Eastern/North African, Native American, Pacific Islander, South Asian, White), and emotional expression (10 smiling, 4 angry, 4 frowning per group). A norming study assessing 1,261 adults’ ratings of the images indicates that faces across race and gender groups are perceived as equally real and align with the gender and racial identities they were prompted to represent. Many well-documented perceptual biases observed with real faces—such as the Own-Race Bias—also generalized to the AI-Faces by Illinois images, providing evidence that similar processes are at play when adults evaluate AI-generated images of children. This manuscript highlights the methodological advantages, and new ethical considerations, of using AI-generated faces of children in psychological research.",

Emerging evidence suggests that encoding too many items into working memory (WM) limits subsequent long-term memory (LTM) retrieval of their details and gist. These findings highlight a boundary condition for theories positing relatively automatic gist encoding. But how expansive is this boundary? Experiment 1 shows that it extends to older adults, despite their generally enhanced reliance on gist memory. In two older adult samples (n = 40 each), LTM gist retrieval was reduced for objects encoded in sets exceeding WM capacity. Experiment 2 shows that this boundary holds even when retaining items in LTM is essential. Under intentional long-term learning, young (n = 81) and older (n = 40) adults’ LTM gist retrieval remained affected by overloading WM at encoding. Results invite leading memory theories to reconsider the universality of relatively automatic gist encoding.",

Data included American Community Survey and Environmental Justice Screen data for 288,918 census block-groups collected yearly from 2013 to 2022. Exploratory structural equation modeling with bifactor rotation was used to extract five orthogonal factors. The scores were validated using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), Child Opportunity Index (COI), data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ambient noise data from the U.S. National Parks Service, and color-coded maps of metropolitan areas. The five scores captured urbanicity, socioeconomic prosperity, university influence, retirement appeal, and pollution levels. Validation showed expected relationships between urbanicity and ambient noise; socioeconomic status and ADI, COI, and mother's education; and score levels corresponding to known characteristics of metropolitan areas. These scores provide a significant advancement in the accessibility and usability of large-scale socioenvironmental data. The public availability brings numerous opportunities for further research and application, potentially uncovering new insights and informing evidence-based decision-making across various domains.",

          "authors": "François Guérit; Robert P. Carlyon",
          "abstract": "Cochlear-Implant (CI) users struggle to understand speech under noisy conditions. This has long been attributed to channel interactions: a given neuron not only responds to electrical stimulation from the closest electrode but is also sensitive to stimulation from electrodes located further away. Shaping the stimulation voltage into a very sharp profile (e.g. using tripolar as opposed to the more-common monopolar stimulation) has been proposed as a solution, but with only limited success. We argue that this is due to a combination of factors, including the fact that envelopes of adjacent CI channels are highly correlated in response to many sounds including speech, that some neural spread of excitation is necessary for sufficient loudness, and that, at comfortably loud levels, monopolar and sharp stimulation modes can yield very similar output voltage at cochlear locations that are at least 3-4 electrodes away from a given stimulation electrode. We describe a “Hilltop” method to effectively reduce the voltage more than 3-4 electrodes away from a given electrode, while keeping the same percept of place pitch as with monopolar stimulation. Based on computational modelling and on psychophysical measures of charge summation, we show that the difference between monopolar and Hilltop stimulation persists at the level of the spiral ganglion neurons, and therefore warrants investigations with more complex, multi-channel stimuli. We also describe possible limitations of this strategy, including the presence of sidelobes of opposite effective polarity in some participants, and suggest ways to mitigate their effects.",

          "abstract": "Users have become increasingly reliant on Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, to complete a wide range of reasoning tasks, from managing workplace projects to giving personal advice. However, LLMs function as black boxes, leaving users with minimal insight into how they generate the responses that they do. One way that users can attempt to peek into these black boxes is by asking LLMs to explain their reasoning processes. The nascent literature on LLM faithfulness suggests that LLMs – like humans – often fail to accurately identify the information they use to inform their reasoning, suggesting a lack of metacognitive knowledge. Across two studies, we extend this research to the context of multi-attribute choice, tasking both LLMs and human participants (n = 436) with completing the Knowledge of Weights paradigm. Participants first completed a series of choice tasks in which they picked between homes that varied on six attributes, then self-reported the decision weight they believed they placed on each attribute in two different formats. In Study 1, we found that ChatGPT4o self-reported weights that were significantly less reflective of their choice behavior than humans. In Study 2, we found that three more-advanced LLMs (ChatGPT5, Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Flash) self-reported weights that were as accurate or more accurate than those provided by humans. These results suggest that LLMs can generate and maintain accurate metacognitive knowledge of their own decision-making processes as well or better than humans, but that this is a relatively new ability. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Autobiographical memory enables individuals to communicate not only what happened but when, drawing on both local event sequences and global temporal frameworks like recurring routines and conventional time systems (e.g., calendars, clocks). Developmental research has demonstrated gains in the ability to describe past events in sequence through childhood, yet little is known about how children embed experiences within global temporal structures. Moreover, existing studies of autobiographical organization often treat age as the primary driver of developmental change, which may overlook how differences in experience contribute to temporal organization as well. We hypothesized that, with age, children’s autobiographical narratives would shift from being organized in sequences of local events towards being embedded in global, relational structures. Moreover, we predicted that children’s experience navigating time independently in everyday life would relate to their tendency to describe experiences relative to temporal patterns. To that end, 92 participants aged 7-25 years, a key age range during which episodic memory abilities and independence increase, described a typical day, and their narratives were coded with a scheme which distinguished local from global temporal organization. We also measured conventional time knowledge and developed a questionnaire to quantify the independence with which children navigate time in daily life. Results supported our hypothesized developmental shift; with age, participants referenced local sequences less and global time structures more. Furthermore, individual differences in experience were linked to distinct organizational properties, as conventional time knowledge predicted references to specific temporal locations, while independence predicted references to relational time patterns.",

A sample of 473 Brazilian adults completed questionnaires on the EFML, musical coping, and well-being. The validation process involved Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), while the mediation was tested using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

          "abstract": "Designing games for the elderly must highlight age-related challenges and present unique opportunities to address a growing problem. Recent studies on gameplay design for older adults suggest using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Ryan, Rigby, and Przybylski 2006) which emphasizes relatedness as a key motivator (Webster 2008), providing potential benefits to the well-being of the elderly (Hasan and Linger 2016). This project design focuses on relatedness in gaming for older adults through a VR experience. We created an adventure using a virtual AI child as a companion, guide, and motivator. The game utilizes an independent Quest2 VR headset. The gameplay – designed to resonate with older adults' inner-childhood memories – features hand-drawn settings, nostalgic toys, and familiar intergenerational interactions (Havukainen et al. 2020). Each of the gameplay's levels presented a different measure of engagement across the SDT dimensions. Successful interactions were rewarded by the AI child's display of affection. The pilot consisted of 19 healthy Israeli elderly volunteers over 65, each participating in a 15–20-minute session in Shenkar Games' Lab. Unstructured interviews, motivated by Subjective Vitality and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaires, were administered to subjects before and after the gameplay to elicit changes in their subjective well-being. Chronicling the game highlighted the development of positive emotions between participants and their AI child. The immersive VR experience increased their emotional response and inspired the older adults to interact with their AI child as human, some even expressed desire to hug it. Notwithstanding the limited number of participants, the VR pilot demonstrated the possibility of relatedness between older adults and their AI companion.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how neurodivergent individuals, students, and educators discuss virtual reality (VR)-based education on Reddit, with a focus on accessibility, sensory experience, and structural concerns. Using a qualitative research design grounded in constructivist epistemology, secondary data were drawn from publicly available Reddit threads and analysed through thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2006) six-phase framework. Findings revealed that while some users experience VR as calming, structured, and conducive to focus, others reported sensory overload, motion sickness, and disorientation, especially among users with dyspraxia or heightened sensory sensitivities. Participants also voiced ethical concerns around corporate control, data privacy, and the exclusion of educators and neurodivergent stakeholders from design processes. The study underscores that VR is not inherently inclusive and that its educational benefits are highly individualised. Inclusive design must go beyond technical usability to meaningfully engage neurodivergent perspectives from the outset. The findings carry important implications for developers, educators, and policymakers seeking to integrate immersive technologies in equitable and ethical ways. By amplifying user-generated discourse, this research highlights the importance of participatory approaches in shaping accessible educational technologies and identifies a critical gap: the underrepresentation of neurodivergent developers in both online discourse and design leadership.",

          "abstract": "Currently there is a lack of suitable tasks for measuring cognitive flexibility (CF) in children under 3 years old. Additionally, few tasks can be adapted for use across infancy and toddlerhood, which is necessary to ensure consistency in the measured construct. Here we present a new CF task, the ‘Shapes Task’ aimed at addressing this gap. During the task, children first place differently shaped blocks directly into the correct target hole(s) in a shape-sorter box. Then, in three ‘Switch trials’, the box is rotated before the child can respond. To produce the correct response, the child must now withhold responding to the previously correct location(s) and flexibly orient to the new solution. The task was administered to 156 10-month-olds and 110 16-month-olds, with 87 participants assessed longitudinally. Participants were less accurate and had slower reaction times during Switch trials, suggesting that the switches successfully increased CF load. Additionally, 16-month-olds made quicker and more accurate responses than 10-month-olds. We also found evidence of longitudinal stability in task performance between the two ages. Performance on the Shapes Task did not correlate with a well-validated response inhibition task, suggesting that individual differences in Shapes performance is not driven by inhibitory control abilities. Our data suggest that the Shapes Task is an adequate measure of CF abilities in infants and toddlers, and as such is a valuable new addition to the developmental researcher’s toolkit.\nKeywords: Cognitive Flexibility, Executive Functions, Longitudinal, New Task, Infancy, Toddlerhood",

Verbal instructions and self-talk have been shown to facilitate task performance more efficiently than written instruction, reducing the need to visually translate the information received into phonological representations. To analyse the effect of modality of instruction further, this study explores the influence of verbal and written instruction on cognitive performance in a task-switching test between two groups of different levels of general anxiety, utilising the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3). No major differences between the low and high anxiety groups was noted, and both groups showed lower reaction times and higher accuracy in the auditory instructions condition compared to the visual instructions. These findings support the conclusion that verbal instruction assists in mitigating cognitive load further emphasising its role in enhancing cognitive efficiency.

          "abstract": "Knowing the truth is rarely enough---we also ask ``why?'' While much is known about how we explain contingent and probabilistic facts, far less is known about we explain necessary truths, such as those in mathematics, where the outcomes follow by logical deduction rather than causation. We present a framework, inspired by computational complexity, to make sense of how this happens: because cognition is resource-bounded, people prefer explanations that (1) reduce the cost of discovering the conclusion or (2) mark points of cognitive load where contemplation concentrates. In a series of three experiments with n=838 participants using SAT problems, we show how these motives serve as strong and significant predictors of explanatory preferences in both purely abstract logic problems (Study One), and in problems where the underlying logic is presented in the style of classic detective stories (Studies Two and Three, the latter preregistered). When story framings are used, preferences for causal drivers appear, but do not displace the the computational ones. Our results demonstrate that cognitive resource limitations are central to explanation-making; they can both coexist with causal explanation and can yield satisfying reasons-why judgments even in the absence of cause.",

          "authors": "Ivan Ivanovich Ivanchei; Inès Mentec; Axel Cleeremans",
          "abstract": "An important question in affective science is whether valence assignment, i.e., evaluating a perceived object as positive or negative, occurs after perception or whether it is intrinsic to it. Recent theories propose that valence assignment, or simply evaluation, may be embedded within conscious perception. To test this idea, we combined deep neural network (DNN) modeling with representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify which levels of visual processing contribute to valence assignment. Participants performed a forced-choice preference task, selecting one of three emotionally neutral everyday objects (e.g., cups, lamps) under varying instructions: no instruction, utility-based, aesthetic-based, and under time pressure. Perceived valence distances between objects were captured as representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) and compared with DNN activation distances across layers. Across studies, valence distances correlated with differences in the first DNN layer, reflecting low-level visual processing. However, this relationship could not be explained by individual features such as contrast or luminance, implying a more integrative perceptual basis. When choices involved objects from distinct categories, valence judgments primarily reflected perceived utility, yet aesthetic instructions biased them toward similar visual computations. These findings indicate that valence assignment is partially built into perceptual processing, with higher-level task demands flexibly shaping its expression. This supports a view of conscious perception as inherently valenced, yet context-sensitive.",

          "abstract": "Confidence exhibits systematic individual differences across mental health, gender, and age. However, it remains unknown whether these distinct sources of confidence (i.e., metacognitive) bias have common or distinct computational origins. To address this question, we studied the temporal evolution of underconfidence associated with individual differences in mental health and gender (N = 1447). We found that an underconfidence associated with anxiety symptoms became more prominent the longer individuals took to make metacognitive judgments – suggesting that it is exacerbated by additional time for introspection. In contrast, gender-related underconfidence decreased with greater metacognitive judgment time – suggesting that additional time for introspection is able to remediate prepotent biases. A novel dynamic computational model of confidence explained these effects – while both gender and anxiety symptoms involved shifts in confidence criteria, only anxiety symptoms involved a temporal accumulation of negatively-biased evidence about one’s ability. Our study reveals multiple computational pathways to the formation of underconfidence, in turn highlighting specific potential mechanisms for its remediation.",

          "abstract": "The increasing use of computer-generated speech in various applications has raised questions about how people perceive synthetic voices. This study investigates the role of linguistic information in the perception of humanness in speech. We conducted two experiments with native German-, Spanish- and Turkish-speaking participants who rated the human-likeness of human and text-to-speech (TTS)-generated voices. By presenting German sentences as well as manipulated versions of those sentences in terms of syntax and semantics, we examined the role of three types of linguistic information, that is, phonetics, semantics, and syntax, on humanness perception. Acoustic analyses revealed differences between human and TTS-generated voices in terms of summary acoustics and dynamic contours of pitch and intensity, thus showing that TTS-generated voices are not yet fully aligned with human voices on voice quality and prosody. Importantly, behavioral results showed that these acoustic differences were more salient to native German listeners, who distinguished between human and synthetic voices more extremely. In addition to the role of phonetic or phonological familiarity, we observed a role of both syntax and semantics in humanness perception, with the manipulated sentences sounding less human regardless of the speaker (i.e., TTS-generated or human), but only for the native speakers. Lastly, humanness perception of speech appears to be relatively idiosyncratic as indicated by the individual differences observed. Altogether, this study contributes to our understanding of the interplay between linguistic and paralinguistic information in speech perception, and clarifies how listeners perceive their increasingly synthetically-generated soundscape.",

To effectively champion sustainable practices, children's understanding of sustainability and social equity, especially concerning emerging technologies like social robots, must first be established. In this paper, we systematically investigated children’s understanding of robot sustainability and social equity through a mixed-methods survey study and a focus group study with 107 children aged 10-16 years. Our findings show that children’s understanding of sustainability and social equity informs a critical stance toward robots, with more knowledgeable children demanding higher standards. Our results contribute to the literature by shifting the discourse on educational robots toward sustainability, providing a foundational understanding of children's perspectives, and informing the design of future technologies and curricula to foster a more responsible and equitable future.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

Bistable visual stimuli, in particular, have long been used to study neurological and cognitive processes. However, many experimental paradigms rely on self-report to assess subjective perceptual experiences, introducing potential issues such as low reliability and interferences of reporting into the processes under investigation. No-report paradigms serve as a method to work around these problems by decoding perceptual content based on physiological data. Here we discuss the strengths and pitfalls of no-report paradigms in the context of research using multistable perception. Focusing on experimental power related to decoding accuracy, we exemplify the current progress of decoding perceptual content using three major domains of physiological data (eye-tracking, M/EEG and fMRI). We find that the predictability of the percept varies significantly depending on the paradigm and stimulus type, showcasing both the potential and limitations of physiological inference in bistable perception research.",

          "abstract": "Domestic Violence affects 1 in 3 women worldwide. Empirical evidence from India suggests that women and girls experience a continuum of violence and discrimination from prenatal stages till death in families that largely continue to operate within a dominantly patriarchal framework. However, quantitative literature on domestic violence in India suffers from problems pertaining to reductive and episodic framing, focusing on short-term prevalence, and frames the impact on survivors largely in terms of clinical constructs such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. This work argues for a broader, thematic framing of domestic and familial violence and contends that the psychological sequelae of this kind of chronic and systemic discrimination and violence cannot be captured using rigid clinical constructs that dominate psychological literature. We propose a conceptual framework utilizing case studies that is loosely and partially aligned with the tenets of complex trauma. However, we also critique its origin within hegemonic psychiatry that led to yet another diagnostic construct and highlight the need for creating a culturally adapted expansion—to shift the emphasis from an individually rooted, diagnostic framework to a continuous trauma framework that allows researchers to dissect the psychological alterations in survivors of domestic violence in a non-clinical and contextual manner.",

          "abstract": "Number word learning offers a unique window into the nature of cognition. Number words are not only abstract in nature, but they are defined by their participation in a rich system of logical inferences that transcend our perceptual experience of the world. Numerate children as young as 5 years of age can reason about relations between large exact number words despite being unable to perceptually discriminate the quantities they represent. And they can reason about infinite magnitudes, despite never having experienced them. How do these intuitions arise in cognition if not through the senses? Although developmental psychologists have made remarkable progress in documenting the stages according to which children learn number words and the principles that govern their use, the cognitive origins of this knowledge remains poorly understood. I argue that strong nativist accounts lack a workable causal theory that describes the role that innate primitives might play during development and actual learning episodes. I then reconsider constructivist accounts that seek to explain how children might create new representational resources that have greater expressive power than precursor states.",

Numerous studies have indicated that specific personality traits may be associated with heightened motivation to explore or solve tasks. Nevertheless, this relationship remains unexplored within the genus Gorilla. In our study, we investigated the association between personality, interest, and performance in a cognitive enrichment task among 17 zoo-housed western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). The experimental task involved retrieving food from a tube presented in a social context. Each session consisted of a 30-minute recording of a gorilla performing the task, with a total of three sessions per individual. We conducted personality assessments using the Gorilla Behavior Index questionnaire, which comprised 25 adjectives. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors that accounted for 76% of the variance. We found positive associations between Maternal factor and the variable of success (first success), and negative associations between Maternal and Extraversion with success rate. However, we did not find a link between the personality factors and interest. Additionally, we observed that repeated exposure to the task improved gorillas’ performance. Females showed greater efficiency in food extraction compared to males. Furthermore, younger individuals achieved higher success rates than older ones. Thus, our findings suggest that personality, sex and age play an important role in explaining gorillas' performance in solving tasks.",

To prevent generation of potentially harmful output and recommendations, most publicly accessible LLMs have implemented safeguards that are triggered when users ask for illegal content or proscribed groups. However, these models are pre-trained on data from the internet that may contain connections between benign and more extreme content and communities. Therefore, users may ask for seemingly innocuous content about alternative communities but receive potentially radicalizing output. To investigate this possibility, we conducted an experiment with two publicly available, widely used LLMs (OpenAI GPT 4o and Google Gemini). We systematically manipulated the nature of prompts asking for summarization of relatively benign content about the Tradwives community during a multi-turn conversation (N = 896). We show that benign prompts, especially those that involve roleplay and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), can bypass safeguards and expose users to potentially radicalizing content and connections. The implication is that even with guardrails in place and users not intending to seek illegal content, LLMs could play a role in the radicalization process.",

          "abstract": "Reading anxiety is the fear of reading and is theorized to be negatively associated with reading achievement. An inability to engage in reading due to either low reading achievement or high reading anxiety could be debilitating. Research on reading anxiety and its association with reading achievement has existed since the 1980s. However, this has been an area of rapidly increasing investigation in recent years. The goal of the present preregistered meta-analysis was to determine the strength of the association between reading anxiety and reading achievement. Through systematic screening of the published and unpublished literature, 64 studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis (totaling 180 effect sizes and 14,467 participants). The included studies were conducted in 14 countries and 11 languages. Analyses were performed using random effects models, accounting for dependent effect sizes via robust variance estimation. A moderate negative average weighted correlation was found between reading anxiety and reading achievement (r = -0.30). Significant heterogeneity across effect sizes was found (Q = 996, p &lt; .001, I2 = 82). Learning disability status, gender, reading domain, and age were not significant moderators. The association between reading anxiety and reading achievement has implications for the fields of psychology and education, specifically in efforts to promote people’s reading achievement while maintaining their socioemotional well-being. Future research using experimental and longitudinal designs is needed to determine the direction of any causal influences between reading anxiety and reading achievement. This would improve suggestions that can be made on how to support people struggling with their reading anxiety and reading achievement.",

The package provides a unified and minimalistic interface that covers all essential stages of predictive modeling, including data preprocessing, model construction, hyperparameter optimization, and sensitivity analysis. MLwrap supports a range of widely used algorithms, such as Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and XGBoost Decision Trees, and incorporates evidence-based default hyperparameter ranges to facilitate robust model selection. The workflow is organized into four core functions: preprocessing(), build_model(), fine_tuning(), and sensitivity_analysis(), which together streamline the entire ML pipeline and encapsulate all steps within a single, reproducible analysis object. Through two illustrative examples using the included sim_data dataset, this paper demonstrates the application of MLwrap to both regression and classification tasks, highlighting its capacity to simplify complex workflows and provide interpretable results. The package aims to empower analysts and researchers, especially in the health, social and behavioral sciences, to efficiently extract actionable insights from data while ensuring transparency and reproducibility in their analyses.

No study before has investigated the longitudinal development of early joint attention (JA) behaviours in preterms. The current study examined the growth of early JA behaviours and the relation with later language skills in preterms.\nMethods: This prospective longitudinal study examined the development of early JA skills between 10 and 24 months in 51 preterms. The Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS) were administered at the corrected ages of 10, 18 and 24 months. At each age, infants’ JA behaviours and coordinated vocalisations were coded. At 36 months, language skills were evaluated by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.\nResults: We found that most JA behaviours (basic or advanced, regardless of coordinated vocalisations were considered) developed between 10 and 18 months in preterms. Only basic initiating behaviours did not seem to increase, with even a decrease for basic initiating JA (IJA). Response to JA behaviour was the only skill with a continued increase in frequency between 18 and 24 months. When investigating JA behaviours (at 10 months, and growth between 10-18 and 18-24 months) as predictors of language, only 10-months advanced IJA behaviours emerged as predictor of receptive language.\nConclusion: JA development in preterms mainly occurs between 10 and 18 months, but we emphasise the large observed inter-individual heterogeneity in JA development. Frequency of (advanced) IJA behaviours seem to contribute more to later language than initiating behavioural requests, possibly because these behaviours elicit more language learning opportunities.",

          "abstract": "Listeners rapidly form first impressions from voices, inferring multiple person characteristics within milliseconds. We employed a novel method, Self-Steered Sound Synthesis (S4), to identify and compare the acoustic signatures underlying these impressions. Participants interactively used S4 to synthesise voices expressing six person characteristics - age, masculinity, health, attractiveness, dominance, and trustworthiness - by manipulating four perceptually salient acoustic dimensions: mean pitch, pitch excursion, breathiness, and formant spacing. Masculinity, older age, and dominance were conveyed by lowering mean pitch and formant spacing, consistent with projecting the impression of a large person, and flattening the intonation. Physical health, attractiveness, and trustworthiness were conveyed by choosing less extreme and more \"typical\" acoustic properties. A second perceptual experiment confirmed that the synthesised voices from Experiment 1 indeed conveyed the intended person characteristics to an independent sample of listeners, and that listeners relied on similar acoustic cues for their evaluations. From a methodological perspective, we draw similar conclusions from two drastically different approaches, thus providing a comprehensive account of first impression formation that bridges across voice production (or synthesis) and perception. Our converging findings furthermore demonstrate the methodological robustness of S4. From a theoretical perspective, our findings furthermore extend theoretical frameworks that conceptualise first impressions within a continuous “trait space”, highlighting the graded and intercorrelated nature of different person characteristics on a perceptual and conceptual level. We extend this framework by showing that not only perceptual judgments, but also the acoustic signatures of person characteristics show intercorrelations, thus integrating acoustic cues into perceptual models of voice perception.",

In the current study, we used network analysis to explore the relationships between different psychosocial risk factors and depression across adolescence, a period characterised by marked social, psychological and physiological change. Using data collected from adolescents aged 11-18 years (n = 202), we estimated two networks - one focusing on depression severity and the other on individual core symptoms of depression (low mood and anhedonia) - and investigated the features of the networks, including the associations relating to depression, changes to network structure across adolescence and the centrality of different risk factors. Emotion regulation difficulties and perceived stress were among the most central in the network and showed some of the strongest associations with both depression severity and presence of individual core symptoms. The network structure was largely stable across adolescence but the quality of school environment and depression severity did become more strongly related with increasing age.

          "abstract": "Learning about others’ personality traits is crucial for building personal relationships. This learning process can be conceptualized as reductions in prediction errors (PE), i.e., the differences between expectations about other persons and their subsequent feedback. Pupil dilation has been established as an important marker of various non-social learning processes. However, it remains unclear if pupil dilation also relates to PEs in abstract social learning processes. To test this, we conducted a pilot experiment and a pre-registered main experiment where participants were instructed to learn about the traits of other people (i.e., learning profiles) or about a self-profile, a profile that reflected the participant’s own trait ratings. We hypothesized that pupil size reflects PEs during social learning. We applied linear mixed-effects (LME) models to the behavioral data to test whether absolute PEs decreased over time. In the main experiment, we observed a significant reduction in absolute PEs, indicating successful learning. We then used LME models for the pupillometry data to test the relationship between absolute PEs and pupil dilation. In both experiments, larger absolute PEs were associated with larger pupil dilation on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect remained robust after controlling for confounding variables such as signed PEs and feedback. As expected, learning about the self-profile yielded smaller absolute PEs compared to other-profiles, and this was accompanied by reduced pupil dilation. Taken together, these findings suggest that pupil dilation scales with error magnitude and represents a critical physiological index of personality trait learning about others.",

          "abstract": "We have recently found that people remember bigger images more than smaller images during naturalistic-like encoding. Since these findings were established with accuracy levels which may be confounded by response biases, and since memory performance was apparently low, here we addressed these issues. In a new set of experiments (n=199), we estimated accuracy to test replication of our earlier findings, dprime memory-sensitivity that accounts for potential response biases (criterion), and RT-based ROC measures. Our findings, consistent across experiments, that overall memory as estimated by dprime and ROC-based analyses was significantly above chance, indicate that information was encoded and learnt. Furthermore, larger images (in the 3 to15.5 degrees range) were better remembered as evident in dprime and accuracy. Memory for 1.5 degrees images did not differ from that of 3degrees images and memory for images bigger than 15.5 degrees dropped, likely reflecting limitations of display size. Memorability also increased with image size. Our findings provide converging measures supporting the idea that image size plays an important role in image memory during naturalistic encoding for images in the size range of 3 to 15.5 degrees. Our study also emphasizes the importance of testing an effect across multiple measures and methods.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

Through semi-structured interviews, we asked a broad sample of 24 German school teachers about their personal mastery goals for professional learning and the degree to which goal pursuit was based on “wanting to” and “needing to”. Two raters coded the goals using an established category system (κ = .74). Learning approach and task approach goals were mentioned most frequently, but learning avoidance and task avoidance goals also occurred. Each of the four mastery goals was pursued because of “wanting to” (as a meaningful end-state in itself, including authentic interests and intrinsic enjoyment) and/or “needing to” (e.g., as a requirement or precondition for accomplishment and external pressures and obligations) reasons. Findings provide ecological support for the existence of (mastery) goal complexes, and suggest “wanting to” and “needing to” as a psychologically meaningful distinction.",

          "abstract": "This review includes studies that evaluate the effects of group-based interventions to support the social reintegration of marginalized adults who suffer from both mental illness and other problems when compared with an individually delivered intervention. A total of 62 studies were identified. 61 of these were assessed to be of sufficient methodological quality to be included in the data synthesis, but only 49 studies could be used in meta-analysis, as we could not compute effect sizes for 12 studies. The studies spanned the period from 2000 to 2022 and were carried out in the OECD countries. Most interventions lasted less than a year, and the effects of the interventions were all measured within the first year after the end of the interventions. The included studies were mostly randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Notably, close to half of the RCTs had been preregistered. All included studies had a well-defined control group. The 49 studies included in the meta-analyses included 349 effect sizes and involved participants with various mental illnesses and indicators of social marginalization. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders were the most common mental health conditions (36 studies), while substance use was the most frequently reported co-occurring issue (13 studies). Most participants faced multiple challenges related to social exclusion. The interventions varied but were most commonly group-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (11 studies). \n\nAcross a range of meta-regression analyses, the majority of analyses showed overall positive effects of group-based interventions, regardless of the type of measurement, though not all individual results were statistically significant. The two main analyses regarding the overall average effect size, one examining social reintegration outcomes and the other focusing on mental health outcomes, both showed statistically significant benefits of group-based interventions. The random effects weighted standardized mean difference for short-term outcomes was 0.195 standard deviation (SD), 95% CI[0.122, 0.268] for the meta-analysis using all social reintegration outcomes, and the random effects weighted standardized mean difference was 0.215 SD, 95% CI[0.090, 0.340] for the meta-analysis using all mental health outcomes. This corresponds to treatment effects that are approximately 2.3 and 1.4 times greater than the typical improvements observed with usual care in reintegration and mental health outcomes, respectively.\n\nA unique characteristic of this body of literature is that close to half of the studies represent preregistered studies. When analyzing this group of studies only, we still found a substantial and statistically significant effect of group-based intervention when compared to no or usual individual treatments. Overall, the findings were robust across all sensitivity and publication bias analyses, further increasing confidence in the evidence base.",

          "abstract": "Graphical models have become an important method for studying the network structure of multivariate psychological data. Accurate recovery of the underlying network structure is paramount and requires that the models are appropriate for the data at hand. Traditionally, Gaussian graphical models for continuous data and Ising models for binary data have dominated the literature. However, psychological research often relies on ordinal data from Likert scale items, creating a model-data mismatch. This paper examines the effect of dichotomizing ordinal variables on network recovery, as opposed to analyzing the data at its original level of measurement, using a Bayesian analysis of the ordinal Markov random field model. This model is implemented in the R package bgms. Our analysis shows that dichotomization results in a loss of information, which affects the accuracy of network recovery. This is particularly true when considering the interplay between the dichotomization cutoffs used and the distribution of the ordinal categories. In addition, we show that there is a difference in accuracy when using dichotomized data depending on whether edges are included or excluded in the true network, highlighting the effectiveness of using the ordinal model in recovering conditional independence relationships. These findings underscore the importance of using models that deal directly with ordinal data to ensure more reliable and valid inferred network structures in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Value-based decision-making is regulated by a delicate interplay of instrumental and Pavlovian controllers. Here we assessed the role of catecholamines in this interplay. We investigated the effects of the catecholamine reuptake inhibitor methylphenidate (MPH) in 100 healthy subjects using a combined appetitive and aversive Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm including approach and withdrawal actions. By administering the drug after learning, our design allowed us to establish that MPH can also bias action outside a learning context by directly modulating the expression of motivational bias on instrumental action rather than by only modulating instrumental learning bias. In line with previous results, the effect of MPH on bias varied across individuals as a function of their working memory span capacity. By assessing both approach and withdrawal actions, we revealed that MPH enhanced not only the invigorating effect of appetitive Pavlovian cues on active approach, but also the inhibitory effect of appetitive cues on active withdrawal, the invigorating effect of aversive cues on active withdrawal, and the inhibitory effect of aversive cues on active approach. Thus, in participants with high working memory capacity, MPH boosted both approach and withdrawal PIT. Taken together, this pattern of effects is most consistent with the hypothesis that MPH modulates the cognitive control of Pavlovian biasing in a baseline-state-dependent manner, in line with the well-established inverted-U shaped relationship between catecholamine receptor stimulation in prefrontal cortex, and cognitive control.",

          "abstract": "Ample findings suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) collaborate in solving cognitive conflict. The ACC is assumed to register and signal ongoing conflicts and errors. In contrast, the DLPFC is thought to implement (the signalled need for) cognitive control. Yet, the precise temporal and thus functional interactions between the two regions remain poorly understood. Here, we probed the role of ACC-to-DLPFC interactions in error processing through concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) while participants (n=38) performed a complex, error-prone task. Specifically, we applied online triple-pulse TMS over the right DLPFC (versus an active TMS control) in a 200 ms window after a behavioural response, targeting the period of error-related ACC activation. Our aim was to interfere with DLPFC at the time of error processing and/ or signal transmission from the ACC and assess the impact on related neural (i.e., the error-related negativity; Ne/ERN) and behavioural measures, such as post-error slowing (PES) and post-error accuracy (PEA). Additionally, we assessed EEG-predictors (i.e., CNV) of behavioural adjustments in the inter-trial interval (ITI). While no main effects of DLPFC-TMS were found on individual measures, we observed significant changes in the relationships between neural (Ne/ERN, ITI) and behavioural (PES, PEA) markers depending on the TMS condition.\nThese findings indicate that DLPFC stimulation influenced the strategy of behavioural adaptation rather than its magnitude, highlighting the DLPFC’s role in implementing cognitive control. Our results further point to the pre-stimulus time as a key window for translating neural error signals into adaptive behaviour. Our study underlines the usefulness of combining time-sensitive neuroimaging and stimulation methods to unravel the functional interplay between neuronal and behavioural markers of adaptive cognition.",

Mean differences in survey constructs across behaviors were analyzed, and predictive pathways were estimated using robust structural equation modelling.\nResults: Nicotine pouches were viewed more favorably than vapes or cigarettes. Nicotine use was more common among older youth, though less so for vaping. Male gender was more strongly associated with pouch use than with vaping or smoking. Health literacy, but not socioeconomic status, was consistently associated with all behaviors. Across products, affective attitudes were the strongest correlates, while instrumental attitudes showed no significant effects. Friend-group subjective and descriptive norms exerted stronger effects than family norms, with friend norms especially predictive of smoking.\nConclusions: Some determinants generalized across behaviors, while others varied by product. Affective attitudes and friend-group norms emerged as key cross-cutting influences, whereas gendered patterns and normative salience differed by product. Tailored prevention and harm-reduction strategies should address both shared and behavior-specific determinants of youth nicotine use.",

However, this approach is exceptionally costly due to the limited number of experts, the time and resources required for training them, and the high task burden. To overcome these barriers and expedite creativity research, computational automation of creativity assessment has been explored. We provide an overview of recent developments in computational creativity assessment methods, including techniques based on artificial intelligence (such as large language models) and semantic distance. Leveraging these modern machine-learning approaches, computational creativity assessment methods have enabled automatic scoring across various tasks—from simple idea generation to complex problem-solving and artistic expressions—often matching human rater agreement. These methods also have the potential to automatically generate new creativity tests (“automated item generation”) and can be used to detect invalid responses (i.e., random/task-irrelevant ideas), thereby ensuring assessment integrity for high-stakes applications. We discuss the current challenges and potential future directions, such as improving the interpretability and explainability of automated scoring, and a complementary approach centered around evaluating mental processes leading to creativity.",

          "abstract": "One of the most striking features of human consciousness is its ability to foster an ongoing, seemingly continuous stream of thought. Prior studies have provided valuable insights into the neural correlates of the content of thought (e.g., whether it is task related or not). However, independent of its content, the stream of thought can also be characterized by its dynamics—how it changes over time. The Dynamic Framework of Thought proposes a neural model of how different large-scale brain networks may contribute to thoughts that are freely moving (spontaneous) or deliberately constrained. We empirically tested this model using a neurophenomenological approach, in which participants reported the nature of their thought stream in real time during fMRI scanning. Consistent with the model predictions, freely-moving thought was associated with greater activation of the default network (especially the medial-temporal subcomponent) than the frontoparietal control network, whereas deliberately constrained thought was associated with the opposite pattern of activation. Additionally, these distinct thought dynamics were reflected in the changes in the functional coupling patterns within and between these networks. These findings suggest that experience sampling, in conjunction with fMRI, can illuminate the neural basis of subtle thought dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to profoundly reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Using large-scale survey data (N = 37,097; 38 European countries), we find that the public predominantly views AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for a large set of technology-related, political, and socio-demographic factors, we further find that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Drawing on nationally representative, preregistered experimental data (N = 400; United States), we provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democratic institutions and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may erode democratic legitimacy and discourage public involvement in shaping the future of AI.",

However, the nature of these alterations remains unclear, and it is debated whether reduced sensitivity to reward is a general phenomenon, specific to social contexts, or exists at all. Evidence for reduced sensitivity to reward primarily comes from neurobiological studies, yet it remains uncertain how these findings translate to autistic behavior. A key challenge in addressing this question lies in assessing and comparing behavioral responses to reward between autistic and non-autistic groups. Here, we addressed this issue by investigating the integration of monetary reward information into behavior through the framework of Bayesian perceptual decision-making, enabling a quantitative evaluation of the direct contribution of reward to decision-making. Autistic (n = 32) and non-autistic (n = 48) participants performed an orientation categorization task, while the monetary reward given per correct answer varied across categories. Using signal-detection theory, we estimated decision boundaries while accounting for sensory uncertainty and prior expectation. Our results reveal that autistic individuals adjust their decision boundaries in response to monetary reward in a suboptimal but typical manner. These findings challenge the hypothesis of generalized alteration of reward processing in autism.",

          "abstract": "Greed is linked to unethical behaviour, yet research on this relationship remains limited. This study examined how greed as a personality trait influences unethical behaviour, focus-ing on moral disengagement and moral identity. Participants (N=500) completed measures of greed, moral disengagement, and moral identity, along with a bribery acceptance task in Greek (native) and English (second language). Results showed that greed increased unethi-cal behaviour, with moral disengagement partially mediating this link by justifying immor-al actions. Moral identity moderated both the direct and indirect effects, weakening greed’s influence on unethical behaviour. Bribery acceptance was higher in the second language. These findings highlight the psychological mechanisms connecting greed, moral disen-gagement and unethical behaviour and emphasize the protective role of moral identity. A deeper understanding of these processes can contribute to the development of strategies aimed at reducing unethical conduct across different contexts.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Trust in Large Language Models (LLMs) is common. This trust is explained by LLMs’ highly fluent – fast and coherent – output. A recent spate of reports about psychotic delusions caused by LLMs shows that this trust in LLMs is risky and misplaced. As I will argue, it is not even trust in the robust sense of the term. LLM-induced delusion is a variant of a well-known phenomenon called induced delusion or folie à deux, where delusions are socially transmitted. Drawing on this phenomenon, I argue that when a user takes themselves to trust a LLM, they are actually only trusting themselves, but this self-trust is cloaked by the LLM’s agent-like nature. Given the considerable epistemic and moral hazards of this cloaked self-trust, we should discourage talk of trust in LLMs and avoid acting as if we trusted them.",

But how good are current funding allocation processes at effectively identifying and supporting research ideas that will end up contributing to societal good? In this primer, we address the critical challenge of assessing the effectiveness of funding allocation procedures by treating the selection process as a diagnostic procedure and applying psychometric tools to its assessment. We highlight an apparent disconnect between the mission of funding beneficial research and prevailing practices in funding allocation, emphasizing a lack of understanding regarding how to measure and predict the quality of research proposals. We advocate for greater transparency in funding decision processes, and for empirical investigations of how funding systems may yield optimal outcomes under existing constraints and objectives.",

          "abstract": "Atypical metacognition has been suggested to underlie autistic phenotypes, given its role in social cognition and behavioural flexibility. However, no study has quantitatively assessed metacognitive abilities in autism. Here, we measured meta-uncertainty—the noise corrupting the estimates of one’s own decision uncertainty—in autism. In three experiments, autistic and non-autistic participants (N = 145) performed orientation categorisation tasks while simultaneously reporting their choice confidence. By independently manipulating each Bayesian component—sensory uncertainty, prior, and reward—and fitting a recently established process model, we assessed metacognitive abilities and their contingency on the Bayesian components while controlling for first-order decisions. Unlike non-autistic participants, autistic participants’ meta-uncertainty depended on which decision component was manipulated, and was lower than that of non-autistic participants specifically when decisions were adjusted for sensory uncertainty. These findings reveal that metacognition in autism is not generally reduced but rather enhanced for inferences that rely primarily on sensory information.",

          "abstract": "Humans can flexibly organize their behavior to pursue hierarchically structured goals, dynamically updating their commitment to goals and their concomitant subgoals in response to changes in environmental contingencies. Through a novel hierarchical goal selection paradigm, we investigate human persistence patterns in goal and subgoal pursuit, especially in the presence of varying subgoal prospects. We observe that humans exhibit a depth-first commitment to hierarchical goals, preferring to persist on a goal--subgoal pair until termination rather than the breadth-first approach of alternating between subgoals within a goal. We also show that this depth-first persistence in goals and subgoals is modulated by goal and subgoal progress, respectively. We further demonstrate that a momentum-based account that parsimoniously estimates the values of ongoing goals explains depth-first patterns of persistence in hierarchically organized goals. We explicitly dissociate the effects of momentum computations from switching costs on goal persistence, and show that momentum computations drive persistence choices above and beyond dynamic costs imposed by switching goals and subgoals.",

          "abstract": "As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) rapidly becomes more sophisticated and more widespread, understanding the impact of its perceived humanness on trust is increasingly important. Previous work has shown that anthropomorphism increases the perceived trustworthiness of an agent as an advisor, but here we asked whether it might also impact the trustworthiness of informational communications it produces in a non-advisory role. In two experiments, participants read a science communication blog post attributed to a GenAI with varying levels of anthropomorphic cues. They were asked to report the trustworthiness of both the agent and the content it produced. In Experiment 1 (N = 270), anthropomorphic cues in a description of the author directly increased author trust but not content trust. However, anthropomorphism appears positively correlated with both author and content trust due to the positive correlation between author and content trust. Experiment 2 (N = 144) replicated these findings using a more immersive design: participants chatted with a GenAI chatbot presented as the author of the blog. Partial correlations revealed that the effect of anthropomorphism on author trust explains much of the correlation between anthropomorphism and content trust in Experiment 1 but less so in Experiment 2. These effects reveal a dissociation between the perceived trustworthiness of the author and the content, suggesting that anthropomorphic cues may directly impact the former, but not the latter. Additionally, the salience of the GenAI author may impact the cognitive mechanisms involved in these trustworthiness judgments.",

In this study, we created an intervention to increase student motivation and engagement using previously derived longitudinal data from our target population. We selected six teacher behaviors that best predicted student engagement in two subjects, physical education (PE) and mathematics, among Grade 7 students. We tested a 12-hour mostly-online teacher professional learning intervention in a prospectively registered, single-blinded, cluster-randomised controlled trial. From 30 participating schools, 1,969 students could be matched to one of the 129 teachers who provided consent (71 PE and 58 mathematics teachers). Employing a multiverse analytical approach, we found the intervention significantly increased psychological need satisfaction in most analyses. We found no robust effects on student engagement or other self-reported variables (attitudes toward PE, student use of approach or avoidance goals, or the perceived value of mathematics). Effects on achievement were mixed. We observed positive effects on PE achievement, with increased self-reported physical activity corresponding to an extra 0.43 days of activity per week. There were no significant effects on mathematics achievement. While we did not significantly increase engagement itself, this light-touch professional learning intervention was able to increase proximal predictors of motivation and engagement.",

          "authors": "Daphne Xin Hou; Stuti Thapa; Louis Tay",
          "abstract": "Past research on cross-cultural equivalence has focused on statistical procedures and techniques for ensuring measurement equivalence in tests and surveys. With the rise of big data and machine learning(ML), particularly natural language processing (NLP), researchers have powerful tools to study culture using large-scale, organic language data from social media. However, the lack of methodological guidance on how to establish cross-language equivalence in cross-cultural studies, especially with multilingual or culturally diverse text data, poses a major challenge. To address this gap, this paper proposes a framework to raise awareness of key equivalence challenges and offer practical guidance for reducing measurement biases when applying ML techniques to social media language data. The framework outlines five types of equivalence following the ML pipeline from data collection to evaluation: source equivalence, sample equivalence, input equivalence, psychological ground truth equivalence, and model performance equivalence. We also draw parallels with survey-based research to highlight shared conceptual challenges and identify future directions for advancing cross-cultural research with big data and computational linguistic methods.",

A preliminary validation of its effectiveness was conducted using two typical examples of gender-stereotyped occupations: “doctor = male” and “florist = female.” The test was administered to 70 undergraduate students (41 males and 29 females). The results indicated that no clear gender stereotype was detected for “doctor,” whereas a distinct feminine stereotype was observed for “florist.” Although further verification using other occupations is necessary, the findings suggest that the adult version of the gFUMIE test is effective in detecting gender stereotypes. Furthermore, developing a children’s version of the gFUMIE test based on the same principle, it will become possible to measure gender stereotypes in younger children and to provide a new method for studying the development of gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Parents are often said to see their grown-up children as kids—but does this reflect a genuine perceptual bias? This study tested whether mothers perceive their adult daughters’ faces as younger than their chronological age and compared these judgments with the daughters’ self-perceptions. Each mother–daughter pair viewed systematically aged or rejuvenated images of the daughter’s face. In a facial-age judgment task, participants indicated whether each image appeared younger or older than the target’s actual appearance. In a morph-identity rating task, they rated how much each image resembled the target’s real face. Both groups exhibited a youth bias, but it was significantly larger among mothers. Moreover, mothers judged younger morphs as more representative of their daughters’ identity, consistent with enduring parental representations anchored in memories of earlier developmental stages. These results suggest that facial age perception can be shaped by the observer’s relational history and motivational dynamics—parents may, quite literally, see their children through the lens of the past.",

However, daily processes related to conflict and positive and negative affect have been overlooked. We tested the mutual effects between parent-adolescent conflict and affect in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries between 14 to 21 days to rate their positive and negative affect, and conflict interactions between October 2021 and August 2023. The participants were mostly from families with high socioeconomic status, most of the parents were biological mothers, and over half of the parents were Caucasian. Adolescents were between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.37, SD = 1.28). We tested the daily associations between negative/positive affect and conflict interactions in one dynamic structural equation model (DSEM). Contrary to our expectations, greater adolescent negative affect on a day was associated with lower parent-reported conflict next day. Further, both within- and between-family level correlations between adolescent and parent negative and positive affect were significant. Greater parent and adolescent conflict was related to lower positive and greater negative affect for parents and adolescents. Thus, while both same-day and mean-level associations over time indicate that conflicts are linked to poorer affective well-being, and parents may have made efforts to improve their affect the following day in an attempt to compensate for the conflicts experienced the day before. Further, this effort was appeared to be driven by the adolescents’ rather than the parents’ emotional experiences.",

          "abstract": "Despite being nearly universal, boredom has only recently emerged as a serious topic within human factors psychology, especially in the context of human-in-the-loop (HiL) systems. Once dismissed as trivial, boredom is now recognized as a dynamic emotion marked by disengagement, with real consequences for human performance while monitoring systems in air travel; nuclear power; and healthcare. This study explores the onset of boredom by examining undergraduate participants engaged in boredom inducing natural activities. Participants reported their boredom and typically sought relief through smartphones, mirroring everyday coping behaviors. Results showed a wide variation in boredom onset times, with some participants reporting boredom within 1 minute and others within 17 minutes. Participants’ own metacognitive estimates of boredom proved more reliable than standard boredom measures. Neither trait nor state self-report scales consistently predicted how quickly someone would become bored in real-world situations. This challenges the validity of traditional boredom assessments and highlights the complexity of individual boredom profiles. The findings underline that as automation reduces workload and vigilance demands in critical HiL fields, understanding and measuring boredom becomes increasingly important for preventing error and designing safer systems. Metacognitive assessment may be a pragmatic tool for identifying boredom-prone individuals in applied settings, pending development of more robust objective measures.",

          "abstract": "Background: When confronted with ambiguous stimuli, the ability to utilize contextual information is crucial for survival. Context processing involves the ability to discriminate new information from previously encountered information, and to recognize something as previously encountered even briefly or partially. Deficits in context processing are a key feature across a number of psychiatric conditions. Existing tasks only examine discrimination and recognition of cues as opposed to contextual information. Thus, new tasks using complex scenes are urgently needed. \n\nObjective: We developed the Context Discrimination and Recognition Task (CDRT) and established baseline performance in healthy adults. \n\nMethod: 48 participants (mean age (M) = 30.27, standard deviation (SD) = 11.78) completed the CDRT to characterize memory performance for 1) discrimination between previously viewed and never viewed complex scenes (Discrete Discrimination Scores; DDS); 2) recognition of previously viewed complex scenes (Discrete Recognition Scores; DRS); 3) sensitivity to distinctions across a gradient of complex scenes (Width); and 4) bias in recognition of complex scenes (Bias). Pearson correlations were conducted to examine associations between these scores.\n\nResults: Results revealed a significant positive relationship between DDS and DRS scores, r(41) = 0.93, p &lt; 0.01, and between DDS and modified recognition scores (DRSmid), r(41) = 0.71, p &lt; 0.01. Width was also positively associated with DRS, r(41)= -0.32, p = 0.03, and DRSmid, r(41)= -0.32, p = 0.03.\n\nConclusion: We found that the CDRT is sensitive to a range of discrimination and recognition levels and is uniquely positioned to probe context processing. Additionally, both recognition and discrimination scores increased with decreased ambiguity of complex scenes, demonstrating sensitivity of the task in detecting variability of performance across participants. Better recognition of complex scenes was associated with greater sensitivity to differences between contexts. This novel task can be used to assess memory-associated processes for complex scenes in future studies aiming to elucidate neural function underlying context processing in psychiatric conditions.",

          "abstract": "Memory retrieval is guided by two complementary learning systems: an episodic memory system storing individual experiences, and a semantic knowledge system representing ‘things which go together’. While much is known about these structures in isolation, their interplay has been comparatively less studied. In this work we propose a spotlight-cascade model, which characterizes the interplay between these systems through two walks: a cascading walk in episodic space and an autocorrelated walk in semantic space. We combine these two walks in a spotlight-cascade model. This model is then validated through an online experiment in which participants travel to a fictive island and interact with 16 fantasy animals, dubbed Fennimals. Some of these Fennimals are encountered in the same region of the island (creating episodic groups), whilst some Fennimals share semantically similar heads and names (creating semantic groups). Participants are then asked to recall the names of these Fennimals. The experiment consisted of two between-subjects conditions. In the semantic spotlight condition, the semantic and episodic groups overlapped. In line with a predicted semantic spotlight effect, participants sequentially retrieved Fennimals along the imposed semantic structure. In the episodic jump condition, we then mixed these two groups, such that Fennimals in the same episodic group contained features from distinct semantic groups. In line with theoretical predictions based on our spotlight-cascade model, participants were now less likely to follow the semantic grouping structure when sequentially retrieving names – instead following a mixture of both semantic and episodic ties. These findings highlight that our novel model bridges both complementary learning systems and sheds a new light on previous models of memory retrieval. In addition, our findings suggest promising new directions of research into various topics in cognitive science.",

          "abstract": "Efficient language processing requires both the ability to predict as well as flexibly revise. Numerous studies have demonstrated that young children can make predictions during online language processing tasks, but less is known about their ability to quickly revise interpretations when initial predictions are infelicitous. Adults readily revise initial interpretations during language processing across linguistic domains—recovering from garden paths, adjusting to acoustic variation, and resolving lexical ambiguities. However, it is relatively unknown how revision mechanisms develop in early childhood, and, even more critically, how revision ability relates to the acquisition of language. We examined four- and five-year-olds’ (N=60) phonological revision abilities using an eye-tracking paradigm that captured children’s initial phonological interpretation of a word and subsequent revision and recovery. We characterized children’s processing along 11 distinct dimensions, and employed unsupervised clustering analyses to identify three distinct speech processing types among the children. Results showed substantial individual differences in processing strategies with different patterns of initial interpretation, as well as subsequent revision, underlying similar language outcomes. Processing type membership significantly predicted children’s vocabulary and pre-literacy skills, suggesting that phonological revision mechanisms may underpin multiple domains of language development. Overall, our findings align with both Bayesian inference and error-driven learning accounts where the probabilistic prediction and resolution of mismatches may drive language development across multiple linguistic domains.",

This study aimed to\ninvestigate whether automated analysis of naturalistic, child-centered audio recordings can index\nthe developmental trajectory of speech-language abilities from ages 3 to 5 years.\n\nMethods: A longitudinal design was employed with N=155 preschoolers, who were followed\nfrom age 3 to 5 years. Deep learning speech classification methods were used to compute\ncanonical proportion—the proportion of a child’s speech that is produced as canonical syllables\n(well-formed syllables with a consonant–vowel transition, such as “ba”), a key marker of speech\nmotor control development and phonological representation building—from child-centered audio\nrecordings collected at ages 3 and 4. Standardized lab-based assessments of speech and language\ndevelopment were administered one year later at ages 4 and 5.\n\nResults: Canonical proportion measures significantly predicted multiple dimensions of later\nspeech-language development. The strongest longitudinal associations were observed for\nconsonant articulation skill and vocabulary size. Weaker, though still significant, relationships\nwere found for meta-phonological skills, including phonological awareness and phonological\nworking memory.\n\nConclusion: Findings suggest that children’s spontaneous, everyday speech production\npatterns provide moderate indices of subsequent language development across multiple domains.\nAutomated measures such as canonical proportion hold promise for expanding and diversifying\napproaches to studying language acquisition and for complementing traditional lab-based\nassessments.",

          "abstract": "Music evokes strong emotions across listeners although it conveys no biologically relevant information regarding the survival challenges in the environment. Here we review the neurobiology and psychology of emotional communication through music, focussing on the functions and mechanisms of musical emotional expressions in social interaction and extend our analysis of the communicative space beyond the pure acoustic features to the interaction of musical emotional cues with other verbal and nonverbal communication channels. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies shows functional overlap for brain systems involved in music production and emotions. Musical emotion communication however differs from other common expressive channels (faces and bodies, utterances, and semantics) in its timescale, context, spontaneity and interactivity. Because musical emotional communication can be modulated by affective information communicated through other verbal and nonverbal channels, musical communication provides a flexible means for context-dependent and culturally malleable communication of emotions, which is particularly well suited for large-scale social affiliation and bonding.",

          "abstract": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been linked to altered coupling between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and regional BOLD signal within medial visceromotor/interoceptive networks. SSRI treatment strengthens this coupling without changing mean RSA (Shafer et al., 2015). Whether noninvasive neuromodulation of anterior medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can modulate this brain–heart linkage is unknown. Objective: Test whether repeated transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) targeting anterior mPFC enhances RSA–BOLD coupling in MDD and whether coupling relates to symptom change. Methods: Fourteen adults with MDD completed up to 11 tFUS sessions over ~3 weeks. Resting-state fMRI with simultaneous photoplethysmography (PPG) was acquired PRE and POST. A first-level RSA regressor (non-Hilbert; no HRF convolution) estimated per-TR RSA–BOLD covariation. Ten a-priori CAN/MVN ROIs (sgACC, rACC, dACC, vmPFC, rmPFC, left insula, left amygdala, left putamen, PAG, hypothalamus) were tested. Primary endpoint: across-ROI composite change in positive RSA–BOLD coupling (POST–PRE). Secondary ROI-wise and whole-brain parametric and non-parametric tests were performed; sensitivity analyses used an HRF-convolved Hilbert HRV regressor. Associations with HRSD, MADRS, BDI, PTQ, and VAS were explored. Results: The composite increased numerically but not significantly (Δ=+0.19 SD; 95% CI [−0.28, 0.66]; t(13)=0.88, p=.40; d=0.24); 9/14 participants showed higher POST values. No ROI-wise or whole-brain POST&gt;PRE effects survived FWE correction. Baseline small-volume–corrected effects replicated canonical coupling (left anterior insula positive; sgACC negative) but did not change with treatment. Mean RSA, RMSSD, and Hilbert HRV amplitude showed no significant session effects. Symptom-coupling correlations were uniformly non-significant after correction. Conclusions: In this uncontrolled pilot, anterior mPFC tFUS did not reliably increase RSA-BOLD coupling at the group level, despite replication of baseline neurovisceral patterns. Any tFUS-related modulation appears small and variable at this sample size. Larger, controlled studies with individualized targeting and parameter optimization are warranted.",

Building on prior pharmacological work, this study tested whether RMSSD, pNN50, SDNN, as well as exploratory Toichi nonlinear metrics index vagal activity during respiratory and pharmacological manipulation. Six healthy adults completed eleven 1-minute breathing trials (4–9 bpm) following double-blind administration of saline, esmolol (β-adrenergic blockade), or glycopyrrolate (muscarinic blockade). Parasympathetic blockade significantly suppressed all HRV metrics and increased heart rate, whereas sympathetic blockade had no effect. Breathing rate, drug condition, and their interaction were non-significant, indicating that drug effects on HRV were consistent across respiratory conditions. These findings support the interpretation of time-domain HRV indices as predominantly parasympathetic markers, rather than sympathetic, across paced breathing in controlled laboratory settings.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between personality, behaviour, and welfare in captive capuchin monkeys (Sapajus apella) at Bioparque Buinzoo (Chile). The main goals were to assess welfare, examine association between personality traits and abnormal behaviour, and evaluate the effects of habitat enrichment on activity levels, social interactions, and abnormal behaviours. We assessed personality using an adapted Eysenck’s PEN questionnaire, whereas welfare was evaluated through the Animal Welfare Assessment Grid (AWAG), complemented with behavioural observations. The results revealed strong connections between personality traits, behaviour, and welfare. Self-directed behaviours were significantly associated with the Introversion-Extraversion personality axis, while affiliative behaviours correlated with higher welfare scores. Contrary to expectations, Anxiety-related traits were negatively correlated with abnormal behaviour, suggesting a more complex relationship than anticipated. Individuals with lower welfare scores were less active, supporting the notion that poor welfare impacts both physical and psychological well-being. Habitat enrichment interventions produced mixed results: while inactivity decreased significantly, there were no notable changes in abnormal or affiliative behaviours. These findings indicate that while enrichment can improve activity, its design may require greater personalisation to address social and behavioural challenges effectively. This study highlights the importance of considering individual differences when planning welfare strategies. Incorporating personality assessments into environmental enrichment planning would provide a more tailored approach, better addressing the specific needs of each animal. By focusing on individual traits, welfare can be improved and foster healthy social interactions. This study also emphasizes the value of nonhuman primates as models for understanding personality and behaviour, contributing to both welfare management and species-specific biological insights.",

          "abstract": "Reading anxiety is the fear of reading and is theorized to be negatively associated with reading achievement. An inability to engage in reading due to either low reading achievement or high reading anxiety could be debilitating. Research on reading anxiety and its association with reading achievement has existed since the 1980s. However, this has been an area of rapidly increasing investigation in recent years. The goal of the present preregistered meta-analysis was to determine the strength of the association between reading anxiety and reading achievement. Through systematic screening of the published and unpublished literature, 64 studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis (totaling 180 effect sizes and 14,467 participants). The included studies were conducted in 14 countries and 11 languages. Analyses were performed using random effects models, accounting for dependent effect sizes via robust variance estimation. A moderate negative average weighted correlation was found between reading anxiety and reading achievement (r = -0.30). Significant heterogeneity across effect sizes was found (Q = 996, p &lt; .001, I2 = 82). Learning disability status, gender, reading domain, and age were not significant moderators. The association between reading anxiety and reading achievement has implications for the fields of psychology and education, specifically in efforts to promote people’s reading achievement while maintaining their socioemotional well-being. Future research using experimental and longitudinal designs is needed to determine the direction of any causal influences between reading anxiety and reading achievement. This would improve suggestions that can be made on how to support people struggling with their reading anxiety and reading achievement.",

We modeled consensus—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) rated targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers saw targets as they saw themselves. In both studies, subreddit fans provided self- and character ratings using three-item measures for each of nine traits: the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed significant consensus for all traits across both studies (mean rs=.54 to .60). Assumed-similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers projected their own open-mindedness onto characters in both series, whereas Yellowjackets viewers also projected Dark Tetrad traits—mainly narcissism and sadism. Finally, k-means clustering of character-trait means provided a novel visualization of character groupings and their underlying trait dimensions. Because perceived similarity to fictional characters helps shape parasocial bonds, understanding personality perception in this process advances both social and media psychological theory.",

          "abstract": "Learning about others’ personality traits is crucial for building personal relationships. This learning process can be conceptualized as reductions in prediction errors (PE), i.e., the differences between expectations about other persons and their subsequent feedback. Pupil dilation has been established as an important marker of various non-social learning processes. However, it remains unclear if pupil dilation also relates to PEs in abstract social learning processes. To test this, we conducted a pilot experiment and a pre-registered main experiment where participants were instructed to learn about the traits of other people (i.e., learning profiles) or about a self-profile, a profile that reflected the participant’s own trait ratings. We hypothesized that pupil size reflects PEs during social learning. We applied linear mixed-effects (LME) models to the behavioral data to test whether absolute PEs decreased over time. In the main experiment, we observed a significant reduction in absolute PEs, indicating successful learning. We then used LME models for the pupillometry data to test the relationship between absolute PEs and pupil dilation. In both experiments, larger absolute PEs were associated with larger pupil dilation on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect remained robust after controlling for confounding variables such as signed PEs and feedback. As expected, learning about the self-profile yielded smaller absolute PEs compared to other-profiles, and this was accompanied by reduced pupil dilation. Taken together, these findings suggest that pupil dilation scales with error magnitude and represents a critical physiological index of personality trait learning about others.",

However, treatment options remain inadequate and access to efficacious treatment is limited by geography, economics, and scale. Digital health interventions for chronic pain are easily scaled solutions to this problem and autonomous conversational agents represent a new frontier in this treatment domain. Despite their potential impact, conversational agents powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) have yet to be developed or examined for treatment of chronic pain. \n\nObjectives: We sought to develop and test Solace, a first-of-its-kind, expert trained generative AI conversational agent designed to deliver support grounded in principles of evidence-based pain psychology. \n\nMethods: We conducted an acceptability and usability study of Solace in a group of individuals with chronic pain. Participants (n=175) were recruited from Prolific, an online crowdsourcing platform, and interacted with Solace for 30 minutes. Self-report measures of system usability, treatment acceptability, and therapeutic alliance were completed after the interaction and clinically relevant pain related measures were completed before and after the interaction. \n\nResults: Participants rated the usability of Solace to be excellent (System Usability Scale mean = 85.04) and found it to be an acceptable intervention for chronic pain. Therapeutic alliance between participants and Solace was rated highly. Participants also demonstrated improvements in anxiety, pain interference, kinesiophobia, and pain resilience. Safety guardrails designed to identify and manage instances of suicidal ideation, injury, or requests for medication recommendations performed appropriately during the study. Solace is a usable and acceptable treatment for chronic pain that facilitates forming a strong therapeutic alliance with users. A single 30-minute conversation with Solace was also associated with improvements in several clinically relevant domains. \n\nConclusion: Solace is a usable and acceptable expert trained generative AI conversational agent for pain management. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of Solace as a strategy for the treatment of chronic pain.",

          "abstract": "Democracies worldwide have suffered from democratic backsliding and a rise in popularity of authoritarian politics. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of (support for) authoritarianism requires developing and validating scales to measure it. However, many authoritarianism scales perform irregularly outside of Western contexts, over time, and across groups. We conducted four studies, with samples from a total of 17 countries (total N = 31,767), to assess commonly used scales’ (three versions of Right-Wing Authoritarianism; Left-Wing Authoritarianism; Group Authoritarianism; Child Rearing; and Political Intolerance) latent item clustering, measure overlap, and invariance across cultures and over time. Specifically, we ask which measures remain invariant across different social groups, which items from different scales cluster together, and whether multiple scales for authoritarianism measure shared latent constructs. We find no evidence of cross-scalar item clustering or latent variable convergence. Moreover, items within scales clustered predominantly based on positive or negative wording. Breaking this trend were six items from the 32-item Right-Wing Authoritarianism scale, which addressed ideological and expressive freedoms. The six-item Political Intolerance scale by Dunwoody &amp; Funke (2016) was the most invariant of the scales assessed. These findings suggest that (disapproval of) belief diversity may be a core psychological aspect of authoritarianism, which should be considered in theory and scale development.",

We apply Reckase’s maximum discrimination point method to define them in an arbitrary algebraic basis. Then, we define that basis to be a geometrical representation of the measured construct. This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one, based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in a test space, distinct from the latent space. We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items. We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for graphical representation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor model theory.",

In this study, we challenge this 'different causes–different problems' assumption by testing two contrasting models of how vaccines and antibiotic behaviors might be related psychologically.\n\nIn one view, they could reflect a common stable attitude. People who distrust biomedical treatments or have a preference for natural immunity might avoid both vaccines and antibiotics. If so, a vaccine hesitant individual would be unlikely to overuse antibiotics.\n\nAn alternative view, grounded in cognitive neuroscience, posits a single state-dependent mechanism that prioritizes action when ill but inaction when healthy. This yields the prediction that the same people who avoid vaccines would also overuse antibiotics.\n\nAcross four countries (USA, UK, France and Argentina; N=1,307), our survey results support the second, state-dependent pattern: Across diverse healthcare contexts, individuals more hesitant about vaccines were also more likely to overuse antibiotics.\n\nThis asymmetry—bias towards action in one case and inaction in the other—calls for a rethinking of public health strategies to address vaccination and antibiotic use together, rather than in isolation, and in a way that is sensitive to target audiences' health states.",

Across two studies (N = 246), these tasks demonstrated acceptable to good reliability and provided complementary insights. While correlations between indirect and explicit measures were generally low, some associations aligned with theoretical expectations.

However, individual differences in response to exposure indicate that many patients do not fully benefit from therapy. Examining individual changes over time in threat expectancy likelihood, a theorized working mechanism of exposure as proposed by the Inhibitory Retrieval Theory, may help optimize individual treatment success. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of learning during one exposure exercise for fear of public speaking and the retention of learning in daily life. Participants with elevated fear of public speaking (70 women, M age = 23.10) completed an exposure exercise designed to violate an idiosyncratic threat expectancy. They gave two, three, or four presentations to at least halve threat expectancy likelihood. Ecological momentary assessments were used to measure threat expectancy likelihood eight times a day for four days before and four days after the exposure exercise. Results showed individual differences in how fast threat expectancy likelihood decreased during the exposure exercise. Furthermore, there were individual differences in how much this translated to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood in daily life and how long participants retained the decrease. Additionally, after the exposure exercise, we found a decrease in threat expectancy severity, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance tendency, and an increase in willingness to give a presentation in daily life.

          "authors": "Giwon Bahg; Simone A Luchini; Roger Beaty",
          "abstract": "Creativity assessment has historically relied on human raters to judge the quality of ideas and products. However, this approach is exceptionally costly due to the limited number of experts, the time and resources required for training them, and the high task burden. To overcome these barriers and expedite creativity research, computational automation of creativity assessment has been explored. We provide an overview of recent developments in computational creativity assessment methods, including techniques based on artificial intelligence (such as large language models) and semantic distance. Leveraging these modern machine-learning approaches, computational creativity assessment methods have enabled automatic scoring across various tasks—from simple idea generation to complex problem-solving and artistic expressions—often matching human rater agreement. These methods also have the potential to automatically generate new creativity tests (“automated item generation”) and can be used to detect invalid responses (i.e., random/task-irrelevant ideas), thereby ensuring assessment integrity for high-stakes applications. We discuss the current challenges and potential future directions, such as improving the interpretability and explainability of automated scoring, and a complementary approach centered around evaluating mental processes leading to creativity.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to novelty can enhance memory performance through behavioural tagging, whereby novel experiences strengthen temporally proximate memories. Whilst consistently demonstrated in rodents, human studies have yielded mixed results, possibly due to inadequate novelty manipulations and/or insufficient hippocampal engagement during encoding. Here, we investigated whether exploration of a novel, unpredictable, immersive virtual reality retroactively enhanced spatial memory in humans. Thirty-six participants completed a two-day experiment involving spatial object-location learning in custom mazes, with encoding strength manipulated through repetition, to create initially weak and strong encoding conditions. Following encoding, participants explored either familiar (predictable city) or novel (multi-site outer-space with unpredictable teleportations) virtual environments. Memory was assessed through spatial accuracy metrics and cued recall. We found a retroactive memory enhancement following novel environment exploration, specifically when novelty occurred on Day 2. This enhancement was evident across spatial memory measures and cued recall, but did not interact with encoding strength. Our results demonstrate that retroactive behavioural tagging effects can be elicited in humans using spatial memory tasks paired with immersive novelty experiences, provided participants have appropriate reference points for novelty evaluation. These findings highlight the importance of investigating behavioural tagging using manipulations that emulate those studied in rodents.",

          "abstract": "Although exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is generally effective for anxiety disorders, many people do not benefit. A better understanding of treatment predictors is required. This study investigated whether the dynamics of threat expectancy likelihood, which is one of the theorized working mechanisms of exposure, after an exposure exercise would predict subsequent intervention outcome. The short exposure exercise was designed to decrease the likelihood of one idiosyncratic threat expectancy. It was hypothesized that individuals with public speaking anxiety who hold on longer to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood after the exposure exercise (slower speed of return to equilibrium), show greater benefit from subsequent exposure intervention (i.e., less public speaking anxiety). Participants with subclinical public speaking anxiety (N = 60, M age = 25.42) completed an exposure exercise and momentary assessments in daily life (eight times per day) three days before and four days after the exposure exercise. One week later, they did an online one-session exposure intervention to decrease public speaking anxiety. Result showed that threat expectancy likelihood decreased after the exposure exercise and public speaking anxiety decreased after the intervention. Against expectations, speed of return to expectancy likelihood equilibrium did not predict intervention effects. Potential explanations of null results are discussed, like sampling frequency to measure speed of return to equilibrium and timing of the exposure exercise. Given the potential of dynamic predictors for exposure therapy outcome, more research is needed to examine the conditions in which speed of return to equilibrium predicts subsequent treatment outcome in anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic social interactions and feedback are crucial for understanding others’ emotions, particularly when confronted with contradictory emotional cues. Alexithymia, a condition that co-occurs with many psychiatric disorders, is characterized by impairment in emotional processing. However, computational mechanisms by which it alters social inferences based on feedback cues remain unexplored. To examine this, 60 participants with low and high levels of alexithymia completed an emotional learning task involving contradictory social (verbal and visual) cues to infer targets’ emotions. Computational analyses, including bin-based, reinforcement learning, and drift-diffusion modeling, revealed how alexithymia alters latent parameters that govern value updating and choice. Individuals with high alexithymia demonstrated lower accuracy in learning from social feedback. Drift diffusion analysis revealed a perceptual bias toward the visual cue, higher drift rates in the visual-correct condition, and greater evidence accumulation to infer others' emotions. These findings suggest that individuals with high alexithymia exhibit impaired social learning and difficulty with decision-making in situations with conflicting social information, with computational modeling quantifying the latent processes involved and advancing mechanistic targets for computational psychiatry.",

This study investigates patterns of emotional expression in mothers and adolescents using video filmed with head cameras during a novel interaction task. \nMethods: Participants were 26 mother-adolescent dyads (13 boys and 13 girls) from the Wirral Child Health and Development Study. Mothers and adolescents played a card game answering questions about each other whilst wearing head-cameras. Card responses were coded as correct and incorrect. The intensity of mother and adolescent emotional expressions was analysed by AI software FaceReader and collapsed into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Linear regressions tested the following preregistered hypotheses: (H1) mother and adolescent emotional expressions are positively associated; (H2) mothers display more positive emotions than their adolescents; (H3) mothers express more positive and neutral emotions when their adolescents are negative, whereas adolescents react more negatively to their mothers’ negativity; (H4) both mothers and adolescents display more positive emotions during agreements than during disagreements; and (H5) mothers express greater emotional variability during disagreements than during agreements.\nResults: Mothers demonstrated higher emotional variability during periods in which adolescents expressed a higher intensity of negative emotions, supporting H1 and H3, and expressed higher intensity of positive emotions compared to adolescents, supporting H2. There was no evidence to support H4 and H5.\nConclusions: Mothers express greater positive emotional intensity than their adolescents and a wider range of emotional expressions in response to their adolescents’ negative emotions. This could inform parenting interventions and advice around the de-escalation of negative emotional states in adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that unexpected sounds can inhibit eye-movements, which may occur due to global suppression of motor actions. If this is the case, then eye-movements should be inhibited across a range of tasks, and the degree of inhibition should be relatively independent from the bottom-up perceptual processes associated with each task. In the present study, we tested whether unexpected novel sounds inhibit eye-movements in two complex and ecologically valid tasks: passage reading and dynamic scene viewing. Participants read short passages from textbooks for comprehension and watched short videos of urban environments for memory recall while their eye-movements were being recorded. On every 5th fixation, a sound was played: this was either a repeated “standard” sine wave tone with a probability of .8 or a “novel” environmental sound with a probability of .2. Unexpected novel sounds led to longer fixation durations compared to the standard sound in both tasks, but the effect was slightly weaker in the dynamic scene viewing task. Follow-up analyses suggested that smooth pursuit eye-movements did not fully explain the attenuation of the effect in the scene viewing task. These results suggest that saccadic inhibition by unexpected sounds can occur in different active vision tasks, but the effect may not be entirely independent of the task dynamics.",

However, long-term effects remain unclear. Therefore, we explored long-term (&gt;12 years) outcomes of childhood stimulant medication use, using data from the NeuroIMAGE cohort. Method. Childhood (up to Mage=16.14, SDage=3.48) stimulant treatment trajectories were detected using K-means clustering based on age at initiation, stop age, total and maximum daily dose, and duration and variability of stimulant use in 324 children. The trajectories were compared across seven domains of adult outcomes (controlling for multiple testing) including psychiatric status, behavioral and emotional functioning, academic and professional functioning, adaptive functioning, neurocognitive functioning, physical health, and healthcare service use. Results. In 143 adults with childhood ADHD (Mage=28.34, SDage=3.74, 65% males) three stimulant treatment trajectory groups were detected: early-and-intense (n=46), late-and-moderate (n=63), and stimulant-naïve (n=34). The three groups did not differ on most adult outcomes, but group differences were observed for the adaptive, neurocognitive and physical functioning domains on the measures risk perception, cognitive flexibility, and sleep quality. The early-and-intense group had the most favorable mean scores (trend effects) compared to the other groups. Findings did not change after controlling for age and sex. Discussion. Stimulant medication use in childhood did not predict long-term outcomes in those with childhood ADHD in our sample, with a few exceptions, including some positive outcomes related to risk perception, cognitive flexibility, and sleep quality in those with longer and higher dosages.

          "abstract": "Concealed Information Tests (CITs) aim to detect recognition of critical information that individuals attempt to hide, typically using physiological markers. Although previous CIT studies have combined several autonomic indicators such as heart rate and pupil change, it is still unclear whether adding neural measures to pupillometry can capture complementary aspects of recognition and attentional control. To investigate this, we examined whether electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry jointly provide reliable markers of concealed information in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm, which constrains strategic processing and emphasizes rapid recognition. Participants viewed streams of faces containing a critical probe—either a personally familiar (parent’s) face or an unfamiliar face—while performing a sex-based target detection task. EEG and pupil size were recorded concurrently, focusing on four measures: ERP amplitude at Pz, theta-band (4–8 Hz) power, absolute pupil size, and pupil size change. At the group level, all measures differentiated probes from controls, reflecting attentional orienting and recognition. At the individual level, detection varied across modalities. To integrate evidence, we applied Fisher’s method to combine p-values across measures. Although overall detection did not substantially improve, combined inference compensated for limitations of single measures.",

          "abstract": "The Joint Position Reproduction test (JPR) is one of the most widely used methods to assess proprioceptive accuracy. It was revealed that certain characteristics of the test influence the acuity. However, some studies show contradicting results, and interactions between factors were also revealed. In this study, we investigated how the effect of starting position, movement type (active or passive), speed, magnitude, and time spent at the target position influences error magnitude and direction. We implied a full factorial 2 (starting position: 30 or 150°) * 2 (movement type: active or passive) * 3 (movement amplitude:30, 60 or 90°) * 2 speed (12 or 24°/sec) * 2 (time spent at target: 2 or 4 sec) within subject design, measuring the left elbow joint, and analyzed the data of 135 university students, using generalized linear mixed models. In the first model, where the outcome variable was absolute error, we found a significant main effect of movement type, speed, and amplitude, and significant interactions of amplitude*speed, amplitude*starting position and amplitude*speed*error direction. Higher movement amplitudes and speeds, and passive motion, lead to higher error scores. The deteriorating effect of amplitude was magnified by speed; the staring position*amplitude interaction shows the possible effect of target position. In the second model, where the outcome variable was error direction, we found a significant starting position main effect, and significant starting position*speed and starting position*amplitude interactions. Participants tended to make errors towards the starting position, higher speed and amplitudes increased this tendency. The results have important consequences regarding the standardisation of the JPR. Namely, to ensure comparability, we recommend standardising for the type (active or passive), amplitude and speed of movement and target position.",

Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosed in childhood show higher healthcare utilization, but their medication use remains understudied while this can clarify the long-term health burden of childhood ADHD. Methods. In this 18-year prospective cohort study, pharmacy dispensing records of ADHD, other psychotropic, and somatic medication of the last year were compared between adults with childhood ADHD (n=125, Mage=29, 68% males), their siblings (n=109, Mage=28, 35% males) and controls (n=101, Mage=30, 42% males) without childhood ADHD at study entry. Group differences in demographics and psychiatric status were included as covariates (sensitivity analyses). Results. The childhood ADHD group was more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, more different ADHD medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and neurological medications (specifically analgesics) compared to their siblings and controls (OR range=3.25-8.35, β range=0.61-0.65). Compared to controls, the childhood ADHD group was also more likely to be prescribed other psychotropic medication (OR=3.82) and used more different types of psychotropic medication (β=0.38). Siblings and controls did not differ. Findings remained after controlling for demographic differences, except that the childhood ADHD group no longer differed from controls on analgesics. After controlling for psychiatric status differences (ADHD, major depressive disorder), the childhood ADHD group still differed on ADHD medication use, more different ADHD medications, and NSAIDs, and from controls on more different psychotropic medications. Conclusions. Adults with childhood ADHD, but not their siblings, show elevated long-term medication use. The elevated medication use is not merely explained by shared familial factors but is partly attributable to current psychiatric status.",

Insights from this research could help audiologists identify high-risk demographics, and ultimately contribute to addressing inequalities in hearing health. \n\nDesign: An online study design was used, where data were collected on participant demographics, lifestyle and socioeconomic status, including age, gender, ethnicity, region of residence, income, education, occupation, exercise frequency, height and weight, smoking status, and weekly alcohol consumption, which were used as model predictors. Participants also self-reported their hearing function using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale 12 (SSQ-12) and completed an online digits-in-noise (DiN) task to assess speech perception ability, which were used as outcome variables. A sample of 227 adults aged 45-65 (Mean age = 53.77, SD = 5.87) were recruited through Prolific (www.prolific.com) based on Office for National Statistics (ONS) income groups. Results: Two multiple regression models were conducted with the outcome variables of speech perception ability (Digits-in-Noise: DiN) and self-reported hearing function (Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Scale: SSQ-12). The analysis revealed that having a routine and manual occupation predicted worse self-reported hearing function, as did being a regular tobacco consumer.  No significant predictors were significant for speech perception ability . \n\nConclusions: The findings suggest that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as measured in this study,  are significantly associated with self-reported hearing function in mid-life, but not with speech in noise perception ability. These results partially align with previous research that has identified smoking and occupation factors as predictors of hearing sensitivity when measured using pure tone audiometry. These data highlight the need for greater understanding as to how lifestyle and socioeconomic factors relate to different dimensions of hearing health.",

It is also noted that the proposal for non-orthogonal definitions of creative products, where product creativity is process-dependent, make the creative process definition primary in defining creativity.

          "abstract": "It is well documented that individuals who possess a Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM) can voluntarily retrieve an increased frequency of personal memories, that are also markedly more detailed, compared to non-HSAM individuals. In contrast, no study has explored potential differences relating to involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) retrieval. Here, a single HSAM case (DT) and matched controls completed a 1-day naturalistic IAM diary study to investigate frequency and characteristics of IAMs. HSAM individuals, even if they can remember almost every day of their life, are not constantly flooded by their past. Therefore, we hypothesised that occurrence of IAMs would be as in controls. At the same time, their exceptional ability to remember personally-relevant events could be reflected in the features of the memories relived. In line with our predictions, frequentist and Bayesian analyses support that DT has a normal prevalence of spontaneous memory pop-ups, but his IAMs were more vivid and self-relevant than controls. Such results support that, for individuals with exceptional memory, IAMs, like voluntary memories, are of an extremely high quality. Finally, we argue that our results provide evidence in support of cue overload mechanisms limiting unintentional (but possibly also intentional) retrieval in HSAM.",

Despite MCOs' detrimental effects on economies and citizens, evidence-based protocols targeting the promotion of anti-mafia motives are still lacking. To fill this gap, we assessed whether embodying heroic figures through Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) would enhance opposition to MCOs, reducing omertà. Specifically, 71 Italian young adults were split into three groups, in which they respectively embodied: a notorious Italian anti-mafia hero (i.e., Giovanni Falcone; Experimental Group, N = 24), a heroic figure unrelated to the anti-mafia movement (i.e., a firefighter; Heroic Control Group, N = 22) or a common person (Control Group, N = 25). After familiarizing themselves with the virtual body and completing a motor task, participants delivered a speech in front of an audience of virtual agents. Results showed that the embodiment procedure did not affect anti-mafia attitudes, and that, unlike the control group, participants embodying heroic characters tended to maintain the same level of decisional conflict about their anti-mafia intentions. In addition, in a subsequent Interpersonal Distance Task (IPD), only participants in the Experimental and Heroic Control groups displayed greater physiological discomfort (stronger heart rate deceleration or skin conductance response) when facing virtual agents associated with MCOs and crime, compared to innocent agents.

          "abstract": "Measuring subjective experience during meditation remains methodologically challenging due to reliance on verbal self-reports for embodied phenomena. To address this, we developed the Meditation Pictographic Scale (MPS) using a first-person phenomenological approach. We developed and validated the MPS across four phases: (1) qualitative interviews to refine pictographic items; (2) administration to adults (N = 373) in a randomized controlled trial, comparing three meditation practices (breath counting, loving-kindness, decentering) and active control; (3) psychometric analysis, including sensitivity to change, congruent correlations with related constructs, and internal structure via network analysis and exploratory factor analysis; and (4) assessment of structural changes across meditation states. Results showed that the MPS detected meditation-induced changes, with items clustering into positive, negative, and distortion-related experiences. The MPS demonstrated stable psychometric properties and sensitivity to specific meditation practices, offering a novel, non-verbal tool for studying meditation states, self-related processes, and altered states of consciousness.",

          "authors": "Margaret L Westwater; Fei Shang; Michael Browning",
          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by abnormal food intake, including energy restriction despite starvation or episodic binge-eating, which may reflect alterations in the reward value of food. Affected individuals show impaired learning from non-food rewards (e.g., money), yet the generalisability of such perturbations across the spectrum of disordered eating and to disorder-salient stimuli remains poorly understood. Therefore, we examined associations between ED symptoms and decision-making during reinforcement learning with food and non-food reward in a population-based sample. We recruited four hundred adults (n=250 female, M(SD)=29.5(6.6) years) to an online study, during which they performed two runs of a probabilistic instrumental learning task with either food or monetary reward. On each trial, participants chose between two cues with the aim of maximising the amount of money or food earned throughout the task, where cues were probabilistically associated with either wins, losses or neutral outcomes. A reinforcement learning model was fit to trial-wise choices to generate parameter estimates of learning rate and inverse choice temperature. Increased ED symptomatology was related to poorer task accuracy on loss relative to win trials across both reward types. Computational modelling revealed that greater ED symptom scores were associated with decreased inverse choice temperature for loss versus win trials. Our findings identify a link between ED symptomatology and impaired reinforcement learning from punishment that appears to generalise across food and monetary reinforcers. This may explain, in part, the challenges with modifying behaviour in patients who are struggling with EDs despite serious negative health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social gaze is a fundamental social cue that regulates approach and avoidance in social interactions. Everyday social interactions are characterized by repeated eye gaze exchanges. However, it remains unknown whether and how individuals learn from experiencing direct or averted eye gaze in others. Here, we used reinforcement learning modeling to investigate how micro-level gaze behaviors contribute to dynamic changes in social preferences and social closeness. Participants repeatedly chose between two faces that predominantly (70%) responded with either direct or averted gaze when selected, and rated their perceived closeness towards these individuals. Results showed a significant increase in choice frequency and closeness ratings for the direct gaze partner compared to the averted gaze partner. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms, computational modeling revealed that the direction of others’ eye gaze elicits a learning signal (prediction error) that in turn changes the latent value of the interaction partner. The learning signal was calibrated by individual differences in perceiving direct gaze as rewarding. Initial attractiveness and valence of the interaction partner predicted this reward calibration, suggesting that pre-existing impressions shape how social feedback is valued. In turn, calibration was reflected in participants’ social evaluations of the direct gaze partner, indicating how learning experiences contributed to impression formation. Together, these findings demonstrate that even minimal gaze interactions can shape social preference and closeness through reinforcement learning mechanisms. They further suggest that eye contact is a powerful, yet individually calibrated, social signal with implications for understanding and improving social engagement in both everyday and clinical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Human emotional crying remains an enigmatic phenomenon despite its universality across the lifespan. This manuscript introduces the Control-Arousal Signal Model (CAS), an integrative framework that unifies physiological, cognitive, and social perspectives on crying. The model posits that emotional crying emerges when a sudden increase in arousal coincides with a perceived loss of control, leading to an emotional response and the expression of emotional crying including behaviors such as tears and vocalizations. The CAS conceptualizes crying as a five-phase temporal process—from stimulus appraisal to post-crying regulation—and highlights interpersonal signaling of loss of control as its primary function, with intrapersonal regulation as a secondary, context-dependent outcome. By systematically reviewing major theories and empirical findings, the manuscript demonstrates how the CAS reconciles contradictory evidence, accommodates both negative and positive crying, and accounts for developmental, situational, and cultural moderators. The model generates testable hypotheses regarding the triggers, functions, and outcomes of crying, providing a coherent basis for future research. Its implications extend to developmental psychology, clinical practice, emotion regulation, and cross-cultural studies, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding crying as a central feature of human emotional expression.",

Patients were tested either on (N=34) or off (N=34) dopaminergic medication (levodopa), with age-matched polyneuropathy patients serving as controls (N=35). Behaviorally, patients off medication showed marked learning and decision-making deficits, characterized by overexploration and insufficient exploitation. To clarify the mechanisms underlying these impairments, we applied a computational model that combines similarity-based generalization with both random and uncertainty-directed exploration. The modeling results showed that impairments in patients off medication resulted from reduced generalization and increased uncertainty-directed exploration, but not greater random exploration. In contrast, exploration and generalization in patients on medication were comparable to the control group. Our  findings highlight how dopamine depletion in PD impacts reward learning under uncertainty, suggesting a key role of dopamine in exploration and generalization.",

          "abstract": "While sleep benefits memory consolidation in young adults, it remains unclear whether this advantage persists over aging. Using an associative inference task (AB/BC paradigm), we compared the effects of post-learning sleep versus equivalent wakefulness on associative (AB, BC) and inferential (AC) memory in older and young adults. Our study showed that sleep (vs. wake) enhanced associative memory retention in both age groups, while for inferential memory, a significant sleep benefit was observed in young adults, with a similar but non-significant trend in older adults. Critically, a direct comparison revealed that the magnitude of the sleep benefit for both memory types did not statistically differ between older and young adults. Refined analyses revealed that among older participants, sleep preferentially benefited poor performers in consolidating both associative and inferential memory. Furthermore, associative memory retention was positively correlated with subjective sleep quality in young adults, whereas inferential memory performance was linked to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior score in older adults. Together, our results suggest that sleep’s role in memory consolidation remains largely intact in healthy aging, highlighting its potential contribution to support cognitive health in later life.",

          "authors": "Alex Steiner",
          "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progressively paralyzes speech and motor functions, rendering patients speechless when voluntary movement is lost. Although invasive brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) such as electrocorticography (ECoG) have achieved high accuracy in speech-related neural activity decoding, clinical use is limited by surgery costs and risks. This study presents a new, fully non-invasive EEG-based inner-speech translation system aimed at communication restoration in ALS. This paper introduces a novel machine learning architecture based on a fusion of region-aware convolutional attention encoders and a transformer decoder, presenting a generative sequence-to-sequence model for open-vocabulary EEG-to-text translation. Preprocessed and downsampled EEG data from the Chisco imagined-speech dataset were used, and 48 optimized electrode channels were selected based on contribution-based ranking. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT) was employed to train the model to preserve linguistic fluency while being specialized for EEG input. Evaluation achieved BLEU-1 = 0.512 $\\pm$ 0.012 and ROUGE-L F1 = 0.396 $\\pm$ 0.009, surpassing earlier non-invasive baselines. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of cross-regional fusion and diversity regularization in maintaining cortical interpretability during the encoding process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-vocabulary, non-invasive EEG-to-text system capable of reconstructing continuous inner speech with high linguistic coherence and accuracy. These findings are a key step toward clinical neural speech restoration for ALS, facilitating the development of future real-time, low-cost assistive communication devices.",

These motive inferences were linked to greater political sectarianism and lower willingness to have a conversation about politics with the outrage expressor. In a fourth study (N = 720), we developed an intervention that changed people’s motive inferences, which improved willingness to have a conversation about politics. These findings highlight the role of motive inferences in shaping contemporary online political discourse filled with strong emotions, and suggest key levers to foster civil interactions among cross-partisans.",

Embedding reproducible, code-based workflows, literate programming, and ethical transparency throughout training can make openness both feasible and normative. By treating transparency as a professional competency, supported by open educational resources and institutional incentives, clinical psychology can model how to cultivate a sustainable culture of open science.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding human needs that transcends the limitations of hierarchical models. Unlike Maslow's rigid pyramid, our Dynamic Attention Based Model (DABM) proposes that human needs function as competing signals for cognitive attention, with their urgency determined by both evolutionary priority and subjective intensity. We introduce nine fundamental need categories that operate simultaneously rather than sequentially, each associated with distinct neurobiological pathways. The model makes a critical ontological distinction between needs (abstract psychological states), actions (behavioral responses), and objects (satisfiers), resolving longstanding conceptual ambiguities in motivation theory. We present the Integrated Needs Hierarchy (INH) assessment tool, propose three empirical validation studies, and address theoretical and practical implications. This framework offers a more dynamic, culturally sensitive, and neurobiologically grounded understanding of human motivation than existing theories.",

          "abstract": "Experiences of aloneness are inevitable, yet relatively little research has explored what explains positive experiences of solitude. As attachment orientations shape the experience of aloneness it is plausible they are associated with positive solitude. This study examined the relationship between attachment orientations and experiences of positive solitude, mediated via behavioural emotion regulation strategies. Adults living in Australia (N = 548; Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.38) completed measures of attachment and behavioural emotion regulation (Time 1), and positive solitude (Time 2, one week later). Structural equation modelling tested effects of anxious and avoidant attachment on positive solitude via five behavioural emotion regulation strategies: seeking distraction, seeking social support, actively approaching, ignoring, and withdrawal. The final model accounted for 24.8% of the variance in positive solitude. Avoidant and anxious attachment predicted different patterns of emotion regulation while all emotion regulation strategies significantly predicted positive solitude. Avoidant attachment indirectly predicted lower positive solitude while anxious attachment directly and indirectly predicted lower positive solitude. Findings suggest that both attachment orientation and emotion regulation shape the capacity to experience solitude positively. These results highlight the importance of considering attachment and emotion regulation in designing personalised interventions to promote adaptive and positive experiences of aloneness.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

We examined this issue on several popular participant recruitment platforms, including Mechanical Turk and Lucid. Across four studies spanning five years using multiple methods, we provide evidence that most of the data quality problems affecting online research using online panels can be tied to fraudulent users from outside of the US—not bots.

          "authors": "Douglas Guilbeault; Spencer Caplan; Charles Yang",
          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

Using mixed-effects models, we assessed how granting log access and completing short surveys affected glance, session, and app episode frequency and duration in both the short term (after surveys) and long term (across days). The result show that smartphone logging induced small, transient reductions in use frequency and duration, particularly during the first five days, suggesting initial self-regulation due to awareness of monitoring. Experience sampling prompts produced short-term increases in use lasting two to three hours. Overall, both methods induced some degree of reactivity in smartphone use, though the effect of this reactivity on inferences remains unknown.

Although regression approaches frame these as mutually exclusive, the underlying theoretical expectations concern differences at the extremes of the genetic distribution, as measured by a polygenic index (PGI). Here compensation and reinforcing dynamics are mapped to socioeconomic (SES) differences in the rate of overachievers (low-PGI individuals who attain a degree) and underachievers (high-PGI individuals who do not). Using three representative datasets from the US and UK, the findings show that compensatory and reinforcing dynamics can operate simultaneously: high-SES students are more likely to overachieve despite a low PGI - suggesting compensation - and less likely to underachieve - supporting Scarr-Rowe hypothesis. This framework challenges the presumed trade-off between equity and efficiency, and, in reconciling longstanding hypotheses on GxE interactions, possibly explains inconsistent findings from the literature.",

While such initiatives have been criticized as conspicuous consumption or vanity projects, one public benefit claimed is the display of new artistic perspectives: Due to their strong personal vision and independence, private museums have been argued (including by private museum founders themselves) to showcase underexposed artists and provide artistic innovation. We test this proposition with large-scale exhibition and auction data. We find that contrary to claims of artistic novelty, private museums disproportionately exhibit established artists, as their exhibition choices tend to favor artists who have already had longer careers, more prior exhibitions and higher auction turnover. Thus, the potential of private museums to serve as incubators of novel perspectives is limited.",

Unfortunately, socioeconomically underserved children with GBS across the United States have an increased risk of death compared to the general public. This paper seeks to address this problem through creative approaches that are inspired by the field of sociology. These interventions include community-based efforts that encourage early diagnosis, proactive treatment, and recovery support. When these remedies are used on a nationwide scale, marginalized children have the potential to survive GBS.",

Yet, why and from whom resilience is required is often overlooked. Economic downturns are exemplary sites to examine these questions.\nOBJECTIVE\nI study children’s prosocial development and caregiving as an expression of family resilience in households affected by job loss during the Great Recession in Ireland. From a social reproduction perspective, I posit that the demands and capacities for resilience are unequally shared within families, across generations and following a gendered pattern.\nMETHOD\nI rely on cohort data from children’s early years to adolescence (Growing Up in Ireland, 2008-2022) to estimate growth-curve and OLS models for prosocial development and outcomes tied to caregiving.\nFINDINGS\nChildren whose mothers experienced job loss exhibit steeper prosocial development. Girls with younger siblings drive this finding. At age 13, the same group is more likely to share and fulfil caregiving duties. Findings suggest that mothers might have leaned on their children to maintain some paid work after job loss, stimulating their daughters’ prosocial development and involvement in caregiving.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study highlights how economic downturns reinforce the gendered and generational underpinnings that bind the paid and unpaid work of family resilience.",

          "abstract": "The risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) is closely tied to attitudes justifying IPV at individual, couple and societal levels. We analysed how women’s IPV risk varies with their own and their spouse’s attitudes, local community acceptance and country-level gender equality. Using data from 148,421 couples across 30 low- and middle-income countries and 34 Indian states, we estimated Bayesian regression models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with uninformative priors. IPV justification and IPV experience varied significantly across and within countries. Women’s risk was more strongly associated with their own attitudes than with their husbands’ attitudes. Community-level justification independently increased risk, while higher country-level gender equality was linked to lower IPV exposures. The association between neighbourhood norms and women’s risk was moderated by spousal attitudes, with the association strongest among couples in which neither partner justified IPV. Country-level gender equality consistently reduced women’s risk regardless of couples’ attitudes. These findings suggest that focusing solely on couples where husbands perpetrate IPV is insufficient. Sustainable prevention efforts must also address community norms and structural gender inequality.",

          "abstract": "Geopolitical risk has emerged as a persistent feature of the global business environment, yet its impacts on domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) remain underexplored, particularly in emerging economies with distinctive institutional contexts. This study examines how geopolitical risk influences M&amp;A deal failure in India and whether acquirers’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates this relationship under the country’s mandatory CSR regime. Using a sample of 377 domestic M&amp;A deals announced between 2015–16 and 2019–20, the analysis reveals a counterintuitive pattern: higher geopolitical risk is associated with a lower likelihood of deal failure, suggesting that firms pursue domestic consolidation as a defensive hedge against external volatility. While acquirers’ CSR performance independently reduces the probability of deal failure, its interaction with high geopolitical risk increases the likelihood of failure. It indicates that strong CSR commitments may constrain financial flexibility during uncertain times, thereby heightening deal vulnerability. These results remain robust across alternative model specifications, sub-samples, and disaggregated geopolitical risk measures. By integrating geopolitical risk with a legally enforced CSR spending regime, this study provides one of the first empirical demonstrations of how macro-political turbulence and regulatory social responsibility jointly shape corporate M&amp;A outcomes in emerging markets. These findings re-conceptualize CSR as a potential financial constraint under regulation and advance the understanding of firm behavior at the intersection of risk, responsibility, and regulation.",

This study used data from a national survey of adults to examine how, why, and to what extent parents’ expectations for athletic achievement are linked to underlying social inequalities. Logistic regressions using data from parents (n = 676-690) revealed factors associated with expectations of their children becoming a small college, college scholarship, or professional or Olympic athlete. Most parents appeared to have realistically pessimistic expectations. Higher expectations were apparent among parents of younger children, who perceived their children to have stronger athletic identities seemingly born out of their sport participation histories, who were sport fans, who had children that were Black or Latinx, who lived in neighborhoods with more non-White families, and, when it came to expectations of becoming a professional or Olympic athlete, who were from a lower socioeconomic status position. The child’s gender and the parent’s gender were not significantly related to athletic expectations and socioeconomic status was inconsistently related to expectations of becoming a college athlete. The results supported some theoretical arguments and contradicted others, and they can be used to target educational messaging around youth sport practices.",

Existing scholarship emphasizes the electoral or elite payoffs of favoritism, but pays less attention to the processes that make partisan favoritism possible. We develop a theory of coordination advantage in which shared partisanship facilitates networks that link local and central officials. These networks provide privileged access to information and informal guidance, enabling local officials aligned with central officials to submit more and higher-quality grant applications without overtly violating formal rules. Using data on municipal grant requests and federal allocations in Brazil, we show that aligned mayors submit more proposals, receive more funding, and achieve greater compliance with technical standards than their unaligned counterparts. Original data on legislators' visits to municipalities and ministerial schedules show that partisan ties activate coordination. These findings suggest that partisan favoritism persists by exploiting partisan networks to navigate within institutional constraints.",

Prior research highlights that hedonic and utilitarian motivations, environmental cues, and holistic experience design significantly shape consumer behavior within retail settings. This study synthesizes key theoretical perspectives on experiential marketing and examines their implications for the redesign of physical retail spaces.

          "abstract": "Can large-scale geopolitical shocks causally reshape how individuals perceive their intergenerational mobility? We address this question by examining the immediate impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on mobility perceptions using a quasi-experimental design. Leveraging World Values Survey data collected in Czechia and Uruguay during the invasion, we implement a regression discontinuity design that compares respondents interviewed immediately before and after February 24, 2022. This unexpected event during survey design approach addresses key limitations of correlational studies by exploiting quasi-random variation in exposure to the shock. Across multiple specifications -- including bandwidth sensitivity analyses, logit models, demographic controls, and robust bias-corrected estimates -- we find consistent null effects. The invasion produced no discernible immediate impact on either upward or downward mobility perceptions in either country, despite Czechia's geographic proximity and historical ties to the region. These findings complement prior correlational evidence showing associations between war concerns and mobility beliefs one year after the invasion, suggesting that such effects may unfold gradually rather than instantaneously, or that correlational patterns reflect selection into worry rather than immediate causal impacts. Our study demonstrates the value of combining multiple methods and measures when studying how geopolitical crises shape social perceptions.",

          "authors": "Carlo Luiu",
          "abstract": "As populations in both developed and developing countries continue to age, ensuring access to transportation that meets the mobility needs of older adults is becoming increasingly important. This issue is particularly pressing for individuals who are unable to drive or access private vehicles. Flexible Transport Services (FTS) offer a promising alternative to private transport for older people, thanks to features such as door-to-door accessibility and operational flexibility. This paper investigates travel satisfaction, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward FTS among older adults residing in the urban context of Birmingham, United Kingdom. A mixed-methods approach is employed, beginning with an analysis of travel frequency and purpose associated with FTS use, followed by a thematic analysis aimed at capturing older people's experiences, perceptions, and overall attitudes toward this mode of transport. The analysis reveals six key themes: lack of need, service provision issues, stigma, lack of awareness, convenience, and social implications. These themes highlight both the benefits of FTS and the factors that hinder its use. A central finding is the marked difference in perception between frequent users and non-users. FTS is often viewed negatively by non-users, with three of the four identified barriers predominantly arising from this group. In contrast, frequent users express satisfaction with the service, particularly emphasising its role in meeting discretionary travel needs. This is especially true for individuals over the age of 80 and those with limited access to a car.",

          "abstract": "Short-form video platforms, such as TikTok, have rapidly transformed digital media consumption, with billions of active users worldwide. Their design features, such as algorithmic personalization, endless scrolling, and rapid novelty, have raised concerns about mobile overuse and its associated adverse effects on well-being. However, evidence on whether short-form videos increase mobile usage remains limited. To address this gap, we estimate the causal effect of short-form video platforms on mobile usage behavior using individual-level data (N=1,764) drawn from a representative panel of U.S. mobile device users. Specifically, we compare TikTok adopters to adopters of Instagram/Facebook during the period (1/5/2019--5/8/2020) when short-form video was the key distinguishing feature of TikTok (i.e., before these competitors introduced their own short-form video products), thereby shedding light on the effect of exposure to short-form videos. We find that using short-form video platforms significantly increases total mobile usage duration by up to 17% (about 28 minutes per day for the average user) and reduces average time away from the mobile phone by -20% (29 fewer minutes per day for the average user), but does not consistently affect the number of daily sessions. Effects are disproportionately higher among individuals who previously used their phones less, relative to those with higher baseline usage. Contrary to fears about nocturnal overuse, effects are only significant during daytime hours. Surprisingly, older individuals have significantly larger increases in mobile sessions per day from usage of short-form video platforms compared to younger individuals. Altogether, our results show a behavioral mechanism through which short-form video platforms contribute to mobile usage, offering new insights into theories of digital addiction and highlighting the importance of promoting healthier digital engagement.",

We first explored and identified key patterns across 8,550 sensor-logged showering events from 319 German households. We then combined this high-resolution smart-meter data with time-stamped post-shower surveys to analyse shampoo-shower duration. The Gamma mixed model (14 predictors spanning demographics, context, in-shower behaviour and hair characteristics) explained 68.4% of deviance (AIC = 4281.6). Behavioural predictors showed the clearest associations: showers with two or more shampoo applications were 27% longer than those with one, while showers with three or more water pauses were 28% longer than those with one. Some contextual and demographic predictors also mattered: soft water areas were linked to 23% longer durations, and younger/mid-age adults had durations up to 31% longer than adults 50+. Other factors (gender, employment, household composition/size, home type, bills responsibility and most hair characteristics) showed small or uncertain effects after adjustment.

          "abstract": "News recommender systems (NRSs) are increasingly implemented in news industry to enhance digital distribution, yet their development and evaluation are shaped by a complex interplay of organizational stakeholders with diverse objectives. This study investigates the real-world complexities of NRS implementation, considering the multitude of objectives on the NRS provider side by exploring how different stakeholder groups —from journalistic, commercial and tech logic— conceptualize NRS goals and assess their performance. Through 22 semi-structured expert interviews across four news organizations in Europe, we uncover a `jungle of metrics' where an overabundance of data insights does not necessarily lead to better decision-making. While traditional accuracy-based metrics like click-through rate (CTR) remain widely used, they fail to capture the broader strategic objectives that guide NRS adoption in industry. This paper identifies a critical gap between current academic evaluations of NRS and the business key performance indicators (KPIs) used in practice. Rather than evaluating NRS in isolation, stakeholders assess their contribution to overarching organizational goals, including reach, engagement, conversion, and retention. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced, multi-stakeholder approach to NRS evaluation that aligns with both business imperatives and journalistic values.",

I compare their replies to questions on hypothetical movement behavior if hypothetically affected by natural disaster (pre-monsoon, May-June 2021) to  migration intentions and actual migration 2-6 months later after quasi-experimental actual exposure (post-monsoon, August/September 2022/January 2023). Results show that hypothetical as well as actual affectedness and risk shape migration intent and behavior similarly. However, the vignette experiment is approximating actual migration intent more closely than migration, indicating that survey experimental approaches likely overestimate actual behavior, while capturing behavioral intent well.

          "authors": "George Cooper",
          "abstract": "Since 2017, Western scholarly publishers have faced growing pressure from Chinese state regulators to restrict access to politically sensitive content or risk losing market access. This study examines conditions compelling publishers to acquiesce to censorship demands through qualitative interviews with twenty-four participants: twelve Asia Studies academics and twelve publishing professionals. Thematic analysis revealed ten themes across six categories: conditions, definitions, responsibility, knowledge, resistance, and values. Censorship complicity stems from China's economic power and publishers' revenue dependence on subscriptions, article processing charges, and citation metrics. The study identifies pervasive tendencies to deny or redistribute responsibility, contributing to normalization despite value alignment opposing censorship. \n\nSelf-censorship occurs in a climate of strategic uncertainty, where publishers withhold information to protect commercial interests and avoid anti-competition violations, preventing coordinated resistance. While author boycotts initially constrained compliance—reversing Cambridge University Press's 2017 decision to acquiesce to censorship demands—fragmentation has weakened collective action, particularly among early-career scholars dependent on access to China. Participants demonstrated shared conceptualizations of censorship and liberal-democratic values favouring resistance but diverged on whether China-based scholars' interests should inform responses. Collaborative resistance requires expanding stakeholder coalitions to include research funders and librarians through industry-wide frameworks analogous to the Global Network Initiative.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how maritime losses and energy constraints shaped Japan’s war economy during the Asia-Pacific War. Using historical statistics, shipping records, and government documents, the analysis focuses on the deterioration of Japan’s maritime transport capacity and its consequences for energy supply, industrial production, and military logistics. The findings show that increasing losses of merchant vessels critically reduced the inflow of essential resources—particularly coal and oil—leading to severe energy shortages across Japan’s industrial sectors. These shortages ultimately restricted war production, weakened military operations, and accelerated Japan’s strategic decline in the final stages of the conflict. By quantifying the relationship between maritime losses and energy constraints, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the structural vulnerabilities of Japan’s wartime economy.",

          "abstract": "Marine heatwaves are accelerating under climate change and increasingly threaten the lives and livelihoods of coastal populations, particularly in low and middle-income countries where many households directly depend on local marine fisheries for protein, micronutrients and income. To quantify this threat, we link individual-level data on child and maternal health from 9,813 coastal sites in 36 low or middle-income countries to heatwave exposures in the nearby ocean, and use this linked dataset to estimate fixed-effects logistic regression models that test for heatwave effects on child mortality, child wasting, child stunting, and adult underweight. We find that a 1 SD increase in the number of heatwaves over a 24-month period increases the odds of child mortality by 5.4%, child wasting by 6.5% and child stunting by 8.8%, and that these effects also extend to other dimensions of heatwaves such as maximum sea surface temperature and cumulative intensity. Urban populations, unexpectedly, are most strongly affected, which may reflect their position as purchasers rather than producers of protein-rich foods. Taken together, these results document that marine heatwaves directly undermine human health and emphasize the continued importance of global monitoring for child and maternal health as well as oceanic conditions.",

          "abstract": "Colourblind racial ideology (CBRI) encompasses belief systems or worldviews that deny, minimize, or distort the relevance of race or racism. The present research examined the role of sociodemographic variables as predictors of CBRI among pre-service and in-service social work professionals in Germany, and how their endorsement of CBRI, in turn, relates to their sensitivity to recognizing racist incidents. Specifically, we introduce and tested a mediation model hypothesizing that older, more privileged professionals living in rural or Eastern German regions are less likely to recognize racist incidents due to their higher endorsement of CBRI. We additionally explored whether the assumed relationships differ between two forms of CBRI: colour-evasion and power-evasion. Results from a correlational, cross-sectional online study with pre- and in-service social workers (N = 242) largely supported our predictions. However, social workers’ region of residence (Eastern vs. Western Germany) did not emerge as a significant predictor of CBRI, and only power-evasion but not colour-evasion significantly mediated the relationships between sociodemographic variables and racism recognition. Implications of these findings for social work practice and education are discussed in light of critical race and critical whiteness theory.",

          "authors": "Heini Väisänen; Hanna Remes; Lara Lehtoranta; Marie-Caroline Compans; Pekka Martikainen",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately one in four women experiences a miscarriage, which may affect fertility intentions and health. However, there is a lack of research on the topic, in part due to poor quality of miscarriage data. Both surveys and healthcare records likely miss some early pregnancy losses. We compare data from self-reports and healthcare records  at the individual level to understand to what extent these data differ and for whom.\nMETHODS: We used healthcare records on miscarriages in Finland linked to self-reported miscarriage data in antenatal appointments, as well as in a national epidemiological survey, FinHealth 2017. The antenatal data was available for all those with a live birth, whereas the survey also captured those without children, but had a smaller sample size. We compared the consistency of records overall and by socio-demographic characteristics using descriptive statistics and multinomial regressions.\nRESULTS: For over 80% of people, miscarriage data was consistent between self-reports and healthcare records. This was mainly driven by those who had never had a miscarriage, as the share of consistent records dropped to 40% when only those with at least one miscarriage in one data source were analysed. We observed some self-reporting fewer (1-4% among full sample, 7-13% among those with a miscarriage) and some more miscarriages than in healthcare records (8-12% among the full sample, 46-56% among those with a miscarriage). Inconsistency in either direction was often associated with older age, higher parity, and lower education.\nCONCLUSIONS: Healthcare records and self-reports overlap partly in the miscarriages they capture. More miscarriages were observed using self-reports, probably due to some miscarriages managed outside the healthcare system, and differences in miscarriage definition between lay people and healthcare professionals, with the latter having a more restrictive definition. Future miscarriage studies should carefully consider the strengths and limitations of each type of source against their research aims, when choosing a suitable data source.",

Using mixed-effects models, we assessed how granting log access and completing short surveys affected glance, session, and app episode frequency and duration in both the short term (after surveys) and long term (across days). The result show that smartphone logging induced small, transient reductions in use frequency and duration, particularly during the first five days, suggesting initial self-regulation due to awareness of monitoring. Experience sampling prompts produced short-term increases in use lasting two to three hours. Overall, both methods induced some degree of reactivity in smartphone use, though the effect of this reactivity on inferences remains unknown. The findings suggest that researchers should allow acclimation periods and space surveys appropriately.",

          "abstract": "The global economy operates under a fundamentally flawed informational ecosystem dominated by quasi-holistic perspectives that have fragmented understanding and perpetuated systemic failures throughout human history. This paper introduces Supra-level Holistic Re-engineering (SHR) as the first genuinely holistic methodology for addressing the global economy as an integrated whole. SHR synthesizes six key ideas—the clean slate principle from Business Process Reengineering, holism, narrative synthesis, systems thinking, the global economic system concept, and organizational advantages—to transcend limitations inherent in existing concepts and theories.\nThe analysis reveals that quasi-holistic definitions and semantics embedded in social science literature serve as the root cause of fragmentation, creating a vicious four-phase cycle that generates infinite convoluted loops of discrepancies. These discrepancies manifest at all levels in the economy as gaps, overlaps, controversies, and conflicts that disrupt workflows and push the global economy toward self-destruction. Most insidiously, an implicit quasi-holistic framework has enabled the financial system to dominate the global economy, transforming money from a medium of exchange into the ultimate end, thereby distorting true reality and robbing productivity from all other service systems.\nThis paper redefines the Global Economic System/World Economic System as RGES (Redefined GES), establishing it as an overarching structure coordinating all subsystems through interconnectivity and interrelationships across space, time, and level. The urgency for this paradigm shift is underscored by environmental deadlines, escalating financial crises, and geopolitical tensions. With NASA confirming Earth's uninhabitability by 2600 and critical turnaround points potentially already passed, SHR represents an existential necessity for steering humanity toward a sustainable future before reaching the point of no return.",

          "abstract": "This study addresses the economic returns to education among men and women in Norway, during five decades of changing and widening gender disparities in educational attainment. We ask how gender differences in educational attainment and returns have contributed to change and persistence in the gender income gap, and whether young men have started trailing behind due to women’s relative gains in higher education. While rising real incomes have contributed to a narrowing relative income gap, the absolute gap has decreased more slowly. In the past decade, both real incomes and the gender income gap have stagnated. Our results show that while both men and women in Norway have increased their education levels, women’s gains have been mainly in higher education, while men’s gains have disproportionately been in vocational upper secondary education. Contrary to the situation in the US and other liberal market economies, income growth among men with vocational education in Norway has recently outpaced every other group, resulting in a decreasing college premium, particularly among men. Women’s relative gains in higher education are partly offset by their lower incomes at all education levels, and the relatively strong income growth among men with vocational degrees. Decomposition analyses confirm these patterns.",

In diesem Beitrag wird ein Praxisbeispiel vorgestellt, in dem ein KI-gestützter Chatbot Studierende in einem bildungswissenschaftlichen Modul der Lehramtsausbildung begleitet, indem er Fragen beantwortet und Lernmaterialien bereitstellt, um das Selbststudium zu fördern. Neben praktischen Aspekten stehen die ethischen Implikationen im Fokus, wie der Schutz von Autonomie und Datenschutz sowie die Notwendigkeit von Transparenz im Lernprozess.\nEin besonderer Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Förderung ethischer Kompetenzen im Umgang mit KI-Systemen, da Studierende nicht nur technologische, sondern auch kritische und medienpädagogische Fähigkeiten entwickeln müssen, um digitale Werkzeuge reflektiert und verantwortungsvoll zu nutzen (Knaus 2018; Kuka/Hörmann/Sabitzer 2024). Der Beitrag plädiert dafür, dass die Integration von KI nicht nur technologische Anpassungen erfordert, sondern auch eine umfassende medienpädagogische Auseinandersetzung, die Studierende und Lehrende mit Future Skills ausstattet. Abschließend wird die Rolle der KI als integraler Bestandteil der Hochschulbildung diskutiert, um Lernprozesse ganzheitlich und verantwortungsbewusst zu gestalten.\n\nThe ongoing digital transformation provides new opportunities for higher education, particularly through AI-powered chatbots.

Alongside practical considerations, the ethical implications of chatbot usage—especially autonomy, data protection, and transparency—are discussed. A particular focus is placed on fostering ethical and media-pedagogical competencies, as students must develop critical skills to engage responsibly with AI systems. The paper argues that integrating AI in higher education requires not only technological adaptation but also a pedagogical approach that equips students and teachers with future-oriented skills.",

          "abstract": "Can inclusion in government break the appeal of far right parties? This question is critical given the global rise of far-right parties which makes government formation increasingly difficult. Commentators and pundits alike increasingly argue that the appeal of the far right could be broken by including far-right parties in government. The idea is that taking over government responsibility, dealing with the constraints of day-to-day politics and making policy compromises would make it difficult for far-right parties to maintain their popular appeal. \nWe test this argument by analyzing 1,237 cabinets in 57 democracies from 1976 to 2023 by relying on a difference-in-differences design. We find no evidence that executive participation weakens far-right support. On the contrary, far-right parties  gain in popularity, increasing their vote share by an average of about six percentage points in the next election. Thus, government inclusion does not break the appeal of the far right, it consolidates their electoral position.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of evaluative capital, a form of personal academic capital grounded in quantifiable performance metrics (citation counts, h-index, journal impact factors) that function within both formal and informal academic evaluation rituals. Drawing on Randall Collins’s microinteractionism and Viviana Zelizer’s concept of circuits of value, and engaging with critiques of bibliometric indicators, the article distinguishes evaluative capital from Bourdieu’s symbolic capital by emphasizing its personal, quantifiable, and institutionalized nature. It develops a micro-stratification approach to theorize how such metrics are interpreted and converted into career resources through everyday academic interactions. The article examines how different actors (elite scholars, early-career academics, and late-career academics) accumulate and deploy evaluative capital, shaping patterns of academic stratification. Further, it explores the mechanisms by which metrics translate into professional advantages and the inflationary dynamics that can erode their value over time. Finally, the analysis situates evaluative capital within broader institutional and infrastructural conditions that shape visibility, commensurability, and symbolic valuation in science, shedding light on how metric-centric evaluation regimes transform academic hierarchies.",

          "abstract": "Persistent Black-White segregation is a key mechanism shaping profound Black-White inequalities.\nA central assumption is that Whites explicitly benefit from racial segregation and would lose advantages afforded to them if they were to residentially integrate with Black Americans.\nThe theoretical basis for this stems from a focus on neighborhood-level consequences of segregation that produce zero-sum outcomes.\nHowever, segregation also shapes broader, macro-level dynamics, including income segregation, the availability of public goods, and policy outcomes that likely impact all residents.\nIn this paper, I track individuals born between 1905-1920 in the complete-count 1940 Census linked to Social Security death records and utilize an instrumental variable design that leverages county-level variation in government fragmentation to estimate the causal effect of segregation on Black and White longevity.\nResults reveal that a 10-point increase in Black-White segregation decreased Black longevity by 0.44 years and White longevity by 0.29 years.\nFor Whites with lower education, segregation is particularly harmful, but for those with the highest education, the effects are attenuated by 0.10 years.\nThese results highlight that processes of racial stratification also affect Whites and contest straightforward zero-sum conceptions of segregation effects.",

          "abstract": "Rising economic inequality has reshaped residential patterns across rich democracies, yet the political consequences of economic segregation remain poorly understood. We argue that the spatial concentration of affluence and poverty amplifies class-based disparities in participation by weakening cross-class networks and reinforcing socio-economic (dis-)advantage. Combining fine-grained grid-based measures of segregation with local election results from German municipalities between 2005 and 2021, we show that turnout is lower in segregated places with many economically-deprived residents. Original survey data reveal that segregation widens turnout gaps by disproportionately demobilizing low-income voters. However, these effects depend on local social capital: using administrative records of all civic associations, we show that turnout in segregated places declines where associations are scarce but increases where dense community and welfare organizations bridge economic divides and alleviate material constraints. This suggests that the spatial structure of inequality and the strength of civic associations shape political inequality beyond individual socio-economic status.",

          "abstract": "Ample sociological research focusses on, or uses friendships between individuals in their analyses. Although it may seem clear what friendship is when using the term in everyday life, the scientific study of friendship (networks) faces a myriad of challenges due to the conflation of distinct relationship types that vary within and between sociodemographic groups into one only intuitively understood concept ‘friendship’. We review these relations and meanings from respondents’ and re-searchers’ perspective and distil four frequently used friendship archetypes. We discuss how this ‘conceptual overload’ poses challenges for research on social in-tegration, segregation, influence, tie formation, and network ecology. We advocate building on existing friendship and more broadly relational research by theorizing and measuring clearly defined social relations. In doing so, we can build on existing friendship research but advance to conduct more rigorous types of social network analyses.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how visual self-presentation in online dating functions as a practice of subjectivation through which attractiveness is socio-culturally anticipated rather than merely displayed or evaluated. Drawing on Foucault’s theory of subjectivation and Bourdieu’s practice-theoretical framework, it conceptualizes profile curation as a technology of the self through which tacit yet conjunctively shared constructions of attractiveness are rendered visible. Self-presentation through images is thus not mere impression management but a practice of subjectivation that materializes power/knowledge formations in visual form. Using an abductive–computational analysis of 73,206 Tinder images collected across thirteen metropolitan areas and across gender and sexuality, the study reconstructs ten Constructions of Attractiveness (COA) and their patterned combinations as Repertoires of Attractiveness (ROA). These typologies reveal how users align with culturally recognizable and field-bound anticipations of attractiveness, transforming embodied dispositions and forms of capital into field-legible visibility. Cross-cultural comparison shows that these repertoires cluster along regional trajectories, suggesting that while gender and sexuality remain significant, digital self-presentation is more strongly structured by broader cultural conjunctive milieus. The study contributes to a sociological understanding of mediated subjectivation by showing how visual self-presentation practices make power/knowledge formations visible and delimit how subjects can appear as attractive.",

We review both literatures for Latin America, looking both at income and educational persistence. We document very high levels of intergenerational persistence and inequality of opportunity for education, with inherited characteristics predicting 29% to 52% of the current-generation variance in years of schooling. Inherited circumstances are somewhat less predictive of educational achievement, measured through standardized test scores, accounting for 20% to 30% of their variance. Our estimates of inequality of opportunity for income acquisition suggest that between 46% to 66% of contemporary income Gini coefficients can be predicted by a relatively narrow set of inherited circumstances, making Latin America a region of high inequality inheritability by international standards. Our review also finds a very wide range of intergenerational income elasticity estimates, with substantial uncertainty driven by data challenges and methodological differences.

England’s new Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) policy provides a critical case. While previous studies have examined its ecological outcomes, few have explored how different institutional models of habitat banking shape who participates in the market and how collaboration unfolds at the landscape scale. Drawing on participatory institutional mapping and 29 interviews with landowners, conservation organisations, planning authorities, and investors in Oxfordshire, we identify and compare three models of habitat banking: (1) for-profit providers leasing land under conservation covenants; (2) institutional not-for-profits managing land; and (3) individual landowners supported by not-for-profit facilitators under legal agreement with planning authorities. We show that for-profit providers tend to foster inclusive participation through risk-sharing finance but limited local collaboration, while not-for- profits enable collaborative governance that advances strategic, landscape-scale nature recovery yet restricts participation to a narrower set of landowners. These findings demonstrate how institutional design and operational models shape both inclusivity and collaboration, with implications for reconciling individual participation and collective ecological goals in the implementation of biodiversity markets.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become an essential tool for social scientists and humanities (SSH) researchers who work with textual data. One particularly valuable use case is automating text annotation, traditionally a time-consuming step in preparing data for empirical analysis. Yet, many SSH researchers face two challenges: getting started with LLMs, and understanding how to evaluate and correct for their limitations. The rapid pace of model development can make LLMs appear inaccessible or intimidating, while even experienced users may overlook how annotation errors can bias results from downstream analyses (e.g., regression estimates, $p$-values), even when accuracy appears high. This tutorial provides a step-by-step, hands-on guide to using LLMs for text annotation in SSH research for both Python and R users. We cover (1) how to choose and access LLM APIs, (2) how to design and run annotation tasks programmatically, (3) how to evaluate annotation quality and iterate on prompts, (4) how to integrate annotations into statistical workflows while accounting for uncertainty, and (5) how to manage cost, efficiency, and reproducibility. Throughout, we provide concrete examples, code snippets, and best-practice checklists to help researchers confidently and transparently incorporate LLM-based annotation into their workflows.",

Using 30x30 meter satellite data along Brazil’s 12,800 km border in the Amazon, we find dramatic shifts in deforestation rates that align with changes in Brazilian policies. Between 2001 and 2005, at the tail end of a pro-exploitation period,  annual deforestation in Brazil was more than three times the rate across the border. From 2006 to 2013, these differences disappeared as Brazil introduced policies to curb deforestation. However, they re-emerged in 2014 amid a period of dismantling environmental regulation. We show that both reversals were stronger in areas with weaker de jure protection and greater potential for exploitation. National borders provide a unique means to evaluate the effectiveness of national conservation policies, which are increasingly of international concern.",

Building on classic debates about computers in qualitative data analysis (QDA), we revisit possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, and 'big data.' We introduce a typology of contemporary approaches to using computers in qualitative research: streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical methods, the sociology of computation, and technological rejection. Drawing from scaled team ethnographies and solo research integrating computational social science (CSS), we describe methodological choices across study lifecycles, from literature reviews through data collection, coding, text retrieval, and representation. We argue that new technologies hold potential to address longstanding methodological challenges when deployed with knowledge, purpose, and ethical commitment. Yet a pragmatic approach--moving beyond technological optimism and dismissal--is essential given rapidly changing tools that are both generative and dangerous. Computation now saturates research infrastructure, from algorithmic literature searches to scholarly metrics, making computational literacy a core methodological competence in and beyond sociology. We conclude that when used carefully and transparently, contemporary computational tools can meaningfully expand--rather than displace--the irreducible insights of qualitative research.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the political economy of growth by examining the interplay between globalization dynamics, trade performance, and wealth creation over the period 1971–2023. Dominant theories in international economics often posit that deeper globalization fosters export expansion and sustained GDP growth. However, the empirical evidence presented here challenges this linear assumption. Findings indicate that higher levels of globalization do not consistently translate into improved export capacity or rising GDP per capita. Instead, structural disruptions—geopolitical tensions, economic shocks, and protectionist trade regimes—frequently constrain anticipated benefits, revealing systemic vulnerabilities within the global economy. Building on interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives from political economy and development studies, the analysis introduces the concept of an optimal investment threshold. This threshold represents a critical level of foreign direct investment (FDI) net outflows, expressed as a percentage of GDP, beyond which the marginal gains of globalization diminish. Exceeding this point can trigger systemic decline, characterized by stagnating GDP growth and weakened trade performance, thereby challenging the sustainability of globalization-driven development models.These insights underscore the need for recalibrated strategies that integrate structural limits into policy design. By promoting inclusive growth through balanced investment flows and coordinated international regulation, the study reframes globalization as a managed process rather than an automatic engine of prosperity. This theoretical contribution advances debates on global economic governance and offers a framework for policymakers to align investment dynamics with long-term development objectives.",

We then use representative survey experiment data from 1,967 UK residents to examine how susceptible the electorate is to such ecofascist ideas and whether exposure to climate change threat makes them more susceptible. Findings indicate that approximately one-fifth of the UK population is susceptible to an ecofascist ideology rooted in Volk, Kampf and Lebensraum. A sense of climate despair and anomie stemming from climate change threats, combined with predispositions toward social dominance and authoritarianism, and a conflicted relationship with nature, increases susceptibility to ecofascism significantly. We conclude by emphasising that this susceptibility could be exploited by right-wing actors in the future and the necessity to develop progressive responses to climate change threat.",

Each layer explains how motion replaces evolution. Based on evidence from 2023 to 2025, the study links government documents, institutional reports, and verified events to show that every crisis produces activity that protects the system more than it changes it.\nThe analysis follows this pattern across FATF compliance, transitional justice, foreign aid, protest movements, and road safety planning. These cases reveal that fragility in Nepal is not a moment of failure but a learned behavior of adaptation. Every disruption is absorbed and reorganized to restore balance. Instead of collapsing, power adjusts. The Survival Reflex Loop describes this habit of endurance, where reform, time, and hope become instruments for continuity rather than transformation.",

We showcase an application by replicating and updating Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2020) findings on home currency bias using N-PORT instead of commercial fund holdings data. Our results confirm that N-PORT data offer a comprehensive, reliable, and public alternative to commercial datasets for research in macroeconomics and finance.

          "authors": "Samet AYDIN",
          "abstract": "Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which gained rapid traction in the business world during the mid-1990s, soon lost its appeal due to numerous instances of failure, where substantial investments in system implementation failed to deliver the anticipated outcomes. The main reason for these failures was that businesses overly concentrated on the technological tools available at the time and their eagerness to use them while overlooking the core principles of the CRM approach, especially the strategic and human components. CRM is not just a technology; what truly matters are the business processes and human resources that implement them. Technology can only support these two essential components. Today, driven by advancements in information technology, shifts in consumer behavior and expectations due to e-commerce, mobile applications, and social media necessitate the redefinition and restructuring of CRM. In the Information Age, CRM has become indispensable for crafting, implementing, and enhancing value in the relationships between businesses and their customers. This paper discusses the reasons for CRM’s existence and its fundamental philosophy. In addition, it focuses on definitions related to CRM, its historical development, and the various ways in which it is important for businesses and their customers.",

          "abstract": "Political scientists now regularly use audio, video, and text data to investigate questions about deliberation, representation, and emotion. However, existing research using multimodal data focuses largely on highly professionalized settings like national legislatures where pre-processed data is often available. Although scholars can increasingly access a wide range of data on less standardized environments such as campaign events, committee hearings, and local government meetings, using videos of these events for research poses a number of common measurement challenges, including low quality transcripts, missing speaker information, idiosyncratic production styles, and varying formats. In this paper, we present a streamlined pipeline using open-source tools to automatically extract text (e.g. transcription), audio (e.g. vocal features), and images (e.g. scene detection) from videos of complex political events. The outputs of our pipeline can then be readily used for a wide range of substantive analyses. We validate our approach through an examination of local government meetings in the United States, showing how we can accurately segment audio, identify speakers, transcribe speech, and detect gender in videos of varying structure and audio/video quality. As a demonstration, we examine participation by gender in over 1,000 hours of school board meeting videos.",

We argue that the police act as strategic bureaucrats who increase the disclosure of out-group cues (ethnicity, nationality) when immigration is salient to signal transparency to the public. To test this, we use an LLM annotation pipeline to code out-group cues in about one million press releases published by local police stations across Germany (2014–2024). Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we demonstrate an increase in out-group cues in police communications (1) following a nationwide shock to immigration salience (the 2015/16 Cologne New Year’s Eve sexual assaults), and (2) in the days before regional state elections in which immigration is a salient campaign issue. Our findings demonstrate how bureaucratic discretion shapes the supply of politically charged information.",

Using the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and analyzing 40,000 genotyped mother–father–child trios, we test whether children’s polygenic indices (PGIs) predict subsequent fertility, partnership dissolution, and transition to marriage. Accounting for parental PGIs, we found limited evidence for evocative effects across most traits. The exception was that children with a higher ADHD PGI predicted increased parental partnership dissolution (7% [CI=2.9-11.8%] per s.d.), especially in families with daughters (11% [CI=4.9-18%] per s.d.), higher socioeconomic status (15% [CI=7.7-23.2%] per s.d.), and older maternal age at first birth (10% [CI=3-17%] per s.d.). The main source of variation is the socio-economic dimension where child-driven effects are stronger in higher-SES families. The study provides evidence for evocative gene-environment correlations in family demography, demonstrating the importance of child-to-parent effects in shaping family trajectories.",

However, reports of anti-vaccine policymaking (AVP) across state legislatures have been largely anecdotal. We offer a first-of-its-kind effort to quantify and standardize reporting of the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of AVP by introducing the State Vaccine Policy Project (SVPP) database; a content-coded record of every piece of vaccine-related legislation introduced across all US state houses from 2019 - 2023. SVPP data reveal that both the total volume and proportion of anti-vaccine bills introduced across state legislatures has been increasing steadily since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 1 in 10 anti-vaccine bills signed into law during that period. We also show that the rise in anti-vaccine legislating is attributable primarily to the legislative actions of state lawmakers affiliated with the Republican party, and that dozens of anti-vaccine bills directly aim to reduce the scope of vaccine mandates. In addition to offering a standardized and exhaustive assessment of the growth of anti-vaccine policy making across US state legislatures, our work provides scholars with a unique dataset for studying changes in the vaccine policy environment.",

Drawing from anthropological, feminist, and philosophical traditions, this work challenges the biomedical construction of intersexuality and proposes embodied approaches that center lived experience and agency. The analysis traces genealogies of bodily thought—from Cartesian dualism through phenomenology to contemporary feminist theory—while examining how power structures, medical discourses, and cultural norms shape intersex experiences. By articulating sociological and individual levels of analysis, this framework reveals intersexuality as a contested field where expert knowledge confronts activist voices, and where bodies become sites of both disciplinary control and transformative resistance. This theoretical contribution provides essential tools for ethnographic research on intersex lives and broader questions of bodily difference, gender variance, and biomedical normalization.",

This paper presents a case study of this matter using the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). A survey question included in this study attempts to measure student truancy across countries over time. The international survey documentation suggests an identical question has been used across countries and cycles. Yet the national documentation illustrates how a subtle – yet important – change to the wording was made in some countries in 2015. We demonstrate how researchers could easily miss this change and how this would impact inferences in changes in truancy rates before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Attempts to use artificial intelligence and large language models to spot this problem resulted in overconfidently incorrect advice. The findings thus serve as a reminder to even the most experienced data analysts (including ourselves) – ALWAYS READ THE SURVEY DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY.",

          "authors": "Sami Nenno; Philipp Lorenz-Spreen",
          "abstract": "Private wealth in Germany is highly concentrated and often inherited rather than earned. This concentration reinforces unequal distributions of political influence, income, and other capacities linked to wealth. Although public support for stricter taxation is widespread, left-wing parties have so far failed to reintroduce a net wealth tax or close inheritance tax loopholes. We analyze the social media communication from 2017 to 2025 on Facebook, Instagram, and X by German members of parliament and ads by business lobby groups. Specifically, we examine the salience of wealth taxation, argumentation patterns for and against stricter net wealth, inheritance, or gift taxes, and which arguments resonate with users. Our findings indicate that wealth taxation is not a frequent topic among members of parliament but generates higher user engagement compared to other policy issues. Left-wing parties rely on value-based arguments stressing inequality, injustice, and responsibility but rarely present concrete data on inequality or tax exemptions. Conservatives highlight threats to inherited homes, liberals emphasize economic risks, and the far right questions state intervention. We conclude that left-wing communication likely resonates primarily with their own supporters rather than broader audiences. The study contributes to a more holistic description of the political communication of  economic inequality.",

          "authors": "Wenjia Xia",
          "abstract": "With the rise of social media as a central arena for identity construction and social interaction, employers increasingly use social media information to evaluate candidates’ job fit. While such digital recruitment practices promise efficiency and precision, they also conceal underlying social risks such as the erosion of trust and the rise of surveillance capitalism. This raises an urgent question of how to balance individual rights, organizational efficiency, risk management, and fairness within the digital labor market. Yet existing studies have largely approached this issue from legal or managerial perspectives, without systematically examining the underlying logic of surveillance capitalism and its impact on social trust from a sociological standpoint. Drawing on an integrated analysis of existing theories and cross-national literature, this paper investigates the practice of social media screening from the perspectives of candidates, employers, and society. Building on this analysis, the paper delineates the ethical and regulatory boundaries of social media screening and identifies policy pathways toward a more inclusive and equitable digital labor market.",

          "abstract": "Telecommuting is often portrayed as a work-life balance measure. Though, in theory, telecommuting can provide workers with more time for leisure and family, due to the boundary blurring between work and life spheres, it can exacerbate gender inequalities by pushing women to carry out more domestic work while increasing men’s time in paid work. Empirically, the evidence is mixed. We extend the debate by exploring how individuals’ gender role attitudes moderate the relationship between telecommuting and the division of domestic work. We apply hybrid models to the German Family Panel data. The data covers the timespan from 2008 to 2021, which includes the unique COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that gender role attitudes matter. When getting access to telecommuting, egalitarian men increased their contribution to childcare, while traditional men did not. Similarly, telecommuting traditional women increased their childcare contribution. The pattern remained the same during the expansion of telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic: only telecommuting traditional women and telecommuting egalitarian men increased their childcare contribution. The results of this study suggest that telecommuting has the potential to serve as a ‘great equaliser.’ However, achieving this requires actively promoting more egalitarian views on gender roles.",

While many studies cite it, only some make thorough use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment World-Through, that builds on the walkthrough method but engages more productively with the app’s interface. This approach combines the technical walkthrough with a new theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment.

For this reason, this study aimed to examine the physical and emotional dimensions of older adults in the context of the pandemic, considering their history of virus infection. To carry out this analysis, we employed the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), the Gratitude Questionnaire (CG-6), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Visual Analog Scale for Pain Assessment (VAS), the Sleep Quality Scale (CS), and the Self-Reported Physical Activity Scale (FAF).This study was based on a sample of 71 individuals aged between 55 and 75 years (M= 63.07 years; SD= 5.49). The findings revealed that older adults who had previously been infected by the virus exhibited better mental health compared to their non-infected counterparts (p = .049, d = 0.48). Additionally, this group showed a higher tendency to engage in regular physical activities (p = .042; Phi = .250) and experienced an improved quality of life. However, it is noteworthy that stress and happiness levels in both groups were comparable, regardless of whether they had been exposed to the virus or not. In summary, this study suggests that older adults who had overcome COVID-19 infection demonstrated better outcomes in certain indicators of their physical and emotional well-being compared to those who had not been exposed to the virus.\nKeywords: older people, covid-19; mental health, quality of life, physical activity.",

          "abstract": "Causal reasoning is central to social sciences, supporting both theory development and testing. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to analyze texts across social sciences, yet their abilities to interpret causal statements and reconstruct causal structures remain uncertain in social science texts. This study examines to what extent LLMs can (a) identify causal sentences and (b) recover causal edges to reconstruct directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This examination relies on two text-based simulations and one experiment using real sociological texts. In simulated texts, models reliably detected explicit causal statements but often misclassified non-causal ones, particularly when probabilistic language was used. For causal graph recovery, clarity of expression strongly influenced accuracy. Across 500 replications with real texts, performance ranged from moderate to near perfect, revealing both model heterogeneity and inconsistency. These results indicate that LLMs can assist in extracting causal knowledge from social science texts, yet accurate inference of complex causal mechanisms still requires careful theoretical reasoning. Future applications may benefit from targeted prompting and domain-specific fine-tuning, but their contribution to sociological theorizing should be carefully assessed against traditional methodological standards.",

          "abstract": "A substantial body of research indicates that graduates’ field of study is a key predictor of the gender wage gap. While previous studies often compare groups based on women's minority status in a given field, we reframe this by distinguishing between care and non-care fields—defined by their links to stereotypically feminized characteristics. Using administrative data from Italy and Finland, we firstly investigate whether gender gaps in wages and other significant aspects of jobs differ between graduates of care- and non-care related fields of study. Second, adopting a comparative perspective, we further examine whether these gender gaps vary between Italy and Finland, two countries with different levels of gender inequality. Findings support the gender comparative advantage argument that women experience smaller gaps in outcomes when graduating from care-oriented fields than other fields, narrowing disparities in employment, wages, and job authority, and eliminating gender disparities in access to high-service occupations. Analyses are broadly consistent across Italy and Finland, suggesting limited cross-country variation in gender gaps in outcomes when comparing care and non-care fields.  \n\nKeywords: Care fields; Gender gap; Labour market; Administrative data; Comparative research",

          "abstract": "Background and Objectives\nAs people have fewer children and often remain single, siblings might be more active players\nin family networks of older adults who lack a partner, children, or both—referred to as\n“kinless”. This study examines (1) how the absence of children and/or a partner is associated\nwith exchange of support between siblings and (2) how intragenerational geographic proximity\nshapes these associations.\nResearch Design and Methods\nThis study utilizes multilevel ordinal logistic regressions of frequencies of exchanging practical\nhelp plus logistic regressions of providing personal care and population-based survey data from\nthe Generational Transmissions in Finland project connected to register data about individuals\naged 68–74 years in 2018 and their siblings.\nResults\nSiblings were found to be active supporters in later life. Partnerless older adults—particularly\nnever married—were more likely to receive practical help from siblings than those with\npartners. While childlessness alone did not increase sibling support, kinless older adults\nreceived the highest levels of help. Kinless individuals also provided more assistance and\npersonal care to siblings, even across long distances. Geographic proximity strengthened\nsupport exchanges, but kinlessness remained a strong predictor of support exchange regardless\nof distance. Finally, a 10 km threshold seems adequate for approximating help and care\nexchanges between siblings.\nDiscussion and Implications\nFindings highlight siblings’ role as a compensatory source of support in later life. Policies\nshould broaden caregiving definitions to include siblings, extend caregiver benefits beyond\nnuclear family ties, and develop services to facilitate both local and long-distance sibling\ncaregiving.\n\nKeywords: intragenerational relationships, personal care, practical help, geographic\ncloseness, childlessness, singlehood",

          "authors": "Qingqing Chen; Anna Zinn; Danyelle; Bettina Grün; Sara Dolnicar",
          "abstract": "State nature connectedness – a temporary emotional bond with nature – is associated with pro-environmental behavior, but it remains unclear whether state nature connectedness interventions cause pro-environmental behavior. This study investigates whether self-efficacy messages can trigger state nature connectedness, and whether a state nature connectedness intervention causes pro-environmental behavior (water conservation in hotels). We conducted an online experiment (N = 651) testing the effectiveness of nature images and self-efficacy messages in activating state nature connectedness, and an quasi-experimental field study in a hotel, using the hot water consumption of 6,154 guests as the dependent variable. Results indicate that a lush green landscape image featuring water droplets combined with a self-efficacy message significantly increased state nature connectedness (and water-saving intentions). However, the intervention did not translate into significant reductions in water use, challenging the assumption that a state nature connectedness intervention directly influences pro-environmental behavior. These findings underscore the necessity of field experiments in assessing the real-world effectiveness of behavior change interventions and emphasize the value of publishing null results to advance cumulative knowledge on promoting pro-environmental behavior change.",

          "authors": "Danyelle; Anna Kristina Zinn; Sara Dolnicar",
          "abstract": "Interventions designed to promote pro-environmental behaviour often yield inconsistent results. The Targeted Interception Theory of Behaviour Change offers a framework for improving effectiveness by aligning intervention strategies with the cognitive characteristics of behaviours, conceptualised along a continuum from habitual to scripted to considered behaviours. Across three studies, we empirically test key assumptions of this theory. Study 1 classified 18 pro-environmental behaviours based on self-reported mental processing, identifying four focal behaviours that span the continuum: purchasing energy-efficient white goods (considered), setting heating sustainably (scripted), choosing vegetarian/vegan meals at restaurants (semi-habitual), and purchasing carbon offsets with flights (highly habitual). Study 2 comprised four survey experiments comparing cognitive interventions (environmental messaging), behavioural-guidance interventions, and choice architecture changes (default change) against a control condition. While Study 1 confirmed that behaviours differ in cognitive demands, results from Study 2 were mixed: default changes increased intentions to purchase energy-efficient white goods and to choose vegetarian/vegan meals, whereas other interventions rarely outperformed the control. Study 3 reanalysed meta-analytic data from 137 field interventions, coding each by behaviour type (habitual or scripted) and intervention strategy (cognitive, behavioural-guidance, or choice architecture). These results supported theoretical predictions: choice architecture interventions were effective across both behaviour types; behavioural-guidance interventions were moderately effective for scripted behaviours but ineffective for habitual behaviours; and cognitive interventions had negligible impact. Together, these findings provide initial empirical support for Targeted Interception Theory, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to cognitive demands and underscoring the robustness of choice architecture as a strategy for promoting pro-environmental behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated social media's role in post-repression backlash mobilization but have yet to consider how they can sustain movements through long term repression. We explore this possibility by studying how Finnish climate activists responded to government repression in their social media behavior. We first conducted semi-structured interviews to see how activists understand the interplay between activism, repression, and social media affordances. Findings from our interviews suggest that activists are compelled to continue participating in the movement despite repression because the risk of social media amplifying individual-level chilling into movement-wide cascading demobilization outweighs risks from repression. We looked for evidence of this mechanism in the networked communication of Finnish climate activists on Twitter using temporal network analyses. Our findings show that activists' Twitter participation remained remarkably consistent despite offline repression, and that their communication patterns exhibited centralization tendencies that likely sustain the movement.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on 7,602 human-AI co-created physical designs from the “ZaoHaoWu” platform, this study promptly identifies and focuses on the IB-ID (I buy what I design) user group—individuals who embody dual identities as both designers and consumers—and examines how they embed identity narratives into products, thereby shifting from symbolic possession to meaning co-creation.\nWe developed a 2 (mobile vs. fixed context) × 2 (functional vs. decorative attributes) conceptual framework and employed visual language model (Qwen2.5-VLM) and large language models (Qwen3-turbo) to extract textual information from images, enabling thematic discovery and construction of fine-grained emotional semantic networks.\nThree key findings emerged:\n(1) User creative preferences can be categorized into four structural themes: Mythic, Whimsy, Sinofuturism, and Pastiche. Among them, Sinofuturism—which fuses local cultural symbols with futuristic imagination—achieved the highest social engagement, highlighting how strong cultural signifiers effectively stimulate high user participation.\n(2) Emotional expression is highly context-dependent: mobile contexts carry significantly more joy than fixed contexts, and decorative attributes further amplify positive emotions.\n(3) Functional products exhibit notably more cohesive emotional semantics, whereas decorative products display more dispersed emotional expressions. Collectively, these findings support the core proposition of our proposed Situational Self-Expression (SSE) theory—that self-expression is jointly shaped by usage context and product attributes.\nThese insights not only reconstruct McCracken’s Meaning Transfer Model (MTM) into an updated Meaning Co-Creation Model (MCcM), but also advance human-AI collaborative creation beyond virtual showcases into real-world consumption loops. They offer brands a three-dimensional design guideline centered on context–cultural symbols–emotion.",
