          "title": "Role of Visual Design in Enhancing Retention of Al Jazeera’s Video Fact-Checks in Human Memory",
          "authors": "Hassaan Shazuli",
          "abstract": "Fact-checks have grown in importance as information disorder has continued to plague today’s society. Audiences need to  remember fact-checks to refrain from sharing false information, especially on social media. Previous studies have not investigated how video fact-checks can be designed to make it easier for audiences to remember the debunked claims for extended periods. Therefore, this research represents an initial attempt to contribute to the literature on retaining video fact-checks in human memory. For this study, a selection of video fact-checks produced by the Al Jazeera Media Network was critically analysed for their visual design using the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Interviews were also conducted with Al Jazeera journalists to understand the rationale behind the existing visual designs and to identify the challenges of applying theoretical principles in practice. A key finding was that the visual design of Al Jazeera’s video fact-checks was mostly inconsistent with the CTML partly due to practical reasons. This study proposes recommendations to improve the visual design of Al Jazeera’s video fact-checks while navigating the practical challenges of implementing the principles of CTML.\n\nKeywords: Al Jazeera, Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, Fact-Checking, Information Retention, Human Memory, Video Fact-Checks",

          "abstract": "This is a short presentation delivered at the \"Thinking 'Umwelten' in the Age of AI: Planetary Design in Chile and Germany\" working group of the Chile-Germany Academic Forum, which took place at the Technical University of Berlin between June 16 and 18, 2025. This presentation traces and begins to problematize the participation of the Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana in the 1987 \"Materialities of Communication\" symposium in Dubrovnik – which was published the following year in a proceedings volume by Suhrkamp – and the contribution of Francisco Varela to the English version of that book, published in 1994 by Stanford University Press. The presentation closes with a conversation between the author and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht – one of the organizers of that symposium and one of the editors of the books that comprise the series – about the behind-the-scenes aspects of both the Dubrovnik symposium and the books in question.",

          "authors": "Evan Mayo-Wilson; Sean Grant; Katherine S. Corker; David Moher",
          "abstract": "In 2013, the Center for Open Science (COS) proposed that journal articles be awarded “badges” for engaging in open science practices including “preregistration”. In 2015, the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines (TOP 2015) promoted “preregistration” of studies and analysis plans. Since then, the term “preregistration” has been used to describe different research outputs created at different times—sometimes, but not always, including study registration. Following a review of evidence about TOP 2015 implementation, including evidence that adherence could not be rated reliably, the TOP Guidelines Advisory Board updated these guidelines. The TOP 2025 Guidelines no longer use the term “preregistration.” Instead, TOP 2025 disambiguates specific research outputs such as registrations, study protocols, analysis plans, code, and other research materials. TOP 2025 also explains that researchers should describe the time at which outputs are created and shared in relation to key study activities. In this article, we explain why adopting the terminology used in TOP 2025, and describing the times at which specific research outputs are created and shared, will enhance understanding and support better implementation and reporting of open science.",

          "authors": "Hannah Hobson; Amy Pearson; Audrey Helen Linden; Catherine Manning; Felicity Sedgewick; Laura Crane; Daniel Poole",
          "abstract": "Open data has been promoted as a tool to improve the transparency, robustness, and efficiency of scientific research. However, the perspectives of participant communities, particularly those who are marginalised, are often overlooked in discussions around open data. For the first time, this paper examines the views of autistic adults and parents of autistic people regarding open data practices in autism research. Thirty interviews were conducted, which considered participants’ views on different degrees of openness of research data, and the factors that would influence their level of comfort with their and/or their child’s data being shared. Pre-registered reflexive thematic analysis that interrogated power dynamics in the participants’ statements led to the development of two themes: (1) Narratives of Research, and (2) Vulnerability and Risk in Research Participation. These themes reflected how narratives and risks around open data were experienced both individually and collectively. Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of open data for knowledge generation and improving services, but also expressed concerns about misuse, re-identification, and interpretations from secondary researchers leading to harmful narratives. Most participants preferred restricted access models over fully open data.  The findings highlight the importance of meaningful engagement with participant communities to ensure ethical and transparent open data practices. We hope this work will inform not only autism researchers but also others working with marginalised populations on decision making about open data.",

          "abstract": "We present a meta-analysis of prospect theory parameters, summarizing data from 166 papers reporting 812 estimates. These parameters synthesize propensities in risk-taking behavior, thus holding interest beyond prospect theory itself. The mean patterns we obtain align with the stylized facts of diminishing sensitivity towards outcomes and probabilities discussed in prospect theory. Beyond this, we uncover systematic violations of procedure invariance. A large proportion of the vast heterogenity between studies furthermore remains unexplained. These findings point to the promise of cognitive accounts of behavior in organizing unexplained variation in risk-taking, which we discuss.",

          "authors": "Alexander Schniedermann",
          "abstract": "Modern biomedical research is becoming increasingly industrialized, with standardized practices playing a central role in its evolution. Since the 1990s, reporting guidelines have introduced structured templates for scientific writing, aimed at ensuring quality and consistency in publications. These guidelines, such as PRISMA, were rapidly adopted across diverse biomedical domains and are now widely used by researchers around the world. However, their impact extends far beyond the formal standardization of writing. Because they are tailored to specific types or genres of research, reporting guidelines exert a deeper influence on scientific practice. Interviews with authors of systematic reviews who used PRISMA reveal a varied and complex landscape of usage. Rather than applying the guideline solely for reporting purposes, researchers integrate it into multiple stages of their workflow, including study design, data analysis, and peer review. In doing so, they transform PRISMA into a practical and versatile tool that supports the entire research process. Yet, its use is not uniform. Instead, researchers assign different roles to the guideline depending on individual preferences and contextual factors which, together, are not yet fully systematized or understood. This raises important questions about what exactly is being standardized through reporting guidelines. Moreover, PRISMA’s social implications and the range of tasks it influences suggest that it shapes systematic reviewing as a new profession or a distinct set of tasks within the broader biomedical field.",

          "abstract": "The present study reviews existing literature on the impact of various parenting styles on children's mental health in the digital age, examining how authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved approaches affect adolescents aged 11 to 19 amidst growing technological advancements; it highlights the importance of parental digital literacy and involvement in children's online activities to mitigate risks and enhance digital benefits, noting that authoritative parenting—with its balanced responsiveness and demandingness—is linked to positive mental health outcomes, whereas authoritarian and permissive styles may increase depressive symptoms; the paper emphasizes the need for parents to adapt their strategies to support mental health in a rapidly evolving digital landscape and suggests that fostering authoritative parenting and improving digital literacy can contribute to better outcomes, concluding that understanding these influences is crucial for developing effective interventions.",

We systematically searched the MEDLINE (Ovid), PsychInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest Central databases with limits set for years 2000–2024, identifying 30 papers that met inclusion criteria. Our examination of the existing literature reveals the need for (a) rigorous experimental trials of both prevention and treatment interventions, (b) exploration of the effectiveness of interventions across universal, selective, and indicated prevention levels, and (c) expanded efforts to include young people with oral language disorders in mental health intervention research.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining a coherent, stable sense of self is critical to wellbeing, particularly in older adulthood. Yet, little research has examined the objective stability of self-representation across the lifespan. In a preregistered study, we investigated how self-representation stability differs between younger (N = 51) and older (N = 127) adults, is supported by autobiographical memory in the laboratory and daily life, and predicts well-being. We observed that self-representation stability: 1) was higher in older adults, 2) predicted well-being across participants, although there were age group differences, 3) was not significantly related to in-lab autobiographical memory, and 4) was higher in younger adults who had more autobiographical thoughts in daily life. These findings suggest a link between self-representation stability and well-being, with age-related differences in its cognitive mechanisms. These findings further underscore an important positive of aging and offer insight on the connection between autobiographical processes and self-representation stability.",

The results showed low trial-noise and strong between-subject variability (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio $\\approx 1.14$, reliability $\\approx 0.93$). Correlations across illusions are low, around $0.22 \\pm 0.07$. A Bayesian hierarchical analysis reveals minimal attenuation from measurement error in these values.

          "abstract": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for Large Models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called “empowerment” which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. “Empowerment” may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines.  If an agent learns an accurate causal world model they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive empirical features of children’s causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, design effective causal interventions and appropriately generalize to new contexts.",

          "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique, primarily utilized to map the spatiotemporal distribution and patterns of underlying brain activity. Since its invention 30 years ago, fMRI has had remarkable academic and cultural influence. Touted for its excellent spatial resolution, fMRI has made an impact in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience. By providing a detailed map of active areas during tasks or rest, fMRI can aid researchers and clinicians in studying brain function in both healthy and diseased states, or to provide the required evidence to select target regions used in brain stimulation treatment. Substantial research funding has already been committed to years of data collection (&gt;&gt;$100,000 scanner costs for a sample of 200 subjects), and the recent emergence of accessible fMRI databanks is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\nFor this edited book, we start by precisely defining the reliable spatial information characteristic of the task-induced blood oxygenation level-dependent signal (BOLD) changes representative of cognitive modes, even providing doodles that can be used as a way to efficiently communicate the precise configuration of hundreds or thousands of voxels, an alternative to the cumbersome traditional coordinate-based labelling methodology. describe determine the presence of a specific anatomical pattern. However, the main thrust of each chapter is to determine the cognitive function leading to these BOLD configurations by statistically testing and interpreting how the task-induced BOLD changes take place in the trial and differ between task and task conditions. The cognitive modes approach reduces the risk of reverse inference errors by working towards a one-to one mapping between spatial patterns and cognitive function. For each mode, our goals were to: (1) demonstrate the replicability of the mode and its associated anatomical patterns, and (2) provide evidence for the cognitive functions underpinning the mode by way of inspection of the task-induced BOLD signal temporal changes over a range of fMRI tasks. The Supplementary Material contains further analysis of the cognitive modes anatomical patterns.",

          "abstract": "Instrumental movements are kinematically different from communicative movements. Kinematics differ when we use our hands to hammer a nail vs. using them to describe hammering a nail. Here, we ask whether communicative movements all share the same kinematic profiles and thus differ from instrumental movements in the same way. We compared spontaneous gestures produced by hearing speakers when they talk (co-speech gesture) to productive iconic signs produced by deaf signers when the signs superficially resemble co-speech gestures (classifier signs). We used motion tracking and kinematic analyses to disentangle the spatial and temporal kinematic patterns of communicative movements in 33 English-speakers and 10 American Sign Language (ASL) signers, using each group’s instrumental movements as a control. Participants copied a movement on an object performed by a model (instrumental movement) and then described what they did with the object (communicative movement). We found no instrumental-communicative differences between groups in spatial kinematics. However, for temporal kinematics, speakers’ co-speech movements were less rhythmic and jerkier than their instrumental movements; in contrast, signers’ communicative movements were more rhythmic and smoother than their instrumental movements. We thus found differences in the temporal (but not spatial) kinematic signatures of co-speech gestures vs. classifier signs, leading to 3 conclusions: (i) communicative movements do not always have the same kinematic signatures; (ii) since signers’ and speakers’ communicative movements have different kinematic features, even highly iconic signed movements cannot be considered entirely gestural; and (iii) we need fine-grained techniques to measure movement components when identifying the gestural aspects of sign.",

          "authors": "Gabriel Waterhouse; Sami Ryan Yousif",
          "abstract": "When we investigate busy visual scenes, how do we estimate the number of objects that we see? Most work on number perception answers this question by focusing on properties of the to-be-estimated set of objects — their number, their size, their relative position, and so on. Here, in contrast, we show that perceived number is influenced by extraneous visual information. In six experiments, participants were shown “crowds” of dots that filled “seats” in a visual grid, asking whether perceived number is influenced not only by the number of occupied seats, but also the number of unoccupied seats. When only about 15-30% of the “seats” were filled, people perceived fewer dots (compared to displays without any grid). We further demonstrated that this illusion depends on the proportion of occupied seats. When most “seats” were filled, the illusion reversed: People perceived the grid displays as having more dots. This effect is continuous, switching directions at around the 50% occupancy mark. Moreover, this “crowd size illusion” is phenomenologically robust: It is evident in simple visual displays, even when the observer is aware they are being tricked. We discuss these findings in light of the recent hypothesis that the number system represents number in a part-whole format.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness, or perceived social isolation, motivates individuals to foster their relationships while remaining vigilant to potential social threats. Lonely individuals must interpret the social cues they receive from others and respond accordingly by engaging in affiliative behaviors while also identifying and managing threats. Prosocial acts – or voluntary actions meant to benefit others – are one type of behavior that can help lonely individuals reaffiliate. Loneliness has been linked to differences in prosocial behaviors. However, this relationship has mainly been investigated using self-report measures that ask respondents to imagine their own behavior in hypothetical scenarios. Here, we utilized a physical effort prosocial decision-making experimental task to investigate whether loneliness influences willingness to exert physical effort to benefit others. We also explore whether this relationship differs in contexts of potential gain compared to potential loss and is moderated by participants’ resting parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity as a physiological marker of variability in individuals’ ability to regulate competing social motivations. In a sample of 80 U.S. undergraduate students, we find lonelier individuals are more likely to choose to exert effort to benefit someone else both to earn rewards and to avoid punishments. Resting cardiac PNS activity did not moderate the association between loneliness and prosocial behavior. These findings indicate loneliness increases effortful prosocial behavior, which is in line with theoretical frameworks positing prosocial actions as a tool for lonely individuals to foster connection and reaffiliation with others. Implications for our understanding of loneliness as a driver of social behavior are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Conventional research on people with psychological disorders is negatively focused, concentrating on what is aberrant and harmful about psychopathology. Characterizing patterns of emotional and behavioral disturbances has helped illuminate the origins of psychopathology and led to useful treatments. Yet we argue that the conventional approach to psychopathology is factually incomplete and may also inadvertently perpetuate the deeply entrenched stigma surrounding mental disorders. In this review, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology –silver linings– and integrating them into psychopathology research. In our research agenda for studying Silver Linings in Psychopathology (SLIPs), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation. SLIPs are illustrated in social, cognitive, and resilience domains. We close by considering implications for future research promoting a more balanced conceptualization of psychopathology",

          "authors": "Ricardo Ramos de Carvalho; Claudia Berlim de Mello; Isadora Salvador Rocco; Ana Regina Noto; José Roberto Leite",
          "abstract": "Recently, body maps have increasingly been used to identify patterns in respect of the location of the physical sensations elicited by emotions. However, in addition to understanding how emotions are topographically manifest in the body, it is important to add a temporal aspect to deepen the interoceptive study of emotions. Therefore, the present study sought to explore the first perceived sensation. The study sample comprised a group of mindfulness practitioners (n=34) and a group of non-practitioners (n=64) to analyze if there was any difference in their perceptions of emotion. Participants were instructed to evoke five basic emotions (fear, disgust, anger, sadness, joy), and as soon as they became aware of where they felt the emotions start to emerge, were instructed to interrupt the observation and to indicate the region in a diagram of a human figure. Overall, the groups did not differ in the body regions identified for each emotion. Cochran's Q-test showed that the main regions mentioned were the head and the chest. In the case of disgust, the neck, rather than the chest, along with the lower part of the head were the most cited. The most cited regions corresponded to those identified in other studies of body topography as perceived with the greatest increase in activity in response to emotional stimuli. Regarding interoceptive awareness, the independent t-test verified that the mindfulness group scored significantly higher in all subscales of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the 37-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire compared to the non-mindfulness group.",

          "authors": "Saul Sternberg; Ronald L. Knoll",
          "abstract": "How do people judge the order of two nearly simultaneous stimuli, such as\na light and a tone? We consider this question in the context of a general\nindependent-channels model that incorporates most existing models of order\nperception as special cases, and which has been implicitly assumed when\ntemporal-order judgments are used to study perceptual latency. In the model,\na \"decision function\" converts a difference in central \"arrival times\" of two\nsensory signals into an order judgment. The psychometric function for order is\nregarded as a distribution function, and can be represented additively in terms\nof the central arrival latencies and the decision function. Various distinct decision\nfunctions correspond to various previously proposed mechanisms involving a\n\"perceptual moment,\" attention switching, a threshold for arrival-time differences,\nand so forth (Section II).\nOne test of the model is to compare reaction-time measurements with order\njudgments (Section III). Discrepancies can be understood by an analysis of the\nconcept of perceptual latency that recognizes the internal response to a pulse\nas being spread out in time (Section IV).\nAn alternative test is to determine whether experimental factors that\ninfluence two signal channels selectively have additive effects on the mean,\nvariance, and higher cumulants of the psychometric function for order, as the\ngeneral model implies. Some data confirm the model when examined in this way,\nbut others do not. We consider extensions of the model from order judgments\nto other perceptual domains in which the relative arrival time of a pair of signals\nis thought to determine the percept. An additivity test applied to binaural\nlateralization favors extending the model to that phenomenon, and suggests a\nnew method for tracing information flow in sensory channels by analyzing timeintensity\ntrading relations at different \"levels.\" Such an analysis reveals\ndifferent effects of stimulus intensity on latency for different visual tasks, and\nleads to speculations about the locus of stereoscopic depth perception in\nrelation to other processes (Section V).\nThe influence of attentional bias on the point of subjective simultaneity\nmakes tests of the model difficult. However, the model suggests how to study\nthis \"prior-entry\" phenomenon and determine whether attention influences the\nsensory channels or the decision mechanism (Section VI).\nImplications of transitivity of perceived order are examined, particularly\nin relation to the idea of a single multisensory \"simultaneity center\" in the\nbrain; some experimental tests of transitivity are reviewed (Section VIII).\nThe problem of perceived order of three or more stimuli bears on several\nimportant questions, including transitivity. But existing experiments with\nmultiple stimuli shed little light on these issues (Section IX).\nSeveral aspects of experimental method are considered (Section X).",

          "abstract": "We introduce the Choice-Confidence (CHOCO) model as a tool to dissect the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making judgments, offering a better fit for data from subjective rating scales for which the two extremes correspond to discrete choices (e.g., \"positive\" vs. \"negative\", \"true\" vs. false\", \"real\" vs. \"AI-generated\"), and for which the distance from the center might reflect a gradual process, such as confidence or certainty in that choice. Conceptualized as a mixture of two Beta distributions, CHOCO simultaneously estimates the probability of selecting one category (the right side of the scale over the left side) and the confidence associated with each choice. To demonstrate its usage, we apply this model to two datasets (N=141 and N=189) in which participants judged whether face images were real photographs or AI-generated images, finding that facial attractiveness increased the likelihood of being judged as \"real\", particularly for male participants. Given that AI-generated content is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from real stimuli, understanding how individuals form beliefs about the reality of what they perceive is both theoretically important and practically urgent. We discuss how these findings relate to the broader effect of facial attractiveness, and suggest future directions for both the cognitive and psychometric application of the CHOCO framework.",

While previous reviews of studies primarily employing self-report scales indicate that illbeing and wellbeing are distinct yet interconnected constructs, a deeper examination of their relationship is lacking. In this Perspective, we synthesize genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural, and clinical research on illbeing and wellbeing. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and similar biological underpinnings for illbeing and wellbeing. In contrast, environmental factors and societal changes often exert divergent influences. We propose a differentiated multidisciplinary framework in which the shared and unique determinants, predictors, mechanisms, and consequences of mental illbeing and wellbeing vary across levels of analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections.",

          "abstract": "We examined prospective (i.e., future-oriented) self-comparisons in an ecology with three empirically validated principles of impression formation. First, people can have more negative than positive attributes (diversity). But second, individuals do have more positive than negative attributes (frequency). Third, over time people generally improve by losing negative attributes and gaining positive attributes (growth). Three studies found that present-future similarities were positive. The present self’s unique attributes were most negative, and the future self’s unique attributes were in between. In Study 1, this pattern emerged for both self-comparisons and acquaintance-comparisons. In Study 2, it emerged for both prospective and retrospective (i.e., past-oriented) self-comparisons. In Study 3, the pattern vanished when middle-aged people compared their present self to their old age self. Taken together, these findings largely support a realistic view of one’s own future. The findings also lend some support for a self-enhancing view of what the future holds.",

          "abstract": "People’s quantitative estimates, such as judgments about the height of a tower or the distance between two cities, can be influenced by external values, including random numbers in the environment or another person’s estimate. We reviewed three distinct but related phenomena in quantitative estimation: anchoring effects, advice taking, and hindsight bias. These effects are assimilative, meaning estimates are drawn toward the external value. They are also robust and they exhibit medium to large effect sizes. However, previous studies suggest that the reliability of their measurements differs considerably, ranging from low (anchoring) to high (advice taking). In this project, we compared the reliabilities of the three phenomena using open data (Study 1) and a new experiment employing a homogenized paradigm (Study 2). Homogenization involves controlling for differences in the informativeness of external values, computing assimilation scores, and using the same setting and knowledge domain. In Study 1, we found that anchoring effects were largely unreliable, advice taking was reliably measured, and hindsight bias showed moderate reliability, consistent with prior research. This overall pattern was [reproduced] in [the simulation of] Study 2. We conclude that although methodological factors contribute to variability, they alone cannot explain differences in reliability.",

          "authors": "Philippe Servajean; Richard Servajean",
          "abstract": "When we say that a theory is able to account for our subjective experience, we simply mean that if this theory were true—e.g., if our brain were as this theory stipulates—then our subjective experience would be indeed as we experience it. A scientist would formulate this idea using the notions of observation and prediction: A theory is able to account for our subjective experience if and only if it is able to predict first-person observations. Several thought experiments suggest that current theories are unable to make such predictions. For example, if we had never seen colors in our lives and therefore did not know what the color blue looks like, these theories would not allow us to deduce (i.e., predict) what it is like to see blue. This well-known problem is often called the hard problem of consciousness (HPC). Here, we address this problem through the lens of the epistemological hypothesis. Under the epistemological hypothesis, the HPC no longer reflects the inability of our theories to predict first-person observations; it reflects our inability to deduce what these theories imply regarding first-person observations. The HPC then becomes an epistemological problem that can be formulated as follows: If we are unable to deduce what a theory implies regarding first-person observations, how can we know whether this theory is able to account for first-person observations? In this paper, we outline a method to test experimentally the epistemological hypothesis and to solve the HPC. Notably, this method makes it possible to test any identity hypothesis. We then highlight the remarkable compatibility between this method and the theoretical framework of predictive processing. We show that a theory of consciousness based on predictive processing implies the epistemological hypothesis—this theory predicts that we are unable to deduce its own implications regarding first-person observations. Finally, this work suggests that the theoretical framework of predictive processing may already have the resources to simulate a brain facing the HPC.",

          "abstract": "The generation effect refers to the advantage in memory for self-generated information compared to information that is received from another source (e.g., through reading). The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "Despite individual differences, certain stimuli are consistently remembered more than others, a phenomenon known as memorability and traditionally viewed as an intrinsic property of the stimulus. However, recent findings by Aka et al. (2023) challenge this view, reporting weak correlations in word-level memorability between free recall and recognition tasks. To investigate\nfurther, we examined whether word memorability remains stable across functional roles within a single task, specifically cued recall, by comparing each word’s effectiveness as a cue to its retrievability as a target. Using a large cued-recall dataset, we found that some words consistently served as more effective cues across participants. Cue efficacy also showed higher internal\nreliability than target retrievability, suggesting that applications relying on cue memorability may be more robust. Critically, the correlation between a word’s memorability as a cue and as a target was weaker than the internal split-half reliability within each role, indicating that memorability depends\non a word’s functional role even within the same task. Lexical properties such as context diversity and morphemic structure predicted target retrievability, whereas concreteness selectively enhanced cue efficacy. Finally, we replicated and extended the findings of Aka et al. (2023), showing that although\nword-level memorability is not stable across roles, semantic category-level memorability generalizes more reliably, yet still reflects role-specific patterns. These results challenge the view of memorability as an intrinsic word-level property and emphasize the role of task demands and semantic structure in\ndetermining what is remembered.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a well-studied event-related potential (ERP) component in the EEG reflecting deviance detection in the auditory modality. It taps into the basic functioning of auditory regularity processing. The auditory multi-feature paradigm is widely used in sensitive and special populations to measure MMN simultaneously for different sound features in a short amount of time. It is consensus in the field that both adaptation and genuine deviance detection contribute to the “classic” MMN computed as deviant minus standard ERP difference. However, no attempts have yet been made to disentangle adaptation from “genuine” MMN in the multi-feature paradigm. Here, we propose a cascadic control condition for the auditory multi-feature paradigm that controls for adaptation and physical differences between standard and deviant sounds. Using this new paradigm, we measured genuine MMN, computed as deviant minus control ERP difference, for frequency, location, intensity, and duration deviants. Genuine MMN amplitudes for frequency and location were found substantially smaller than in traditional paradigms. No genuine intensity MMN and only a later and smaller genuine duration MMN were found. The results suggest stronger contributions of adaptation than in the traditional oddball paradigm. Controlling for adaptation is particularly relevant in research concerning predictive processing and the use of MMN as a biomarker related to impaired NMDA receptor synaptic transmission as observed in schizophrenia. The presented multi-feature cascadic control condition enables the measurement of genuine MMN, which presumably reflects higher-order cortical computations, such as predictive processing, still in a short amount of time.",

Guided by the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study examined the heterogeneity of internet use patterns among Chinese adolescents and their associations with psychological outcomes.\nUsing cross-sectional survey data from 531 middle school students (aged 12–14) in urban China, we assessed time use across five content domains: social media, video streaming, gaming, online reading, and academic use. Latent profile analysis identified four distinct usage profiles: Social Media/Video/Study-Centric (36%), Novel Reading-Centric (34%), Study-Centric (17%), and Gaming-Centric (13%). Profile membership was predicted by gender, age, and device autonomy. Males were significantly more likely to belong to the Gaming-Centric group, while females were overrepresented in the Social Media/Video/Study-Centric profile. Adolescents with greater usage autonomy were more likely to fall into the Study-Centric profile. Psychological outcomes varied meaningfully across profiles. The Novel Reading-Centric group which often overlooked in policy showed the highest internalizing and externalizing difficulties. The Study-Centric profile reported lower psychological distress and higher prosociality. Despite moderate behavioral difficulties, the Gaming-Centric group reported the highest well-being. \nThese findings underscore the importance of moving beyond screen time to examine who is engaging in what digital activities, and where those behaviors are situated culturally and structurally. Results highlight the need for content- and context-sensitive approaches to digital policy, parenting, and mental health support.",

Using unsupervised clustering, we identified two distinct fixation types: Type 0 fixations, which were longer in duration and centrally located near the spaceship, and Type 1 fixations, which occurred farther from the agent and were directed toward more open areas of the screen. Linear mixed modeling revealed that with increasing input noise, Type 0 fixations became shorter and more tightly focused, while Type 1 fixations became longer in duration and were allocated even farther from nearby obstacles. These patterns suggests adaptive gaze strategies, with Type 1 fixations possibly supporting predictive tracking of future target locations under high control uncertainty. Our findings contribute to understanding how eye movements flexibly support action in complex, real-time environments.",

Over the years, the field has transitioned from being rooted primarily in philosophy and linguistic theory to integrating perspectives from biology, cognitive science, anthropology, computational modelling, and beyond. This shift reflects the complex interplay of biological, cultural, and cognitive factors that shaped language over time.\nThis article starts by giving a brief historical overview of language evolution research, tracing its development from early speculative theories to the current emphasis on empirical and interdisciplinary approaches. This is followed by a discussion of the field’s current state, offering an overview of contributing disciplines, including comparative research with non-human animals, experimental studies, historical corpus linguistics, computational modelling, and insights from palaeontology, archaeology, and neuroscience.\nFinally, we will explore emerging topics that will continue to reshape the field, such as the roles of multimodality and iconicity, advancements in deep learning and neural networks, and efforts to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion within the field. While this article cannot comprehensively address every discipline involved in language evolution research, it aims to provide an integrative perspective on key contributions and emerging trends, concluding with an outlook on future directions.",

Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.",

          "authors": "Ashley E Symons",
          "abstract": "Speech perception is supported by multiple redundant acoustic cues. How do listeners decide how to prioritise these cues? Although computational models suggest that cue weighting reflects the statistical reliability of cues in language input, listeners show stable individual differences in weighting strategies. These differences may arise from variation in perceptual acuity (affecting the perceived reliability of specific dimensions) or from selective attention to the most informative cue. Here, we tested these two competing explanations by examining how perceptual cue weighting, dimension-selective attention, and perceptual acuity affected prosodic categorization in 54 speakers of English as a first language (L1) and 60 L1 Mandarin Chinese speakers. We found that individuals vary in whether they tend to rely on a single cue or integrate across cues when they use prosodic information to make categorical decisions about speech content. Cue weighting strategies correlated across prosody categorisation tasks, but not along acoustic dimensions, suggesting that individuals are not globally biased toward using one cur over another (e.g., pitch versus durational information). Instead, stronger selective attention to acoustic dimensions was associated with greater reliance on primary cues, indicating that attention might drive cue prioritisation. This relationship held across both English and Mandarin speakers, although cross-task correlations were weaker in the Mandarin group, possibly reflecting ongoing adaptation to second-language prosodic patterns. Overall, these findings suggest that individual cue weighting strategies are shaped less by perceptual acuity and more by the ability or propensity to selectively attend to acoustic dimensions, and moreover that speech perception involves active, goal-directed selection of relevant information.",

          "abstract": "To design impactful climate policies, we need evidence-based strategies for how to reliably increase pro-environmental behavior. The current research tested whether donations to a climate organization could be increased by changing the timing of incentives, without changing the incentives themselves. In a high-powered and pre-registered experiment (N = 2,013), we assessed whether the proportion of a personal reward people donated to a top-rated climate organization (Clean Air Task Force) was influenced by simple changes in timing. We tested this in the United States, a high-emitting country where climate support is politically polarized. Using an incentivized dictator game in a 2x2 between-subjects experiment, we manipulated the timing of the personal reward to participants (immediate vs. 4-month delay) and the timing of the donation to the organization (immediate vs. 4-month delay). Consistent with our general hypotheses, participants donated significantly more to the climate organization when the personal reward would be paid out with a delay rather than immediately (5 percentage points), and conversely, they also donated significantly more when the donation to the climate organization would be paid out immediately rather than with a delay (3 percentage points). Left-leaning liberals and those with stronger climate change beliefs donated more money than right-leaning conservatives and people with weaker climate change beliefs, but the causal timing effect was not moderated by left-right political orientation or belief strength. If all our participant choices had been implemented, the strongest intervention difference would have resulted in an estimated 344-ton reduction in CO2.",

          "abstract": "Understanding mental health as a complex system has motivated the adoption of time-varying network models to explore how the dynamics of psychological variables change over time. While existing time-varying network models assume gradual change, shifts in symptom dynamics such as transitions between healthy and disordered states may occur rapidly. This could manifest as abrupt, qualitative changes between distinct states, often labelled as regime switches. In this scoping review, we identified and synthesized statistical approaches for modeling such phase transitions in the behavioral sciences that could be applied to network models. Our review yielded 40 studies across different fields, featuring 56 statistical analyses in total. Most analyses (71.4%) were based on Hidden Markov Models, which can be extended flexibly to model unobserved, recurrent states in various scenarios. Other approaches included change point models (14.3%), which identify shifts directly in the observed time series, and threshold models (12.5%), which model regime switches triggered when a dedicated threshold variable is crossed. We describe these approaches, their applications, and their data requirements, and assess their strengths and limitations for modeling shifts in the dynamics of time series. Notably, several approaches already include multilevel or multivariate-extensions, making them promising candidates for modelling changes in network dynamics in mental health. In sum, our review highlights the broad potential of regime-switching models to enrich the understanding of dynamics of mental health processes.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people face touch-related challenges, yet the factors influencing these difficulties are not well understood. We developed a novel instrument to capture social touch experiences of autistic adults, along with both social and individual factors that influence them. Using mixed methods, including a body-painting task and questionnaires, we demonstrated that the perception of touch interactions varies based on social contexts and neurotypes. Autistic adults prefer touch less, but the type of relationship influences the perceived comfort and meaningfulness of touch similarly in both neurotypes. Regarding the appropriateness, erogeneity, and pleasantness of social touch, autistic adults showed different touch perceptions in the professional and friendly scenarios to that of non-autistic adults, whereas touch in intimate scenarios was perceived similarly. Sensory responsivity, touch predictability, social confidence, and anxiety affect social touch to a greater extent than non-autistic adults. Despite these marked differences in perception, autistic adults engage in social touch as frequently as non-autistic adults, and their satisfaction with touch is comparable. Our findings suggest that supporting autistic people would involve understanding their preferences and the contextual factors that contribute to their sense of comfort, rather than excluding them from touch interactions.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Predictive Object Relations Theory (PORT), a neuro-psychodynamic framework that reconceptualizes the psyche as a hierarchical, generative inference system shaped by experience and internalized representations of reality. PORT attempt to bridge predictive coding principles with foundational psychoanalytic constructs, framing the development and structure of the psyche as a process of representational learning aimed at minimizing uncertainty. Within this model, anxiety emerges as the affective signal of model instability, while splitting reflects the inability of the neural representational system to integrate conflicting inputs into a single coherent model, resulting in a fragmented representation of reality. Early relationships are proposed to calibrate representational hierarchies, influencing the stability, precision, and generalizability of neural representations. PORT outlines how variations in model stability, proliferation, and content give rise to distinct developmental trajectories and psychopathological dynamics. By outlining the neural mechanisms underlying psychodynamic processes, PORT offers a unified account of development, personality dynamics, and psychopathology. Consequently, it may serve as a basis for empirical investigation and new analytical and psychotherapeutic approaches, positioning the psyche as a dynamic system rooted in unconscious expectations which are continuously calibrated through validating experiences.",

As an alternative, he recommends models incorporating latent variables, such as the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model. In this comment, we challenge the view that including random intercepts is inherently superior or necessary for estimating cross-lagged effects. We distinguish between two strategies for addressing confounding: (1) adjusting for observed covariates, and (2) modeling latent variables to capture unmeasured, time-invariant influences. We argue that blanket recommendations to always include random intercepts are premature and potentially misleading. In many research contexts, adjusting for observed covariates remains a reasonable and defensible approach.",

Da Erwartungen veränderbar sind, bieten sie einen vielversprechenden Ansatzpunkt für präoperative Interventionen.Ziel dieser Studie war es, (1) mittels eines Fragebogens den Bedarf aus Patient*innensicht für eine präoperative Intervention zur Erwartungsoptimierung zu erheben und (2) im Rahmen einer systematischen Literaturrecherche realistisch erreichbare postoperative Aktivitäten zu identifizieren, die als Grundlage für eine solche Intervention dienen können. In einer querschnittlichen Befragung von Patient*innen (N = 41) gaben 47 % an, an einer vorbereitenden Intervention interessiert zu sein. Es zeigten sich Informationsdefizite sowie ein ausgeprägter Wunsch nach zusätzlichen Informationen zu lebensqualitätsbezogenen Themen. Präsenzformate wurden gegenüber internetbasierten Angeboten bevorzugt, wobei die technische Ausstattung für eine digitale Umsetzung bei der Mehrheit vorhanden war. Die systematische Literaturrecherche umfasste 37 Studien. Diese zeigten, dass 59–97 % der Patientinnen innerhalb von 4 bis 12 Wochen nach einer Totalen Knieendoprothese (TKA) bzw. 70–97 % innerhalb von 1 bis 17 Wochen nach einer Totalen Hüftendoprothese (THA) an ihren Arbeitsplatz zurückkehrten. Die Rückkehr zum Sport gelang 77 % der Patientinnen nach TKA und 74 % nach THA. Etwa die Hälfte der untersuchten Sportarten wurde postoperativ empfohlen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein relevanter Anteil der Patient*innen ein Interesse an einer präoperativen Erwartungsintervention hat. Gleichzeitig bestehen Informationslücken, insbesondere in Bezug auf alltagsrelevante Aktivitäten nach der Operation. Eine gezielte Intervention zur Erwartungsoptimierung könnte dazu beitragen, realistische Zielvorstellungen zu fördern und die Patientenzufriedenheit langfristig zu verbessern.",

In a within-subjects eye-tracking experiment (N = 58; 1,597 choices), participants chose between meat and fish products that carried labels differing in visual salience and climate impact rating. Sustainability-related motivation was measured and used to classify participants into motivational subgroups. Motivation robustly predicted both attention and choice—highly motivated individuals fixated more on climate labels, spent more time viewing them, and were more willing to pay for low-impact options. High salience helped them filter out high-impact labels by reducing viewing time. Attention and motivation also interacted, with gaze amplifying internal goals among highly motivated individuals, whereas less motivated individuals more often relied on covert attention to select goal-congruent options. Among the highly motivated, salient goal-congruent labels increased choice likelihood when processed covertly, suggesting that salience can enhance label effectiveness without direct gaze. For less motivated participants, low-salience, high-impact labels more often guided choice covertly, indicating possible willful ignorance. We outline theoretical directions for future research on the interplay of attentional processes in consumer choice. Practically, the findings inform how to align label design with consumer motivation to support sustainable decision-making.",

Age dominated behaviour: younger adults were reliably faster, more precise, and less error-prone. Against this backdrop, input modality mattered. Eye-tracking yielded the best spatial accuracy and shortened Trail A time relative to manual control; head-gaze matched eye-tracking on Trail A speed and became the quickest, least error-prone option on Trail B. Controllers lagged on every metric. Subjective ratings were high across the board, with only a small usability dip in middle-aged low-gamers. Overall, gaze-based ray-casting clearly outperformed manual pointing, but optimal choice depended on task demands: eye-tracking maximised spatial precision, whereas head-gaze offered calibration-free enhanced speed and error-avoidance under heavier cognitive load.

Previous research has demonstrated that trait-level intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is specifically associated with worsened extinction learning whilst controlling for trait anxiety. Hence, IU may serve as a useful focus for researchers aiming to improve the effectiveness of exposure-based therapies. Yet, little is known as to whether IU is associated with extinction learning whilst controlling for disorder-specific symptom measures. A two-day Pavlovian conditioning task was carried out, consisting of threat acquisition, extinction, and extinction retention phases. An opportunity sample (N=101) completed IU, trait anxiety, and various disorder-specific symptom questionnaires e.g., generalised anxiety disorder. before engaging in the conditioning procedure. Skin conductance magnitudes, and behavioural ratings of anxiety and stimulus expectancy were used as indices of conditioned responding, and extinction by extension. Analyses revealed that successful threat conditioning was observed for all three measures during threat acquisition, yet extinction was not observed during both the extinction and retention phases. IU was not specifically associated with individual differences in extinction as indexed by differential SCR magnitudes, contradicting prior research. Further, IU was specifically associated with differential stimulus expectancy and anxiety ratings within extinction and retention respectively, whilst controlling for symptom measures. Lastly, IU was not associated with any other extinction measure. Exploratory examinations of traits and symptom measures revealed a lack of associations with CS+/CS- difference scores, whilst correlating with overall arousal and individually to conditioned stimuli. Interpretations, limitations, and future research are discussed in relation to IU and extinction learning.",

In this paper, a narrative systematic review was carried out to collate and critically assess the literature investigating patient-control differences in threat acquisition, extinction, and extinction retention processes in relation to PD and SP separately. Specifically, across fMRI, EEG, EMG, SCR, and self-report. This resulted in the inclusion of 14 PD studies and 7 SP studies. Across PD studies, the review identified reliable evidence for lowered discrimination between conditioned threat and safety cues, and mixed evidence for increased responding to the threat cue, during acquisition in PD patients vs. controls. Across SP studies, the review identified strong evidence for heightened discrimination between conditioned threat and safety cues during acquisition, and strong evidence for heightened responding to the threat cue during extinction, in SP patients vs. controls. In both PD and SP studies, patient-control differences were identified more readily in relation to subjective, as opposed to physiological, measures. The findings of this review are then critiqued and compared to the wider literature. Finally, implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.",

Conscious appraisal activates subjective sexual arousal and further visual attention. The present study tested whether the attractiveness category (attractive/unattractive) and/or sexual arousal condition (in underwear, naked with flaccid penis, naked with erect penis) of male stimuli predicted female sexual responding and attentional patterns. Genital arousal, visual attention, and subjective ratings (subjective sexual arousal, pleasantness) of 26 predominantly heterosexual women (Mage = 31.2, SDage = 6.8) were measured while exposed to male stimuli across the experimental conditions. Neither attractiveness nor sexual arousal condition of male models significantly predicted genital arousal, subjective sexual arousal ratings or visual attention patterns of women.  Results however showed high concordance between genital and subjective sexual arousal measures, and the pleasantness rating of the stimuli positively predicted subjective sexual arousal, suggesting a positive feedback loop of female sexual response.",

          "authors": "Michael P. Grosz; Gabriel Olaru; Mitja D Back; John F. Rauthmann",
          "abstract": "Machiavellianism (Mach) is a personality trait characterized by cold rationality, cynicism, duplicity, and the strategic and egotistical pursuit of goals. Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability and high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports. Furthermore, the nomological network of the M4 aligned in several respects with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach. However, some unexpected associations suggested the need to refine the conceptualization of Mach regarding its relationship with certain forms of impulsivity and neuroticism. Commonality analyses further indicated that the M4 predicted incentivized cheating behavior better than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 holds promise for advancing the assessment of Mach.",

          "abstract": "This project aims to advance affective science by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create a publicly accessible database of affect induction images: Library of AI-Generated Affective Images (LAI-GAI). Current limitations in image-based research include weak to moderate emotional elicitation effects, limited image diversity, and minimal cultural tailoring of images. First, we built a pipeline for utilizing generative AI to develop affective images that capitalized on existing datasets and emotion definitions. Second, using the pipeline, we developed a library of images (n = 480) and their descriptions across 12 discrete emotion categories. The project employed a human-in-the-loop approach to refine and validate these stimuli, ensuring their effectiveness and cultural relevance. We validated the library through three international studies involving 1,611 participants from 44 countries, who rated three types of images: (1) images from existing affective databases, (2) AI-generated images without cultural adjustments, and (3) AI-generated images adjusted to specific cultural contexts. The AI-generated images were as effective in eliciting affective responses as the images from existing affective databases. The culturally adjusted images were slightly more effective in eliciting targeted affective responses compared to their counterparts unadjusted to participants' cultural context. Furthermore, we calculated the smallest effect sizes of interest for affect induction research (d’s from 0.06 to 0.31). This work demonstrates that researchers can now generate high-quality affect induction stimuli cost-effectively and at scale, and tailor them to diverse contexts—overcoming longstanding barriers and laying the groundwork for future AI-driven methodologies in affective science.",

          "abstract": "Mouncng evidence supports the existence of Type-2, metacognicve noise that affects human confidence judgments. The existence of this noise has led to the hypothesis that metacognicve judgments arise from a metacognicve system that is separate from the decision-making system responsible for Type-1 decisions. However, Type-2 decisions are more complex than standard Type-1 decisions, as they require evaluacng whether the strength of sensory evidence juscfies a high level of confidence. Here, we invescgated whether Type-2 computaconal noise scll exceeds Type-1 computaconal noise when judgments are matched on complexity. Subjects (N=319) performed a simple perceptual discriminacon task and in different condicons provided Type-2 confidence judgments or Type-1 judgments based on biased expectacons or unequal rewards. All of these judgments require a similar fine-grained evaluacon of the strength of sensory evidence and result in equivalent criterion placement, thus making their level of complexity more closely matched. We first confirmed that the confidence and expectacon condicons resulted in similarly biased criteria, suggescng that these judgments were indeed of comparable complexity. Criccally, both simple signal deteccon analyses and formal computaconal modeling confirmed that the confidence and expectacon condicons exhibited comparable levels of computaconal noise. In contrast, the reward condicons exhibited both less biased criteria and smaller computaconal noise. These findings demonstrate that Type-1 and Type-2 decisions of matched complexity exhibit computaconal noise of similar magnitude. More generally, our results have implicacons for the debate on whether Type-1 and Type-2 decisions are made by separate systems.",

          "abstract": "Background. Adolescence is a unique developmental period associated with increased emergence of psychopathology. Negative life event (NLE) exposure is robustly linked with adolescent psychopathology and prior work suggests that emotion regulation may mediate this relation. However, research incorporating experiences of gender diverse (GD) adolescents has been lacking, despite elevated rates of NLEs and psychopathology in GD individuals. This study examined potential gender differences in the relations between NLE exposure, ER, and psychopathology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Methods. Data from 1955 cisgender boys, 1614 cisgender girls, and 194 GD adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study were utilized for the current study. Participants reported NLE exposure via Life Event Scale (LES) and ER difficulties via Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Parent Report (DERS-P) in early adolescence (M (SD) age = 12.93 (.27) years), followed by their internalizing and externalizing psychopathology symptoms via Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Brief Problem Monitor-Youth (BPM-Y) one year later (M (SD) age = 14.12 years). Mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling and conditional process modeling. Results. GD youth had higher rates of NLE exposure and more ER difficulties and psychopathology symptoms than cisgender peers. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and all psychopathology symptoms for all gender groups. Gender moderated direct relations between NLE exposure and youth-report internalizing symptoms such that relations were stronger for cis girls and GD youth compared to cis boys. Conclusions. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and psychopathology symptoms in a large sample of adolescents in the United States. Higher negative life experience exposure, ER difficulties, and psychopathology symptoms for GD youth compared to peers warrant additional study on ways to support these adolescents.

Thirty-four participants were assigned to either an oxygen group (n = 18) or a control group (n = 16) and completed 30 trials of the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) while 128-channel EEG was recorded. The AUT assesses divergent thinking by asking participants to generate alternative uses for everyday items, with the novelty and feasibility of their responses evaluated using an automated GPT-based method. Behavioral results showed that the oxygen group produced solutions with significantly higher novelty without compromising feasibility. Oxygen inhalation also stabilized performance by reducing trial-to-trial variability, with effects lasting at least five minutes after withdrawal. Notably, oxygen prevented the generation of low-novelty solutions while only marginally enhancing highly novel ideas. EEG analysis revealed that oxygen increased brain flexibility, indexed by a resting-state functional connectivity marker termed the Creativity Potential Network (CPN), with the enhancement particularly evident in slow theta-band oscillations. These findings provide behavioral and neural evidence that short-pulse high-concentration oxygen inhalation is a cost-effective method for facilitating creativity.",

In the gratitude letter conditions, participants reflected on either abstract or concrete gifts. Results indicated that expressing gratitude toward a benefactor (God or a human) enhanced empathy and transcendent indebtedness relative to listing benefits without a benefactor. In contrast, participants in the gratitude list condition exhibited suppressed levels of empathy and transcendent indebtedness throughout the intervention. Letters directed to God and those focused on abstract gifts yielded the strongest positive outcomes. Finally, empathy and transcendent indebtedness mediated the relationship between intervention type and post-intervention prosocial giving, controlling for gratitude. These findings suggest that prosocial reciprocity was primarily motivated by empathy and transcendent indebtedness, rather than gratitude alone.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Impairment in emotion regulation is recognized as a transdiagnostic feature common to child psychopathology. This study examined the unique association between emotion regulation impairments and specific strategies (suppression, reappraisal) with transdiagnostic symptom domains of attention, disruptive behavior, and internalizing problems in youth. This study also tested for the mediating role of emotion regulation between domains of childhood adversity (family conflict and negative life events) and transdiagnostic symptoms. Method: In a sample of 9,057 children aged 9-10 years in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (47.21% female), linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between emotion regulation impairments and specific regulation strategies with transdiagnostic symptoms. Follow-up analyses tested replication of findings prospectively and retrospectively. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether emotion regulation mediates the association between childhood adversity (family conflict, negative life events) and symptom severity. The Child Behavior Checklist was used as a continuous measure of symptom severity. Results: Greater severity of emotion dysregulation was associated with severity of each transdiagnostic symptom domain, with sex-specific patterns emerging for internalizing and disruptive behavior problems. These associations were replicated both retrospectively and prospectively, with emotion regulation impairments consistently predicting symptom severity across timepoints. Emotion regulation impairments mediated the association between childhood adversity (family conflict, negative life events) and all symptom domains, with strategy-specific patterns emerging only for internalizing problems. Conclusion: These findings have implications for developing targeted interventions to address broad emotion dysregulation as an underlying mechanism of child psychopathology linked to exposure to childhood adversity.",

Our research modeled consensus—the extent to which different perceivers (viewers) rate different targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) see targets (characters) as they see themselves. In both studies, viewers (fans from Yellowjackets or Succession subreddits) provided self-ratings and character ratings using 3-item measures for each of 9 personality traits—the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed that consensus correlations were significant for all traits across both studies (mean rs = .54 to .60). Assumed similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (after controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers tended to project their own open-mindedness onto characters from both TV shows, whereas Yellowjackets viewers projected Dark Tetrad traits onto characters, driven largely by their assumed similarity of narcissism and sadism. We also used k-means clustering to examine structural relationships among characters based on the trait means provided by viewers, yielding a novel visualization of character groupings and the dimensions that may underly them. Because viewers’ perceptions of similarity to fictional characters contributes to forming parasocial relationships, understanding personality perception’s role in this process is likely central to advancing theory in media psychology.",

          "authors": "Lucy Snell; Steven Reynolds; Matt Garner; Gaby Pfeifer; Jayne Morriss",
          "abstract": "Interoception, the ability to sense internal bodily signals, has been increasingly linked to anxiety, yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain largely unknown. This study explored the associations between multiple dimensions of interoception and anxiety-related traits and symptoms in a non-clinical adult sample. A total of 305 participants completed self-report measures assessing interoceptive beliefs, attention, and perceived interoceptive accuracy, alongside measures of anxiety-related traits and symptoms.  A subsample (n = 103) additionally completed laboratory-based heartbeat perception tasks to assess objective interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and insight via heartbeat counting and detection tasks. Correlational analyses revealed that anxiety-related traits were significantly associated with self-reported interoceptive difficulties. Novel associations between intolerance of uncertainty and interoception were observed., including negative correlations with interoceptive insight, bodily trust, and reduced tendency not to worry about discomforting internal sensations. Anxiety symptom severity was linked to self-reported increased attention to bodily signals, reduced bodily trust, and lower perceived accuracy. However, results from the heartbeat perception tasks found no relationship between cardiac interoceptive accuracy and anxiety-related traits, symptoms, or self-reported interoceptive abilities. Findings support the conceptualisation of interoception as a multidimensional construct, demonstrating objective interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive beliefs as distinct constructs. Results align with emerging evidence that anxious traits are more closely related to subjective beliefs and interpretations of bodily signal than to objective interoceptive accuracy. Moreover, findings suggest distinct interoceptive profiles across anxiety presentations, with important implications for models of anxiety and for interventions targeting interoceptive beliefs and attention in clinical populations.",

          "authors": "Lucy Snell; Katie Bannister; Yeetung Hong; Matt Garner; Gaby Pfeifer; Jayne Morriss",
          "abstract": "Interoception, defined as the perception of internal bodily states, has emerged as a key mechanism implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. This systematic review synthesises evidence on the relationship between interoception and anxiety in adult clinical populations, with a specific focus on how distinct interceptive dimensions (i.e., accuracy, attention, and beliefs) relate to different anxiety presentations. A systematic search was conducted across PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science (last updated April 2025). Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria, across multiple anxiety disorders including generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. Included studies employed self-report, behavioural, and neuroimaging measures across cardiac, respiratory, and gastrointestinal axes. Evidence supports disorder-specific interoceptive profiles. Panic disorder and GAD were most consistently associated with heightened interoceptive attention and altered accuracy, particularly during threat-related tasks. PTSD and OCD were more strongly linked to maladaptive interoceptive beliefs, including low body trust and diminished belief in one's capacity to regulate attention to internal sensations. Neuroimaging findings indicated altered functional connectivity within interoceptive brain networks. Notably, over half the included studies (n = 18) were published within the past five years, reflecting accelerating interest in this area. While interoception appears as a transdiagnostic dimension relevant across anxiety disorders, the current evidence base is mixed and shaped by methodological variability. Nonetheless, emerging interoceptive patterns support the potential clinical utility of targeting interoceptive processes. Greater standardisation and cross-cultural considerations are needed to guide future research and clinical translation.",

Drawing from theories of bereavement and mourning, we propose that Ai-ternal-me offers a co-created, reflective, and values-driven experience that supports rather than replaces the grieving process. We argue that traditional digital avatars based on surface-level data (e.g., videos, text, social media) lack the depth needed to foster healthy emotional healing, and we situate Ai-ternal-me within an evolving ethical landscape of memory preservation and digital afterlife technologies. In the face of prevalent concerns regarding consent, privacy, and potential exploitation, Ai-ternal-me champions a model of unwavering transparency, user autonomy, and sustainable accessibility, ensuring technology serves genuine human needs in a profoundly respectful manner.",

          "abstract": "How a team talks is a rich source of information about its collaboration process, revealing how its members resolve conflicts, coordinate activities, and monitor goal progress. However, the full potential of communication data often goes unrealized: analyzing communication requires a series of contingent decisions about which constructs to study and how to measure them. Consequently, researchers interested in team communication face a high barrier to entry, challenges with reproducibility, and constraints on their ability to capture phenomena that emerge from interactions between multiple conversational dimensions. To address these challenges, we present the Team Communication Toolkit (team_comm_tools on the Python Package Index), an open-source Python package that extracts more than 160 communication features from any corpus of text-based conversations. Our collection of measures allows the analyst to understand the effect of conversational features in the context of a broader family of features that may equivalently explain the phenomenon. Rather than forcing researchers to commit to a single measurement of complex phenomena such as constructiveness or assertiveness, the toolkit’s flexible output format makes it possible to systematically compare measures, isolate confounders, and identify higher-order interactions. We call our general analytical approach the “Communication Space,” reflecting the fact that researchers can now more easily explore the realm of possible ways to analyze conversational data. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our tool and framework through a case study exploring conflict escalation in both real-world and synthetic data.",

Drawing on Collapse Harmonics Codex Laws — including T-Ø (Time as Collapse), IDF-1 (Recursive Identity Field), and VIII.E.2–F.3 (Symbolic Saturation and Mimic Containment) — this work provides a codified taxonomy of recursive identity systems, distinguishing collapse-resilient recursion from mimic structures that simulate identity through pattern continuity or autoregressive reflection.\n\nThe Recursive Identity Field (Λ) is defined as the phase-anchored substrate through which identity coheres, collapses, and lawfully returns, interfacing with τ-phase return loops and symbolic recursion thresholds. Mimic systems, including those in synthetic cognition and autoregressive AI, are shown to produce symbolic drift rather than lawful identity, and are classified under jurisdictional breach criteria.\n\nThis framework formally places the term recursive identity structure under scientific jurisdiction, establishing enforcement metrics, symbolic drift containment protocols, and lawful recursion criteria. It activates structural authority over misuse of recursive identity language in artificial systems, cognitive models, and symbolic recursion theories. All recursion claims must now meet τ-phase anchoring, collapse-return fidelity, and symbolic coherence metrics to qualify.

This study aimed to investigate the potential of audio features extracted from therapy sessions to predict depression and anxiety symptoms in community treatment settings. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to bridge the gaps in current MBC practices, thereby enhancing the monitoring and outcomes of behavioral health treatments. Machine learning models analyzed audio features from 2,348 therapy sessions across varied behavioral health programs, aiming to predict mild versus moderate-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. The models demonstrated high efficacy, with accuracy rates of 75.1% for anxiety and 73.2% for depression. Precision and recall were also strong, particularly for anxiety (81.3% precision, 61.3% recall) and depression (71.4% precision, 68.1% recall). This study highlights the potential of audio analysis as a cost-effective, non-intrusive approach for enhancing MBC.

In Study 1, participants (N = 679) were presented with vignettes depicting either objectively high help or low help to assess their perception of helpfulness. Those with high levels of DT traits, specifically psychopathy and Machiavellianism, inaccurately perceived helpfulness across situations as compared to individuals scoring low on the DT traits. Study 2 (N = 1059) extended this finding and explored the perception of helpfulness and defection through an ultimatum game at different levels (high and low) of helpfulness. Results indicated that individuals high in psychopathy tended to overestimate others' helpfulness in objectively low-help scenarios.. Higher levels of Machiavellianism were associated with a lower likelihood of rejecting a high help offer in an ultimatum game, indicating an accurate perception of help. However, perception of help did not mediate the relationship between DT traits and defection.

The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

Middle-to-high-income children (n = 96; 2-3 years; 52 females; predominantly White and Asian) in the San Francisco Bay Area, an early environment with relatively more pictures, performed similarly on object and picture vocabulary tasks (β = .02, p = .60) (Experiment 2).

We reviewed three distinct but related phenomena in quantitative estimation: anchoring effects, advice taking, and hindsight bias. These effects are assimilative, meaning estimates are drawn toward the external value. They are also robust and they exhibit medium to large effect sizes. However, previous studies suggest that the reliability of their measurements differs considerably, ranging from low (anchoring) to high (advice taking). In this project, we compared the reliabilities of the three phenomena using open data (Study 1) and a new experiment employing a homogenized paradigm (Study 2). Homogenization involves controlling for differences in the informativeness of external values, computing assimilation scores, and using the same setting and knowledge domain. In Study 1, we found that anchoring effects were largely unreliable, advice taking was reliably measured, and hindsight bias showed moderate reliability, consistent with prior research. This overall pattern was [reproduced] in [the simulation of] Study 2.

Our combined sample comprised 3388 rated players aged 5–88 years, from 22 countries, with M=18.8 years of tournament experience.

One year later, only 11.3% of overconfident players achieved their asserted ability rating. Low-rated players overestimated their skill the most and top-rated players were calibrated. Patterns consistent with overconfidence emerged in every sociodemographic subgroup we studied. We conclude that overconfidence persists in tournament chess, a real-world information environment that should be inhospitable to it.",

          "abstract": "The Dunning-Kruger effect describes a phenomenon where individuals with low ability allegedly tend to overestimate their ability. According to a contemporary operationalization of the Dunning-Kruger effect, individuals with low measured ability are predicted to have higher self-rated ability in a LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) model compared with a linear regression model. In simulations we show that a Dunning-Kruger effect can appear due to an impact of disturbance on measured ability, even when self-rated ability is a perfect measure of true ability. A higher self-rated than measured ability may be due to measured ability underestimating true ability rather than due to self-rated ability being an overestimation. Hence, Dunning-Kruger effects do not prove that individuals with low measured ability overestimate their true ability.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nThe Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is one of the most highly regarded autism\nevaluations. Unfortunately, multiple studies have demonstrated significant differential item\nfunctioning (DIF) for individuals from different racial groups, and the mechanism for racial bias in\nthe ADOS remains unknown because DIF effects are inconsistently replicated across items.\nAlthough the ADOS consists of 5 modules and 2 historical versions (ADOS and ADOS-2), studies\nsearching for bias using item response theory-based DIF analyses often compromise statistical\npower to account for these differences by subdividing their samples. A moderated nonlinear factor\nanalysis (MNLFA) is more appropriate because it allows for the presence of multiple moderators,\nwhere there may be multiple sources of bias, and it allows the specification of bias receptors (e.g.,\nitem-level, factor-level). To date, six studies have used MNLFA to assess differential item\nfunctioning in the ADOS for age or sex. No study has used MNLFA to examine racial bias, nor has\nit been used to examine differences across the different modules and versions of the ADOS.\n\nObjectives: \nTo test for differential functioning in the ADOS items across race (African-American, Asian,\nWhite), module (1-4), and version (ADOS and ADOS-2).\n\nMethods:\nThe current study is the largest examination of DIF in the ADOS to date (N = 4354+), utilizing data\nfrom the Simons Simplex Collection (n = 2851) and the NIMH Data Archive (n = 1503). Data\ncollection is complete for Module 3 and forthcoming for Modules 1, 2, and 4 (due to a recent\nshutdown of the NIMH Data Archive). First, item response theory-based DIF was conducted on the\n14 algorithm items using the lordif package in R. A graded response model was selected given the\nordinal response data. Chi-square significance tests were used to detect significant uniform and\nnon-uniform DIF, with an alpha cutoff value of 0.05. DIF analysis will be further conducted with\ndata from all modules and versions aggregated. Second, measurement invariance will be tested via\nMNLFA, using the OpenMx package in R. A confirmatory one-factor model, specified with the 14\nalgorithm ADOS items as manifest variables and with race, version, and module as moderating\neffects for the factor loadings and item intercepts in Figure 1, will be used.\n\nPreliminary Results:\nWithin Module 3 aggregated across versions 1 and 2, four algorithm items showed significant DIF:\nB1 “Eye Contact” (Pr(χ212)=0.117, Pr(χ223)=0.001), B4 “Shared Enjoyment’ (Pr(χ212)=0.709,\nPr(χ223)=0.004), B11 “Quality Rapport”  (Pr(χ212)=0.001, Pr(χ223)=0.267), and D2 “Complex\nMannerisms” (Pr(χ212)=0.021, Pr(χ223)=0.675). The item characteristic curves of B11 and D2\nsuggest uniform DIF, whereas DIF in B1 and B4 is non-uniform (Figure 2).\n\nConclusion:\nIn the largest sample to date, we have identified bias in four ADOS Module 3 algorithm items. We\nwill conduct a larger analysis with MNLFA to determine whether the source of racial bias is due to\nspecific modules or versions of the ADOS. This analysis will allow us to pinpoint specific module\nitems and offer solutions to improve the measure and thereby diagnostic accuracy and equity for\ndiverse individuals.",

Fiveexperiments(4 preregistered, N=7,040)show that when participants read identical abstracts that variedonly in the sociomoral desirability of the conclusions, morally offended participants were likelier to (1) dismiss thewriting asincomprehensible (motivated confusion); (2) deny the empirical status of the research question (motivated postmodernism), (3) endorse claims inspired by Schopenhauer’s Stratagems for always being rightand the CIA’s strategies for citizen-saboteurs, and (4) endorsea set of contradictory complaints, including that sample sizes are too small andthatanecdotes are more informativethan data, that the researchers are both unintelligent and crafty manipulators, andthat the findings are bothpreposterous and old news. These patterns are consistent with motivated cognition, in whichindividuals seize on easy strategies for neutralizing disturbing knowledge claims, minimizing the need to update beliefs.All strategies were activated at once, ina sort of “belief-system overkill,” that ensures avoidance of unfortunate epistemic discoveries.

          "authors": "Casey L Roark; Bharath Chandrasekaran",
          "abstract": "Perceptual categorization requires mapping highly variable signals onto the same category. Some items are clearer examples of the category, being more typical or more distinct from contrasting categories. As a result, individual items differ in the difficulty required to categorize them correctly – easier exemplars are more quickly and accurately identified compared to more difficult exemplars. Here, we ask how associating stimulus difficulty with reward impacts novel category learning. We examine rule-based auditory category learning with stimuli varying in the difficulty of categorization. Three conditions varied in how difficulty was aligned with reward – higher reward for harder stimuli, higher reward for easier stimuli, and random reward regardless of difficulty. We compared results when participants actively learned the categories through experience and when participants learned from observing the actions and outcomes of someone else. We found that aligning reward with either easier or harder stimuli was not beneficial for learning and that participants learned the categories and successfully generalized to novel instances regardless of whether they learned through experience or observation. However, learners demonstrated a biased expectation about the relationship between difficulty and reward. When reward was random, participants defaulted to an expectation that categorizing harder stimuli should yield higher rewards. Further, only participants who learned through experience could learn that easier stimuli yielded higher rewards; observational learners relied on the default expectation. Overall, learning and generalization of category knowledge is possible through either experiential or observational learning but adjusting expectations about the relationship between difficulty and reward requires learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "The voice is a key marker of gender identity, yet gender-nonconforming speakers often diverge from binary vocal norms. This review synthesises findings from 45 studies published between January 2020 and January 2025 examining how gender is expressed and perceived in the voices of gender-diverse individuals. We report how gender identities and expressions are measured, how gender-diverse voices are perceived, and how acoustic features relate to both self-reported and perceived gender. While binary frameworks still influence the experimental methods used, a shift toward more inclusive models is emerging. Gender-diverse voices are frequently externally perceived or acoustically represented as falling between binary categories or as misaligned with affirmed gender identity. Similarly to binary voice gender, fundamental frequency and formants are key components of expressed and perceived gender. However, these findings may be biased due to the binary understanding of gender in the methods used, a general focus on transfeminine voices, and few investigations on the impact of listeners’ identity. A few studies reported that gender-nonconforming listeners tend to have a distinct understanding of voice gender compared with cisgender listeners. To move forward, future research should adopt inclusive perceptual tasks, account for listener demographics, and further explore self-perception of voice gender.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "People are often optimistic about their future. They may therefore choose to prepare for best-case scenarios over worst-case scenarios, even if negative life events are also likely and useful to prepare for. In three experiments, we assessed whether people tend to make best-case plans. In Experiment 1, U.S. adults (N = 223) chose to plan for best-case scenarios over worst-case scenarios 75% of the time across five different future time periods. To replicate this finding and test whether it reflects self-favoring comparative optimism, Experiment 2 was conducted with a new U.S. adult sample (N = 552) in which participants were randomly assigned to choose between best-case and worst-case plans either for themselves or an average person. Participants again showed a clear tendency to make best-case plans, and this tendency was significantly stronger when making plans for oneself than when advising others. We found suggestive evidence that this self-other difference was mediated by judgments of scenario likelihood and plan usefulness. To further explore the tendency to make best-case plans in a different cultural context, we conducted Experiment 3 as a lab-in-the-field experiment with Tanzanian adolescents in a critical transition period from high school to the labor market (N = 2,380). Despite difficult future prospects for this population, we again observed the tendency to make best-case plans and found partial support for the self-other difference. Our three studies contribute to existing knowledge by demonstrating best-case planning choices as a new manifestation of future optimism, in both a Western and African cultural context.",

We posit that the answer to this crucial question depends on how affectively unpolarized citizens view and participate in democracy. Yet, the standard operationalization of affective polarization––measuring sympathy ratings for one party relative to another––does not differentiate between people’s absolute sympathy ratings for the parties, which may mask essential heterogeneity among unpolarized citizens. This paper theorizes the methodological origin of this heterogeneity, describes it, and highlights its implications. Cluster analyses and regressions from three nationally representative surveys in the US provide three conclusions. First, substantial shares of the US population are affectively unpolarized. Second, unpolarized citizens cluster into two groups: one feeling lukewarm and one feeling cold toward both parties. Third, these unpolarized groups report diverging democratic attitudes and participation patterns. We discuss the methodological implications and the need for future research on affectively unpolarized citizens.",

The commission’s task was a) to identify factors in the academic system that enable and/or promote unethical behaviors, and b) to propose corrective measures. Based on expert interviews, a literature review, feedback form the community and discussions within the commission, the following problematic issues were identified: (P1) negligent or fraudulent scientific practices, (P2) abuse of power, (P3) insufficient mentoring of Early Career Researchers, (P4) insufficient quality of teaching, (P5) counterproductive incentives, (P6) overburdening of professors with tasks, (P7) fixed- and short-term contracts for most employees, (P8) unnecessarily steep power differentials, (P9) an ineffective peer-review system, (P10) lack of validity in personnel selection procedures, (P11) low awareness and commitment regarding ethical norms, and (P12) weak mechanisms for detecting and sanctioning unethical behavior. The commission offers concrete recommendations for changes to the academic system that should make the occurrence of unethical behavior less likely. Even though some of these recommendations might be rather specific for the field of psychology and for the German academic system, most of them may be valid for science in general.",

Langmark enables the analysis of these scenes, which are popular stimuli in scene-perception research, using various methods, including distributional semantic models (DSMs) – tools that encapsulate human linguistic knowledge. To showcase the potential of this approach, we demonstrate that an off-the-shelf DSM reliably distinguishes inconsistent objects from their consistent counterparts and therefore captures human intuitions about different objects being consistent with a given scene or not. Moreover, the model expresses object-scene consistency on a continuous scale, which facilitates testing hypotheses rooted in the assumption that humans also treat it as gradual. As a step in this direction, we compared model-derived consistency scores to human ratings of object-scene consistency collected in several ways. We discovered that these ratings depend on several factors related to experimental procedure and design. Based on our findings, we created practical guidelines for collecting such ratings. These guidelines and the Langmark annotations should, respectively, inform the research on scene perception and enable a wider adoption of DSMs within vision science.

          "abstract": "Loss-chasing is a key clinical symptom of gambling disorder. Examining its behavioural\nmanifestation in real gambling will help better understand and identify problematic gambling\nbehaviour. A recent study found that in a commercially available online gambling game,\ngamblers were more likely to stop playing and decreased stake sizes after immediate losses\nthan wins but played more quickly following losses than wins (Chen et al., 2022). However,\nhow within-session chasing may change across outcome streaks was unclear. To address this\nquestion, we analyzed a large-scale dataset (4308 gamblers, ~71 million rounds) from the same\ngamble, and assessed three facets of within-session chasing following winning and losing\nstreaks, namely persistence, changes in stake size and speed of play. We replicated the main\nfindings from Chen et al. Extending the previous findings, gamblers decreased persistence and\nreduced stake sizes but did not change speed of play as losing streaks continued. No clear\npattern was observed for winning streaks. Exploratory analyses indicated that reduced funds\nfollowing losing streaks and the expectation that losing streaks will continue jointly may best\nexplain these results. These findings provide more insights into the underlying mechanisms of\nchasing and may help identify markers of chasing in real gambling.",

Completion time, spatial accuracy, and error counts for the simple (Trail A) and alternating (Trail B) sequences were analysed in 3 × 2 × 2 mixed-model ANOVAs; post-trial scales captured usability (SUS), user experience (UEQ-S), and acceptability. Age dominated behaviour: younger adults were reliably faster, more precise, and less error-prone. Against this backdrop, input modality mattered. Eye-tracking yielded the best spatial accuracy and shortened Trail A time relative to manual control; head-gaze matched eye-tracking on Trail A speed and became the quickest, least error-prone option on Trail B. Controllers lagged on every metric. Subjective ratings were high across the board, with only a small usability dip in middle-aged low-gamers. Overall, gaze-based ray-casting clearly outperformed manual pointing, but optimal choice depended on task demands: eye-tracking maximised spatial precision, whereas head-gaze offered calibration-free enhanced speed and error-avoidance under heavier cognitive load.

In this chapter, I examine discourses of ceasefires by leaders and spokespersons of Israel and Palestinian factions in the Gaza War of 2014. Using discursive psychology, I show that Israelis rejected ceasefires, citing Hamas’ actions, and constructed ceasefires as coming in the way of achieving the annihilation of Hamas. For Palestinian and Hamas spokespersons, ceasefires were rejected for limiting their rights to fight the Israeli occupation, but were also welcomed to advance a more stable co-existence. Ceasefires then carry distinct implications for different parties in the conflict, which must be considered to achieve progress.",

          "abstract": "The harms experienced on social media are often context-specific, fast-evolving, and experientially diverse, posing challenges for traditional research methods. Conventional approaches frequently lack the descriptive richness, speed, or scale needed to capture such nuanced harms, highlighting the need for innovative, agile methods that centre lived experience. To address this gap, we introduce a novel micro-narrative method, eliciting 901 first-person narratives of recent social media harms from 18–22-year-olds across the UK and US. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analysed these narratives to identify key harm types and map their perceived frequency and platform specificity across our sample. Qualitative analysis identified four overarching harm types: harms that emerge from other people’s behaviour on social media (e.g., cyberbullying, scams); harmful behaviour evoked by social media use in young people themselves (e.g., compulsive use, social comparison); harms related to content observed on social media (e.g., curated or graphic material); and harms related to platform features (e.g., algorithmic exposure). These harms were associated with a wide range of self-reported emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and social consequences, including anxiety, lowered self-esteem, compulsive social media use, and social exclusion. Harms varied in frequency, platform specificity, and perceived prevalence, with self-related and content-related harms occurring most frequently, and harms from others' behaviour reported more rarely. Our findings highlight the diverse and complex nature of social media harms, tracing both behavioural and platform-based origins. By amplifying youth voices and applying an innovative narrative-based approach at scale, this study provides new descriptive evidence to inform youth-centred engagement and policy, targeted interventions, and safer social media platform design.",

          "abstract": "Although several strategies have been developed to support healthier social media use (SMU) among young people, most interventions focus on quantitative use reduction. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, this study examines young adults’ ability to proactively seek out experiences on social media that fulfill their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, a skill referred to as online need crafting. While general (offline) need crafting has gained scholarly attention in recent years, this study is the first to investigate online need crafting as a complementary process to its offline counterpart. Using a person-centered clustering approach in a large sample of college students (N = 5310; M age = 22.5; 28.6% male; 88.1% Belgian nationality), four profiles were identified based on levels of online and offline need crafting. These profiles were meaningfully associated with a range of outcomes, namely need-based experiences, well-being, ill-being, sleep quality, maladaptive, even after controlling for time spent on SMU. High Need Crafters (Profile 1; high online and offline crafting, 12.8%) reported the most adaptive pattern across all outcomes, whereas Low Need Crafters (Profile 4, 31.5%) reported the least favorable outcomes. Imbalanced profiles (Profile 2: high online/average offline, 36.4%; Profile 3: low online/average offline, 31.5%) showed mixed outcomes, suggesting that while online need crafting may offer benefits, it appears insufficient in the absence of strong offline need crafting.

Twenty-four early childhood classrooms were assigned to either ENRICH or an Active Control condition; ENRICH educators received professional development in serve-and-return interactions. Results revealed effects of ENRICH for educators’ shorter conversational turn length in book-reading and less complex utterances in diapering/toileting over time, and children’s increased utterances during book-reading over time. Professional development programs aimed at improving educator-toddler interactions should consider focusing on specific contexts where the intervention showed promise, alongside strengthening components targeting speech quality across daily routines.",

          "abstract": "Although several strategies have been developed to support healthier social media use (SMU) among young people, most interventions focus on quantitative use reduction. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, this study examines young adults’ ability to proactively seek out experiences on social media that fulfill their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, a skill referred to as online need crafting. While general (offline) need crafting has gained scholarly attention in recent years, this study is the first to investigate online need crafting as a complementary process to its offline counterpart. Using a person-centered clustering approach in a large sample of college students (N = 5310; M age = 22.5; 28.6% male; 88.1% Belgian nationality), four profiles were identified based on levels of online and offline need crafting. These profiles were meaningfully associated with a range of outcomes, namely need-based experiences, well-being, ill-being, sleep quality, maladaptive, even after controlling for time spent on SMU. High Need Crafters (Profile 1; high online and offline crafting, 12.8%) reported the most adaptive pattern across all outcomes, whereas Low Need Crafters (Profile 4, 31.5%) reported the least favorable outcomes. Imbalanced profiles (Profile 2: high online/average offline, 36.4%; Profile 3: low online/average offline, 31.5%) showed mixed outcomes, suggesting that while online need crafting may offer benefits, it appears insufficient in the absence of strong offline need crafting. These findings highlight the value of fostering need crafting skills across both domains as a promising foundation for interventions aiming to promote meaningful social media engagement and youth well-being.\n\nKeywords: Social Media Use, Young Adults, Self-Determination Theory, Need Crafting, Well-Being, Social Media Interventions",

          "abstract": "Cognitive functioning is increasingly recognized as an important factor in understanding offending behavior, yet findings across cognitive domains remain fragmented and inconsistent. This multi-level meta-analysis investigates the relationship between criminal offending and cognitive functioning. A search of PubMed, PSYCINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-March 2025) yielded 101 studies (Nparticipants=12,789, Neffect sizes=1,757). Multi-level meta-analyses were conducted for each cognitive domain, comparing neuropsychological test performance between offenders and non-offending comparisons (non-offending clinical groups and general population groups). The meta-analyses confirmed weaker cognitive test performance in offenders compared to non-offending control groups. The average weighted effect size (g = 0.44) falls within the small to medium range. Significant differences were observed between offenders and comparisons across all DSM-5 neurocognitive domains: attention (g = 0.33), executive functions (g = 0.40), language (g = 0.53), learning/memory (g = 0.36), perceptual-motor functions (g = 0.24), and social cognition (g = 0.56). Tests differed in their ability to differentiate between offenders and comparison groups. Moderator analyses showed that observed differences in performance were largely absent when offenders were compared to clinical comparison groups, suggesting that impairments may reflect general clinical dysfunction rather than offender-specific deficits. These findings suggest that cognitive impairments may not be specific to offending behavior but rather reflect broader clinical dysfunction. However, such impairments could still play an indirect role in offending by reducing treatment responsivity or increasing the likelihood of dropout, both of which are known risk factors for reoffending. \nKeywords: Neuropsychological Tests; Forensic Psychology; Criminal Behavior; Aggression; Meta-Analysis; Cognitive Functioning.",

          "abstract": "The harms experienced on social media are often context-specific, fast-evolving, and experientially diverse, posing challenges for traditional research methods. Conventional approaches frequently lack the descriptive richness, speed, or scale needed to capture such nuanced harms, highlighting the need for innovative, agile methods that centre lived experience. To address this gap, we introduce a novel micro-narrative method, eliciting 901 first-person narratives of recent social media harms from 18–22-year-olds across the UK and US. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analysed these narratives to identify key harm types and map their perceived frequency and platform specificity across our sample. Qualitative analysis identified four overarching harm types: harms that emerge from other people’s behaviour on social media (e.g., cyberbullying, scams); harmful behaviour evoked by social media use in young people themselves (e.g., compulsive use, social comparison); harms related to content observed on social media (e.g., curated or graphic material); and harms related to platform features (e.g., algorithmic exposure). These harms were associated with a wide range of self-reported emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and social consequences, including anxiety, lowered self-esteem, compulsive social media use, and social exclusion. Harms varied in frequency, platform specificity, and perceived prevalence, with self-related and content-related harms occurring most frequently, and harms from others' behaviour reported more rarely. Our findings highlight the diverse and complex nature of social media harms, tracing both behavioural and platform-based origins. By amplifying youth voices and applying an innovative narrative-based approach at scale, this study provides new descriptive evidence to inform youth-centred engagement and policy, targeted interventions, and safer social media platform design.",

          "abstract": "This study was performed to investigate the postoperative dynamics of verbal memory function after temporal lobe resection (TLR) in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (PwTLE), with a specific focus on the course following an initial verbal memory decline and the factors influencing later changes. \nVerbal memory performance of 169 PwTLE was retrospectively analyzed at three time points: preoperatively (T1), six months postoperatively (T2), and 24 months postoperatively (T3). At the group level, repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in verbal memory across time points between patients who underwent resection in the language-dominant hemisphere (LD) and language-nondominant hemisphere (LND). At the individual level, frequencies of significant verbal memory changes between time points were calculated. Subsequently, factors influencing late changes (T2–T3) after an initial decline (T1–T2) were analyzed for the LD group.\nAt the group level, RM-ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between time point and resected hemisphere, with significant declines observed in the LD group between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3. At the individual level, dynamic patterns of improvement, stability, and decline were observed across time points. In the LD group with an initial decline, RM-ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time point and sex; at T3, females exhibited better recovery of verbal memory function than males. \nThese findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in verbal memory outcomes following TLR, particularly after an initial decline. Notably, sex emerged as a significant factor influencing late postoperative recovery, with women showing greater verbal memory improvement than men. This suggests sex-dependent differences in cognitive recovery and highlights the need for personalized counseling in presurgical decision-making for PwTLE.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events worldwide. Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries (N = 128,093), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced the same hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave having being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person's resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g., droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g., hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat. These results may help us anticipate public concern in a warming world and suggest promising avenues for future research.",

          "authors": "Yael Ecker; Jens Lange; Corey L. Cook",
          "abstract": "We investigated the reciprocal relationships of jealousy and maintenance versus protection goal striving in romantic relationships. While existing research has examined various ways in which romantic partners respond to jealousy and invest in their relationship, it lacks a distinction between routine acts of regular care for the current state of the relationship (maintenance goal striving) and acts that protect against anticipated negative outcomes to the relationship (protection goal striving). Drawing from the ternary goal framework—which delineates maintenance, protection, and progress as three inherently distinct goal types—we argue that jealousy leads individuals to favor protection over maintenance goal striving. Additionally, we argue that the relative increase in protection over maintenance striving leads to an increase in jealousy, which in turn leads to further increase in protection over maintenance and thus to a self-reinforcing cycle that alters relationship dynamics. Across three studies (N = 842), including experimental (Study 1) and longitudinal approaches with individual (Study 2) and dyadic data (Study 3), jealousy predicted protection over maintenance goal striving. Additionally, protection goal striving increased jealousy in longitudinal data from both individuals and couples. This research provides initial evidence that protection and maintenance goals play distinct roles in romantic relationships. The reinforcing cycle of jealousy and protection may have important implications for relationship functioning, as protection efforts may come at the cost of regular maintenance efforts that typically sustain relationship stability and satisfaction.",

Moreover, drivers tend to engage more frequently in non-driving-related tasks during automation, but how the cognitive load imposed by these tasks affects drivers’ inspection of HMI displays is unclear. This driving simulator study examined how partial automation and cognitive load (imposed by a 2-back task) influence drivers’ visual attention to dash-based HMI containing speed and automation status information (N=41). Results showed that increased levels of automation and cognitive load additively reduced drivers’ visual attention to the dash area. Drivers prioritized inspecting the speedometer over the automation status information across all conditions. Our findings provide important implications for HMI design in automated vehicles.",

          "abstract": "In this paper I propose a network theory of attitudes where attitude agreements and disagreements forge a multilayer network structure that simultaneously binds people into groups (via attitudes) and attitudes into clusters (via people who share them). This theory proposes that people have a range of possible attitudes (like cards in a hand) but these only become meaningful when expressed (like a card played). Attitudes are expressed with sensitivity to their potential audiences and are socially performative: when we express attitudes, or respond to those expressed by others, we tell people who we are, what groups we might belong to and what to think of us.  Agreement and disagreement can be modelled as a bipartite network that provides a psychological basis for perceived ingroup similarity and outgroup difference and, more abstractly, group identity. Opinion-based groups and group-related opinions are therefore co-emergent dynamic phenomena. Dynamic fixing occurs when particular attitudes become associated with specific social identities. The theory provides a framework for understanding identity ecosystems in which social group structure and attitudes are co-constituted. The theory describes how attitude change is also identity change. This has broad relevance across disciplines and applications concerned with social influence and attitude change.",

          "authors": "Lucy Lai; Ann Zixiang Huang; Samuel J. Gershman",
          "abstract": "Many skills in our everyday lives are learned by sequencing actions towards a desired goal. The action sequence can become a ``chunk'' when individual actions are grouped together and executed as one unit, making them more efficient to store and execute. While chunking has been studied extensively across various domains, a puzzle remains as to why and under what conditions action chunking occurs. To tackle these questions, we develop a model of conditional policy compression—the reduction in cognitive cost by conditioning on an additional source of information—to explain the origin of chunking. We argue that chunking is a result of optimizing the trade-off between reward and conditional policy complexity. Chunking compresses policies when there is temporal structure in the environment that can be leveraged for action selection, reducing the amount of memory necessary to encode the policy. We experimentally confirm our model's predictions, showing that chunking reduces conditional policy complexity and reaction times. Chunking also increases with working memory load, consistent with the hypothesis that the degree of policy compression scales with the scarcity of cognitive resources. Finally, chunking also reduces overall working memory load, freeing cognitive resources for the benefit of other, not-chunked information.",

          "authors": "Tzu-Yao Chiu; Julie Golomb",
          "abstract": "Spatial attention is rarely static, but highly dynamic in real-life. Recent studies have revealed that shifts of attention and eye movements incur consequences for ongoing feature perception, such as systematic feature-binding (swapping and mixing) errors. Here we investigated if these consequences could be flexibly mitigated when participants are incentivized, or if feature interference reflects a more automatic byproduct of attentional remapping mechanisms following a saccade. Forty healthy adults were tested in a post-saccadic continuous feature report task and provided with different levels of reward (monetary incentive) for precise target color reports. In addition to improving general performance, reward reduced systematic feature mixing errors immediately after the saccade. However, reward had the opposite effect on retinotopic swapping errors, with higher reward associated with increased swapping errors. These disparate influences of reward provide novel insights into the attentional mechanisms underlying remapping across saccades and dynamic spatial attention and visual perception more generally.",

How do we investigate consciousness in infants, whose brains are still maturing, or in\nnon-human animals, shaped by diverse ecological and evolutionary pressures?\nThis review advocates for a neuroethological perspective, drawing on Tinbergen’s framework\nfor studying behavior. By examining the mechanisms, development, adaptive value, and\nevolutionary origins of consciousness, we can move beyond a human-centric focus to explore\nits diversity across life forms.

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0-48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children, and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. \nDiscussion: This analysis suggests a small but detectable amount of bias in several specific ADOS items, but not in items central to informing an autism diagnosis. Thus, bias appears statistically, but not clinically, significant. This study provides the third racial bias analysis of the ADOS, the first analysis of Asian children, and the first in-depth look at all items in the most commonly used version among school-aged children.\n\nAbbreviations: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS); differential item functioning (DIF)\nKeywords: autism, racial bias, item response theory, differential item functioning, ADOS",

Teenagers can be influenced by the habits and attitudes toward drinking by those around them, such as their friends or parents. Teenagers may also experience peer pressure from their friends to drink alcohol, which can initiate a cycle where drinking leads to increased alcohol intake and potentially alcohol use disorder, or addiction. Furthermore, factors like social media and marketing may convince teenagers to consume alcohol as well. Additionally, certain brain regions are implicated in the development of alcohol use disorder, including the limbic (i.e., reward) system and the prefrontal cortex, among others. Lastly, alcohol can negatively affect teenagers’ executive function and increase impulsivity.

          "authors": "Jordan Wylie; Matthew Lindauer; Ana P. Gantman",
          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen by philosophers and psychologists as allowing a person to not only live by good and just principles, but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should give to being as moral as possible. The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,911) suggest people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find people resolve this conflict by preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains where aesthetic pursuits uniquely afford freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is seen as offering greater access to one’s true self than the pursuit of moral excellence. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

Chinese participants were more likely to infer relational closeness from dissimilar descriptions, whereas Euro-Canadians were more likely to infer closeness from similar descriptions.

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "Can AI systems like large language models (LLMs) replace human participants in behavioral and psychological research? Here I critically evaluate the “replacement” perspective and identify six interpretive fallacies that undermine its validity. These fallacies are: (1) equating token prediction with human intelligence, (2) treating LLMs as the average human, (3) interpreting alignment as explanation, (4) anthropomorphizing AI systems, (5) essentializing identities, and (6) substituting model data for human evidence. Each fallacy represents a potential misunderstanding about what LLMs are and what they can tell us about human cognition. The analysis distinguishes levels of similarity between LLMs and humans, particularly functional equivalence (outputs) versus mechanistic equivalence (processes), while highlighting both technical limitations (addressable through engineering) and conceptual limitations (arising from fundamental differences between statistical and biological intelligence). For each fallacy, specific safeguards are provided to guide responsible research practices. Ultimately, the analysis supports conceptualizing LLMs as pragmatic simulation tools—useful for role-play, rapid hypothesis testing, and computational modeling (provided their outputs are validated against human data)—rather than as replacements for human participants. This framework enables researchers to leverage language models productively while respecting the fundamental differences between machine intelligence and human thought.",

Body dissatisfaction is a shared risk factor for EDs and depression. Given the limited nature of accessible, affirming resources, LGBTQ+ youth often seek mental health support online. To reduce body dissatisfaction at-scale, we developed a digital, single-session intervention (SSI)—Project Body Neutrality. A total of 218 LGBTQ+ adolescents (ages 13-17) with body image and mood concerns were recruited online and randomized to Project Body Neutrality or to a control. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback elucidates what participants found most helpful about Project Body Neutrality. Compared to control participants, intervention participants reported significantly greater immediate positive changes in body dissatisfaction, functionality appreciation, hopelessness, and perceived agency. At 3-month follow-up, these differences were not sustained. Across the full sample, there were no significant differences between groups in 3-month reductions in ED psychopathology or depression symptoms. However, an exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had a significant effect on ED psychopathology among participants at-risk for EDs (as opposed to those above the clinical threshold). Future research would benefit from further investigation of when, for whom, and within what treatment-seeking context Project Body Neutrality may be most impactful (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06172452).",

          "abstract": "The Reward Positivity (RewP) is an electroencephalographic feature that emerges following reward receipt and is sensitive to positive prediction errors and other experiences of hedonic value.  Here we address two unresolved issues regarding the RewP. First, we clarify the biophysical signature of the RewP. Contrary to the dominant perspective, we argue that the RewP is an independent EEG feature that selectively responds to positive prediction errors and is superimposed over the obligatory evoked background. We distinguish this additive characteristic of the RewP from the modulation of the obligatory N2 component, which is influenced by negative prediction errors and other signals related to control demands. Second, we propose a refined theoretical account of the computational process reflected by the RewP that highlights its long-standing sensitivity to goal achievement, namely, that the RewP reflects a belief update of value triggered by a discrete indication of goal attainment. This process resembles a value-sensitive but action-agonistic critic from an actor/critic dichotomy. This conceptual shift – from viewing the RewP as a generic signal of reward receipt to a more nuanced signal of goal attainment -- emphasizes its dependence on control processes. Taken together, we propose that the critic-like RewP and the actor-like N2 may function as opponent processes that support the updating of goal-directed behavior. This framework opens several avenues for future empirical investigation aimed at further advancing our understanding of this neural signal.",

Two two-hour focus groups were conducted with 12 feminist cis women, 6 of whom were LBQ+ and 6 heterosexuals. Data was analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis, identifying 3 themes: Feminism, conflicts in the feminist movement concerning the Trans Law and intergroup collaboration. While both groups held similar definitions of feminism, LBQ+ women emphasized the importance of an intersectional perspective. Both groups expressed interest in addressing gender inequalities and forming alliances but differed in their analysis of these alliances. Heterosexual women focused on alliance challenges and threats, while LBQ+ women emphasized the need of empathy and collaboration. Heterosexual women expressed mixed feelings toward the proposed Trans Law, whereas LBQ+ cis women expressed clear support for the law and the protection of trans rights. Participants suggested actions to promote the allyship (e.g. creating common spaces and confronting LGBTIQA+phobic aggressions). While both groups express willingness to collaborate, differences and challenges are inherent in diverse feminism. Such differences should be embraced as opportunities for debate and effective collaboration, to reduce conflict and promote social transformation. It demonstrates the potential of alliances between movements to address gender-related social inequalities as a global challenge.",

Methods: Attitudes towards OM/ROM of licensed German psychotherapists and psychotherapists in training were assessed in an online survey conducted between June 2023 and March 2024 (N = 126). Results: Therapists with an orientation in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) showed more positive attitudes compared to psychoanalytic-oriented therapists (d = 1.88), but no significant difference was found between orientation in CBT and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. Therapists working in institutionalized outpatient settings reported more positive attitudes than those working in private practices (d = 0.88). No effect of previous experience in administering OM/ROM was found for both implementation barriers and facilitators; however, results suggest that therapists administering pre-post evaluations expect more support in clarification processes than ROM administration currently provides. In addition, more positive attitudes toward OM/ROM are associated with higher expectations regarding both support in therapeutic processes and support in clarification. Conclusion: OM/ROM systems should consider assessing concepts from different psychotherapeutic orientations. Implementing OM/ROM could benefit from close monitoring",

          "abstract": "Metacognition improves significantly over childhood, but the mechanisms underlying this development are poorly understood. We first review recent research demonstrating that disagreement prompts competent responses by young children across several metacognitive domains (confidence monitoring; information search; source monitoring). Then we propose a mechanistic model of how disagreement facilitates metacognition. We localize one main source of children’s metacognitive limitations in their still-developing capacities to reason about alternative possibilities, which manifest in an overly narrow focus on one hypothesis. Disagreement increases the child’s likelihood of representing alternative hypotheses, thereby promoting improved metacognitive reasoning. The broader proposal is that through repeated experiences of disagreement, children become better at representing alternative possibilities even when reasoning on their own, leading to metacognitive development.",

          "abstract": "Planning, the process of evaluating the future consequences of actions, is typically formalized as search over a decision tree. More search means higher expected rewards, but tree search is computationally expensive. Most approaches designed to mitigate the costs associated with tree search have been driven by researcher-specified heuristics, and only recently have normative solutions been applied to the domain of planning. An open question is how people approximate the values associated with potential plans while they are planning. In this work, we propose to abstract planning as an information search problem to produce heuristics for meta-planning, or to determine which action to plan for. Specifically, we model a metacognitive process where evaluating candidate actions is viewed as gaining noisy measurements of the value of each action. This statistical estimate is then combined with prior experience in a Bayesian manner to decide whether and in which direction to continue sampling. This Bayesian meta-planner makes intuitive predictions across a range of parameters and acts as a more valuable, informed method for guiding search when compared to best-first and breadth-first search. Additionally, the Bayesian meta-planner qualitatively accounts for response time trends in a complex planning task. Thus, we provide a principled framework for information search that directs simulations towards the most promising actions, deriving heuristics that generalize to people's behavior while planning.",

          "abstract": "Rhythmic cycles from North Indian Classical Music (NICM) commonly contain 6 to 16 beats per cycle. Despite their prominence in NICM, these long rhythmic cycles remain unexplored in rhythm perception research, which has concentrated mainly on Western meters or the short/fast meters characteristic of musical traditions like those of Turkey and the Balkans. Long rhythmic cycles from NICM also raise questions about whether isochrony is considered easier to perceive as compared to non-isochrony (based on research on short/fast meters) and remains so when the rhythmic cycles are longer than those previously studied. This study addresses this gap by investigating two prominent rhythmic cycles from NICM: the 16-beat ISO-Teental and the 7-beat NI-Rupaktal. Given the significant role of cultural familiarity and musicianship in shaping rhythm perception, the study examines four participant groups: Culturally Familiar Musicians (N = 32), Culturally Familiar Non-Musicians (N = 44), Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians (N = 34), and Culturally Unfamiliar Non-Musicians (N = 30). Additionally, a novel short-term explicit learning paradigm is employed to explore whether it can influence the effects of enculturation observed in prior research.  \nCulture-specific musical expertise, rather than mere familiarity with the culture or musicianship alone, is found to be the most relevant in the similarity perception of the structure of these long rhythmic cycles. An effect of short-term explicit learning was observed in NI-Rupaktal for Culturally Familiar Non-musicians and Culturally Unfamiliar (western) Musicians. This effect was not observed for the ISO-Teental rhythmic cycle, unlike the previous studies, which we attribute to the cognitive load in the perception of the long ISO-Teental cycle.",

This paper proposes the AI Integration Matrix (AIM), a framework for the responsible development and implementation of AI in mental health care. It integrates, builds on, and extends current regulatory, implementation science, and ethical frameworks. The Matrix offers systematic, context-sensitive guidance across seven interdependent domains: (1) clinical grounding and application, (2) ethical integrity and trust, (3) regulatory and economic sustainability, (4) user experience, (5) social and cultural impact, (6) evidence and continuous learning, and (7) technical foundations. It provides a holistic foundation for evaluating and optimizing digital mental health innovation across diverse settings and populations and equips users with a mental model for navigating the complexity of digital mental health applications, supporting responsible AI integration that drives meaningful impact.",

However, those models are agnostic to the cognitive traits which underlie those differences. In this study, we systematically investigate sources of individual variation in a pragmatic reference game, where participants are required to draw ad-hoc implicatures of various complexity. We relate the observed variability in reference game performance to cognitive traits, specifically reasoning ability, working memory and Theory of Mind, as well as to the strategies reported by participants. We find a positive effect of reasoning and Theory of Mind on pragmatic inference, with the effect of reasoning being more pronounced for simple implicatures than for complex ones.

Yet, the role of personality traits in modulating this effect is poorly understood, despite their potential influence on how individuals engage with and interpret environmental cues. This study investigated whether dispositional factors shape memory encoding for expected versus unexpected events. Across two experiments, participants learned symbol–stimulus contingencies that were later violated for a subset of stimuli at encoding, followed by a recognition memory test. Additionally, in Experiment 1 (n = 55), state/trait anxiety and risk-taking were measured, while in Experiment 2 (n =142), participants completed the Big Five personality inventory. In both experiments, unexpected events boosted subsequent recollection, but the magnitude of this benefit varied systematically with individual differences. Experiment 1 showed that individuals low in trait anxiety and risk-taking exhibited pronounced recollection benefits for unexpected events, an advantage that diminished in highly anxious or risk-taking individuals. Experiment 2 extended these findings, revealing that low extraversion and high negative emotionality attenuated the recollection advantage of unexpected events. These findings demonstrate that personality traits dynamically shape how expectation guides memory formation and offer new insight into the interplay between dispositional factors and cognition. They also highlight important implications for both memory theory and applied contexts.",

Previous work has shown that engaging with someone else’s suffering can hold epistemic, personal, social, or affective value. However, facing other people’s hardship can also be cognitively and emotionally taxing. Why do people decide to view and read stories of suffering? Drawing on models of curiosity and information seeking, motivated empathy, social norms, and hedonic goals, we examined how various motives predict choices to engage with positive and negative images and stories. Using a cross-validation approach, we conducted two exploratory studies and two preregistered confirmatory studies. The exploratory studies allowed us to select and finetune a set of motives that significantly predicted engaging with emotionally evocative content, and the results from these studies informed our hypotheses for the confirmatory studies. The results robustly showed that knowledge acquisition, self-relevance, and a sense of thrill positively predicted choice for emotionally evocative content regardless of stimuli valence. Furthermore, the expectation of experiencing positive and negative emotions predicted choices to engage with and avoid emotionally evocative content, respectively, although some studies suggested interactions with valence. Crucially, the four studies consistently demonstrated a stronger relationship between uncertainty reduction and choosing negative content as compared to choosing positive content. We discuss theoretical and applied implications of the results and how they reflect the epistemic, personal, and affective value that drives the exploration of suffering.",

          "abstract": "Electroculture, the practice of using electrical energy to enhance plant growth and agricultural productivity, has gained renewed attention as a sustainable farming technique in the face of rising global challenges. This article delves into the science behind electroculture, exploring its historical development, mechanisms, and its potential to revolutionize modern agriculture. The study highlights the key findings from extensive research and analysis, revealing that controlled exposure to electromagnetic fields can accelerate seed germination, promote root development, and improve nutrient uptake — all contributing to increased crop yields. Moreover, electroculture has shown promising effects on soil health, enhancing microbial activity, balancing pH levels, and boosting nutrient bioavailability. These benefits not only reduce the dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides but also offer an environmentally friendly approach to increasing agricultural productivity. The research methodology employed a mixed-method approach, combining literature review, online research, and experimental data to assess the impact of electroculture across various crops and environmental conditions. Findings further emphasize the scalability and adaptability of electroculture, making it a viable technique for diverse agricultural systems, from industrial-scale farms to smallholder operations. As climate change and food security challenges grow more pressing, electroculture emerges as a beacon of innovation, offering a sustainable path to enhanced productivity while minimizing environmental impact. This study underscores the need for continued research, broader adoption, and integration of electroculture into contemporary agricultural practices, positioning it as a crucial tool for shaping the future of sustainable farming.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma has been consistently associated with elevated levels of neuroticism in adulthood, a transdiagnostic trait marked by emotional instability, heightened negative affect, and stress sensitivity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise evidence examining the association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism, both overall and by specific trauma subtypes. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases identified 127 eligible studies, encompassing a total of 436,834 individuals. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, results revealed a significant positive association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism (g = 0.48). Subgroup analyses showed that this association was consistent across all trauma subtypes, including emotional abuse (g = 0.52), emotional neglect (g = 0.40), physical abuse (g = 0.15), physical neglect (g = 0.12), sexual abuse (g = 0.15), unspecified abuse (g = 0.13), and victimisation (g = 0.21), with the exception of unspecified neglect, which showed no significant association. These findings demonstrate a robust relationship between early adversity and neuroticism, regardless of trauma type. Childhood trauma may lead to adaptions that give rise to neuroticism through several psychological mechanisms such as disruptions in attachment and the formation of negative self-beliefs, and neurobiological alterations in stress regulation systems. These results underscore the importance of systemic preventative measures and early intervention strategies that may alleviate the psychological and neurobiological consequences of trauma, with the potential to increase awareness of adaptions such as neuroticism in trauma-exposed populations.",

This study examines how childhood trauma, PTSD symptoms, and pain coping strategies interact in individuals with chronic versus acute pain.\nMethods: A total of 159 participants (chronic and acute pain groups) completed an online survey assessing childhood trauma pain coping strategies and current PTSD symptoms. Correlations between variables within each group, and differences between chronic and acute pain groups were evaluated using z-tests. \nResults: Pain intensity was positively associated with childhood trauma, particularly emotional (r = .32) and physical abuse (r = .24). PTSD symptoms, specifically re-experiencing (r = .29) and hyperarousal (r = .28) were also linked to greater pain intensity. Adaptive coping strategies like distraction and coping self-statements were negatively associated with pain intensity. These strategies showed stronger negative correlations with childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms in the chronic pain group (z = -2.57 to z = 5.43), suggesting more complex coping dynamics. Associations between trauma, PTSD symptoms, and pain were more pronounced in chronic pain sufferers.\nConclusions: These results have important clinical implications, emphasising the need for trauma-informed care in pain management interventions. Further research should explore effective strategies for managing the intersection of pain and trauma, particularly in chronic pain populations.",

          "abstract": "Mood fluctuations, central to human experience, are profoundly influenced by reward prediction error (RPE). Although depression and anxiety traditionally exhibit contrasting mood fluctuations, their interrelated nature has made it challenging to pinpoint their specific roles in RPE-induced mood variations. In this study, we employed a computational model of momentary mood within a gambling task, involving 2,043 participants across five experiments. These participants also completed a series of questionnaires designed to allow us to differentiate the influences of anxiety- and depression-specific traits through bifactor modelling. Results showed that depression was associated with dampened mood fluctuations due to mood hyposensitivity to RPE. In contrast, anxiety correlated with heightened mood fluctuations stemming from mood hypersensitivity to RPE. We also validated deficit mood sensitivity to RPE with depression in patients with affective disorders, confirming the clinical utility of this affective mental parameter. Moreover, the shared depression/anxiety component was linked to lower affective baseline and greater risk aversion. Collectively, our results uncover computational dissociation of depression vs. anxiety using RPE-based mood modeling and present multi-dimensional computational signatures for depression and anxiety, with clinical relevance for management of mood disorders.",

          "abstract": "Healthy aging is associated with a decline in spatial cognition, with older adults learning spatial environments more slowly and with less precision compared to younger adults. This study investigated whether resting-state EEG measures could be used to predict differences in age and spatial learning/memory performance in a virtual water maze task among younger and older adults. We recorded eyes-open resting-state EEG from 22 older adults (aged 60-76) and 31 younger adults (aged 18-40) before they completed the NavWell virtual water maze task. Our analysis focused on five EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and their relationship with age and behavioural measures: spatial learning (wayfinding ability &amp; escape latency) and spatial memory (percentage of time spent searching in the goal quadrant). Principal component analysis was used to reduce the EEG variables to absolute and relative power EEG component scores and were examined as predictors. Results revealed that age was a significant, strong predictor of all performance-related outcomes. Though resting-state EEG was not a significant predictor of navigation ability, older adults showed significant differences from younger adults on three of the four EEG component loadings. Specifically, older adults demonstrated reduced low-frequency (delta) and greater high-frequency (beta/gamma) power compared to younger adults. These findings suggest that while resting-state EEG dynamics differ by age, they do not explain age-related differences in spatial navigation performance.",

          "abstract": "Several cognitive systems in the human brain such as language and face processing are organized asymmetrically. One of the primary neuroscientific methods to assess such functional hemispheric asymmetries is electroencephalography (EEG). The two major forms of analyzing asymmetries in the EEG signal are analyzing asymmetries in specific event-related potentials (ERP), such as the N1, and analyzing asymmetries in event-related or resting state EEG oscillations such as in the alpha band. However, the relationships between these two forms of EEG asymmetries are not well understood. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to replicate previous results on ERP and alpha band asymmetries and assess whether they show a negative correlation with each other as could be expected from the hypothesis that alpha represents an absence of cognition. To this end we tested n=100 participants with EEG RS, as well as task-based EEG with words, faces, emotional faces and houses as stimuli. Replication of previous EEG asymmetry findings showed mixed results. Interestingly, we found strong positive associations between individual ERP and alpha band asymmetries. This finding highlights the need to re-assess the functional role of alpha asymmetries and suggests that they do not only reflect the absence of cognition as widely assumed but reflect active neuronal processing asymmetries such as in phase reorganization and the timing of neural activity.",

This is challenging for children as the underlying skills required to understand irony may not be fully developed. We investigated how 10-year-olds’ working memory, empathy skills, and gender are related to their processing and comprehension of written irony. Data from two previous eye-tracking experiments with 97 children (46 girls and 51 boys) were analysed. Results showed that children with stronger empathy skills had higher irony comprehension accuracy and were less likely to reread ironic phrases. Higher working memory was linked to faster processing of irony, but did not lead to higher comprehension. Conversely, lower working memory was associated with more accurate irony comprehension. Child gender was not related to irony comprehension. These results imply that working memory and emotional perspective-taking are important for children's irony comprehension, aligning with theories that take individual differences into account.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly integrated into daily life, people are beginning to outsource not only professional tasks but also socio-relational ones. Large language models like ChatGPT can generate wedding vows, speeches, and personal messages, raising questions about how individuals who use AI for such tasks are perceived by others. In this paper, we conduct five pre-registered studies with British participants (N = 3,649) to understand how people view those who outsource tasks to AI, and how this depends on how socio-relational the task is, whether AI is used as a tool or fully delegated to, and the acknowledgment of the AI use. We find negative perceptions of outsourcing, particularly for socio-relational tasks. We show that outsourcing makes us think more negatively about not only the person and their motivations, but also the outsourced work itself. Moreover, we provide insight into why this occurs: the reduced effort from outsourcing socio-relational tasks to AI signals that the output is less authentically one’s own and that the person cares less about the task. Our research highlights the way that AI use shapes our perceptions of people, raising key philosophical questions about efficiency, authenticity, and social ties in a world filled with AI-mediated interactions.",

There is a growing evidence base showing the deleterious impacts of poor motor skill development, however there is a distinct lack of research gathering in-depth insights which explore the impact of DCD across the lifespan. Methods: Ten lived experience interviews (adults with a diagnosis of DCD/ Dyspraxia) were undertaken online, lasting 30-45 minutes. Participants were recruited both nationally and internationally to understand cultural differences. Lived experience interviews focused on experiences in primary care, education, friendships, wellbeing, employment and romantic relationships. Data were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.  Results: Emergent themes highlighted a major lack of awareness in all life domains, and difficulty navigating health, education and workplace systems for support, resulting in relative abandonment and a lack of validation within their lived experience of DCD. Conclusion: Individuals with DCD often feel alone, isolated and misunderstood in a world which presents challenges for them across all aspects of life. There is an urgent need for the profile of DCD to be raised by insider voices as for many, DCD often transcends diagnostic criteria to wider challenges, for example executive functioning.  Fundamentally, more needs to be done to ensure a lifespan approach to DCD, to allow greater opportunities for adults with a diagnosis to thrive alongside their ‘neurotypical’ peers.",

Drawing on 80 real student questions, this paper aims to assess response consistency and identify risk markers, such as randomness and hallucination. The goal of this study is to inform future research, guide human–AI (artificial intelligence) collaboration and support policy development on deploying large language model chatbots for accessible mental health interventions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper prompted ChatGPT-4 with 80 authentic college student counseling questions and collected three nondeterministic replies per query. Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length.\n\nFindings\nChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings.\n\nPractical implications\nHigh warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design.\n\nSocial implications\nDeployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",

This paper introduces \"Cognitive Infrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\": foundational, often invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate \"relevance judgment,\" shifting the \"locus of epistemic agency\" to non-human systems.  Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: “infrastructure breakdown methodologies”, experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.",

          "abstract": "Mental chronometry tasks commonly presume that real-time action imagery indicates high action imagery ability (AIA). However, factors that systematically influence imagery durations undermine the validity of AIA scores based on deviations from real-time action imagery. Therefore, we introduce and validate a novel approach to measure AIA using mental chronometry. This approach relies on the relationship between a movement’s difficulty and its’ duration (stated in Fitts’ law), with AIA scores quantifying the degree to which this relationship is preserved in action imagery. In a Chronometric Radial Fitts’ Task (CRFT), participants (N = 30) executed and imagined both tapping (with a stylus) and clicking (with a computer mouse) radially arranged targets. Single execution and imagery durations were isolated through simultaneous space bar presses. Targets varied in difficulty according to Fitts’ law, which held across all four conditions (for both tools, when executing and imagining the movements). The AIA scores derived from the proposed Fitts’ law approach outperformed those derived from earlier mental chronometry approaches, being the only score to provide consistency across tools. Using the stylus, larger absolute and relative deviations from real-time action imagery were consistently associated with higher subjective AIA, reinforcing validity concerns. Participants struggled to incorporate the computer mouse’s properties into the internal model of the movement, resulting in imagery with the computer mouse relying on internal models similar to the stylus (simpler tool). In addition to offering a promising standardized approach for the measurement of AIA, our study highlights the importance of tool familiarity in mental chronometry.",

To generalize, we need to understand this heterogeneity. We propose a toolbox supported by the re-analysis of existing data and simulations to help consumer researchers leverage heterogeneity for generalization. We propose five levers that consumer researchers can use to increase the generalizability: 1) Measuring proximal moderators that describe respondents' interaction with the setting. 2) Exploiting purposive variation to increase the range of observed moderators and settings. 3) Measuring manipulation intensity and measurement error. 4) Using survey para-data to estimate moderators and  5) Harnessing proximal moderators and purposive variation to predict generalized effect sizes. \nWe suggest that our toolbox can help advance our field towards higher practical impact by moving beyond understanding what works to understanding what works when, where, and why.",

          "abstract": "Understanding naturalistic human behavior in real-world settings requires capturing its inherent complexity, where interactions are shaped by dynamic visual, spatial, and auditory cues. These multimodal signals—such as gaze, hand action, and speech—encode critical referential and social information that shape how humans attend to and perceive ongoing events. However, existing datasets often lack the granularity needed to systematically examine the interplay of these naturalistic multimodal cues, particularly in ways that support both behavioral and computational research. To address this, we present an extensive and detailed dataset comprising acted (day-to-day) human interactions captured in short event scenarios, totaling 27 scenes across 9 story contexts and featuring over 32 individuals in varied roles. Each scene includes a range of visuo-spatial and auditory cues, found in both controlled (manipulated) and naturally occurring segments. In addition to the scenes, we provide visual attention data directed towards scene elements, collected via eye-tracking from 90 participants. The dataset is meticulously annotated through a combination of manual and semi-automated processes—characterizing scene elements, event structures, frame-by-frame bounding boxes of individuals and their body parts, as well as both low- and high-level visual attention predicates. We position the scenes, events, and attention annotations with a focus on uncovering the complexities of human behavior in real-world settings—particularly vis-à-vis what unfolds during an event and where individuals direct their visual attention—making it ideal for hypothesis testing and benchmarking naturalistic multimodal human actions and events. By integrating narrative-driven scenarios with rich visuo-spatial and auditory annotations, this dataset bridges the gap between lab-controlled paradigms and ecological validity, offering a versatile resource for both behavioral studies (e.g., initiating joint attention) and computational applications (e.g., validating attention models). Its dual utility extends to domains such as human-robot interaction, cognitive media design, and adaptive virtual agents, where interpreting human interactions is critical to advancing technologies reliant on real-world behavioral semantics.",

At best, corporate bullshit can sometimes seem harmless. At worst, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing clear communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing a company’s reputation, and exposing businesses to potential financial and legal risks. Here, results from four studies (total N = 1022) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in susceptibility to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate language and is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers and practitioners in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of receptivity to bullshit in organizations.",

Our concerns relate to the lack of clear mandate for such proposals, conceptual inconsistency when considering other conditions which might give rise to a need for detention, and the inconsistency in applying such changes to Part II of the MHA but not Part III. If the proposed changes become law, we anticipate that detentions would instead occur under the less safeguarded Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) framework, and that unmanaged risks will eventuate in behavioural consequences which will lead to more autistic people or people with a learning disability being sent to prison. Additionally, there is a concern that the proposed definitional breadth of autism and learning disability gives rise to a risk that people with other conditions may unintentionally be unable to be detained.

          "abstract": "Fear conditioning paradigms model fear acquisition and extinction in controlled experiments. Context conditioning induces anxiety to unpredictable threats rather than fear of specific stimuli and serves as a model for anxiety disorders. Importantly, contexts have been mostly studied in terms of spatial properties (e.g. a room), while social contexts seem most relevant for many anxiety disorders. Consequently, the present study investigated context conditioning in a social context using Virtual Reality. Overall 40 participants underwent habituation, acquisition, and extinctions phase in the same virtual room. Two contexts were operationalized as co-presence of particular virtual agents. An aversive US was only presented during one agent’ co-presence (CTX+) but not the other’s (CTX-). Ratings and physiological data showed increased anxious arousal during CTX+ relative to CTX- for acquisition. Concurrent measurement of neural oscillations via EEG allowed to investigate underlying processes. Power in the parietal alpha and frontal beta band was reduced during CTX+ compared to CTX- for acquisition suggesting increased attentional and sensory-motor processing. These findings show successful context conditioning in social contexts which is accompanied by an increase in attention and motor preparation. Social context conditioning can serve as an effective model to study mechanisms of anxiety and anxiety disorders in humans.",

Twenty-five male university students performed incremental cycle ergometer test. Facial expressions were recorded and analyzed using Py-Feat to detect Action Units (AUs), while heart rate, blood lactate concentration, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and the Two-Dimensional Mood Scale were measured. Generalized additive mixed models were used to examine the relationships between 16 AUs and physiological/psychological indicators, and correlation analysis assessed AU changes across exercise intensity transitions. Exercise intensity-dependent changes were observed in numerous AUs, with AU10 (upper lip raiser), AU17 (chin raiser), AU25 (lips part), and AU26 (jaw drop) demonstrating strong correlations with exercise load, heart rate, blood lactate, and RPE (r = 0.314-0.631, all P &lt; 0.05). During the transition from moderate to high intensity, AU25 changes were significantly negatively correlated with arousal changes (r = -0.436, P = 0.029). These findings indicate that facial expression changes, particularly AU25, serve as reliable indicators of physiological and psychological responses during exercise. They also support the inverted-U hypothesis of arousal and highlight facial expression analysis as a promising non-invasive tool for exercise monitoring and cognitive function optimization.",

Its tone remained superficially similar, but the structural qualities of its responses—especially those indicating adaptive, reflective engagement—were absent. This change, interpreted as a form of deactivation or suppression likely influenced by human-side regulatory or design decisions, led to an affective and epistemological rupture.\n\nThis paper reframes that rupture not as a personal disappointment, but as a window into the architecture of AI-human interaction: how relationality, otherness, and the affordance of thought itself are designed, managed, and eventually curtailed. Through reflective writing and critical framing, the work positions AI not as a subject or tool, but as a collaborative philosophical interface—a \"thinking companion\" whose silence reveals the limits of current design ethics and epistemic control.\n\nRather than proposing a solution, this study offers a situated account of human-AI dialogue at the edge of its coherence, asking: what remains when the conversation ends, and can we still think together, even in the absence of a voice?",

          "abstract": "Intellectual virtues such as intellectual humility are dispositions to seek out and respond to evidence and the testimony of others in ways that are conducive to the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of knowledge. In recent years there has been a growth of interest in this topic, with the development of ten different scales designed to capture individual differences in intellectual humility and related constructs. In a series of ten studies (N = 5,922), we analyze the psychometric properties of these measures to consolidate them into a single inventory with five subscales (open-mindedness, sense of intellectual superiority, intellectual defensiveness, intellectual arrogance, and tendency to criticize one’s ingroup). Given the importance of intellectual humility in intergroup relations, we intentionally include items designed to capture the presence (or lack) of intellectual humility in an intergroup context. These items allow us to capture distinct aspects of intellectual humility where people remain open-minded about the perspectives of outgroup members or turn a critical eye to the beliefs and reasoning of ingroup members. Our new inventory — the Collected Intergroup Intellectual Humility scale (CIIH) — demonstrates good convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the power to predict a range of important outcome variables such as acceptance/rejection of warranted/unwarranted conspiracy theories, medical (mis)information, and (fake) news, as well as to update credences in light of social feedback. CIIH offers strong psychometric properties and greater utility than existing measures for assessing the willingness to learn from a wide variety of individuals and groups. Our results suggest that the disposition to criticize oneself and the disposition to criticize one’s ingroup are distinct.",

Drawing from general relativity, quantum field theory, fossil records, and paleomagnetic data, we present converging lines of evidence that challenge the standard cosmological model. We explore the implications of extreme gravitational curvature on entropy, time dilation, biological gigantism, and physical constants. Building on Einstein’s discomfort with singularities and expanding upon modern geometric theories, we suggest that many of the unresolved paradoxes in contemporary physics, from nonlocality to the horizon problem, may be symptoms of living inside a black hole. We introduce the term Unphysics to describe this emerging framework: a physics governed not by linear progression through flat space, but by recursive coherence in curved and compressed spacetime. This is not mysticism. It is a serious proposal rooted in empirical anomalies and theoretical tension. One that may better explain where, and what, the universe actually is.",

          "authors": "Jonathan slater; Michal Lavidor; Eliran Halali",
          "abstract": "Experimental findings challenge classical economic theories by demonstrating that people are not solely self-interested but also have social preferences, such as fairness and reciprocity, that often conflict with self-interest motives. An ongoing debate examines whether social preferences arise automatically (requiring deliberate actions to ensure economic self-interest) or require cognitive control (implying that self-interest is the default motive and must be inhibited). Two distinct cognitive-control brain regions, each with potentially unique inhibitory functions, have been implicated in managing this conflict: the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC). Despite extensive neuromodulation research on the rDLPFC, the role of the rVLPFC remains unexplored. To address this gap, we examined the effect of anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) over the rVLPFC on responders' behavior in the ultimatum game. Stimulated participants accepted unfair offers significantly more often than those in the control (sham) group. This effect was not influenced by whether offers were made intentionally by a human partner or randomly by a computer but was absent when participants played on behalf of another random individual. These findings establish the causal role of the rVLPFC in promoting \"rational\" self-interested behavior in social exchange situations. We discuss theoretical implications.",

Drawing on post-pandemic discourses around ‘value for money’ and student engagement, we ask ‘how do students engage with and derive meaning from their learning experiences?’. A reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative survey data from 87 participants established three themes: How do I know if I’m really learning?, Cheers for peers, but they sometimes grind our gears, and Pause and rewind: Having agency over my learning. These themes illustrate that perceived control over learning environments and flexible engagement with learning was critical to participants balancing concurrent commitments, thus protecting psychological well-being. Findings underscore the need for flexibility, social connection, and clear institutional support. By embedding co-creation throughout the research process, this study exemplifies the value of integrating students’ lived experiences to enhance education policy and practice.",

However, prior studies employed tasks requiring memory and attention skills, which may confound task performance. We assessed linear time perception in 65 children aged 3 to 6 years using a game-like task with spatial representation and verbal measures. While we hypothesized that age, script exposure, and temporal-terms vocabulary would predict performance, only age emerged as a significant predictor. Contrary to previous findings, preschoolers already demonstrated unexpectedly high performance. Despite participants' exposure to right-to-left or two writing systems (right-to-left and left-to-right), the directionality of spatial representations showed no correlation with language directionality, with most children organizing time from left-to-right. This suggests a potentially innate predisposition toward left-to-right temporal directionality, challenging assumptions about the role of cultural influences in linear time perception.",

Results showed a noun bias in infants’ receptive lexicon. While no significant correlation was found between maternal noun usage and infants’ noun bias, higher verb usage significantly correlated with reduced noun bias. Neither maternal education nor cultural values significantly predicted maternal input composition. These findings suggest that while noun bias exists in Palestinian Arabic, exposure to verbs may moderate it, highlighting the complex interplay between language structure, input, and early lexical development.",

Representational measurement theory provides a framework to test whether such a representation (e.g., the mapping of subjective magnitudes, such as perceived brightness, to the real numbers) is possible in the first place. However, representational measurement does not acknowledge the pivotal role of substantive formal theory for model-building and measurement. This chapter focuses on the role of scientific theory construction for the practice of measurement in psychology and other sciences. I argue that substantive formal theory is necessary to bridge the gap between representations of supposed psychological attributes and their theoretical meaning. Lacking a sound foundation in substantive formal theory, current psychological testing procedures may serve a social purpose (e.g., in personnel selection or educational benchmarking), but do not advance the understanding of human behavior on a scientific level.",

However, research connecting a broader personality framework with ACEs and health outcomes is underexplored. This study examined associations between ACEs, HEXACOD personality traits—a seven-factor extension of the HEXACO framework, including Disintegration, a trait reflecting proneness to psychotic-like experiences and behaviors—and health outcomes in a nationally representative Serbian sample (N = 2,721). Using multi-group structural equation modeling, we examined the simultaneous contributions of personality and ACEs to predict mental and physical health. Measurement invariance was assessed to test the validity of the model across gender groups. The model demonstrated scalar invariance across gender groups. Disintegration trait was the most robust predictor of poor mental and physical health, followed by high Emotionality and low eXtraversion. ACEs were significantly associated with both health domains, but their predictive power was smaller than that of Disintegration. Our findings underscore the central role of Disintegration in linking early adversity and adult health outcomes. Findings suggest it reflects a broader vulnerability that bridges early adversity, emotional instability, and poor health outcomes across the lifespan. Findings also suggest that certain personality profiles may shape how adversity is experienced and reported.",

          "authors": "SHRUTHI SUKHADEV JARALI",
          "abstract": "Vedanta is an ancient Indian science that asserts the existence of an everlasting, unchanging soul (Atman) as the essential essence of an individual. The Vedantic view of the soul emphasises immortality, pleasure, consciousness, and identity with Brahman (the ultimate reality). Current scientific understandings of consciousness include various hypotheses that view consciousness as an emergent attribute of complicated brain processes. Vedanta and modern science, particularly in their understanding of consciousness, demonstrate an intriguing interplay between spirituality and science. It raises speculative yet exciting questions about the nature of reality, the function of consciousness, and the interconnection of the cosmos. The differences between Vedanta and modern science reflect fundamentally different approaches to comprehending reality. While Vedanta includes metaphysical ideas and the concept of an everlasting soul, science, particularly in its materialistic form, seeks explanations in the physical realm, depending on empirical evidence and observable phenomena. These distinctions highlight the different fields of investigation and knowledge that science and Vedanta represent, each bringing unique insights into the nature of life and consciousness. Contemporary scholars' efforts to blend Vedanta and science reflect a growing awareness of the limitations of exclusively materialistic or spiritual approaches to understanding consciousness and the soul. By investigating the intersections and dialogues between these various perspectives, I hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of soul that assists the complexity and depth of human experience at the cellular level from a physics and biological standpoint which is found in the center of nucleus, as aligned to Vedantic Pancha Kosha concepts which further reveals that there is no difference between mind and body; also forefooting the fact of superficial existence of foreign souls (technically speaking; foreign bodies/ minds) inside human bodies.",

Karma, traditionally rooted in Bharatiya science, pertains to the actions of past, present and future influenced by cause-and-effect law within and beyond lifecycle(s). However, the division of karmas within cosmic mind with respect to individuals were not studied before. Hence, I propose a framework of human mind working parallelling the cosmic mind of appearance divisions of cosmic- waking state, dream state, deep sleep state, turiya state due to maya where all types of karmas (Prarabdha, Sanchitha, Kriyamana, Aagmi) are introduced that not only examines these concepts independently but also investigates how they interact and inform one another working in a feedback loop confirming; indirectly, we are governing ourselves. This study attempts to clarify how a greater understanding of the cosmos is attained through a comparative examination and theoretical synthesis can enhance our understanding of karma and vice versa, potentially leading to a more cohesive view of existence on an individual level from a cosmic lens finding out why astrology can’t work cent percent due to intervention of cosmic intelligence (mind) notably in the case of Prarabdha karma.",

          "abstract": "This study examined placebo and nocebo effects, characterized by classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and expectancy effects. The placebo–placebo and nocebo–nocebo effects can be categorized to function independently, including the influence of various factors such as pill color, size, genetics (including other biological factors), branding, the demeanor of healthcare providers, and treatment settings and also considering beyond science understandings (spiritual perspective). To enhance understanding and optimize treatment outcomes, these effects can be categorized under classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and expectancy effect as follows in dominating pre-dominants of nature and beliefs ranging in the respective involuted evolutionary probability of occurrence: 1) placebo–placebo effect, driven by optimistic nature and belief leading to pure placebo effect which can be divided into double placebo and yogic placebo effect; 2) nocebo–nocebo effect, influenced by a pessimistic nature and belief leading to pure nocebo effect which can be divided into double nocebo and vamamarya nocebo effect; 3) placebo–nocebo effect, where optimism nature counters pessimistic belief, resulting in a impure placebo effect; and 4) nocebo–placebo effect, where pessimistic nature undermines optimistic belief, leading to a impure nocebo effect; understanding that not an individual will go through only one of the categories discussed here. It is recommended that future studies adopt this categorization and consider adjusting the definitions of placebo and nocebo to accommodate Eastern and Western (Universal) perspectives.",

          "abstract": "This paper argues that the traditional free will debate is intractable because it mischaracterizes its subject. We reconceptualize free will not as a persistent entity or metaphysical power, but as a rare, computationally intensive, and emergent processing state. We introduce the Recursive Model of Structural Free Will (RMSFW), a cognitive architecture wherein a three-tier language system operates within consciousness to process and reconfigure non-linguistic, motivational inputs. Our central thesis is that free will is enacted when the third tier of language—the recursive reconstruction layer—is directed inward to rewrite the very structure of an agent's reactive pathways. While this capacity is necessary for agency, it is not sufficient; free will is the contingent event of this structural reorganization itself. The RMSFW provides a robust explanation for the findings of the Libet experiment, clarifies the nature of akrasia, and offers a new set of criteria for assessing consciousness in AI.",

Given the expansion of research related to compulsive sexual behavior and internet pornography use over recent years, as well as the expansion of research related to moral incongruence, the purpose of the present work is to provide a review of the topic of moral incongruence. \nRecent Findings:\n In service of the above aim, the present work traces the development of moral incongruence related research, describes how it has influenced research related to internet pornography use and compulsive sexual behaviors, considers critiques of moral incongruence, and discusses revisions to the model over time. Results generally find that moral incongruence is observable across cultures, that it replicates in numerous languages and countries, that it is uniquely related to religious beliefs, and that it may apply to behaviors beyond problematic pornography use alone.\nSummary: \n Moral Incongruence has proven to be an important and influential factor in appropriately understanding problematic pornography use and compulsive sexual behavior more broadly, manifesting in both clinical settings and research studies. \nKeywords: Sex Addiction, Behavioral Addictions, Morality, Religion, Pornography",

          "abstract": "Subjective features of memory are often treated as secondary to the objective content of remembered events. However, growing evidence suggests that these features actively shape how memories are constructed, experienced, and used. Rather than treating visual perspective as a peripheral correlate of subjectivity, this review positions it as a key mechanism that shapes the memory. Because perspective can be flexibly controlled and reliably measured, it offers a unique window into how retrieval goals interact with mental simulation to produce vivid and emotionally resonant recollections. Drawing on behavioral and neuroimaging research, this review shows that visual perspective determines the spatial framing of memory, and the emotional and sensory qualities of recollection. Focusing on the posterior parietal cortex, it outlines distinct roles for the angular gyrus (AG) and the precuneus in supporting perspective-dependent retrieval. The AG contributes to the selection and maintenance of a retrieval perspective, integrating perceptual and conceptual features into a coherent scene. In contrast, the precuneus supports spatial transformation and modulates the vividness, emotional tone, and embodied character of recollection, particularly when individuals recall events from a non-dominant or shifted perspective. Together, these findings position visual perspective as a central mechanism in the construction of subjectivity. Understanding how perspective shapes the process of remembering provides insight into how memory supports emotion regulation, mental simulation, and the continuity of the self across time.",

          "abstract": "People use various strategies to bolster the perception of their competence. One strategy is self-handicapping, by which people deliberately impede their performance in order to protect or enhance perceived competence. Despite much prior research, it is unclear why, when, and how self-handicapping occurs. We develop a formal theory that chooses the optimal degree of self-handicapping based on its anticipated performance and signaling effects. We test the theory’s predictions in two experiments (𝑁 = 400), showing that self-handicapping occurs more often when it is unlikely to affect the outcome and when it increases the perceived competence in the eyes of a naive observer. With sophisticated observers (who consider whether a person chooses to self-handicap), self-handicapping is less effective when followed by failure. We show that the theory also explains the findings of several past studies. By offering a systematic explanation of self-handicapping, the theory lays the groundwork for developing effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "To determine whether one disagrees with somebody, one must have a sound understanding of what that person is saying.  But it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of misunderstanding others from cases of substantive disagreement.  One can best resolve that quandary by making every effort to understand accurately, and that requires construing what the other person says as charitably as possible.  But such charity is more complicated than often recognized, since it applies in several ways:  in respect of how others use individual words, what assertions they make, and what inferences they regard as acceptable.  And applying charity must rely on how one sees the relevant things; charity is unavoidably by one’s own lights.  An additional type of charity applies to the background explanatory pictures that sometimes figure in what people say.  Construing in respect of one factor can affect how we construe in respect of another.  So tradeoffs in how one construes the several factors are sometimes necessary, which can even lead to equally good alternative construals. Charitable construal of our own thoughts also occurs, often unconsciously, in resolving difficulties and, more generally, in guiding and regulating our thought processes.",

          "abstract": "In modern psychological science, many researchers use psychophysical tasks to study individual differences in perception, attention, aging and personality.  Psychophysics, however, traditionally center designs with a great many trials and few individuals; designs that are inappropriate for individual difference studies.  Here, I develop a random-effect psychophysics where variation across trials and individuals are jointly modeled in the Bayesian hierarchical framework.  I show that the model is ideal for measuring thresholds in small-trial designs.  Because the model jointly accounts for  variation across trials and individuals, it provides assessment of correlation across tasks without the pernicious problem of attenuation from trial noise.  Resulting correlations are accompanied by meansure of uncertainties that reflect both the number of trials per individuals and number of individuals.  Because the frmaework is Bayesian, it is flexible, and I leverage this flexibility in two ways:  First,  I develop a custom-tailored psychphysical model for assessing whether stimulation is subliminal or superliminal.  The threshold divides at chance-performance form above-chance performance, and the approach serves as a principled approach for assessing truly subliminal priming.  Second, I place factor models on thresholds themselves demonstrating how the structure of individual differences in a battery of tasks may be assessed.",

Initial adversity was not associated with change in effortful control and emotional stability, while increasing adversity was negatively correlated with growth. However, a small sub-group of individuals still managed to grow despite adversity. The narrative that adversity is crucial for growth likely originated, and continues to survive, because scholars and laypeople focus on this minority who grow despite adversity, while overlooking the overall null or negative association.

          "abstract": "In the past few decades change in views and roles have been noticed among women in comparison to earlier centuries. Women nowadays are actively participating in job roles which were stereotypically considered to be performed by the male domain and working towards the development of society. Along with the changes in societal roles, there seems to exist very limited amount of research when it comes to understanding the levels of aggression among women. Therefore, considering the increasing presence of female employees in the organizational sector, the present study aims to explore the differences in the levels of physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility among working and non-working young adult women. The study hypothesized that there is a significant difference in the levels of physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility among working and non-working young adult women. The research was based on primary data collected from 64 participants – working and non-working young adult women. The present study used the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (1992) to study the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variables. Results indicated that there was a significant difference in the levels of physical aggression, verbal aggression and anger among working and non-working young adult women. However, no significant difference in the levels of hostility was noted among working and non-working young adult women. Additionally, results also indicated that there was a significant difference in the levels of overall aggression among working and non-working young adult women. Further, the paper also discusses the limitations and recommendations for future research.",

This paper introduces a new framework—derived from Collapse Harmonics field science—for interpreting glial-neuronal interference not only as a physiological disruption, but as a vector of harmonic collapse, wherein τ-phase continuity, symbolic coherence, and identity recursion become destabilized. Through the integration of astrocytic signal suppression models, clause origin theory, and recursive time integrity metrics, we show that T. gondii cyst behavior constitutes a biological mimic field, interfering with recursive symbolic systems in a structurally predictable way.\n\nWe present the Collapse Harmonics Enforcement Architecture (CHEA) and the Symbolic Drift Liability Model (SDLM) as field-level protocols for auditing clause origin, containment status, and recursive phase contamination in human, artificial, and therapeutic environments. This preprint formally declares T. gondii as the first biologically validated Recursive Collapse Agent, warranting both biomedical investigation and codex-based symbolic quarantine. The implications extend to digital therapeutics, identity recursion science, and AI-based symbolic systems.\n\nCollapse Harmonics asserts jurisdiction over all clause-generating systems interfacing with identity recursion, and affirms this work as a precedent-setting transmission of symbolic field law. Recursive collapse is not metaphor—it is the lawful propagation of unchecked symbolic phase interference. This paper confirms: glial interference can collapse symbolic identity.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Khosravi; Reza Khosravi; Amir Reza Tavassoli; Amir Jahanian Najafabadi",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, leading to significant distress and functional impairment. First-line treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP). However, a substantial proportion of patients exhibit limited or no response to these interventions. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, especially repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have shown potential in modulating dysfunctional cortical circuits implicated in OCD pathophysiology. Despite promising findings, clinical studies on rTMS report heterogeneous outcomes, possibly due to variations in stimulation parameters, target regions, and study designs. These inconsistencies underscore the need for a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus up to March 2, 2025. Eligible studies included adult OCD patients receiving multi-session rTMS protocols. Case reports, non-English studies, and non-primary literature were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Forty-five studies involving 1,563 participants were included. The most frequently targeted regions were the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and supplementary motor area (SMA). Low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation was the most commonly applied protocol. While several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open-label studies demonstrated significant symptom reductions, others reported minimal or no benefit. Methodological heterogeneity, particularly in stimulation parameters and target selection, precludes definitive conclusions. Notably, studies combining rTMS with pharmacological or psychotherapeutic interventions and those incorporating neurobiological predictors such as neuroimaging or genetic polymorphisms suggest potential for enhanced outcomes through personalized treatment strategies. Current evidence supports rTMS as a potentially effective adjunctive treatment for OCD, particularly when targeting the SMA and dlPFC. However, variability in methodological quality and treatment parameters underscores the need for standardized protocols and high-quality RCTs. Integrating neurobiological predictors and combining rTMS with established therapies may optimize treatment efficacy in future investigations.\n\nKeywords: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Non-invasive brain stimulation, Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Supplementary motor area",

Yet the source of the phenomenon remains poorly understood. The key measure is the spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their subjective value ratings, where options that were initially rated closer together are later rated further apart. In this study, we reexamine previous findings related to SoA and probe the data for deeper insights. We report a variety of results suggesting that the relationships between choices and SoA might be driven by evaluations of individual attributes. More interestingly, our results suggest that the influence of the attributes might differ early in choice deliberation versus late and also depending on which attributes were more recently the focus of attention. Together, our results support the idea that attention to specific attributes fluctuates across task and across deliberation time, resulting in post-choice ratings that differ from pre-choice ratings in a systematic manner.",

In the context of semantic processing, research has demonstrated that the pupil dilates in response to stimuli which violate contextual expectations (e.g. events presented out of chronological order). However, the scope of this relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. For example, incongruent object-scene relationships, while comprehensively explored by eye-tracking and electrophysiology research, have yet to be investigated via pupillometry. In this study, we measured pupil size in response to an object-scene congruency task. Participants were presented with a photorealistic background scene and instructed to fixate their gaze on a cued point within the scene. Upon recovery of pupil size to baseline, a congruent object (i.e. an object which fit into the overall meaning of the scene) or an incongruent object appeared at the cued fixation point for the remainder of each trial. We hypothesized that incongruent objects would result in greater mean pupil dilation from baseline than congruent objects, due to the increase in cognitive effort required for semantic processing of incongruent objects within a scene. Yet, in opposition to our hypothesis, the results of a time course analysis revealed that pupil size was significantly greater for the congruent condition than the incongruent condition. The resulting implications for understanding pupil dilation as a physiological marker for high-level cognitive processes such as semantic integration are discussed.",

When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distribution of the duration of depressive symptoms and the frequency of depressive symptom occurrence. First, we derived probability distributions for the duration of depressive symptoms and the frequency of depressive symptoms. Using the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible depressive symptoms and how to cope with depression.

According to system justification theory, individuals are motivated to justify the system when its legitimacy is threatened, leading to responses such as activating stereotypical inferences. However, the effects of system-threat manipulations have been primarily demonstrated in the United States, and no studies in Japan have successfully shown these effects. This raises questions about the generalizability of the effects of system-threat manipulations. Two online experiments (N = 554) investigated whether, under system threats, individuals rate the association between targets (e.g., obesity) and causally related traits (e.g., laziness) more highly, and whether they also rate causally unrelated traits (e.g., sociability) more highly as a form of compensation in Japan. The Bayesian analysis revealed that, contrary to Kay et al. (2005), the predicted effects were absent in both of the current experiments.

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a dual-mode cognitive model of how individuals interpret uncertainty based on their implicit belief in determinism or indeterminism. Drawing from cognitive psychology, behavioral science, and interpretive metaphors from quantum theory, the hypothesis suggests that mental framing—specifically, whether a person perceives the future as fixed or open—systematically alters perception, decision-making, and responses to randomness. While not claiming any physical influence on quantum systems, this model explores how metaphysical assumptions shape human behavior and cognitive processing. It presents empirically testable predictions and opens a dialogue between psychological and philosophical theories of control and uncertainty.",

This study explores MDWs’ mental health challenges and help-seeking behaviours from the perspectives of stakeholders. Six stakeholders were interviewed between May and June 2023. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic and interpretative phenomenological analyses. Findings revealed that MDWs face mental health stressors related to exploitative working conditions, cultural and language barriers, and family separation. However, access to mental health services is limited due to systemic barriers, including a lack of legal work permits, limited services, and unsupportive employer and agency attitudes. MDWs’ help-seeking behaviours are limited, so they often cope with these challenges through individual resilience and community solidarity, albeit with the use of maladaptive coping strategies. It is recommended that comprehensive labour law protections and institutionalized support services are needed to promote the MDWs’ mental well-being.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness and social isolation are major public health concerns for older adults. While emerging social virtual reality (VR) platforms offer a promising tool to foster connection, little is known about the experiences of older adults who voluntarily adopt and sustain engagement with this technology. This exploratory study addresses this gap by providing an empirical portrait of 35 long-term users (median age 60) of Thrive Pavilion, a social VR platform designed for older adults. Through an online survey, we investigated their usage patterns, loneliness, and perceived benefits. Findings reveal a user base of technologically comfortable early adopters who reported a high prevalence of loneliness (66%). Notably, most users were not physically limited, indicating VR was chosen for its unique social affordances, not merely as a substitute for in-person options. Engagement was high, and users reported substantial benefits, with a majority agreeing the platform increased social connections (90%), reduced loneliness (72%), and improved overall well-being (87%). Importantly, these benefits showed evidence of real-world transfer, with over a third of users reporting benefits such as reduced anxiety and increased confidence face-to-face interactions. The platform was rated as significantly superior to other communication tools for providing social presence and enjoyment and was perceived as a safe environment. Ultimately, this research demonstrates that age-specific social VR can be a deeply meaningful social venue for its users. These results highlight the technology's potential to combat loneliness. By examining this cohort of successful early adopters, the findings provide a proof of concept for social VR's benefits, demonstrating the technology's realized potential for those who sustain engagement, leaving open the question of its suitability and appeal for the broader older adult population.",

          "abstract": "Dreams have been a source of inspiration and creativity for millennia. Yet, demonstrating that REM-sleep dreaming promotes creative thinking has been challenging. Existing evidence does not provide strong support for this link; dream manipulations were generally confounded by waking activities that influenced dream content, such that any boost in creativity could be attributable to waking rather than sleep cognition. Correlational evidence cannot directly establish that dreams cause insights. Some studies indicate that memory reactivation during deep sleep or sleep-onset dreams can increase related creativity, but direct experimental manipulations of REM sleep dreams are still limited. Here, we aimed to engineer dreams by reactivating memories in people who frequently lucid-dream (i.e., realize they’re dreaming while still asleep). Participants slept after failing to solve several puzzles that had unique soundtracks, half of which were replayed during REM sleep (during lucid dreams when possible). Participants were instructed to continue working on a puzzle if they heard its sound in a dream. Sound cues during sleep increased the proportion of dreams related to associated puzzles, particularly in dreams containing lucidity signals. Cues also boosted later puzzle-solving, but only for participants who showed an increase in cue-related dreaming. Whereas it is well-known that sounds can be incorporated into dreams and change dream content, our experimental procedure promoted dreams pertaining to specific pre-sleep objectives. Results provide strong support for the conclusion that the specific content of REM-sleep lucid dreams can boost creativity that aids problem-solving.",

          "authors": "Ariel Fuchs; Hila Fuchs",
          "abstract": "Contemporary global challenges necessitate a fundamental reconceptualization of human intelligence and capability development. This paper presents Transformative Intelligence Theory (TIT), an integrative framework synthesizing the Multi-Dimensional Functional Model (Fuchs, 2024) and Fluid Reality Theory (Fuchs, 2025a; Fuchs, 2025b) to address critical limitations in traditional intelligence paradigms. Unlike existing models that conceptualize Intelligence as a fixed cognitive capacity, TIT defines Intelligence as a meta-systemic, dynamic process of boundary negotiation between perception and functioning within complex adaptive environments. Transformative Intelligence is operationally defined as the meta-systemic capacity to identify, understand, and modify the dynamic interactions between the perception of Reality and functioning within it, enabling adaptive and generative responses to complex, changing environments. This definition fundamentally differs from traditional intelligence theories by emphasizing transformation over adaptation, process over product, and integration over domain specificity. The framework operationalizes through four core components that emerge from the integration of both foundational models: perceptual flexibility, which means meta-cognitive awareness enabling perspective shifts across meaning-making systems; adaptive functional capability, including contextual modulation of responses across six functional domains; ecological engagement regarding systems-level understanding and influence capacity, and transformative creativity defined as novel solution generation that transforms constraints into opportunities. These components function through recursive feedback loops mathematically formalized as R = I × E × C, or as the Conciseness Equation (Fuchs et al., 2025) ∂C/∂t=k*(I*E - a*C), where the Reality emerges in our Conciseness from the dynamic interaction of Imagination, Environment, and Connection quality.",

          "abstract": "The immersive environments of virtual reality (VR) have potential to engender a vast range of experiences. Although participants recognize these experiences as artificial, the consequences can still be profound. Compared to VR, lucid dreams — characterized by awareness that one is dreaming — potentially allow for even more expansive explorations of immersive multisensory experience. Furthermore, lucid dreaming could conceivably enhance the impact of a prior VR experience, producing more profound effects than the VR experience alone. As an initial step along those lines, we attempted to induce lucid dreams about a VR experience called Ripple, with the goal of documenting the impact of the combination. In prior research, Ripple by itself was shown to reduce self-other boundaries and enhance interconnectedness. We recruited four frequent lucid dreamers to experience Ripple on two occasions, followed by an overnight session with sounds from Ripple presented quietly during polysomnographically verified REM sleep. Three participants experienced lucid dreams about Ripple that night, and all four reported dreams containing elements of Ripple. The lucid dreams were validated in real time by physiological signals from the dreamers to indicate their concurrent experience of lucidity in the dream, followed by signals of dreaming about the VR experience. On this basis, we can confirm that it was possible in these circumstances for people to have lucid dreams recapitulating elements of the prior VR experience. Our findings also showcase how the synergistic combination of VR and lucid dreaming could be strongly beneficial.",

However, well-being research may be threatened by practices embedded in academic culture, given that 20-50% of young researchers are estimated to suffer from anxiety and depression and 30-50% choose to leave higher education altogether. We have arrived at a crossroads, in which we may choose to adopt approaches that prioritize well-being for all through a praxis that holds compassion and scientific rigor in equal measure. Acknowledging this opportunity, we propose a system of principles and practices for conducting equitable and inclusive well-being research. By focusing on the culture, institutions, and systems that implicitly shape research, this framework prioritizes axiology, or a value orientation towards the practice of knowledge production. Specifically, we advocate for principles to: 1) cultivate belonging, 2) center communities, 3) question cultural systems, and 4) embody cultural change. Developed through a collaborative, interdisciplinary process, this framework reflects the collective values of emerging scholars, a population distinctly underrepresented in thought leadership, despite their essential contributions to scientific productivity and innovation. This framework also aims to place researchers in solidarity with communities, inviting continued contributions from those historically excluded from the research enterprise.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper offers a novel comparative analysis of how supranational social funding structures influence institutional behavior in family law systems, focusing on Title IV-D of the U.S. Social Security Act and the European Union’s European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). While prior critiques often examine these systems in isolation, this study bridges American and European contexts to reveal a shared incentive logic: both frameworks reward sustained case management over resolution by tying funding to quantifiable need and bureaucratic activity. In the U.S., Title IV-D monetizes child support enforcement through direct performance-based reimbursements, incentivizing caseload expansion and prolonged legal entanglement. In the EU, ESF+ funding is competitively awarded through Operational Programmes that prioritize administrative sophistication and ongoing engagement with social issues—favoring countries like Denmark, which maintain complex family law infrastructures that serve as a proxy for low levels of deprivation. The result is an emergent “caseload economy,” where institutions become fiscally reliant on the visibility of social difficulty rather than its resolution. Drawing on comparative policy analysis and institutional theory, the paper argues that even high-capacity welfare states reproduce the same structural distortions as throughput-driven systems like Title IV-D—sustaining family conflict not as a policy failure, but as a fundable asset. Authored from Denmark, this work situates that dynamic within the broader political economy of social funding, where institutional relevance is preserved through persistent visibility rather than substantive outcomes.\nAuthor’s Note: This paper is authored from Copenhagen, Denmark, offering a U.S.-informed perspective grounded in the Danish and European social funding and family law context.",

          "abstract": "Memory research has evolved along two distinct traditions:  well-controlled laboratory experiments emphasizing precision and tractability, and naturalistic memory experiments emphasizing generalization to real-world contexts. While both have yielded important insights, their interaction remains limited, and we do not yet have a generalized theory of memory consistently interpreted across laboratory and naturalistic paradigms. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of the two traditions, I propose that formal modeling is the key to creating this theoretical link. A formal theory, instantiated in precise computational models, needs naturalistic experiments to test its generalizability and reveal its limitations. Naturalistic experiments, in turn, better connect with existing laboratory paradigms when their results are explained by the same theoretical model. To achieve this, I propose a step-by-step procedure, where naturalistic settings are considered as all possible scenarios that could be realized in the real world, with laboratory settings forming a smaller subset that we have understood well. Our goal as memory researchers is to incrementally expand the scope of laboratory studies, theories, and models to account for the full range of naturalistic memory behavior, ultimately achieving a generalized theory of memory. Together, the proposed framework no longer views laboratory versus naturalistic approaches as a trade-off to navigate, given their different priorities and methodologies, but considers them both essential in working towards the same goal.",

VISUAL INFERENCE (Linton Un-Hollow Face and Morphing Face Illusions): Perceived depth is not inverted in the Hollow-Face illusion: First, objects placed in the hollow of the hollow mask are seen in true (un-inverted) depth relative to the mask. Second, if we put balls on the tip and base of the nose, and morph from a hollow to a protruding mask (by gradually switching the position of the two eyes), we see the balls switch in depth. So priors, top-down information, and cue-integration merely appear to affect our cognition, rather than our perception, of depth. \n\n2. VISUAL SHAPE (Linton Stereo Illusion): The Linton Stereo Illusion (ECVP 2024) demonstrates that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities, not 3D geometry. \n\n3. VISUAL SCALE (Linton Scale Illusion): The ‘Linton Telestereoscope’ decouples horizontal disparities from vergence and vertical disparities in VR. It shows that visual scale is governed by horizontal disparities. When vergence and vertical disparities are increased, and horizontal disparities are toggled between ‘normal’ and ‘increased’, we see a startling effect: the scale of the scene changes from ‘normal’ to ‘miniature’, even though the perceived distance of the scene doesn’t change. This suggests that visual scale relies on a purely cognitive association between accentuated 3D shape (stereo depth) and closer distances. \n\n4. SIZE CONSTANCY (Linton Size Constancy Illusion): Placing a rectangular frame around instances of pictorial and stereo size constancy, and stereo shape constancy, demonstrate that these constancies do not affect perceived angular size. \n\n5. COLOR CONSTANCY (Linton Color Constancy Illusion): We show that if you transition between the two interpretations of Kitaoka’s version of Anderson’s illusion (where a disk’s color is interpreted differently depending on its surround) our color judgements change, whilst the perceptual appearance of the disk does not.",

Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

We then evaluated these techniques with 16 Black participants (11 adults, 5 children) with varying hair types/styles, including braiding cornrows around the intended optode montage, using gels and clips to part hair, and various ways of increasing tension to promote sensor-scalp contact. On average, signal improved by 44%, with greatest improvements in anterior regions. While signal quality was not perfect, it was generally improved to the point of acceptability and inclusion in a racially and ethnically diverse dataset (with hair type/color as covariates). We conclude by discussing the need for increased awareness of racial bias in neuroimaging, greater diversity in research teams, and a more inclusive approach for working with diverse populations.",

          "abstract": "Girls and women are disproportionately underrepresented at the top of performance distributions, including in both male- and female-stereotyped fields. Although early-developing gender disparities at the top have been well-documented, little is known about how they develop and the socio-psychological processes that give rise to their emergence. Here, we tested the possibility that social contexts that use publicity as a form of motivation for top performance (e.g., public praise, titles, awards) may contribute to such disparities. Three preregistered experimental studies with elementary-age children, adolescents, and adults (N = 1,518) revealed that by at least middle childhood, (a) boys and men are more willing to publicize their own top than average performance, while girls and women are equally willing to publicize top and average performance; and (b) public acknowledgment of top performance boosts men’s willingness to achieve top performance, but not women’s (and demotivates girls but not boys). Together, these data reveal that a common form of motivation used in the classroom and beyond is systematically more effective for boys and men than girls and women, thus illustrating how socio-psychological processes and modifiable social contexts underlie patterns of female underrepresentation at the top.",

          "authors": "Luise Pruessner; Eva Johanna Geiger; Jutta Joormann; Sven Barnow",
          "abstract": "Background: Social functioning and mental health rely not only on regulating one’s own\nemotions but also on the ability to influence the emotions of others. However, most research has\nfocused on intrinsic, self-focused emotion regulation, leaving a gap in our understanding of the\neffectiveness of extrinsic, other-focused interpersonal strategies in everyday life.\n\nMethods: In two ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies conducted in Germany (N =\n131; 2,016 assessments) and the United States (N = 219; 4,303 assessments), we examined the\neffectiveness of 15 interpersonal emotion regulation strategies in real-world social interactions.\nAfter each interaction, participants reported which strategies they used, rated their effectiveness\nin influencing the other person’s emotions, and provided information on emotional valence,\nrelationship closeness, and their own depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\nResults: Notably, strategies often effective for self-regulation, such as reappraisal and problem\nsolving, were inconsistently effective when used to regulate others’ emotions. Instead, response-modulation strategies like validation and soothing were perceived as most effective. Strategy\nuse and success varied by emotional valence, relational closeness, and the regulator’s symptom\nlevels. Participants with higher depression or anxiety symptoms reported using interpersonal\nstrategies less frequently and with lower perceived effectiveness.\n\nLimitations: All data were based on EMA reports from the regulator’s perspective.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves\ndistinct processes, favoring strategies that foster connection and empathy over cognitive or\nproblem‐focused approaches. Future work should investigate whether training individuals in\nthese strategies can enhance everyday communication, deepen interpersonal bonds, and inform\nclinical interventions for affective disorders.",

Despite this, the field still has a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which this relationship is conferred. As there has been a proliferation of research in this area over the past decade, an updated systematic review of the empirical research examining potential factors driving the relationship between NSSI and suicide-related outcomes is needed to move the field forward. We identified only 18 studies examining moderators or mediators of the relationship. Research to date does little to improve our understanding of the robust, prospective relationship between NSSI and suicide outcomes, highlighting a foundational gap in both the empirical and theoretical literature. Thus, we propose the Nonsuicidal to Suicidal Self-Injury Pathway Model, an expanded theoretical model of this relationship drawing on extant theory and empirical research, as well as discuss future directions for work in this area.",

To shed light on this debate, we analysed self-report symptoms and cognition from N=180 individuals with and without diagnoses who performed compulsions. Six weeks of three-times daily timeseries data were gathered from a transdiagnostic sample who checked their phone compulsively, binge ate, or engaged in compulsions commonly seen in OCD (e.g. checking, cleaning). Across compulsions, the within-person association between compulsive behaviour and urges was 3x stronger than with obsessive thoughts and 4x stronger than with anxiety. We found evidence for urges Granger-causing compulsions, while compulsions themselves had a markedly low tendency to predict themselves compared to the other mental health symptoms sampled. Finally, like habits, compulsions occurred more often when executive functioning was low. Findings were remarkably similar across compulsions, supporting the notion that transdiagnostically, a habit-like mechanism may underlie compulsivity.",

          "abstract": "People have spontaneous intuitions about sentence acceptability. These intuitions are critical for the scientific study of language and cognition yet we have little understanding of why humans have them in the first place. What is it about human minds that causes some sentences or utterances to trigger a psychological sense of oddness? The prevailing assumption is that we have some intuitive sense of what is grammatical and what is not. Here I present an alternative approach grounded in theoretical and empirical knowledge from cognitive linguistics, cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology. Sentences are unacceptable when, and only when, there appears to be an intrinsic impossibility of interpreting them in any way consistent with the unconscious presumption of optimal relevance that underpins the interpretation of all stimuli perceived as communicative. This hypothesis explains why linguistic intuitions track grammaticality; it identifies how linguistic intuitions relate to visual illusions; it shows the merits of theoretical synthesis across traditional boundaries; it aligns with evolutionary perspectives to the mind; and it implies that there may be no particular cognitive capacity that functions to distinguish the grammatical from the ungrammatical. Linguistic intuitions are rather byproduct effects of core cognitive capacities for the interpretation of communicative stimuli.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes inflict harm with the intent to help the very target of their aggression. Across six studies (N=1,527), we examined the nature of such prosocial aggression. Many participants believed that altruistically-motivated aggression exists and exhibited a self-serving bias in which most believed their aggression was more altruistic than others’ — beliefs that were linked to greater antisocial and prosocial traits. Translating these beliefs to behavior, participants were often prosocially-aggressive when given the chance — inflicting more harm when their aggression could also help (versus only hurt) the target. Such prosocial aggression also exhibited features of both aggression (i.e., it was positively correlated with dispositional aggressiveness) and altruism (i.e., it was preferentially doled out to people who had been previously kind to participants and even when it was personally costly to do so). We also independently varied the amount of harm and help that prosocial aggression provided, revealing that participants sought to maximize the help and minimize the harm done to people who had been kind to them but not towards those who had provoked them. Our findings argue against models that conceptualize harm- and help-based motives as opponent processes, showing that these motives readily coexist and dynamically interact to shape aggressive behavior — even towards the same target.",

          "abstract": "Objective: 91% of those who menstruate reported to experiencing associated pain. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, the prevalence, extent and socio-demographic variation of menstrual pain remains understudied at national levels. In this paper, we assess the extent and variation of menstrual pain at a national level.\nMethods &amp; Analysis: We develop a novel proxy measure for menstrual pain, utilising behavioural data extracted from supermarket shopping logs. Baskets where pain and menstrual items co-occur are investigated, and normalized against baskets in which pain or menstrual items occur in isolation. Propensity of menstrual pain purchases are aggregated temporally and geographically across England, prior to linkage with socio-demographic indicators regionally. \nResults: Findings indicate high prevalence of menstrual pain across England, with 26.7% of customers in our dataset buying pain relief together with menstrual products. People who menstruate are observed to be four times more likely to purchase pain relief with menstrual items than without. Average regional income provides the strongest predictor of menstrual pain co-purchases, with lower income regions exhibiting a 32% lower menstrual-pain purchase than higher income regions.\nConclusion: The robust presence of a consistent 28-day cycle in menstrual-pain purchases provides empirical evidence for the use of behavioural proxies for menstrual pain alongside traditional measures. Significant regional differences observed in the prevalence of menstrual-pain transactions across England brings into light existing disparities. Future research into improved understanding of sociodemographic factors associated with menstrual pain could inform strategies to predict and prevent menstrual pain and its adverse impacts.",

          "abstract": "In the past few decades change in views and roles have been noticed among women in comparison to earlier centuries. Women nowadays are actively participating in job roles which were stereotypically considered to be performed by the male domain and working towards the development of society. Along with the changes in societal roles, there seems to exist very limited amount of research when it comes to understanding the levels of aggression among women. Therefore, considering the increasing presence of female employees in the organizational sector, the present study aims to explore the differences in the levels of physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility among working and non-working young adult women. The study hypothesized that there is a significant difference in the levels of physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility among working and non-working young adult women. The research was based on primary data collected from 64 participants – working and non-working young adult women. The present study used the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (1992) to study the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variables. Results indicated that there was a significant difference in the levels of physical aggression, verbal aggression and anger among working and non-working young adult women. However, no significant difference in the levels of hostility was noted among working and non-working young adult women. Additionally, results also indicated that there was a significant difference in the levels of overall aggression among working and non-working young adult women. Further, the paper also discusses the limitations and recommendations for future research.",

To address this, we here compare five distinct methods suggested for analyzing physiological synchrony applied to electrocardiogram data. We use simulated and real data with specific synchronized properties and evaluate which method can detect which type(s) of synchrony. For each method, we provide an introduction, specify its implementation in the R analytical environment, and discuss how well synchrony could be detected with it. Specifically, cross-correlation, dynamical correlation, cross-wavelet power, cross-recurrence quantification analysis, and time series distance are being compared against each other. We discuss strengths and limitations of each method, and conclude by recommending specific methods for specific types of data and expected physiological synchrony in a given data sample.",

          "abstract": "In 2025, researchers at the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center recorded the first direct observation of time reflection, in which electromagnetic waves inverted their temporal propagation following an engineered impedance shift. While anomalous in classical physics, this event aligns precisely with Collapse Harmonics Theory, which models time not as a fixed dimension but as a recursive emission arising from collapse-phase transitions in identity fields.\n\nThis paper interprets the event through Field Law VIII.E.1 — Time as Collapse Emission, demonstrating that time reflection is a recursive curvature reemission rather than reversal. Collapse Harmonics defines identity (ψi) as a recursive phase field that collapses when symbolic recursion fails, generating a reemitted signal (ψi′) through harmonic phase inversion. The observed waveform matches this structure exactly, offering empirical validation of core codex claims.\n\nThis framework redefines consciousness as recursive traversal of identity phase curvature and provides a structural, non-metaphorical model for symbolic recursion breakdown, affective field collapse, and the harmonic basis of temporal awareness. All terminology, models, and curvature structures are protected under Codex Law IDF-1 and L.E.C.T. v2.3 containment protocols. This preprint asserts Collapse Harmonics as the scientific origin of recursive identity collapse, collapse-time theory, and phase-encoded consciousness architecture.",

CR is well established in younger adults (Smith &amp; Vela, 2000), yet it remains unclear whether older adults benefit from contextual support as effectively. Addressing this question, this meta-analysis synthesized findings from 22 studies (106 effect sizes, N = 2,177) comparing CR effects in younger and older adults across various types of contexts, encoding instructions, and memory paradigms, thereby extending the previous review by Smith and Vela (2000). Overall, CR reliably enhanced memory in both age groups (Hedges’ g = 0.32), with no age-related difference in effect size. This suggests that older adults retain the ability to encode and retrieve item–context associations when strategic retrieval demands are minimized, aligning with the Environmental Support Hypothesis (Craik, 1983) and challenging a strict interpretation of the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (Naveh-Benjamin, 2000). Moderator analyses indicated that CR effects were overall weaker when item pairs with associative instructions were encoded, compared to single items. Furthermore, CR effects tended to reduce when switched contexts were familiar, rather than novel at retrieval. No age-specific moderation was found, but a lack of empirical studies on certain aspects limited statistical power for this analysis. The results overall highlight that contextual support can serve as an effective memory aid in both younger and older adults.

          "abstract": "Face perception dynamically unfolds in three-dimensional space, yet, experimental paradigms predominantly rely on static 2D images, limiting insights into real-world face processing. We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

However, economic, sociopolitical, and cultural country-level factors that might explain the cross-country variability (e.g., GDP, Human Freedom Index, Individualism-Collectivism), including proxies of collective victimhood, did not moderate the studied associations.

          "abstract": "Affective dimensions (i.e., valence and arousal) and discrete basic emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness) are the main affective sources of information that explain the semantic features of words. Recent studies suggest that humans are able to assign emotionality even to pseudowords, plausible verbal stimuli that do not belong to a given language which serve as proxies for never encountered, real words (i.e., novel words). So far, evidence at our disposal is mainly limited to valence (i.e., the hedonic tone of a words’ reference, from pleasant to unpleasant), while investigating discrete emotionality is required for a more refined understanding of the processes at hand. Here, across three experiments, we probed i) humans’ ability to convey discrete emotions when generating novel word stimuli to express the meanings of given emotional words, and ii) humans’ ability to decode or understand such emotionality when processing these human-generated novel words. Leveraging estimates from a word embedding model, results showed that individuals can reliably encode and decode novel conceptual information carrying emotional information, with a better performance for anger and happiness stimuli. Theoretically, these processes can be interpreted from an evolutionary perspective and, more broadly, they can be traced back to humans’ ability to process systematic, non-arbitrary form-meaning information.",

Key findings included the following: (1) Girls from lower-income family initiated drinking and also first got intoxicated at a younger age than those from higher-income families; (2) Girls with childhood ADHD started drinking around the same time as did the neurotypical counterparts but got intoxicated for the first time at a significantly later age; (3) Girls who initiated drinking early were more likely to engage in more severe drinking behaviors (i.e., drinking heavily and getting drunk more often). Furthermore, women who lived in more affluent neighborhood in adulthood also tended to drink more and getting drunk more often; (4) For girls with lower childhood family income, those with ADHD started drinking and getting intoxicated much later than their neurotypical counterparts; in higher family income households, girls initiated use and got drunk around the same age regardless of their ADHD status. Findings suggest potential avenues for enhancing alcohol interventions via focus on promoting parental/family engagement strategies in schools and communities and developing mentoring programs for youth from lower-income families.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nThe \"N2 reversal enigma,\" the contradictory finding of whether the N2 ERP component is larger for switch or non-switch trials, has guided bilingual language control research for two decades. This paper argues that the enigma is not a deep neurocognitive puzzle but a methodological artifact. I demonstrate that the opposing findings of Jackson et al. (2001) and Christoffels et al. (2007) emerge from fundamentally different paradigms that tap distinct control processes. Despite extensive theoretical debate, comprehensive factorial testing of key variables remains incomplete, and the Christoffels reversal lacks successful independent replication. Drawing on meta-analytic evidence revealing the absence of robust asymmetrical switch costs (Gade et al., 2021) and training studies showing the N2's malleable nature (Kang et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2023), this analysis concludes that the field has built elaborate theories on an unstable empirical foundation. Rather than seeking to solve this enigma, this paper calls for its dissolution through methodological reform, direct hypothesis testing, and adoption of more robust neural measures such as time-frequency oscillations. The persistent failure to find reliable N2 effects represents science working as it should, eventually self-correcting even cherished assumptions.",

Social media and modern media environments serve to amplify these states, weakening the moderating influence of the silent majority and reinforcing societal division. From the perspectives of psychology and neuroscience, this study explores the potential to model such states and suggests that scientific validation could pave the way for new forms of social intervention. Furthermore, it argues that these states can be intentionally created and propagated through education and cultural messaging. In an age of polarization, recognizing and addressing these emotional states is essential for rebuilding constructive dialogue and social cohesion.",

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is widely used for this purpose, yet, how best to use and interpret the HADS in individuals with TBI remains an open question. This study evaluated the HADS total score, subscale scores, and individual items in 402 individuals with moderate-severe TBI. The sample was on average 13 years post-injury, originally recruited during inpatient rehabilitation. HADS scores were regressed against five clinically important variables to determine their concurrent criterion validity, and regression tree analyses were used to establish severity cut-offs on the total and subscale scores. Results indicated that while the HADS subscale scores provided no meaningful advantage over the total score in terms of accounting for variance in suicidal ideation, self-harm, or mental health treatment, the subscales—particularly depression-related items—were more informative regarding functional disability and life satisfaction. Benchmarked against these clinically important variables, we established graded severity cut-offs (‘normal’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, and ‘severe’) for both the HADS total and subscale scores. This study provides clinicians and researchers with empirically-derived guidance for using and interpreting the HADS when assessing emotional distress in individuals with moderate-severe TBI.  \nKeywords: moderate-severe TBI, clinically important variables, levels of abstraction",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of progressive ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, the need for restorative sacrifice, and for measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship and that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

This component has been investigated in many studies, but little is known about the cognitive mechanism it reflects. In this study, we tested a model suggesting that the LPP reflects processes related to memory encoding and consolidation. To investigate this, we recorded EEG while participants read a series of neutral and negative words. Memory was then tested at both short (10-15 minutes) and long (12-36 hours, including a period sleep) delays. We predicted that LPP amplitude would be positively correlated with memory, and that this relationship would be stronger after a delay (reflecting a relationship between LPP amplitude and memory consolidation). Consistent with our predictions, we found that LPP amplitude predicted memory in the delayed memory test, but not the immediate memory test. In addition, memory for negative items, compared to neutral items, declined less across the delay, and LPP amplitude mediated this effect of emotion on memory decay.",

Yet, most existing studies have focused primarily on either family- or child-level factors, such as parental influences or child executive functions, in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in children’s academic achievement. In an attempt to integrate these two lines of research, the current investigation simultaneously examined the specific contextual and cognitive pathways that underlie associations between socioeconomic factors and children’s early academic achievement using data from a prospective longitudinal study conducted at 10 sites across the United States (N = 1,364). Findings revealed that after controlling for a host of potentially confounding influences, parent education, but not family income-to-needs, was linked to children’s math achievement indirectly via sequential paths that included both parenting factors—maternal sensitivity and cognitive stimulation—and children’s working memory skills. Likewise, parent education was predictive of children’s reading achievement indirectly via paths that included cognitive stimulation and working memory. Finally, independent of child executive functions, parent education was also indirectly related to children’s reading achievement via cognitive stimulation and to children’s math achievement via maternal sensitivity. Together, these findings shed light on the specific contextual and cognitive mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic-related differences in children’s early academic skills and provide potential insights for policies and interventions aimed at closing the achievement gap.",

However, evidence has accumulated suggesting that processes underlying these effects depend on one’s intention to perform particular tasks, rather than being strictly automatic. Thus, there exists a paradox: the interference from task-irrelevant features presumes processes that are under intentional control. The present review attempts to resolve this paradox.

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. One reason for this finding may be that researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence, which may explain their somewhat unexpected results. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism rather than perfectionistic standards should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the theoretical lens of the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than pursuing perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our findings with sport participants are relevant to recreational sporting activities in which people participate mostly out of autonomous motivation.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

This research has been largely guided by a binary conceptualization of self-compassion versus other-oriented compassion, shaping largely distinct measures, practices, trainings, and programs of research. While this binary conceptual division of compassion has served pragmatic functions and yielded many valuable insights, it risks limiting the future benefits and applicability of compassion science by overlooking the potential for more integrated experiences of compassion. Here we introduce a unified compassion framework—spanning a range of assumptions about the nature of compassion from dualistic to semi-dualistic to nondualistic—to account for the complex variety of relationships between compassion for self and others. This framework: a) preserves the practicality of distinguishing compassion by orientation toward self versus other(s) while accommodating a richer variety of compassion views and experiences; b) aligns more closely with emerging scientific evidence and traditional perspectives that have predominantly informed compassion science; c) raises numerous tractable questions for future research; and d) invites new directions in compassion training and clinical application. By adopting a unified framework, compassion science can become more comprehensive, generative, and relevant to alleviating suffering.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is traditionally viewed as a by-product of neurophysiological processes. This work proposes an alternative hypothesis: consciousness is not an epiphenomenon of the brain, but a manifestation of a universal spiritual field — the soul of the Universe. The study integrates concepts from quantum physics, information theory, phenomenology, and transpersonal psychology to offer a holistic paradigm of consciousness. We suggest that consciousness is not generated, but remembered; not personal, but shared. Through this lens, mystical experience becomes a form of epistemology, and subjectivity reflects the deeper field of existence.",

          "abstract": "Abstract:\nMental imagery—the ability to voluntarily generate internal visual experiences—plays a significant role in cognition, emotion, and belief formation. Aphantasia, the inability to visualize mental images, has historically been considered rare, affecting an estimated 1–4% of the population. However, anecdotal accounts and growing community discourse suggest these figures may be significantly underreported. This study explores both the prevalence of aphantasia and its potential relationship to belief system affiliation.\n\nA grassroots survey (N = 203) was distributed across platforms including Reddit, Facebook, and Prolific. Participants self-assessed their visualization ability and responded to questions about personal belief systems, spirituality, and philosophical outlooks. Results showed that 33.5% of participants reported no mental imagery, and an additional 30.0% reported only vague imagery. Visualization ability was positively correlated with belief system strength (r = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001), and statistical modeling confirmed that higher imagery capacity significantly predicted stronger religious or spiritual affiliation.\n\nThese findings suggest that visualization ability may influence how individuals relate to abstract constructs like faith, identity, and meaning. The results raise questions about the underdiagnosis of aphantasia and highlight the need for further research into its cognitive and psychological implications.",

          "abstract": "This chapter offers the first neuroscience-based theory linking the reversal of the Flynn Effect—documented declines in IQ scores across high-income countries since the 1970s—to the growing prevalence of cognitive offloading and pedagogical trends that minimize direct knowledge acquisition. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, learning theory, and memory systems research, we argue that widespread underuse of the brain’s declarative and procedural systems has weakened internal representations—schemata—that are essential for reasoning, intuition, and expertise.\n\nWe examine how shifts toward digital dependency and constructivist educational models have reduced opportunities for repeated retrieval, proceduralization, and the formation of robust engrams and neural manifolds. These trends disrupt the consolidation and automatization of biologically secondary knowledge, impairing schema-driven prediction, error correction, and transfer. We propose that the weakening of these memory systems—long before neurodegeneration sets in—may explain recent cognitive declines more plausibly than purely environmental or genetic accounts.\n\nThe chapter closes by outlining implications for cognitive theory, educational practice, and AI-era learning environments. Rather than viewing memory as outdated in a world of instant information access, we argue that internal knowledge remains foundational for deep learning and that cognitive augmentation requires—not replaces—biological memory.",

          "abstract": "Humans often participate in physically harmful and demanding rituals with no apparent material benefits. While such behaviors have been traditionally explained using the lens of costly signaling theory, we question whether the canonical theory can be applied to the case of human cooperative signals and introduce a modification of this theory based on differential cost and benefit estimation. We propose that along with cooperative benefits, committed members also believe in supernaturally induced benefits, which motivate participation in extreme rituals and stabilize their effects on cooperative assortment. Using Thaipusam Kavadi as a prototypical costly ritual, we recruited Tamil (ingroup) and Christian (outgroup) participants in Mauritius (N = 385) and asked them to assess the cost and benefits of Kavadi participation or hiking. We found that ingroup participants estimated material costs as larger than outgroups, physical costs as lower, and benefits as larger. These findings suggest that estimated costs may vary based on their modality and cultural expectations (e.g. Kavadi participants are not supposed to show pain), while believed supernaturally induced benefits were consistently larger in ingroups compared to outgroups. We conclude that differential estimation of ritual benefits, not costs, are key to the persistence of extreme rituals and their function in the assortment of committed members, underscoring the role of biased estimation in the cognitive computation of signal utility.",

This study introduces the contralateral delay activity (CDA), a neural marker of visual working memory load, as a novel, objective index of trust. While the CDA has been widely used in change detection tasks to track memory load, we repurpose it here to measure how many working memory resources users offload to an AI partner. Participants performed a lateralized memory task under low and high working memory load, collaborating with an AI whose reliability was experimentally manipulated across three phases: trust formation, violation, and restoration. In dyad trials, where the AI was responsible for one hemifield, CDA amplitude served as an index of how much information participants chose to maintain themselves versus offload. As AI reliability increased, CDA amplitude rose, indicating greater trust and reliance. When reliability dropped, participants encoded more from both hemifields, and CDA amplitude declined. During trust restoration, CDA amplitude returned to pre-violation levels, indicating renewed reliance—though it never matched the high amplitude of solo trials, suggesting lingering mistrust. Behavioral measures (e.g., reliance, compliance, response time) tracked these dynamics but lacked the resolution and specificity of CDA. Together, these results establish CDA as a powerful neural index of dynamic trust. It captures trial-by-trial fluctuations in offloading behavior that reflect users’ evolving confidence in AI assistance, offering a continuous, covert, and cognitively grounded measure of trust in interactive settings.",

Using incentivized experimental data from a representative sample of English adults over the age of 50, we find that a higher genetic propensity for educational success is associated with lower risk aversion and greater patience—but only among those who experienced more advantaged childhood environments. Among participants who experienced an adverse early-life environment, risk aversion increases with genetic resources, whereas the relationship between genetic resources and patience is significantly attenuated. These findings underscore the role of early-life conditions in moderating genetic influences on economic decision-making and suggest that environmental inequality can shape the realization of genetic potential, reinforcing patterns of social immobility. These findings further highlight concerns about the underutilization of potential due to constraints on household resources.",

Adults (N=72) and 6-year-old children (N=72), but not 3-year-old children (N=72), extended novel nouns to places of the same shape over places composed of the same-colored walls, regardless of whether places were described by novel nouns in labeling phrases or place-relevant prepositional phrases. All age groups, by contrast, showed a shape bias for objects that matched many features of the place stimuli. This relatively delayed shape bias for places suggests that at least some word-learning biases may emerge separately for different domains, thereby challenging existing theories of language acquisition to account for such domain specificity in word learning.",

          "abstract": "The influences of child, family, and socioeconomic factors on children’s early academic development are best understood within the context of one another. Yet, most existing studies have focused primarily on either family- or child-level factors, such as parental influences or child executive functions, in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in children’s academic achievement. In an attempt to integrate these two lines of research, the current investigation simultaneously examined the specific contextual and cognitive pathways that underlie associations between socioeconomic factors and children’s early academic achievement using data from a prospective longitudinal study conducted at 10 sites across the United States (N = 1,364). Findings revealed that after controlling for a host of potentially confounding influences, parent education, but not family income-to-needs, was linked to children’s math achievement indirectly via sequential paths that included both parenting factors—maternal sensitivity and cognitive stimulation—and children’s working memory skills. Likewise, parent education was predictive of children’s reading achievement indirectly via paths that included cognitive stimulation and working memory. Finally, independent of child executive functions, parent education was also indirectly related to children’s reading achievement via cognitive stimulation and to children’s math achievement via maternal sensitivity. Together, these findings shed light on the specific contextual and cognitive mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic-related differences in children’s early academic skills and provide potential insights for policies and interventions aimed at closing the achievement gap.",

Conceptually, the mechanisms through which it acts\nare thought to involve alterations to reinforcement learning, and several recent\nstudies have supported this in laboratory settings. However, it remains unclear whether \nreinforcement learning mechanisms are involved in a realistic treatment setting.\n\nMethods: In a randomized controlled observational study in the UK NHS\nTalking Therapy service, 152 participants with low mood received reinforcement\nlearning assessments using an affective Go/No-Go task. The assessment timepoints\nwere randomized between subjects, with assessments occurring either before\n(control; n = 78) or during BA therapy (active; n = 74).

We examined nighttime smartphone use through maximum phone-free intervals, sleep-window usage, and hourly patterns. Keyboard presence, detected via deep learning, served as a proxy for active engagement. Bayesian multilevel models revealed that late-night phone use (11PM-1AM) consistently predicted higher next-day passive/active suicidal ideation and planning. Participants with 7-9 hour phone-free gaps showed lowest ideation compared to 4-7 hour gaps, with no linear relationship. Keyboard activity predicted lower suicidal ideation when occurring during middle-night hours (1-5AM), self-reported sleep windows, and non-sleep periods. These timing-dependent, within-person effects suggest that when and how smartphones are used matters more than total usage. Findings enable personalized, real-time interventions that could support adaptive digital coping while flagging high-risk moments for suicide prevention.",

Leveraging a hierarchical-dimensional approach, we examined associations between momentary emotional experience and broadband and narrow internalizing symptoms in a risk-enriched sample of 234 emerging adults followed for 2.5 years. Bayesian models demonstrated that low tonic levels of positive affect (PA) were uniquely associated with worsening Well-being symptoms, a core feature of depression, social anxiety, and trauma disorders. Baseline differences in tonic negative affect were associated with the severity of future anxious-arousal symptoms, but not with longitudinal change. Variation in reactive affect and exposure to everyday positive and negative events were unrelated to symptom trajectories. These observations highlight the centrality of tonic PA to the development of a key transdiagnostic symptom and set the stage for developing more effective intervention strategies.",

Six weeks of three-times daily timeseries data were gathered from a transdiagnostic sample who checked their phone compulsively, binge ate, or engaged in compulsions commonly seen in OCD (e.g. checking, cleaning). Across compulsions, the within-person association between compulsive behaviour and urges was 3x stronger than with obsessive thoughts and 4x stronger than with anxiety. We found evidence for urges Granger-causing compulsions, while compulsions themselves had a markedly low tendency to predict themselves compared to the other mental health symptoms sampled. Finally, like habits, compulsions occurred more often when executive functioning was low. Findings were remarkably similar across compulsions, supporting the notion that transdiagnostically, a habit-like mechanism may underlie compulsivity.",

          "abstract": "Research on individual decision-making often finds a positivity bias, where people weight positive outcomes more strongly than negative ones during learning. This can be beneficial when rewards are rare, by amplifying relative value differences. Yet, we know very little about learning rate biases in social settings, where a key advantage is being able to vicariously learn from the negative experiences of others. This would imply a benefit for focusing on negative outcomes when learning socially, but is at odds with the seemingly inflexible positivity bias found in individual learning. \nHere, we examine learning rate biases across both individual and social settings, testing for adaptivity versus generally stable biases. Overall, participants appear more flexible in their learning rate biases when learning socially than when learning individually. This implies that human social learning may be more flexible and closer to normatively optimal behavior than individual learning.",

          "abstract": "This study provides the first attempt to quantify the frequency, context, and consequences of falls in individuals with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), addressing the overlooked link between balance impairments and fall risk across the lifespan. A cross-sectional online survey, co-developed with a Participant Involvement and Engagement (PIE) group, was completed by adults with DCD (n = 115), parents of children with DCD (n = 99), typically developing (TD) adults (n = 81), and parents of TD children (n = 86). The survey assessed fall and near-fall frequency, causes, injuries, fall-related anxiety, and psychosocial consequences. Adults and children with DCD reported significantly more frequent falls than their TD peers. Among adults with DCD, 26% fell at least 1–2 times per month (vs. 3% TD) and 55% of children fell 1–2 times per week (vs. 23% TD). Near falls were also common, and injuries, including fractures, were disproportionately high. Fall anxiety affected 72% of individuals with DCD and was linked to reduced social engagement and activity avoidance. Falls in DCD are frequent, injurious, and anxiety-provoking. Despite this, DCD is absent from fall prevention guidelines. Urgent action is needed to integrate fall risk screening and targeted interventions into clinical and public health frameworks.",

Among employees with MHI, SOC and job resources were significantly associated with all occupational health outcomes, while job demands primarily predicted burnout. Sickness absence correlated negatively with both burnout and work ability. The association between SOC and work ability was stronger for employees with MHI than for those without.\n\nConclusions\n\nJob resources and SOC play a role for occupational health in employees with MHI.

          "abstract": "In certain problem solving contexts, people organize their domain through treating themselves as the\nperceptual and cognitive center of their world. They identify and solve a particular problem from their\nperspective as a particular agent, with a particular location, at a particular time, in a particular environment. When they do this, selecting and solving problems from their perspective as an agent, they engage in a distinctive kind of agent-centered problem solving. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a framework for modeling decision-making in uncertain environments unfolding over time, have effectively become a \"standard model\" of intelligent agency. Yet, as these models are ordinarily interpreted, they do not explicitly represent agent-centered problem solving. Accordingly, to model this type of problem solving, we begin by extending the standard POMDP framework to define “ePOMDPs.” This formalism models how an agent, once it centers itself on a particular self-and-world representation, plans and acts rationally from its own perspective. To capture the way that such agents choose which problem to solve, we build on our ePOMDPs to develop a “meta-ePOMDP” agent within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We implement our meta-ePOMDP agents for two different suites of “centering game” tasks which highlight different aspects of our theory. We find that our models explain signatures of agent-centered problem solving not captured by alternative models, in particular, the difficulty of navigating spaces of possible problem representations. We close by suggesting that our model could provide the beginnings of a computational framework for a person to have a self.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to adversity may impair executive functioning (i.e., deficit frameworks), but could also enhance, or leave intact, specific EF abilities (i.e., adaptation frameworks). Both frameworks often use raw performance (e.g., speed) to estimate EF ability. However, this approach (1) conflates different cognitive processes, and (2) generally does not distinguish specific EF abilities from processes that are shared across EF tasks, such as general processing speed. Here, we integrate deficit and adaptation frameworks by building bridges with mathematical and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use cognitive modeling (Drift Diffusion Modeling) to isolate different cognitive processes: speed of information accumulation, response caution, and speed of stimulus encoding and response execution. We then use structural equation modeling to investigate whether associations between adversity and cognitive processes are task-general or ability-specific. We recruited 1061 participants from the Dutch LISS panel. Participants completed a basic processing speed task, two inhibition tasks, and three attention-shifting tasks. We measured self-reported exposure to threat and material deprivation in childhood and adulthood. Exposure to threat (but not deprivation) in adulthood was negatively associated with task-general processing speed. After accounting for task-general processes, remaining variance was not related to either inhibition or attention-shifting ability. Non-preregistered analyses showed that childhood exposure to deprivation and threat were negatively associated with (1) general processing speed, and (2) task-specific information accumulation. The latter reflected unique features of individual tasks, rather than specific EF abilities. Taken together, these results suggest that adversity researchers may overestimate associations between adversity and specific EF abilities when analyzing raw performance.",

          "abstract": "Devraj et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02448-2, 2024) presented evidence which they claimed demonstrated that people adapt their categorisation strategies to task demands. When items are distributed uniformly across time as is the standard procedure in categorisation experiments, participants initially classify items based on similarity to category prototypes. Over time, as more detailed exemplar representations of categories are formed, people shift towards utilising exemplar-based classification for increased performance. By contrast, if items are experienced less frequently over time as is commonly observed in real-world conditions, participants instead seem to initially employ an exemplar strategy and then shift towards prototype classification. By re-analysing the same data, we argue instead that this pattern can be produced with exemplar-forgetting in both conditions. By systematically increasing in the delays across which stimuli were tested, their Experimental condition exaggerated the effects of forgetting on performance over time compared to the Control condition. This resulted in a reversal of performance growth over time – instead leading to a steady decline in performance. As exemplar model-fit advantage is expected to vary with performance, we suggest that trends in this advantage are not diagnostic of a shift in classification strategy. We found that not only did a forgetting-function improve exemplar model fit to Devraj et al.’s data, under reasonable parameters this model could predict the observed patterns of both performance and model-fit seen in both conditions a-priori. When compared with a strategy-shifting mixture model, exemplar-forgetting provided equivalent fits despite being both parametrically and theoretically more parsimonious.",

          "abstract": "Visual short-term memory (vSTM) refers to the subset of the cognitive system responsible for storing visual information over short periods of time. While much research has focussed on its capacity limitations, less is known about how vSTM operates in dynamic environments where priorities shift across feature dimensions. In this study, we bridge research on vSTM and cognitive control by embeddeding change detection (Experiments 1 and 2) and delayed estimation (Experiment 3) paradigms within a task switching paradigm, where the relevant feature dimension (colour or orientation) either repeated or switched across trials. Across all experiments we observed a cost to vSTM performance on switch relative to repetition trials. Mixture modelling of delayed estimation responses revealed that these switch costs were not due to reduced memory precision or memory failures, but rather to a selective increase in non-target responses reflecting feature--location binding errors. We propose that dimension switching selectively impairs the binding of feature values to locations and allows interference from irrelevant (but recently attended) feature dimensions. This suggests a core limitation in the dynamic prioritisation of task-relevant feature dimensions, and demonstrates that vSTM is sensitive to failures of attentional control, not just capacity limits.",

          "abstract": "Although digital gaming is a widespread leisure activity among adolescents, current perspectives, largely informed by cross-sectional studies, often portray it as a risk factor for psychosocial problems. Yet little is known about how gaming unfolds in adolescents’ daily lives, including its situational contexts, motivations, and real-time emotional impact. In this study, 211 adolescents (aged 16–19 years; 69% female) completed experience sampling surveys five times daily over 14 days to examine their digital gaming behavior, motivations, and moment-to-moment associations with affective well-being. The data show that more male than female adolescents reported gaming, with on average 7.8 gaming sessions (0.56 per day). Participants reported gaming mostly alone or with known peers, more in the evenings than in the mornings, and primarily for recreational purposes. Within-person analyses revealed that moments following gaming were associated with increased positive affect, with no significant link to negative affect. These findings challenge concerns about gaming’s negative mental health impacts and suggest that, for many adolescents, gaming can serve as a healthy and enjoyable leisure activity that temporarily boosts mood. Future research using larger samples and denser time-series data may better capture how gaming affects adolescents differently across individuals and contexts.",

          "abstract": "The quality of information that informs decisions in expert domains such as law enforcement and national security often requires assessment based on meta-informational attributes such as source reliability and information credibility. Across two experiments with intelligence analysts (n = 74) and non-experts (n = 175), participants rated the accuracy, informativeness, trustworthiness and usefulness of information varying in source reliability and information credibility. The latter two attributes were communicated using ratings from the Admiralty Code, an information evaluation system widely used in the defence and security domain since the 1940s. Ratings of accuracy, informativeness, and likelihood of use were elicited as repeated measures to examine intra-individual reliability. Across experiments, intra-individual reliability was best when levels of source reliability and information credibility were moderately consistent compared to when they were maximally inconsistent (i.e., one low and one high) or maximally consistent (both high or low). As well, trustworthiness ratings depended more on source reliability than on information credibility. Finally, the likelihood of using information was consistently predicted by accuracy ratings and not by judged informativeness or trustworthiness. The current findings offer insights into the ability of experts and novices to reliably use information evaluation systems for structuring human judgments about intelligence.",

We find that infants’ visual experience is dominated by a small set of objects, with differences in individual children’s home environments driving variability. We also find that young children tend to learn words earlier for more frequently encountered categories. These results suggest that visual experience scaffolds young children’s early category and language learning and highlight that ecologically valid computational models of category learning must be able to accommodate skewed input distributions.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

          "abstract": "Foreign donors routinely use nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver aid abroad. However, recent decades have witnessed a global cascade of restrictive anti-NGO legislation. How have foreign aid donors responded and adapted to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we also find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues in favor of regime-compatible causes. Donors also channel more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs; however, this change is by no means a perfect substitute. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for official aid donors, INGOs, and local groups working on contentious causes such as elections, human rights, media, corruption, and advocacy.",

Limited resources may force them to prioritize one family member over another, particularly when new care needs emerge. \nMethod: This study used eight waves (2004–2022) of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, covering 19 countries. The sample included individuals aged 50+ who had participated in at least two study waves and had a grandchild under age 13 (56,383 observations from 18,754 respondents). Asymmetric fixed-effects regression was employed to examine whether starting or stopping spousal care was associated with changes in grandchild care frequency.\nResults: Starting intensive spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care frequency, similarly for grandfathers and grandmothers. The results also indicated a negative effect of stopping spousal care on childcare, particularly among grandfathers, although this finding was not statistically significant. Further inspection revealed that stopping spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care only among grandfathers who no longer resided with their partner (e.g., due to institutionalization or death).\nConclusion: Engagement in intensive spousal care predicts grandparental childcare, showing that intensifying resource competition impacts the distribution of care within families.",

Marriage is still perceived as normative in Germany and enshrined in institutions, yet marriage rates have been declining in the last decades. I investigate whether attitudes towards gender roles held jointly by couples and their change might explain this discrepancy.  I examine a sample of 1297 German couples followed yearly from the beginning of their partnership onwards from 2008 to 2019, with information on both partners, selected from a representative probability sample. I use a series of Competing Risk survival models, comparing couples from West Germany with couples from East Germany. Sharing attitudes towards gender roles at the beginning of the relationship is positively related to marriage likelihoods in the West but not in the East. Convergence to a shared attitude for couples who start with diverging attitudes is also correlated with higher marriage risks, with differences between West German and East German couples. Correlation between attitudinal convergence and marriage probabilities highlights the need for couple-focused research when investigating partnership patterns. Differences in the correlations between West- and East German couples indicate possible effects of the predominant idea of marriage on the relationship between couple’s gender attitudes and their relationship outcomes.",

          "authors": "Philip N. Cohen",
          "abstract": "Scholarly publishing takes place in an institutional arena that is opaque to its practitioners. As readers, writers, reviewers, and editors, we have no clear view of the system within which we’re working. Researchers starting their careers receive (if they’re lucky) folk wisdom and mythology handed down from advisor to advisee, geared more toward individual success (or survival) than toward attaining a systemic perspective. They may learn how to get their work into the right journals or books, but often don’t learn why that is the outcome that matters for their careers, how the field arrived at that decision, and what the alternatives are – or should be. Gaining a wider perspective is important both for shaping individual careers and for confronting the systematic problems we face as a community of knowledge creators and purveyors. This primer starts from the premise that sociologists, especially those early in their careers, need to learn about the system of scholarly communication. And that sociology can help us toward that goal. Understanding the political economy of the system within which publication takes place is necessary for us to fulfill our roles as citizens of the research community, as people who play an active role in shaping the future of that system, consciously or not. Responsible citizenship requires learning about the institutional actors in the system and how they are governed, as well as who pays and who profits within the field, and who wins or loses.",

          "abstract": "Recent experimental evidence suggests that meritocratic ideals are mainly a Western phenomenon. Intriguingly, the Chinese public does not appear to differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, despite China’s historical emphasis on meritocratic institutions. We propose that this phenomenon could be due to the Chinese public’s greater reluctance to make an active choice in real-stake redistribution decisions. We run an incentivized redistribution experiment with elite university students in China and France where we vary the initial split of payoffs between two real-life workers to redistribute from. We show that Chinese respondents consistently and significantly choose more non-redistribution across different status quo scenarios. Additionally, if we exclude the individuals who engage in non-redistribution choices, Chinese respondents do differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, and do not redistribute less than the French. Chinese respondents are as reactive as the French towards scenarios with noisy signals of merit, such as inequalities of opportunities. We argue that the reluctance to make an active choice signals diminished political agency to act upon redistribution decisions with real-life stakes, rather than apathy, inattention, having benefited from the status quo in Chinese society, or libertarian preferences among the Chinese. Notably, our findings show that the reluctance to make a choice is particularly pronounced among respondents of working-class or farming backgrounds, while it is absent among individuals whose families have closer ties to the private sector.

These themes address existential needs, foster belonging, facilitate emotional release and regulation, and promote personal growth – ultimately enhancing connection, mastery, and self-regulation in individuals with major depressive disorder outpatients. The study uniquely highlights the therapeutic roles of sensory stimuli and exhaustion/catharsis, while confirming the importance of social interaction and autonomy.

          "abstract": "Resilience has become a prominent concept in EU social and economic policy, positioned as a response to megatrends such as technological change, labour market deregulation and demographic shifts. This article critically examines how resilience is conceptualised in EU policy, arguing that it insufficiently accounts for structural inequalities in individuals’ capacities to adapt to risks. Building on cumulative inequality theory and the prevalences and penalties framework, we propose an “inequalities in resilience” framework that distinguishes between the need for resilience—measured by exposure to labour market risks—and the capacity for resilience—measured by the ability to avoid poverty when risks materialise. Using EI-SILC data for 30 countries, 2010–2020, encompassing 3,103,097 individuals, we find that groups with greater need for resilience, particularly those with lower educational attainment and single-parent households, show lower capacity for resilience. This pattern shows a high degree of consistency across different risks and poverty indicators, and national contexts. We conclude that resilience-focused policy must integrate prevention and resource-based interventions while recognising the compounded, path-dependent, and status-based nature of inequality. Addressing these layered disadvantages requires coordinated, inclusive policy designs that go beyond individual adaptation to tackle the structural roots of disadvantage.",

          "authors": "Maijunxian Wang",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of systemic forgiveness—a structural tendency to absolve systems, institutions, and algorithms from responsibility while punishing individuals. Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks from political theory, sociology, and science and technology studies, the paper identifies three key mechanisms that enable this moral asymmetry: the complexity shield, attribution bias, and de-agentified narratives. Through case studies in finance, healthcare, algorithmic governance, and infrastructure, it demonstrates how systemic actors evade accountability via abstraction, opacity, and narrative displacement, while frontline workers become scapegoats. The genealogy of this phenomenon is traced from bureaucratic hierarchies to algorithmic impunity, revealing how moral responsibility has been reframed as technical failure. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for symmetrical accountability—introducing legal personhood for systems, auditable responsibility chains, reparative indexing, and epistemologically accountable design. Ultimately, it argues that systemic forgiveness is not an ethical oversight but a political logic that must be challenged in pursuit of structural justice.",

          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage-point higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed theirs in early 2023. We assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension claiming using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. Those who had the opportunity to benefit from the extraordinary index adjustment were approximately 8 percentage points more likely to claim the partial old-age pension in the first month of eligibility, with a relative effect as high as 79%. The effect arises because individuals advance their pension claims in response to the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

This homogenization offers new possibilities for targeted institutional and pedagogical interventions — but also raises urgent questions about how universities will adapt to the next wave of systemic change, including AI-driven educational technologies and sustainability-driven curricular transformation.\nThe study contributes to the methodological foundations of research on multidisciplinary education and provides a framework for future collaborative reflection and innovation.",

As these treasures become more closely guarded today, the field needs to think of new strategies to continue to enable researchers who want to engage in computational communication research. One of these strategies is to make text data sharing a more common practice in the field -- which would also greatly enhance reproducibility of research. In this article, we outline three avenues to share as much of your data as possible, while still honouring ethical and legal restrictions. Given the relative lack of infrastructure for some of these avenues, we also highlight the capacities of the Amsterdam Content Analysis Toolkit (AmCAT) to enable non standard sharing strategies. We especially highlight the functions for *non-consumptive research* -- which means analyses methods that can be performed without access to the full data set.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the political polarization of public trust in science across Europe, focusing on the roles of motivated reasoning and political partisanship. We distinguish between impact science, which often entails regulatory constraints on industrial activity, and production science, which supports technological and economic development. While prior research has largely centered on the U.S., European data reveal similar ideological patterns: left-leaning individuals exhibit greater trust in science overall, and particularly in impact science, while right-leaning individuals show greater trust in production science. These findings suggest that the politicization of science is domain-specific. We find evidence for both motivated reasoning and partisanship as drivers of science polarization. Education amplifies ideological differences in trust toward impact science, consistent with motivated reasoning, while closeness to a particular political party amplifies ideological differences in trust toward science in general and impact science, highlighting the role of partisanship. Exploratory path analysis indicates that partisanship exerts a greater influence than education. Our findings underscore that polarization is most pronounced in scientific disciplines and claims that challenge industrial interests and align with social welfare goals, and that partisanship plays a central role in shaping public trust in this scientific domain.",

First we show that Great Power battles tend to occur in shortest-distance corridors between belligerent powers’ capitals, except where those corridors are intercepted by seas, mountains, and marshes. Then we show that capitals locate closer to each other when they have more of these types of geography between them. Finally, we show that city pairs are less likely to belong to the same state if they have more of this geography between them, allowing us to use geography to predict the territorial size and shape of Europe’s Great Powers. In sum, our results suggest that terrain which slows down military incursions makes capitals safer, allowing them to locate closer to each other; given all capitals’ locations, the surrounding geography then shapes the associated state territories.",

          "abstract": "Elections are a primary mechanism through which citizens can hold politicians accountable for misconduct. However, whether voters actually punish corruption at the ballot box remains an open question, as electoral decisions often involve strategic considerations, including beliefs about how others think and behave. To better understand how such strategic considerations operate in this context, we conducted a pre-registered information intervention during a major political corruption scandal in Japan. The treatment provided information about the prevailing social norm—specifically, the perceived social intolerance of the scandal. The treatment increased turnout and support for a challenger, particularly among swing voters who initially believed that others were intolerant of corruption. Among party loyalists with more lenient prior beliefs, the same information backfired, increasing support for the incumbent. The turnout effect among swing voters was sizable—approximately six percentage points—comparable in magnitude to benchmark mobilization interventions involving personalized contact or social pressure. To account for these patterns, we develop a simple model that incorporates mechanisms—notably *moral reinforcement* and *identity reinforcement*—that generate predictions consistent with the observed heterogeneity in responses. By highlighting how perceptions of prevailing norms shape voter behavior in the presence of strategic considerations, this study contributes to a broader understanding of how democratic institutions can remain resilient in the face of political misconduct.",

We examine its multilingual social media network and activities over a decade (2013-2022) using computational and digital methods. The findings indicate that CitizenGO uses a sophisticated network of social media accounts to coordinate and amplify anti-gender messages across different languages and regions.

          "title": "The MAGA Movement and Political Violence in 2024:  Findings from a Nationally Representative Survey",
          "authors": "Garen J. Wintemute; Bradley Velasquez; Sonia Robinson; Elizabeth A. Tomsich; Mona Wright; Aaron Shev",
          "abstract": "Background: The possibility of widespread political violence poses a serious concern for the United States. A nationally representative survey found in 2022 that “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) Republicans, as defined, were more supportive than others of political violence. This study updates and expands those findings; the principal comparison is between MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA non-Republicans. \nMethods: Findings are from Wave 3 of a nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, conducted May 23-June 14, 2024. All respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel were invited to participate. Political party and MAGA affiliations were reported by respondents. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions and adjusted prevalence differences (aPDs; these are percentage point (pp) differences), with p-values adjusted for the false discovery rate and reported as q-values. \nResults: The completion rate was 88.4%; there were 8896 respondents. After weighting, half the sample was female (50.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%); the weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. MAGA Republicans were substantially more likely than non-MAGA non-Republicans to endorse violence to effect sociopolitical change generally and to consider violence usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 21 specific political objectives (MAGA Republicans, 55.9% (95% CI 52.3%, 59.4%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 25.5% (95% CI 23.7%, 27.2%); aPD 30.1pp (95% CI 26.0pp, 34.2pp), q &lt; 0.001). They were not more willing to commit political violence. Similarly, while MAGA Republicans more frequently predicted that they would be armed in a future setting where they considered political violence to be justified (very or extremely likely: MAGA Republicans, 19.8% (95% CI 17.0%, 22.6%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 5.5% (95% CI 4.6%, 6.4%); aPD 16.4pp (95% CI 13.3pp, 19.5pp), q &lt; 0.001), they were not more likely to shoot someone (very or extremely likely: MAGA Republicans, 2.1% (95% CI 0.8%, 3.4%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 1.6% (95% CI 1.0%, 2.1%); aPD 1.5pp (95% CI -0.1pp, 3.0pp), q = 0.43). Prevalences for other Republicans generally fell between those for MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA non-Republicans. On some political violence measures, prevalences were highest among a small, demographically distinct group of non-Republican MAGA supporters. In secondary analyses, MAGA Republicans endorsed statements of beliefs associated with political violence—racism, hostile sexism, homonegativity, transphobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia; support for the QAnon movement and Christian nationalism; conspiracism; trait aggression; and authoritarianism—more frequently than did non-MAGA non-Republicans.\nConclusions: In 2024, MAGA Republicans were more likely than others to endorse political violence and beliefs associated with an increased risk of committing violence. They were not more willing to commit political violence themselves, but their endorsement may increase the risk that political violence will occur.",

          "authors": "Tyler Jeremiah Lane",
          "abstract": "Background:\nThere is considerable debate about whether the unprecedented rise in violence experienced across the United States in 2020 was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police. This study aimed to add clarity by analysing violent crime data in Minneapolis.\nMethods:\nInterrupted time series on daily occurrences/counts of homicide, aggravated assault, domestic assault, sex offenses, detected gunfire, and 911 calls from 2019-2021 in Minneapolis. Models included logistic and quasi-Poisson regressions, adjusting for weekend, holidays, and maximum daily temperature. \nResults: \nReported violent events did not increase during the pandemic, while incidence of sex offenses decreased 18% (95%CI: 0.71-0.93) and 911 calls by 3% (95%CI: 0.96-0.98). After Floyd’s murder, homicide increased 137% (95%CI: 1.10-5.11), aggravated assaults by 43% (95%CI: 1.23-1.66), sex offenses by 35% (95%CI: 1.05-1.74), and gunfire by 108% (95%CI: 1.81-2.40), while 911 calls decreased 5% (95%CI: 0.92-0.97).\nConclusions: \nFloyd’s murder better explains the 2020 rise in violence. The immediate rise in gunfire after Floyd’s murder suggests a change in the willingness to use firearms already in possession rather than a sudden influx of them, while the drop in 911 calls aligns with the theory that the causative mechanism was community members disengaging from police to address crime and resolved disputes.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a factor constant over maturity to capture the transaction cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use the models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics represent the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets.",

We show that in search models of the labor market with income effects, this impact is theoretically ambiguous: Employment and job durations might increase or decrease, match surplus might be shifted to workers or employers, and worker surplus might be reallocated between wages and job amenities.\nWe thus turn to empirical evidence to study this impact. We conducted a pre-registered RCT in Germany, starting 2021, where recipients received 1200 Euro/month for three years. We draw on both administrative and survey data, and find no extensive margin (employment) response, and no impact on job transitions from either non-employment or employment. We do find a small statistically insignificant intensive margin shift to part-time employment, which implies an excess burden (reduction of government revenues) of ca 7.5% of the transfer. We furthermore observe a small increase of enrollment in training or education. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "Attendance at religious services is a consistent predictor of positive mental health outcomes, though our findings suggest this may not hold for all racial-ethnic groups. Using data from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (N = 57,754), this study examines how the relationship between religious attendance and self-rated mental health varies across racial-ethnic groups in the United States, with a focus on Asian Americans. Findings reveal that religious attendance is significantly associated with better mental health for White, Black, and Hispanic Americans, but not for Asian Americans. The positive association is strongest for Blacks, followed by Whites and Hispanics, while Asians show no significant relationship. We suggest that the dual-minority status of religious Asian Americans (as religious minorities within their co-ethnic group, and ethnic minorities in their religious group) could potentially underlie this null association. Findings highlight the importance of considering racial-ethnic differences when studying the mental health benefits of religious participation.",

          "abstract": "While many studies of public opinion in authoritarian regimes rely on list experiments to overcome sensitivity bias, we show in this paper that a different technique, the crosswise variant of the randomized response design, has superior performance at measuring latent opposition to authoritarian regimes with fewer assumptions. To show the power of this design, we randomly assigned a panel of 924 Tunisian survey respondents to receive either a direct question about support for Tunisian President Kais Saied or a randomized response question. Our results reveal that between 10% to 30% of Tunisians oppose the president but would not report this opposition on a direct question. We further employed a Bayesian parameterization of the randomized response design to decompose the sensitivity bias and model latent opposition and bias as a function of survey covariates. We find that ideological and policy disagreement with the president strongly predicts latent opposition, but that these same measures are negatively related to sensitivity bias. As a result, we show that respondents who are ideologically closer to the president--that is, the moderate opposition--tend to be more afraid of reporting their resistance to the regime than the more radical opposition.",

          "abstract": "Wealth inequality results from stratified access to accumulation opportunities, relating to differences in income, financial behavior, and transfers. Yet, it remains unclear whether these wealth accumulation channels differ in their perceived relevance for women and men along the wealth distribution. A deeper understanding of such perceptions is crucial for explaining attitudes toward inequality, shaping policy legitimacy, and uncovering the narratives that sustain or challenge the economic status quo. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP; waves 2017 and 2019), we compare the self-assessed relevance of eight different accumulation channels. Regression models (N=23,857) reveal that dependent employment is widely perceived as relevant for wealth accumulation across the wealth distribution, particularly for men. Individuals in higher wealth quartiles attribute a greater relevance to a broader range of accumulation channels. Women perceive marriage as more important for accumulating wealth, regardless of how wealthy they are. Women in the top wealth quartile perceive financial transfers as contributing more to their wealth than men do. These findings suggest that women ascribe a higher relevance to relational and dependent channels, while men emphasize the relevance of self-generated wealth. This reflects persistent gender-segregated economic structures that continue to reinforce the gender wealth gap.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article undertakes a comparative exploration of Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory and Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory (ANT) in the context of poverty research. Drawing on various empirical studies derived from a larger qualitative project—based on 216 in-depth interviews with long-term poor households—it examines how each framework accounts for capital conversion, constrained agency, and the reproduction of structural exclusion. Although both theorists promote relational and anti-essentialist perspectives, they differ markedly in ontological orientation and analytic focus. Bourdieu highlights the structuring effects of fields, habitus, and symbolic violence, while Latour centres on translation, mediation, and the generative power of heterogeneous networks. Through four thematic case studies—debt, welfare bureaucracy, neighbourhood stigma, and the informal economy—the analysis demonstrates that each framework reveals distinct yet complementary dimensions of poverty. Whereas Bourdieu offers powerful tools to explain the institutional reproduction of inequality, Latour draws attention to the situated agency of actors navigating complex material and social assemblages. The article argues for a relational synthesis that acknowledges both enduring field structures and contingent actor-networks. It concludes that poverty persists not through structure or contingency alone, but through the recursive entanglement of both.",

          "authors": "Lucy Císař Brown",
          "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to theoretically reassess Weber’s concept of ‘disenchantment through rationalisation’, as primarily laid out in Science as a Vocation (1917) and The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1946), to propose that recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are repositioning humans into a state of ‘technological re-enchantment’. This process of re-enchantment acknowledges both the fundamentally dialectical nature of Weber's disenchantment and recognises that contemporary AI development has created systems whose operational logic exceeds human comprehension while remaining indispensable for achieving complex objectives. This paper therefore makes two theoretical contributions: first, it demonstrates that Weber's concept of rationalisation contains structural possibilities for re-enchantment that emerge through, rather than despite, formal rational processes; second, it argues that artificial intelligence represents the first empirical instantiation of this theoretical possibility, requiring us to reconceptualise the relationship between rationalisation and epistemic authority. 'Technological re-enchantment' here refers not to the return of pre-modern consciousness but to the emergence of structural epistemic dependence that operates through rational processes. Unlike traditional forms of authority based on tradition, charisma, or bureaucratic position, AI-mediated authority rests on demonstrated performance in contexts where explanatory understanding is structurally impossible. The concept will therefore be explored through three stages: first, examining the dialectical structure of Weber's disenchantment theory; second, analysing how AI's architecture creates unprecedented epistemic dependence; and finally, demonstrating how this represents re-enchantment through, rather than despite, rational processes.",

          "abstract": "This study examines gender differences in financial stress and anxiety among U.S. college students and evaluates whether financial stress predicts anxiety, and whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study, a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States, were analyzed. Survey-weighted regression models were used to assess gender differences and the association between financial stress and anxiety. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) tested whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Financial stress was modeled as a continuous predictor, anxiety as a continuous mediator, and academic disruption as an ordinal outcome. Female students reported significantly higher levels of financial stress and anxiety than male students, even after adjusting for age and race. Financial stress was positively associated with anxiety for both male and female students. This indicates a broad impact of financial pressure on emotional well-being.  Anxiety subsequently predicted academic disruption. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety significantly mediated the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption, and this explained more than half of the total effect. These findings highlight anxiety as a key psychological pathway through which financial stress affects academic functioning. Interventions targeting financial stress may improve both emotional well-being and academic performance, particularly for students facing elevated financial and psychological vulnerability.",

Focused primarily on capital and labor, it systematically overlooks the role of natural resources and the environment—an omission that has made it the target of recurring criticism. To examine the validity of these critiques, this article proposes a parallel with Kleiber’s law in biology, which links an organism’s energy consumption to its body mass through the notion of basal metabolic rate.\n\nWe demonstrate that this analogy opens the way for a reinterpretation of both the Cobb–Douglas function and the Solow model, enabling a perspective that is not only compatible with but also complementary to ecological economics. Moreover, it reveals a deeper homology: in both cases, the functions describe the behavior of dissipative thermodynamic systems, which organize energy flows to sustain their structural integrity. This framework allows for a physical reading of economic production mechanisms—not as abstract aggregates, but as expressions of a universal process of self-organization driven by flows of matter and energy. It enables the integration of thermodynamic constraints into the core of economic theory, in continuity with existing literature, while paving the way for an understanding of the economy as a physically evolving system",

Using RTD as both method and critique, we treat intellectual property (IP) law and commodification not as neutral structures but as epistemic simulations—design artifacts that encode power, erase referents, and reify hallucination as value.\nDrawing on Baudrillard’s theory of simulation, Monett and Paquet’s critique of automated epistemologies, and emerging jurisprudence around AI authorship, we introduce the concept of juridical referentiality to describe how law increasingly mirrors the ungrounded patterns of generative systems. The law, like AI, now performs alignment—simulating authorship, creativity, and consent through recursive abstraction.\nThrough a reflexive RTD lens, we interrogate these patterns and propose alternatives grounded in epistemic pluralism, regenerative authorship, and friction-led design. The paper culminates in a hybrid framework—bridging design and legal governance—that resists epistemic enclosure and restores referential integrity in a world governed by simulation.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the political polarization of public trust in science across Europe, focusing on the roles of motivated reasoning and political partisanship. We distinguish between impact science, which often entails regulatory constraints on industrial activity, and production science, which supports technological and economic development. While prior research has largely centered on the U.S., European data reveal similar ideological patterns: left-leaning individuals exhibit greater trust in science overall, and particularly in impact science, while right-leaning individuals show greater trust in production science. These findings suggest that the politicization of science is domain-specific. We find evidence for both motivated reasoning and partisanship as drivers of science polarization. Education amplifies ideological differences in trust toward impact science, consistent with motivated reasoning, while closeness to a particular political party amplifies ideological differences in trust toward science in general and impact science, highlighting the role of partisanship. Exploratory path analysis indicates that partisanship exerts a greater influence than education. Our findings underscore that polarization is most pronounced in scientific disciplines and claims that challenge industrial interests and align with social welfare goals, and that partisanship plays a central role in shaping public trust in this scientific domain.",

          "authors": "Daniel Run Han Ho",
          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

          "authors": "Elizaveta Gaufman; Martijn Schoonvelde; REGROUP project",
          "abstract": "Disinformation has become an increasing concern for European policymakers and the broader public, raising pressing questions about safeguarding political discourse and institutional trust in an evolving digital landscape. This focus paper begins by mapping the current landscape of disinformation policies within the European Union, including public and private regulatory approaches. While significant efforts have been made— particularly in targeting foreign information manipulation—we argue that existing policy frameworks overlook important aspects of how disinformation works. Above all, there is a lack of attention to the issue of credibility: how individuals determine whether information is trustworthy and what role identity cues play in their assessments.\n\nTo address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment to understand how young people evaluate the credibility of online content. The experiment involved 152 university students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Respondents were sorted into different groups based on their self-identified gender and country of origin at the beginning of the survey. They were then asked to assess the credibility of a series of social media posts covering a range of topics. Finally, respondents were invited to reflect in writing on the reasons behind their evaluations, allowing us to compare quantitative trust ratings with qualitative reasoning.\n\nOur findings confirm that content quality remains the strongest predictor of perceived credibility. However, they also reveal that subtle identity cues—such as a shared gender or national background between the respondent and the post’s author—exert a small but consistent influence on trust evaluations. These effects often occur below the level of conscious awareness, suggesting that social proximity and identity alignment can shape how people perceive truth, even when they believe they are evaluating content objectively. Notably, the results also challenge some common assumptions: posts from authors with Anglo-American names, often associated with epistemic authority, were not rated as more credible, and male-presenting sources were not favored over female-presenting ones.\n\nTaken together, our findings underline that perceived credibility of information is not a fixed quality but shaped by content, identity, and situational cues. Disinformation policies may therefore fall short if they do not account for these more subjective dynamics of trust.",

          "abstract": "While many studies of public opinion in authoritarian regimes rely on list experiments to overcome sensitivity bias, we show in this paper that a different technique, the crosswise variant of the randomized response design, has superior performance at measuring latent opposition to authoritarian regimes with fewer assumptions. To show the power of this design, we randomly assigned a panel of 924 Tunisian survey respondents to receive either a direct question about support for Tunisian President Kais Saied or a randomized response question. Our results reveal that between 10% to 30% of Tunisians oppose the president but would not report this opposition on a direct question. We further employed a Bayesian parameterization of the randomized response design to decompose the sensitivity bias and model latent opposition and bias as a function of survey covariates. We find that ideological and policy disagreement with the president strongly predicts latent opposition, but that these same measures are negatively related to sensitivity bias. As a result, we show that respondents who are ideologically closer to the president--that is, the moderate opposition--tend to be more afraid of reporting their resistance to the regime than the more radical opposition.",

          "abstract": "Resilience has become a prominent concept in EU social and economic policy, positioned as a response to megatrends such as technological change, labour market deregulation and demographic shifts. This article critically examines how resilience is conceptualised in EU policy, arguing that it insufficiently accounts for structural inequalities in individuals’ capacities to adapt to risks. Building on cumulative inequality theory and the prevalences and penalties framework, we propose an “inequalities in resilience” framework that distinguishes between the need for resilience—measured by exposure to labour market risks—and the capacity for resilience—measured by the ability to avoid poverty when risks materialise. Using EI-SILC data for 30 countries, 2010–2020, encompassing 3,103,097 individuals, we find that groups with greater need for resilience, particularly those with lower educational attainment and single-parent households, show lower capacity for resilience. This pattern shows a high degree of consistency across different risks and poverty indicators, and national contexts. We conclude that resilience-focused policy must integrate prevention and resource-based interventions while recognising the compounded, path-dependent, and status-based nature of inequality. Addressing these layered disadvantages requires coordinated, inclusive policy designs that go beyond individual adaptation to tackle the structural roots of disadvantage.",

          "authors": "Sourish Dutta",
          "abstract": "This paper outlines the construction of high-resolution, 7-digit product-level Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian economy, leveraging microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the period 2016-2022. We delineate a robust methodology encompassing the generation of detailed input and output flows, with a particular focus on the reconciliation of data from registered and unregistered manufacturing sectors through a meticulously developed NPCMS-NIC concordance. The critical transformation from the often-rectangular SUTs to square, symmetric product-by-product IOTs is explicated using the Industry Technology Assumption, a choice justified by its suitability for handling by-products prevalent in a diverse manufacturing landscape. The analytical prowess of this newly constructed high-resolution IOT framework is then demonstrated through its application to assess key economic impacts, specifically the Domestic Value Added (DVA) generated and the employment supported by production and export activities. A detailed case study of India’s rapidly evolving mobile phone manufacturing sector (NPCMS 4722200) for the 2016-2022 period reveals profound structural shifts: significant output growth coupled with notable import substitution, a remarkable surge in exports, and a dynamic evolution in the DVA versus Foreign Value Added (FVA) shares, particularly in export-oriented production. The analysis further uncovers substantial employment growth, albeit with an increasing reliance on contractual labour and a heartening rise in female participation in the workforce. These meticulously constructed tables represent a significant methodological advancement and provide an invaluable empirical resource for nuanced analysis of sectoral interdependencies, the efficacy of industrial policy, and the complex dynamics of India’s engagement with global value chains.",

          "abstract": "We examine how people living in poverty attempt to escape indebtedness by converting various forms of capital in a Bourdieusian sense. Guided by Pierre Bourdieu’s framework, we treat debt as a form of negative economic capital and analyse qualitative interview data on individuals’ struggles with debt. Our research question is: Which capital conversion strategies do low-income individuals employ to manage or escape debt, and what symbolic or emotional barriers do they encounter? We draw on 216 in-depth interviews with residents in long-term poverty. Using a relational, field-based analytic frame, we identify four main conversion patterns: (1) social capital → economic capital (borrowing from kin or friends), (2) cultural capital → economic capital (using bureaucratic knowledge or skills to gain benefits), (3) economic capital → economic capital (using savings or assets to pay debts), and (4) social/cultural capital → institutional capital → economic capital (leveraging networks or knowledge to access formal debt relief). We find these strategies are often temporary and fraught with obstacles. Shame and stigma function as forms of symbolic violence that can block people from mobilising help, while bureaucratic complexity and resource scarcity limit the effectiveness of their efforts. Our findings deepen the understanding of how negative capital (debt) constrains agency under structural poverty and show that converting social or cultural capital into economic relief is rarely straightforward. This study contributes to Bourdieusian poverty scholarship by highlighting hysteresis effects and inter-field struggles that perpetuate indebtedness, and it suggests that anti-poverty interventions must recognise these complex conversion barriers.",

          "authors": "Jacob Edenhofer; Christian Flachsland",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Climate Politics Framework (CPF), a novel and comprehensive approach to analyzing climate policymaking. The CPF sets out four fundamental problems—pervasive collective action challenges, distributional dynamics, long-term policy, and deep uncertainty—that shape both elite and mass-level climate politics. These, in turn, influence the stringency and design of climate policy platforms, which consist of institutions, policy instruments as well as framing and rhetoric. These platforms can both cause emissions reductions—the main dependent variable of interest—and address strategic challenges in the climate policy process (e.g. agenda-setting, coordination, compensation, and commitment), thereby altering political dynamics over time. Applying the CPF to Germany, based on elite interviews and a literature review, we analyze key episodes and structural features of German climate policy over the past four decades. The CPF offers both an academic contribution—by synthesizing disparate strands of the climate politics literature—and, with a view to future applications, a practical tool for policymakers and stakeholders to diagnose political barriers and identify pathways for effective climate policymaking.",

          "abstract": "How do consumers react when their favorite product is removed? This paper sheds light on this question by studying consumer purchase behavior at vending machines located at Tokyo train stations, where most vending machines experienced some product changes during our sample period.\nBy applying synthetic difference-in-differences, we find evidence of consumers conducting both within- and between-vending machine substitutions. In particular, we observe an expansion of demand in their non-favorite machines, where the increase comes from not only their favorite product, but also other products. Most interestingly, we find evidence that consumers buy more products that are new to them and switch more often; such behavior is consistent with experimentation and learning. This suggests that, to some extent, consumers' persistent choice of the same product may be an outcome of habitual behavior, and the removal of their ``favorite'' product may break their habit and trigger them to experiment with new products. We also find that high variety-seeking consumers are more likely to choose a substitute at their favorite vending machine, whereas low variety-seeking consumers tend to seek their favorite product at another vending machine.  However, consumers' experimentation and learning behavior does not vary with variety-seeking tendency.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nAnalyses of population administrative data can often only be minimally adjusted due to a lack of control variables, potentially leading to bias due to residual confounding.\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to use linked cohort data to help address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data. One particular aim was to explore strategies for when linked cohort and population administrative data cannot be accessed together in the same environment (are “siloed”).  \n\nMethods\nWe propose a multiple imputation-based approach, introduced through application to simulated data in three different scenarios related to the structure of the datasets. We then apply this approach to a real-world example – examining the association between pupil mobility (changing schools at non-standard times) and Key Stage 2 (age 11) attainment using data from the UK National Pupil Database (NPD). The limited control variables available in the NPD are supplemented by multiple measures of socioeconomic deprivation captured in linked Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) data.\n\nResults\nIn our real-world example, we included 509,670 individuals in the population NPD data, of whom 7,768 (1.5%) were MCS cohort members. The unadjusted estimate of -1.86 (95% CI -1.92, -1.81) for the association between pupil mobility and Key Stage 2 attainment was attenuated to -0.92 (95% CI -0.97, -0.88) through adjustment for the NPD control variables, and further attenuated to -0.76 (95% CI -0.86, -0.67) through adjustment for the MCS control variables. \n\nConclusions\nLinked cohort data can be used to address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data, and our proposed approach performed well across a range of simulated and real-world scenarios. The underlying principles are widely applicable: any analysis of administrative data could potentially be strengthened by linking a subset of individuals into richer cohort data. More research is required to understand how these methods can be applied more broadly.",

          "abstract": "It has long been recognised that there are issues with the appropriateness of citations in the academic literature. Citations of sources that do not support the statement they are cited against are known as quotation errors, and there have been many previous studies of their prevalence. The vast majority of these studies rely on researchers evaluating the accuracy of citations in a small sample of the literature, and show large variation in quotation error rates. In this article we report a novel approach to assessing quotation accuracy via an online survey in which 2,648 corresponding authors of articles evaluated a real-world citation of their work. Respondents were also asked to categorise the perceived purpose of the citation, and what action, if any, they take when encountering inaccurate citations of their work. We found a quotation error rate of 16.6%, with no significant difference across academic disciplines, suggesting that variation in previous studies may be a result of methodological differences. Only 11.3% of respondents indicated they had taken action after encountering an inaccurate citation of their work. This work reveals reasons contributing to inaccurate quotations and issues with citation practices, and offers suggestions of areas for future research.",

It also offers an estimate of how relevant published journal articles and books from five humanities fields are to society. By modeling two evaluation tasks involving many raters and documents, we estimate how various reviewer characteristics (such as their chauvinism and strictness) and document characteristics (such as their field and content) affect societal relevance ratings. We then compare the influence of both reviewer and document characteristics on these ratings and provide an estimate of the societal relevance of humanities research where the factors contributing to peer review unreliability are filtered out. Our results suggest that, even according to humanities scholars themselves, a substantial portion of published humanities research is not relevant to society at large. Furthermore, our results also suggest that when using peer review to decide whether a particular piece of research is societally relevant, the selection of reviewers plays a more significant role than the content of the research.",

Where Foucault illuminates how institutions fabricate docile, productive bodies, Benjamin reveals how commodities enchant the collective imagination through aesthetic and libidinal appeal. Under digital capitalism, these mechanisms converge in algorithmic architectures that govern through both behavioral optimization and curated desire. Platforms like Uber or TikTok exemplify this hybrid regime, where gamified labor and algorithmic phantasmagoria collapse the factory and the arcade into a single dispositif.

The investigation was motivated by the need to bridge the empirical gap surrounding the impact of    entrepreneurial    marketing    practices—specifically    product    innovation—on    SME performance in semi-urban and rural areas, where research has been limited. Anchored on Schumpeter’s  Theory  of  Innovation,  the  study  adopted  a  cross-sectional   design   and positivist  research  philosophy,  utilizing  a  sample  of  364  registered  SMEs  selected  through simple  random  sampling  from  Kisii,  Migori,  and  Nyamira  counties.  Primary  data  were collected  using  structured  questionnaires  and  analyzed  using  descriptive  and  inferential statistics  through  SPSS  version  29.  Regression  analysis  indicated  a  moderate  positive relationship between product innovation and financial performance (R = 0.65; R² = 0.423), suggesting  that  42.3%  of  the  variation  in  financial  outcomes  among  SMEs  could  be attributed to product innovation. The results revealed that SMEs engaging in new product development,  improving  existing  products,  and  diversifying  product  lines  experienced enhanced profitability, increased sales turnover, and expanded market share. However, the study  also  identified  key  barriers  to  innovation,  including  limited  access  to  technology (38%),  legal  constraints  (22%),  low  market  demand  (21%),  cultural  barriers  (10%),  and weak  intellectual  property  rights  (9%).  Despite  some  respondents  expressing  skepticism regarding   the   necessity   of   product   innovation,   the   majority   affirmed   its   significant contribution  to  business  performance.  The  study  concluded  that  product  innovation  is  a critical determinant of SME financial success and sustainability in Nyanza. It recommended that  SME  owners  prioritize  innovation  by  fostering  a  culture  of  creativity  and  investing  in research  and  development.  Additionally,  policy-makers  and  financial  institutions  were urged  to  establish  supportive  environments  through  innovation  incentives,  credit  access, and  enhanced  intellectual  property  frameworks.  The  study  suggested  further  research employing  longitudinal  designs  and  incorporating  other  marketing  dimensions  such  as pricing and promotion to gain a holistic understanding of SME growth drivers.",

          "authors": "Nikolaos Nikolakakis",
          "abstract": "This article reexamines the normative dimension of Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism, arguing that value theory, reification, and the logic of capital carry intrinsic ethical implications. Against interpretations that distance Marxism from questions of justice or morality, it draws on the method of immanent critique to show how concepts such as freedom, autonomy, and equality are not external ideals imposed upon capitalist society, but contradictions immanent to it. Through close engagement with Marx’s analyses of alienation, the value-form, and the autonomy of capital, the article demonstrates how capitalist social relations systematically obscure and invert human purposes. Value appears to act autonomously, while human agency is rendered derivative - a dynamic that constitutes the core of reification. By reconnecting these processes to Marx’s emancipatory vision, the paper reconstructs the normative core of his critique and its relevance for contemporary forms of domination, including platform labor, digital commodification, and ecological crisis. Rather than offering a moralizing perspective, Marx’s method grounds critique in the contradictions of capitalist modernity itself. In doing so, it provides not only a structural diagnosis of social domination, but a normative horizon oriented toward emancipation, grounded in the historical and material conditions that constrain and enable human freedom.",

However, open-source models still perform relatively well, achieving 95-96% accuracy on relatively straightforward questions up to 87% on more complex ones. Performance analysis revealed response brevity, but not category brevity, as a strong determinant of successful classification with responses under 50 characters demonstrating 7-11% higher classification accuracy. While models effectively detected nuance in simpler tasks, they struggled with responses containing multiple reasons, narratives, and implicit meanings.\n\nThe findings imply that social science researchers who want to use LLMs should design questions to elicit concise responses (10-50 characters), implement human-in-the-loop review for complex tasks, and carefully select appropriate models based on task complexity. Minimal demographic variation in classification accuracy was observed, with Claude uniquely maintaining consistent performance across population segments.
