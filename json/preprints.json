          "authors": "Tony Alves; Christopher Erdmann; Emily Esten; Martin Klein; Bianca Kramer; Maria Levchenko; Daisy Nip; Michael Parkin; Iratxe Puebla",
          "abstract": "Several preprint review communities have emerged in the life sciences in recent years. They have adopted different approaches to create and share preprint review information. New preprint review initiatives need to understand the benefits and challenges of the current technical solutions to store and transfer review metadata. This requires a clear overview of the various workflows that exist in this space. This publication maps out the preprint review metadata transfer ecosystem within the life sciences. Here we describe six illustrative workflows, as well as protocols, schemas and frameworks used for preprint review metadata transfer. For each workflow we highlight benefits and challenges faced by the preprint review services. Finally, we offer a summary of factors to consider when selecting a metadata workflow. This includes technical needs, costs, maintenance and sustainability, discoverability, and linking between preprints and reviews. We recommend that new preprint review groups adopt one of the existing workflows and encourage them to participate in community efforts to evolve and improve current standards. We believe this will support interoperability and bolster the development of new tools for preprint review.",

          "abstract": "In today’s media landscape, there are an ever-expanding number of communication channels that people can use to communicate within their interpersonal relationships. What social and psychological factors are associated with the selection of communication channels in everyday life? Here we report on findings from an intensive longitudinal field study of undergraduate students (N = 1,423 participants; ecological momentary assessments = 27,644) that examined: (1) the role of interaction partners in the selection of communication channels and (2) the associations between channel selection and perceptions of empathy during meaningful social interactions. Our findings indicated a preference for media-rich channels, such as face-to-face and video communication, particularly when engaging with weak social ties, compared to strong social ties. In addition, the use of media-rich channels was linked to greater momentary perceptions of empathy. Specifically, face-to-face interactions (compared to computer-mediated), as well as video calls and phone calls (compared to direct messaging) were associated with greater perceptions of empathy. These findings support and extend Media Multiplexity Theory, Media Richness Theory, and Media Synchronicity Theory by examining them in the context of interpersonal communication. The findings also show that channel selection is associated with empathy perceptions, which has implications for how people navigate social connections in an increasingly digital environment.",

          "authors": "Christos Halkiopoulos",
          "abstract": "The attentional probe paradigm involves presenting participants with different messages simultaneously through two distinct information channels within the same modality. By measuring reaction times to modality-specific probes that can appear in either channel, this paradigm enables the assessment of attention allocation between these channels. Since the 1980s this paradigm has become prominent for investigating attentional biases in the processing of emotional information. The best-known version of it, the dot-probe technique introduced by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata (1986), uses the visual modality. What is less well-known is that I had previously introduced the attentional probe paradigm in 1981 in the auditory modality in a modified dichotic listening experiment with pure tones as auditory probes. Using this tone-probe technique this study investigated the contrasting ways in which repressors and sensitisers (Byrne,1961) handle threatening information. Criticisms from a contemporary perspective notwithstanding of the rather limited initial study, it was concluded that sensitisers displayed an attentional bias favouring the processing of threatening stimuli, whereas repressors appeared to avoid the optimal processing of such stimuli.  This paper presents a historical reconstruction of how I developed the attentional probe paradigm, how I first applied it in the auditory modality, and how it was subsequently used in the visual modality. It also introduces a multimodal version to be used in further research and offers a critique of extant research relying exclusively on decontextualized stimuli.",

          "title": "Reducing The Low Prevalence Effect: Does similarity search translate to binary decisions?",
          "authors": "Greer Gillies; Anna Kosovicheva",
          "abstract": "In visual search, observers often miss rare targets. This low prevalence effect (LPE) is resistant to many cognitive interventions. However, a recent study showed that having participants identify the item that was most similar to the target (similarity search) eliminated the LPE. As real-world searches often require binary decisions (e.g., is there a threat in this bag?) we tested whether the benefits of similarity search generalize to binary decisions and to more naturalistic stimuli. Participants searched for T shapes amongst near T-distractors and the prevalence of True-T’s was manipulated. In the similarity search only condition, participants clicked on the “most T-like object”. In the similarity search &amp; binary decision condition, participants additionally reported whether the chosen item was a true T (yes/no). We found that in some circumstances, similarity search can be used to attenuate the LPE. However, there was an LPE for the binary decision task. Participants were less likely to classify the target as a true-T during low prevalence compared to high. We replicated this result in an additional experiment using more naturalistic stimuli. Participants watched clips of road videos and clicked on the “most hazardous location” in the video, followed by a binary decision (“would you need to respond to that hazard? yes/no”). Though participants located the hazards regardless of prevalence, there was an LPE for the binary decision task. Together, these results indicate potential limitations in applying similarity search outside the laboratory; the LPE is still seen in these searches if a binary decision is involved.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the psychosocial and community risk factors associated with financial exploitation is essential in developing prevention strategies. Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion also moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

          "authors": "DoYeon Lee; Tianyu Zhou; Jing Du; Brian Odegaard",
          "abstract": "Military personnel are often required to make perceptual decisions based on noisy and uncertain information. Over the last decade, work from experiments using simple stimuli in visual psychophysical paradigms has provided evidence that in the visual periphery, observers are often prone to false alarms and variable confidence judgments in detection tasks. To better understand whether these characteristics extend to more naturalistic paradigms, our research group has developed visual detection experiments in virtual reality, where on each trial, observers are required to first fixate on specific objects, and then make judgments about whether a target (i.e., a green soldier in uniform) is present, and rate confidence in this decision. Inevitably, extending the study of peripheral vision to virtual reality involves trade-offs, with tension between the degree of experimental control that is employed and the ecological validity of the task. In this piece, we focus on the challenges that emerged and the lessons we have learned in pursuit of designs that strike a balance between these factors. In our first experiment, we required participants to ride in an automatically-controlled vehicle, fixate on each red stop sign, and determine whether targets were present in the periphery while looking at the stop sign. Results indicated that observers (1) did not successfully fulfill fixation requirements in the task in all trials, and (2) requiring targets to appear and disappear based on whether a fixation requirement was met resulted in flickering that served as an unintentional, salient cue. In our second experiment, we allowed participants to navigate the vehicle themselves, while again requiring the same fixation requirement and perceptual judgments at each intersection. Initial tests of this design found that variability in how participants navigated in the vehicles sometimes resulted in stopping at locations that did not allow for viewing the stop sign and soldier at the same moment. Finally, in our third experiment, we manipulated the presence of the targets on each trial, and expanded our confidence questions to include both target-present and target-absent trials. Results revealed that confidence was similar in both target-present and target-absent conditions. Based on these preliminary findings, we outline design-related recommendations for studies of the periphery, and explain the tradeoffs that extend across several military-relevant tasks, including both target detection and visual search. Finally, we also share our code to facilitate eye tracking in the HTC Vive Pro, as well as our target detection tasks.",

          "authors": "Emily A. Williams; Matthew Warburton; Martin Krzywinski; Faisal Mushtaq",
          "abstract": "In typing proficiency tests, like those used in job recruitment or research studies, individuals are evaluated based on their speed and accuracy. However, the difficulty of the typed text — its ‘typability’ — can impact typing performance, introducing variability that is unrelated to skill. To ensure valid comparisons across individuals, time, and conditions, it is crucial to control for this variation in text difficulty. To address this issue, we develop the Typability Index, a model that predicts the relative typing speed of text. Building on earlier attempts to quantify typing difficulty from the 1940s, we create a more advanced typability model using the 136M Keystrokes dataset (Dhakal et al., 2018) where over 168,000 participants each typed 15 sentences from a pool of 1,525 items. Through random forest regression, we identify 10 key predictors from 33 candidate variables, including the proportion of lowercase letters, word frequency, and finger movement mechanics. Trained on 80% of the dataset and validated on the remaining 20% and a novel dataset, the Typability Index explained 72-87% of the variance in typability, compared to the 34% explained by an earlier leading model (Bell, 1949). To promote higher control in typing research and assessments, we introduce a web-based tool to facilitate accurate measurement and fair comparisons of text typability.",

          "title": "A Double-Edged Sword? Unpacking the Effects of Rumination on Emotional Clarity",
          "authors": "Cameron Pugach; Blair Elizabeth Wisco; Vera Vine",
          "abstract": "Rumination, or thinking passively and repetitively about one’s distress, and low emotional clarity, or not understanding one’s emotions, are risk factors for psychopathology. It has been suggested that people attempt to increase emotional clarity by ruminating, but whether ruminating works to help or harm emotional clarity in the moment is unknown. In N=74 adults, following an idiographic negative mood induction, we experimentally manipulated rumination and two comparison conditions – distraction and mindfulness – to assess their effects on negative emotion, subjective and implicit indices of emotional clarity, and self-insight. Manipulation checks showed that conditions produced a pattern of distinct experiences theoretically consistent with each response style. Compared to comparison conditions, rumination was less effective in alleviating negative emotion. However, all conditions produced similar effects on emotional clarity and self-insight. Whereas each condition failed to influence subjective emotional clarity, they increased implicit clarity and perceived self-insight. Results underscore the importance of incorporating multiple measures of emotional clarity and suggest that, compared to other cognitive emotion response styles, rumination may function as a double-edged sword that keeps one entrenched in negative emotion but without impairing implicit emotional clarity and self-insight. Findings may have implications for why people ruminate despite its negative impact on well-being.",

          "authors": "Belinda Viola Marijana Merkle; Oliver Dickhäuser",
          "abstract": "Choosing an educational path is a difficult life decision that can lead to unfavorable outcomes when it goes wrong. However, little research has examined how to support successful study major choice processes. To address this gap, we draw on person-environment fit and (affective) forecasting bias theories, assuming that higher objective major-specific fit forecasts (interests, skills, expectations) predict success (motivation, satisfaction, dropout intention, achievement) beyond subjective forecasts. Additionally relying on expectancy-value theory and cognitive dissonance theory, we assume that higher objective major-specific fit forecasts, when displayed in feedback, predict higher motivation to choose a major and higher likelihood of enrollment beyond subjective forecasts. Finally, we propose that prospective students receiving feedback before enrollment experience more success than those receiving no feedback. We tested these hypotheses in a longitudinal field study. Over three years, more than 4000 prospective students received feedback on their objective major-specific fit forecasts in an online-self-assessment and reported their motivation for the major before and after feedback. Subsequently, over 500 of these prospective students entered their respective major and reported their success. Additionally, we surveyed over 200 students who did not receive feedback. As hypothesized, objective major-specific fit forecasts predicted success beyond subjective forecasts. Higher objective forecasts related to higher motivation to choose the major and higher likelihood of enrollment beyond subjective forecasts. Finally, prospective students who received feedback on their objective forecasts before enrollment experienced more success compared to no feedback. We discuss theoretical implications for study choice and success theories and practical implications for study guidance.",

          "authors": "Xander Cornelis; Nicolas Dirix; Louisa Bogaerts",
          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that spontaneous eye blinks have a cognitive role in addition to their biological functions. Blinking has been associated with cognitive effort and processes related to the dynamic nature of incoming sensory information such as the release of attention. However, there is limited evidence supporting the cognitive role of spontaneous blinks, specifically during reading. This study provides the first systematic investigation of blinking patterns in eye-tracking data of naturalistic silent text reading. We hypothesized that blinks would be more likely to occur (1) around punctuation marks signaling a breakpoint in the text and (2) following fixations on lower-frequency words. To test these hypotheses, we utilized data from the large Ghent Eye Tracking Corpus (GECO), which includes eye movement data from 15 participants who read an entire novel in silence. The results indicate higher blinking proportions at punctuation marks compared to other positions in the text. Additionally, blink rates were modulated by word frequency, with higher word frequencies significantly reducing the probability of blinking. Extending previous research, our findings suggest substantial top-down regulation of blinking during reading.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigates whether inner speech—the mental rehearsal of words without articulation—facilitates naming recovery in individuals with aphasia. We hypothesized that items with preserved inner speech but impaired overt naming at baseline would improve more after speech therapy than items without inner speech. \nMethod: Nineteen participants with chronic, expressive aphasia participated in three pre-treatment naming sessions, nine treatment sessions (semantic feature analysis), and three post-treatment naming sessions. For each pre- and post-treatment naming session, participants named ~300 items (pictures of nouns) aloud and also indicated whether they had inner speech for each item. Based on pre-treatment naming sessions, 30 individualized items (“Treated30”) were trained using semantic feature analysis.  Mixed-effects models analyzed the effect of treatment, inner speech, psycholinguistic properties, and aphasia severity on naming outcomes immediately post-treatment. \nResults: There was an average of 60.8% proportional improvement on overt naming and 41% improvement on inner speech for the Treated30 from baseline to follow-up. In a series of hierarchical mixed models, baseline inner speech, inner speech across the study, aphasia severity, and interactions of inner speech variables with treatment were significant in predicting correct naming post-therapy. \nConclusions: Findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between inner and overt speech: baseline inner speech and, importantly, improvements in inner speech significantly influence therapy-related gains in naming. These results suggest that inner speech-focused interventions may improve outcomes by providing a cognitive scaffold for speech production.",

          "abstract": "Background: Consumers are increasingly using LLM-based chatbots to seek mental health advice or intervention due to ease of access and limited availability of mental health professionals. However, their suitability and safety for mental health applications remain underexplored, particularly in comparison to professional therapeutic practices.\nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate how general-purpose chatbots respond to mental health scenarios and compare their responses to those provided by licensed therapists. Specifically, we sought to identify chatbots’ strengths, limitations, and the ethical and practical considerations necessary for their use in mental health care.\nMethods: We conducted a mixed methods study to compare responses from chatbots and licensed therapists to scripted mental health scenarios. We created two fictional scenarios and prompted 3 chatbots to create six interaction logs. We recruited 17 therapists and conducted study sessions that consisted of three activities. First, therapists responded to the two scenarios using a Qualtrics form. Second, therapists went through the six interaction logs using a think aloud procedure to highlight their thoughts about the chatbots’ responses. Lastly, we conducted a semi-structured interview to explore subjective opinions on the use of chatbots for supporting mental health. The study sessions were analyzed using thematic analysis. The interaction logs from chatbot and therapist responses were coded using the Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions codes and then compared to each other.\nResults: We identified seven themes describing the strengths and limitations of the chatbots as compared to therapists. These include elements of good therapy in chatbot’s responses, conversational style of chatbots, insufficient inquiry and feedback seeking by chatbots, chatbot interventions, client engagement, chatbots’ responses to crisis situations, and considerations for chatbot-based therapy. In the use of MULTI codes, we found that therapists evoked more elaboration (t = 4.50, p = 0.001) and employed more self-disclosure (t = 1.05, p = 0.31) as compared to the chatbots. The chatbots used affirming (t = 1.71, p = 0.10) and reassuring (t = 2.29, p = 0.03) language more often than the therapists. The chatbots also employed psychoeducation (t = 2.69, p = 0.01) and suggestions (t = 4.23, p = 0.001) more often than the therapists did.\nConclusions: Our study demonstrates the unsuitability of general purpose chatbots to safely engage in mental health conversations, particularly in crisis situations. While chatbots display elements of good therapy, such as validation and reassurance, overuse of directive advice without sufficient inquiry, and use of generic interventions makes them unsuitable as therapeutic agents. Careful research and evaluation will be necessary to determine the impact of chatbot interactions and to identify the most appropriate use cases related to mental health.",

          "abstract": "Recognition of a word and its meaning benefits from the sensorimotor information about concepts. However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. The robust linguistic and clinical research literature focusing on English language acquisition is generally based on a model that presumes that the oral language a child acquires at home without formal instruction is the same language that is used for reading and writing. Arabic presents a qualitatively different scenario, in that children learning Arabic must acquire at least two different language systems: (1) a dialectal form that is largely used for informal interactions and which is not formally codified, and (2) a standard form, which is typically used in formal contexts and is almost exclusively reserved for reading and writing. Multilingual Arabic speakers are among the fastest growing language communities in the United States (US), yet very little is known about language development in Arabic-English speaking children, leading to critical knowledge gaps in language acquisition theory, assessment, and intervention. This project was designed to provide an initial overview of the Arabic-English language learning environment by addressing the following research questions: \nRQ 1: Do demographic characteristics such as parent sex and parent education influence caregiver reported parent-child use of language outside of the home in the standard form and spoken/home language form?\nRQ 2: Do demographic characteristics such as parent sex and parent education influence caregiver reported child grammatical outcomes, such as verb use, tense, and agreement? \nMethod. A community-based participatory approach was utilized for participant recruitment. The author partnered with community stakeholders to recruit a pilot sample of 42 families to the study. This study received institutional review board approval and followed all ethical guidelines. Questionnaires assessing caregiver ratings of their children’s language skills and the language richness of the home environment was administered in person within participants’ homes or in locations selected by participants (e.g., community centers). Families who consented were audio recorded for fidelity.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nForeign language effect (FLE) refers to the observed differences in responding to judgment and decision-making problems presented in native (L1) or foreign language (L2). The present research aimed to investigate whether L2 use could impact the judgment of bullshit, and, provided that the impact is observed, if the mechanisms behind the FLE could rely on emotionality. Bullshit is a form of meaningless material that is grammatically and syntactically correct, and has been studied in empirical psychology. We conducted two studies with participants differing in L2 proficiency. The participants were instructed to evaluate the profoundness of positive, negative, and neutral bullshit and mundane statements in their L1 and L2. The results suggest that people are more prone to accept the profundity of emotionally charged bullshit, whereas L2 use mostly impacts the judgment of less proficient speakers – it could diminish their ability to detect neutral nonsense and refute the profundity of negative mundane statements. This implies the dependence of FLE on valence, meaning, and their interaction. We discuss findings within Dual Process accounts of reasoning, noting that both emotional involvement and using a L2 lead to quick, intuitive processing. Therefore, to sound profound, use emotional words or a foreign language!",

          "abstract": "Background: Suicidal behaviour is a critical mental health issue in the adolescent population, often linked to serious emotional problems that leave survivors vulnerable to future risk. Psychological crises in adolescence are primarily associated with relational conflicts, with emotional crises involving depression or anxiety significantly increasing suicidal risk. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the rates of suicidal behaviour in adolescents undergoing emotional crises and explore their association with psychiatric diagnoses and demographic factors in Ecuador. Methods: An observational, correlational study using a quantitative approach was conducted. Data from 252 adolescents admitted to the Crisis Intervention Unit at the Institute of Neurosciences in Guayaquil, Ecuador, between 2011 and 2023 were analysed. Hospitalisation frequencies by year, gender, and associated psychiatric diagnoses were assessed. Data were obtained from each patient's unified clinical history. Results: Seventy-five percent of the patients were female, with 48% aged 17–18 years. Most adolescents were single (98%), and 86% had a secondary education level. The most frequent diagnosis was a depressive episode (73.4%), with 156 patients presenting suicidal ideation. Cutting and ingestion of psychotropic drugs were the most common suicide methods, predominantly among females. Logistic regression showed that a combination of an eating disorder and a depressive episode was associated with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation or attempts. Conclusions: The high frequency of suicidal behaviour in adolescent females aged 16–18 years underscores the need for targeted prevention programs addressing emotional crises and stress management in this high-risk group.",

Using a sample of 3,243 students who evaluate 98 teachers in medical courses, multi-faceted Rasch models (MFRM) were applied to control for variability introduced by rater severity and item difficulty. The SET questionnaires, designed to assess nine dimensions of teaching quality, were analyzed for their effectiveness to capture differential teaching perceptions. The analysis incorporated socio-cognitive factors, based on the Central Model of Student Perception (CSP model), which studies how the perception and facilitative effect of teaching influences student response. Results indicate that students can distinguish between specific dimensions of teaching, which supports the validity of the questionnaire, although challenges related to possible perceptual biases and item interpretation persist. These findings suggest that, despite their usefulness, SET questionnaires require rigorous control of external factors to improve their accuracy and reliability as a teaching assessment tool in higher education.",

Clinical outcomes were derived from changes in repeated self-reported scores on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) surveys administered before the first and most recent treatment visits. Adjusted logistic and linear regression was used for the analyses examining type of provider characteristic selected, engagement, and changes in each clinical outcome.\nResults  This study included Grow Therapy patients (mean age 34.0 years; 69.8% identifying as female). Over a quarter of patients selected a provider specialty (27.1%) and 4.4% selected a provider identity. Patients met with their provider a mean of 9.6 times (67.4% had 3 or more visits) and, among complete case patients with at least 2 PHQ-9 and 2 GAD-7 assessments (n=67,105), a large proportion showed significantly improved symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 improvement=3.5, 60.0% with a minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and anxiety (GAD-7 improvement=3.5, 66.1% MCID). Patients selecting a provider specialty had fewer visits but had greater declines in depression symptoms, and those selecting a provider identity engaged longer in care than patients not selecting each of these characteristics, respectively.\nConclusions and Relevance  This real world study demonstrates that a technology-enabled mental health platform that allows patients to self-select their provider is engaging and preliminarily efficacious. Patients may maximize benefits of these platforms by selecting preferred characteristics of their providers.",

The results indicated that young children were more likely to expect to seek help from familiar teachers, particularly those who previously responded positively. In contrast, young children were hesitant to expect to seek help from unfamiliar teachers, regardless of their response quality. These results suggest that preschool children flexibly form help-seeking expectations based on teachers’ familiarity and response quality, prioritizing familiarity over response quality.

          "abstract": "Given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability, cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory. The bulk of such research has investigated the role of emotion in memory by examining the mnemonic effects of affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. However, in addition to studying such dimensions, the consideration of well-established theories of emotion from affective science represents a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion, which conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The constructionist model of emotional memory (CMEM) generates several novel directions for future research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",

However, biases in algorithms designed to assess and treat mental health problems pose risk for equitable mental health. This cross-sectional study investigates the existence of bias in algorithms for detecting stress from mobile devices and its implications for mental health equity.\nMethods: A diverse sample of young adults (N = 212) carried smartphones, wore physiological sensors, and completed hourly surveys assessing their subjective stress for 24 hours. We then developed a Twin Neural Network machine learning (ML) model to detect hourly stress from smartphone and wearable data and evaluated model performance across gender and ethnic/racial status. \nFindings: The model performed moderately well overall yet showed significant variation in performance ranging from poor to good across gender and ethnic/racial groups. In particular, the model evidenced lower performance in women compared to men and overestimated the frequency of stress episodes for Hispanic/Latina women.\nInterpretation: Findings highlight the presence of bias in AI applications for mental health and underscore the need for cautious interpretation of ML outcomes in historically underrepresented groups. Discussion focuses on the implications of AI bias for mental health and the importance of developing methods that combine AI and social justice perspectives to ensure the implementation of equitable mental healthcare.\nFunding: This project is based on work supported by NIMH Grant No. R42MH123368 (Timmons, Comer, Ahle, Co-PIs), NSF GRFP Grant No. 1930019 (Timmons, PI), NSF Grant No. BCS-1627272 (Margolin, PI), SC CTSI (NIH/NCATS) Grant No. UL1TR000130 (Margolin, PI), NIH-NICHD Grant No. R21HD072170-A1 (Margolin, PI), NSF GRFP Grant No. DGE-0937362 (Timmons, PI), an APA Dissertation Award (Timmons, PI), NSF GRFP Grant No. DGE-0937362 (Han, PI), and NSF Grant No. 2046118 (Chaspari, PI).\nKeywords: Artificial intelligence; bias; equitable mental health; multimodal stress sensing",

          "abstract": "Psychological inoculation is a promising and potentially scalable approach to counter misinformation. The goal of inoculation is to teach people to recognize manipulation techniques, such as emotional language, commonly found in misinformation online. While there is substantial evidence that inoculation increases technique recognition when directly assessed, it is not clear if this effect transfers to spontaneous detection of techniques and disengagement with the associated content in real-life contexts. In particular, emotional appeals are abundant on social media and known drivers of attention and engagement. Therefore, we examined the effects of emotional language and emotional manipulation inoculation on attention and engagement in a simulated social media feed environment. Through five pre-registered studies, we found that inoculation only decreased engagement with emotionally presented content when we solely presented synthetic content relevant to the task of identifying emotional manipulation. Any addition of real tweets or even synthetic tweets containing other manipulation techniques (e.g., ad hominem attacks) into the feed appeared to nullify the effect. Our results highlight the importance of assessing misinformation interventions in ecologically-valid contexts to estimate real-world effects.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Current reading research remains Latin script-centric in a monoliterate context, and may not be generalizable to the significant percentage of school-aged children growing up as biscriptal bilinguals globally. To address this, we examined the early stages of reading development in bilingual readers of an under-studied language combination that differs across orthographic depth and script. Specifically, our longitudinal study compared within-language contributions of three phonological processing skills to reading outcomes in Urdu-English bilingual children. Method: We assessed 154 Urdu-English readers in Pakistan and Canada on their phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills at Timepoint 1 (Senior Kindergarten) and word/non-word reading accuracy and fluency outcomes at Timepoint 2 (Grade 1) in Urdu (orthographically-transparent language with Perso-Arabic script) and English (orthographically-opaque language with Latin script). Results: Our multivariate multiple linear regression analyses demonstrate the importance of phonological awareness and RAN for reading, across orthographic depth/script and type of reading outcome measure. Predictive strength differences were also evident. Phonological awareness accounted for greater variance in the reading accuracy measure across both languages and particularly in Urdu, with RAN contributing greater variance to Urdu reading fluency. Phonological memory was not a significant predictor in either language. Conclusions: Our study contributes to the generalizability of dominant reading models, such as the Psycholinguistic Grain Size Theory (PGST), Orthographic Depth Hypothesis (ODH), and Speed-of-Processing theoretical account of RAN-reading fluency relationship, beyond monoliterate readers of Latin scripts. Particularly, we demonstrate the importance of phonological awareness and RAN for reading outcomes in biliterate readers of a transparent orthography with a Perso-Arabic script.",

To this end, this work introduces a statistical approach that provides tools to implement an informed measurement process on unstructured textual data. The proposed approach is grounded in the longstanding tradition of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), now enhanced by the integration of word embeddings. This machine-learning technique represents words in a continuous vector space based on their semantic relationships.

This randomised controlled trial evaluated a novel VR intervention for healthcare students' wellbeing.\n131 healthcare students at St George's, University of London were randomised to either VR (n=67) or video control (n=64) groups. The intervention consisted of five daily sessions of clinically-informed hypnotherapy-based experiences. Outcomes included perceived stress (PSS), wellbeing (WEMWBS), depression (PHQ-2), and momentary affective states. Assessments occurred at baseline, post-session, and at two-week follow-up.\nVR participants showed significantly greater improvements in post-session mood states compared to the video group. At two-week follow-up, the VR group demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress (within-group effect size g=0.57) compared to video controls (g=0.21). VR participants reported significantly higher immersion levels and intervention satisfaction. No significant between-group differences were found for wellbeing or depression measures. Qualitative data indicated stronger therapeutic benefits in the VR group, with 42/47 VR participants reporting positive effects compared to 17/50 in the video group.\nThe VR intervention effectively reduced stress levels in healthcare students, with effects sustained at two-week follow-up. The immersive nature of VR appeared to enhance therapeutic benefits compared to non-immersive delivery.

          "abstract": "Studies show that cognitive activities are reflected by certain pupillary responses, where increased arousal and cognitive effort are typically accompanied by greater pupil dilation. This pupillary response is usually amplified upon presentation of negative or threatening stimuli. Yet, there is a lack of literature describing the opposite relationship, i.e., pupil size being a predictor of efficient threat-detection abilities rather than a criterion. In a lab experiment, we investigated whether pupil size predicted response time and decision in a computer-based visual search task. Subjects were presented with real-life images of different people holding various objects and were asked to indicate the presence or absence of a black handgun in the stimulus material. The analyses showed that larger pupil sizes during the fixation period were a valid predictor of shorter response times after stimulus onset as was the number of trials completed and experience with guns. Pupil size was not associated with the subjects’ decisions. We believe that the link between pupil dilation and increased cognitive effort and engagement accounts for the results and discuss the implications for successful threat-detection.",

          "abstract": "Background: Induction of negative mood increases tobacco choice in dependent smokers; however, less is known about the mechanisms behind this. This study addressed this gap by applying a computational model of value-based decision-making to tobacco and tobacco-unrelated choices following mood manipulation. Method: Using a pre-registered, within-subject design, 49 daily tobacco smokers (›10 daily cigarettes) watched two different videos which primed them to experience negative and positive mood (tobacco valuation and devaluation, respectively). Participants completed self-report measures of mood and craving to smoke before and after priming, followed by a two-alternative forced-choice task with (separate) blocks of tobacco-related and unrelated (animal) images. On each block, participants selected the image that they previously rated higher. A drift-diffusion model was fitted to the reaction time and error data to estimate evidence accumulation (EA) processes and response thresholds during the different blocks. Results: After watching videos intended to induce negative mood, happiness scores were lower (p ‹ .001, d = 1.16), while sadness and craving to smoke scores were higher (both ps ‹ .001, ds › .60), compared to after watching videos intended to induce positive mood. However, contrary to hypotheses, the experimental manipulation did not robustly affect EA rates (F = 1.15, p = .29, ηp2 = .02) or response thresholds (F = .07, p = .79, ηp2 = .00) for either tobacco or tobacco-unrelated decisions. Conclusions: Manipulation of mood in daily smokers did not lead to alterations in the internal processes that precede value-based decisions made about tobacco and tobacco-unrelated cues.",

          "abstract": "So-called ‘mismatch accounts’ propose that, rather than arising from a socio-cognitive deficit present in autistic people, mentalising difficulties are the product of a mismatch in neurotype between interaction partners. Although this idea has grown in popularity over the recent years, there is currently only limited empirical evidence to support mismatch theories. Moreover, the social model of disability such theories are grounded in demands a culturally situated view of social interaction, yet research on mentalising and/or autism is largely biased towards western countries, with little knowledge on how successful mentalising is defined differently, and how tools to assess socio-cognitive ability compare, across cultures. Using a widely employed mentalising task, the current study investigated and compared the bi-directional mentalising performance of British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults and assessed observer-agent kinematic similarity as a potential dimension along which mismatches may occur between neurotypes. Participants were asked to depict various mental state- and action-based interactions by moving two triangles across a touch-screen device, before viewing and interpreting stimuli generated by other participants. In the UK sample, our results replicate a seminal prior study in showing poorer mentalising abilities in non-autistic adults for animations generated by the autistic group. Crucially, the same pattern did not emerge in the Japanese sample, where there were no mentalising differences between the two groups. Limitations of the current study include that efforts to match all samples within and across cultures in terms of IQ, gender and age were not successful for all comparisons, but control analyses suggest this did not affect our results. Furthermore, any performance differences were found for both the mental state- and action-based conditions, mirroring prior work and raising questions about the domain-specificity of the employed task. Our results add support for a paradigm shift in the autism literature, moving beyond deficit-based models and towards acknowledging the inherently relational nature of social interaction. We further discuss how our findings suggest limited cultural transferability of common socio-cognitive measures rather than superior mentalising abilities in Japanese autistic adults, underscoring the need for more cross-cultural research and the development of culturally sensitive scientific and diagnostic tools.",

          "abstract": "The study aimed to explore the understudied area of typical adult handwriting performance, focusing on the potential predictive roles of fine motor skills and executive functions. While the initial stages of handwriting acquisition are assumed to rely upon executive functions and fine motor skills, both components are no longer viewed as needed in automatized, expert handwriting. We tested this assumption by assessing the contributions of these components to handwriting performance in a group of 33 adult participants. Linear regressions were used to examine whether dexterity, manual praxis, working memory, inhibition and flexibility predict handwriting speed, legibility, and fluency. Results revealed that fine motor skills were a significant contributor to all aspects of handwriting performance. Executive functions also predicted handwriting performance, with a significant effect of flexibility on writing speed and of working memory on legibility. These findings highlight that, even at a high level of expertise and automatization, handwriting remains a motor skill whose performance depends on executive and fine motor control capacities. They suggest a predictive coding account of graphomotor control, whereby internal forward and inverse models would support the execution and monitoring of handwriting movements. This raises important questions about the extent to which disorders in motor and executive processes can affect handwriting performance and highlights the need for further research into this complex motor behavior.",

Yet, numerous conceptualizations of well-being exist, which hampers conceptual and empirical research on student well-being, and the development of measurement instruments of and interventions on well-being. To advance research and practice, we propose a definition and conceptual framework of student well-being that may serve as a basis for measuring, understanding, and promoting students’ well-being. We formulated four guiding postulates based on philosophical underpinnings of established perspectives on well-being that guided the development of our definition and framework, which was further shaped by existing literature and the input from meetings with experts. We define student well-being as a multi-facetted concept that reflects a students' degree of positive or negative cognitive appraisal about and affective experience with the self. Student well-being comprises seven interrelated facets (i.e., meaning in life, self-esteem, autonomy, relatedness, sense of belonging, subjective health, body acceptance) grouped into three domains: psychological, social, and physical. The conceptual framework outlines predictors and outcomes of student well-being. We discuss implications of our definition and framework for science and practice, as well as outline several key avenues for future research on student well-being.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelics are hallucinogenic drugs that have the potential to treat depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other psychiatric conditions. The dominant paradigm in contemporary psychedelic-assisted therapy is non-directive; that is, participants undergo the psychedelic treatment with minimal external guidance from therapists. However, the clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy could be improved by explicitly guiding participants to attend to and resolve specific symptoms of their condition. Here, we propose a variant of Daoist meditation – the outer dissolving technique in the water method – as one such framework for guiding participants in psychedelic therapy. This technique can aid participants in noticing and letting go of bodily tensions or “blockages” that are associated with repressed emotions. Practicing this technique during the preparatory and integration phases of psychedelic therapy, as well as during the acute effects of the drug, could foster deeper insights into the somatic manifestations of psychiatric conditions, while also empowering participants to release the emotions that underlie those conditions. Overall, Daoist meditation is a promising technique to facilitate psychological healing, and we encourage future researchers to consider implementing it as an adjunct to psychedelic-assisted therapy.",

Some report changes across the menstrual cycle or with hormone fluctuations, while others find no significant effects. To evaluate the evidentiary value of these studies, we conducted a p-curve analysis on eight studies reporting significant associations. Two analyses were performed: one on the menstrual cycle's effects and another on combined menstrual cycle and ovarian hormone effects. Neither analysis provided clear evidence for a genuine effect, and both revealed very low statistical power (maximum 12%) in the underlying studies. Recent, more rigorous studies with larger sample sizes have also failed to detect this effect, further questioning its existence. If present, the effect is likely very small or non-existent. We recommend that future research employ high statistical power and rigorous methodologies to reliably detect any true effects.",

          "abstract": "Intellectual humility is increasingly recognized as an epistemic virtue that helps foster truth-seeking, encourage compromise, and mitigate polarization. Yet, the current body of evidence grapples with a striking contradiction: The prevailing theoretical account suggests that intellectual humility hinges on metacognitive ability—the capacity to introspect on one’s own accuracy which manifests in assigning due confidence to the varying accuracy of one’s accuracy. However, empirical research testing this metacognitive ability account of intellectual humility has yielded inconsistent results. Here, we introduce a cognitive science approach informed by Signal Detection Theory, allowing for a more nuanced separation of metacognitive ability from correlated but distinct concepts (i.e., confidence and accuracy). We conduct a survey study among a national US sample (N = 999) involving the interpretation of one of the most heavily contested domains—climate change—lending itself for an investigation into how intellectual humility relates to cognitive processes in domains where it is most needed. We presented participants with summaries of fictitious studies on renewable energy, followed by 2-alternative forced choice questions to assess their accuracy and confidence. Results showed that firstly, more intellectually humble citizens were more accurate at discerning correct from incorrect interpretations of the presented evidence. Secondly, more intellectually humble citizens exhibited a heightened capacity to adjust their confidence levels to the varying accuracy of their evidence interpretations–indicating higher metacognitive ability—and this association was robust to accounting for their superior accuracy, and other preregistered covariates. And thirdly, in contrast to intuitive notions, more intellectually humble citizens did not exhibit lower metacognitive bias, the inclination to report lower (vs. higher) overall confidence. By highlighting the role of metacognitive ability in intellectual humility, the current study delivers empirical evidence for the ancient notion that epistemic virtues are linked to metacognitive ability.",

Four Thai tones, two static (low, high) and two dynamic (rising, falling) were presented in AX pairs in two orders: static-dynamic – low-rising, low-falling, high-rising, high-falling, and dynamic-static – rising-low, falling-low, rising-high, falling-high. A significant age effect was found; tone discrimination developed monotonically over age. Independent of this age effect it was found that discrimination was significantly better for dynamic-static than for static-dynamic tone pairs. Thus, there is a definite directional asymmetry in the perception of Thai lexical tones by Thai listeners, and given the consistency of this effect across age, it appears that this directional asymmetry may be formed in early childhood, even perhaps in early infancy, or is even rooted in a general auditory bias in speech perception.",

          "abstract": "How do children learn words so rapidly? A powerful source of information about a new word’s meaning is the set of social cues provided by its speaker (e.g. eye-gaze). Studies of children’s use of social cues have tended to focus on the emergence of this ability in early infancy. We show, however, that this early-emerging ability has a long developmental trajectory: Slow, continuous improvements in speed of social information processing occur over the course of the first five years of life. This developing ability to allocate social attention is a significant bottleneck on early word learning—continuous changes in social information processing predict continuous changes in children’s ability to learn new words. Further, we show that this bottleneck generalizes to children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, whose social information processing is atypical. These results describe a route by which increases in social expertise can lead to changes in language learning ability, and more generally highlight the dependence of developmental outcomes not on just the existence of particular competencies, but on their proficient use in complex contexts.",

Such actions parallel sacrificial dilemmas where harm saves lives, violating deontological ethics against harm but upholding utilitarian ethics to maximize outcomes. Therefore, we predicted that, compared to other medical professionals, surgeons and physicians performing invasive procedures may reject sacrificial harm less, focus on outcomes more, or both--in part due to a lower score on empathy, personal distress and higher score on resilience and lower score on action and outcome aversion. We recruited 131 practicing physicians and compared those who a) regularly perform invasive versus noninvasive procedures and b) specialize in surgery versus other specializations on sacrificial moral dilemma decisions, empathy, personal distress, and resilience, and aversion to causing and witnessing harm. Results indicated that physicians performing invasive procedures and specializing in surgery (versus physicians not performing invasive procedures and surgeries) scored lower on both deontological and utilitarian responding; in addition, surgeons scored lower on personal distress and higher on resilience (however other findings were not significant). These findings provide some tentative evidence that surgeons and physicians performing invasive surgery are less concerned with harm than other medical professionals, which may be adaptive for performing their duties.",

          "abstract": "When a system observes a visual signal under uncertainty, it weights a number of values probabilistically, where the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the distribution corresponds to the best guess of the system regarding the true value of the observed stimulus. Perceptual uncertainty can therefore be assessed as the amount of variability in a Gaussian observation which is logically expected to increase in density as a function of time (number of exposures) and stimulus intensity (Norwich, 1977), thereby making the stimulus representation more accurate. Similar to how noise is modeled in stimulus representations during memory tasks, the amount of uncertainty in the observation can also simultaneously depend on whether the stimulus is perceived as a target or a distractor in a psychophysical task. We show that a framework incorporating both sources of noise can explain priming effects where the interference between two signals in a trial is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of their observations, with the initial stimulus treated as a reference distribution. Our model predicted response times in a perceptual shape discrimination task including items embedded in spatial noise that could unpredictably appear as a target or as a distractor. These results show that processing times of the second stimulus can be convincingly modeled as the statistical distance between the noise distributions of two consecutive stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Registered Reports are a type of empirical article in which study proposals are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before the research is undertaken. This is achieved by splitting the traditional peer review process into two stages: at ‘Stage 1’, authors submit their study proposal and peer reviewers assess the plausibility of the research questions and the appropriateness of the methodology and analytical plan. Protocols that are favourably reviewed receive ‘In Principle Acceptance’ (IPA) whereby the journal, or platform, commits to publishing the final study regardless of its results. The authors then collect and/or analyse their data. At ‘Stage 2’, they then submit their complete research article and peer reviewers evaluate how closely the authors have followed their protocol and accurately report and interpret their findings. By doing this, Registered Reports are proposed to mitigate many issues seen in the historical research ecosystem: they aim to reduce the potential for questionable research practices by incentivising transparency and reproducibility and reduce publication bias by focusing on methodological and analytical rigour over the nature of the results. This guide provides an overview of what Registered Reports are and how they work, responds to frequently asked questions, outlines barriers and solutions to their implementation, and offers 10 top tips for researchers. It is aimed at students and researchers wanting to learn more about Registered Reports and/or conduct their research through this format.",

Here, we introduce a new task for assessing naturalistic expression recognition ability, modeled after an established posed expression labeling task. We investigated whether naturalistic and posed recognition show similar associations with empathy and cognitive ability despite differences in the realism and perceived genuineness of the expressions. Across three studies, we found that the naturalistic task, which was highly correlated with the posed task, possessed strong psychometric properties that make it well suited to studying individual differences. While naturalistic and posed recognition had similarly sized, positive associations with cognitive and affective empathy, naturalistic recognition had a greater positive association with cognitive ability than did posed recognition. Overall, our results show that naturalistic expressions—which are more nuanced and varied than posed expressions—can provide equally, if not more, robust insights into expression recognition ability.",

          "authors": "Patrick Dwyer; Clifford Saron",
          "abstract": "Purpose: The autistic-developed monotropism account suggests autism is characterized by hyper-focus towards interests, although hyper-focus research has not explored associations among self-/caregiver-report and lab-based measures.  Other findings suggest autistic attention has an enhanced capacity and/or is unusually prone to involuntary capture.  This study used questionnaires and lab-based tasks to investigate autistic attention and probe its relations to inattention/distractibility, sensory experiences, and anxiety.\nMethods: 18 autistic and 22 comparison adolescents completed self-report measures of hyper-focus, anxiety, and sensory experiences, and laboratory psychoacoustic tasks, visual working memory and cross-modal attention capture accuracy and reaction time tasks, and a hyper-focus paradigm relying on the N2pc and Pd event-related potentials.  Participants’ caregivers completed proxy hyper-focus, anxiety, sensory experiences, and inattention questionnaires.\nResults: Autistic participants had elevated hyper-focus per self- and caregiver-report questionnaires, and exhibited less visual working memory capacity, potentially reflecting difficulty attending to multiple targets.  However, groups did not differ in event-related potentials indexing hyper-focus, or behavioural cross-modal attention capture.  Different types of attention measures were generally not related to one another.  Participants and their caregivers  overall viewed hyper-focus’ impact as modestly positive, with individual opinions differing.  Self-reported hyper-focus was related to self-reported misophonia and sensory hyperreactivity.\nConclusions: Questionnaires suggest hyper-focus is elevated in autism and has mixed, nuanced real-world impacts.  However, some laboratory paradigms with explicit instructions in highly controlled, often non-naturalistic environments may struggle capture real-world autistic attentional experiences; additional research is needed to align laboratory and questionnaire measures.  This study also suggests autistic perceptual capacities are not globally enhanced.",

          "abstract": "Early vocabulary development benefits from diverse lexical exposures within children’s language environment. However, the influence of lexical diversity on children as they enter middle childhood and are exposed to multimodal language inputs remains unclear. This study evaluates global and local aspects of lexical diversity in three 1.6-million-word child-directed corpora, representing average Chinese children’s speech, print and media language environments. Additionally, pseudo-multimodal samples were compiled from the three corpora to compare with the unimodal environments on lexical diversity. We then investigated the associations between lexical diversity and the acquisition of 361 words spanning early-to-middle childhood. The findings show that print and pseudo-multimodal language provided the most diverse lexical environments, whereas speech exhibited the least diversity. However, speech diversity most strongly predicted lexical development, particularly before the onset of middle childhood. Exploratory analysis revealed that lexical diversity of other modalities emerged as stronger predictors thereafter. Early lexical development was best predicted by words’ variations in connectivity with other words within an immediate context, whereas in middle childhood, variations in words’ occurrences in larger context windows became the primary predictor, implicating children’s growing ability to attend to linguistic contexts of increasing sizes. Importantly, higher diversity was consistently associated with earlier word acquisition across measures and developmental phases. These findings underscore the critical role of varied lexical experiences in children’s language development.",

Diagnostic classification models have been developed to assess students’ learning status and provide remedial instructions. However, the impact of mastery or non-mastery of specific attributes on long-term learning development remains uncertain. If certain non-mastered attributes hinder the growth of mathematical ability, early intervention becomes essential. In this study, we developed a random effect diagnostic classification for multilevel growth curve (RDC-MGC) model to identify the specific effects of attribute mastery on the individual-level mathematics ability growth. The model was applied to arithmetic test data from second- to sixth-grade elementary students. Diagnosis was conducted in the second grade, and the effects of mastery on mathematics ability growth from the third to sixth grades were assessed. The results showed that attribute mastery in the second grade influenced both the intercept and slope of individual ability growth, highlighting the importance of early-stage diagnosis in supporting mathematical development.

However, aside from this and a prior companion study, no investigations have explored the potential groove effect of simple metronome meter-rhythms on repetitive physical activities, including that of walking. Additionally, while a few studies have examined the effect of music sound intensity during walking, auditory stimuli have not been compared with the silent walking condition at equivalent cadence. In Shay (2023a), a range of “basic meters” varying in monotonicity and complexity were created using an accenting metronome, that placed a different tonal accent on the first beat of each repeating measure created. Quadruple meter with a corresponding 4/4 time signature elicited the longest synchronous step lengths and proportionately fastest walking speeds. Additionally, the stimulation of music a metronome was found to increase linearly with increasing sound intensity (Shay, 2022b). With the same participant and test track at a confirmed synchronous walking tempo of 120 bpm, the current investigation aimed to validate and expand upon previous findings by introducing another level of metronome meter complexity (basic quadruple meter with secondary third-beat accenting) in an integrated design across a wider range of sound intensity — 59 dB (faint) to 87 dB (moderately loud). The order of increasing participant vigor elicited by the four stimulus conditions studied was: nearly monotonic basic 10/4 metronome meter &lt; basic 4/4 metronome meter &lt; secondary accented 4/4 metronome meter &lt; familiar–enjoyable 4/4 single-genre music. This sequence represents the order of decreasing meter monotonicity and increasing meter-rhythm complexity overall. Over the intensity range studied, walking speed increased similarly (approximately 11%) with increasing intensity for all stimuli, suggesting that intensity serves as a modulator of the auditory stimulus.  At higher intensities, all conditions of music and metronome meter produced more walking speed than the 120 spm silent walking condition. These results align with prior findings, demonstrating that at equivalent sound intensities and synchronous walking tempos, reducing the monotonicity of the meter or increasing the complexity of the meter-rhythm progressively enhances sensorimotor stimulation. Furthermore, sound intensity modulates the level of the stimulus vigor produced.  These findings have practical implications for walkers, runners, and other repetitive exercise and sports domain activities. Additionally, they provide insights into the auditory coupling with the human motor system and may hold potential for applications in cued-rehabilitation of human gait disorders.",

          "abstract": "Feelings of shame can play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorders. However, the role and measurement of shame in relation to eating disorders remain poorly understood. The current work presents the adaptation of a measure of external and internal shame in relation to eating disorders (EISS-ED) based on an integrative perspective that leverages the strengths of the biopsychosocial model and shame-pride cycle framework. Specifically, the EISS-ED accounts for how individuals believe they are perceived by others (external shame) and how they perceive themselves (internal shame), in relation to eating. The results of exploratory and confirmatory analyses (N = 478) supported the two-factor structure (including 14 items) of the EISS-ED and its factorial invariance by clinical history and gender. Concurrent validity analyses showed positive correlations between external and internal shame and eating disorder symptoms, negative affect, and detachment. Both external and internal shame measures provided fair classification accuracy of participants based on self-reported history of clinical assessment or treatment for eating disorders. These findings improve the understanding of the role of shame in eating disorders and offer evidence on a valid assessment that can aid in identifying, measuring, and addressing this important construct, supporting targeted interventions.",

Yet, we know that individuals mentalize better for people who are like them and autistic people are likely to see non-autistic people as different to themselves. Here, we tested whether an actor’s diagnosis affected the spontaneous mentalizing of autistic and non-autistic adults by recording eye-movements. We found that autistic adults correctly anticipated the actor’s action based on her beliefs only when she was autistic. Conversely, non-autistic adults correctly anticipated her action only when the actor was non-autistic. Thus, the predominantly non-autistic world we inhabit seems to underlie autistic people’s difficulty mentalizing, challenging the idea of a fundamental impairment.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making is a daily activity that we do with small to large risks. A mental process known as counterfactual thinking, which involves considering alternative scenarios that differ from the actual event and potentially affect an individual’s decisions and actions, occurs in the decision-making process. There are two types of counterfactual thinking, upward and downward, both can elicit positive and negative emotions, including regret, disappointment, and relief. This study employed a quantitative experimental approach with a mixed-method design to measure the effects of counterfactual thinking on the decision-making ability of early adult females with anxiety using the modified Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Based on the screening stages using the DASS-42, 40 participants with moderate and severe levels of anxiety met the inclusion criteria. The findings of this study indicate that counterfactual thinking, particularly the upward type, impacts one’s capacity for better decision-making.",

This study piloted a multidimensional measure to evaluate socially and ecologically responsible behavior propensity in the context of nature-based PA. We developed a multidimensional scale to assess this construct related to consumption and engagement behaviors, and explored its construct and criterion validity using confirmatory and exploratory analyses. The scale consists of seven factors relating to consumption behavior, including responsible clothing purchase, secondhand clothing purchase, clothing purchase necessity, travel mode choice, compensation, and sharing; and two factors relating to engagement, i. e., social engagement and ecological engagement. Structural equation models based on the theory of planned behavior largely supported criterion validity of the new scale.

In this study, we applied the visual foraging paradigm to address this gap.

This bias combines with motor\nprecision demands, such as aiming for stable contact points.

          "abstract": "Understanding passenger comfort in automated vehicles (AVs) is critical for advancing highly automated driving systems. This test track study was conducted in 2023 with N = 41 participants who are accustomed to German driving norms. It examined how deceleration rates and environmental factors influence passenger perceptions in two scenarios: crosswalks and blind intersections. The participants were driven by a real AV, which braked using deceleration rates of -1.5 m/s², -2.5 m/s², and -3.5 m/s². Additionally, at the crosswalk, the pedestrian visibility time, and at the intersection, the presence of an approaching vehicle was varied. The results show that passengers generally prefer lower deceleration rates but accept higher rates (-3.5 m/s²) when the pedestrian becomes visible more unexpectedly. In the intersection scenario, comfort ratings were less influenced by the presence of an approaching vehicle than by the deceleration rate, with lower rates being favoured. These findings are valuable for AV development; however, future research should explore more diverse populations to validate the study’s findings across varying traffic conditions and cultural settings. The study indicates that tailoring AV deceleration to the traffic scenarios can enhance passenger comfort. It can help AV developers define comfortable and safe perceived driving styles without compromising efficiency.",

Nonetheless, Trump’s blatant disregard for the truth has given rise to much concern about the dawn of a “post-truth” era. I argue that there are striking differences between the tacit ontologies of truth underlying the WMD deception and Donald Trump’s false claims, respectively. Whereas the WMD campaign contested a single reality, Trump’s false claims often repudiate the very idea of external truths that exist independently of anyone’s opinion. I consider this ontological shift from realism to extreme constructivism to be the most critical aspect of the current “post-truth” malaise. I note that an extreme constructivist “truth” has formed an essential aspect of historical fascism and Nazism, as well as of contemporary populist movements, and that those conceptions are incompatible with liberal-democratic norms of truth-seeking. I conclude by pointing towards potential solutions of the “post-truth” crisis.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies on fear extinction have primarily focused on repeated exposure to fear-inducing context without negative consequences. However, it is also possible that an individual can reduce fear responses by predicting that they can transition to a safe environment through their own actions, even if a fear-inducing context appears. The effect of this transition ability on fear responses remains largely unexplored. Here, by conducting virtual reality (VR) experiments involving height and flight scenarios, we examined whether participants' fear responses to height decrease after actively experiencing a low-altitude VR flight, which allowed them to predict that they would be in a safe state by flying even if they fell from a height. Specifically, participants in the flight group (n=49) flew over a city at altitudes below 5 meters for 7 minutes, while participants in the control group (n=50) watched a video of a flight group participant's experience. Before and after the flight or passive viewing task, both groups walked on a plank while having their skin conductance response (SCR) and subjective fear score (SFS) measured. We found that the active flight group exhibited a greater reduction in both SCR and SFS compared to the control group, and that the questionnaire score of the controllability over the virtual self-body during the VR flight, predicts the SCR reduction in the flight group. These results clarified that the ability to transition to safe states by self actions can reduce physiological and subjective fear responses.",

Participants exposed to opposing formant perturbations applied to the two syllables of a single trained word (e.g., “bedhead” → “bidhad”) adapted separately to counteract the syllable-specific perturbations (i.e., producing “badhid”) and, critically, transferred the learned adaptation to untrained words based purely on shared prosodic structure (words with the same prosody but novel syllables, e.g., producing “breastfed” like “brastfid”). This evidence for an independent word-level prosodic representation, which has been hard to detect in previous studies, highlights the usefulness of sensorimotor adaptation as a tool for language production research.",

          "abstract": "Adults can reflectively revise their beliefs and selectively respond to unreliable informants, despite often forming and revising beliefs unreflectively without assessing their reasons. This study investigates how the strength of counterevidence coming from an informant affects adults’ ability to infer that the informant is unreliable through acquiring and responding to undermining defeaters (i.e., evidence suggesting that something was wrong with how the belief was formed). Participants (N = 120) watched videos of two informants acting on two locations: one whose actions reliably indicated the reward location, and one whose actions did not. The strength of feedback participants received after making a choice was manipulated across two conditions. In the Strong feedback condition, participants received positive feedback when they found the reward and explicit negative feedback when they did not, along with information about the reward's true location. In the Weak feedback condition, they received positive feedback, but incorrect choices simply resulted in no reward appearing. Participants responded selectively to unreliability, following the Unreliable informant’s evidence less often than that of the Reliable informant. This effect was observed after only two to three misleading trials, but only in the Strong feedback condition. In subsequent trials where informants were pitted against each other, participants in the Strong feedback condition, but not in the Weak feedback condition, consistently preferred the Reliable informant. These findings suggest that adults’ ability to infer informants’ reliability depends on the strength of counterevidence. Additionally, exploratory analyses reveal a key distinction between acquiring and responding to undermining defeaters.",

This valuational view has amassed impressive support over the last two decades, but critics have recently raised serious concerns.

This essay offers a systematic response. Key refinements are made to the valuational view allowing for multiple formats for value information and two levels of valuation (options-level and systems-level).

Syrian refugee children (n=59, MAge=14 Range = 8-18), completed a resting state scan using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. Data were analyzed to assess the link between neural network properties and developmental timing of adversity. Results indicate that prolonged displacement experienced earlier in life was significantly linked with neural network organization, impacting the balance between the brain's functional integration and segregation as quantified by the overall reduced small worldness in comparison to experiencing displacement at an older age.

One indicator of emotional health is loneliness, which refers to a distressing experience that one’s social relationships are less in quality and quantity than those desired. This preregistered review aimed to examine the association between adverse childhood experiences (e.g., physical abuse/neglect, emotional abuse/neglect, sexual abuse, parental separation/divorce, family conflict, domestic violence) and loneliness in adulthood. A database search (Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, APA PsychINFO, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus) was conducted. After removal of duplicates, 3,689 papers were reviewed and 20 met inclusion criteria. When feasible, results were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis and inverse variance modelling and reported narratively. Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant association between cumulative adverse childhood experiences and loneliness (r = 0.30, 95% CI [0.22-0.37]; prediction interval = 0.04-0.52) and between specific adversity types and loneliness, namely sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect. Some heterogeneity was observed across studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed no differences in age, gender, age group, continent, or measures of adversity/loneliness. This research indicates that adversities in childhood may have some long-term influences on loneliness, both cumulatively and within adversity subtypes.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Cameron Stade; Shannon Wiltsey Stirman; Philip Held; H. Andrew Schwartz; johannes Christopher Eichstaedt",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has garnered significant attention for their potential to augment and possibly even replace current forms of psychological assessment or treatment. However, current AI technologies have yet to demonstrate the capacity to effect lasting psychological change. This paper outlines five key criteria for developing effective AI clinical psychology interventions, grounded in clinical science principles and emerging evidence from the AI mental health field: 1) attending to mechanisms of patient change, 2) conducting meaningful evaluation, 3) attending to time and dose, 4) modeling key characteristics of therapists and patients; and 5) attending to engagement and sustainability. Despite their potential, LLMs face notable technical and therapeutic limitations, including memory constraints, failure to guide users through a coherent set of interventions, the tendency to engage in advice-giving over inquiry, and a proclivity to demonstrate rather than teach skills. We provide key technical considerations relevant to each criterion, including using multi-agentic models, using multi-step language programming, and finding more suitable objectives for reinforcement learning. Lastly, we discuss open questions in the field of clinical psychology AI, including whether humans will interact with AI the same way they interact with other humans, how scalability can be balanced with human monitoring, given safety concerns, and how large language models might radically disrupt how psychological interventions are delivered. Only by combining insights from clinical science with a clear understanding of the technical affordances and limitations of large language models will it be possible for AI to make a meaningful impact on human psychological suffering.",

Grounded in the principles of hierarchical decomposition, information theory, and behavioral adaptation, ESTIMAT aims to bridge abstract concepts of motivation, identity, and cognitive states with measurable, actionable metrics.\n\nThe central premise of ESTIMAT is to quantify \"Moments of Peak Motivation\" (MPMs)—states of heightened engagement and alignment—using a States Metric (SM). This metric, rooted in information entropy, evaluates the adaptive potential of individuals across physical, emotional, social, and intellectual dimensions. By breaking complex cognitive states into manageable components, ESTIMAT offers a structured method for designing tasks, routines, and long-term goals that maximize both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.\n\nThis paper outlines the conceptual foundations of ESTIMAT, presents its parallels with Fermi estimation, and discusses potential applications in self-improvement, behavioral sciences, and cognitive engineering. While empirical validation is forthcoming, the framework provides a robust starting point for interdisciplinary exploration and practical application.",

          "abstract": "Most prior literature tends to examine potentially traumatic event (PTE) exposure as a cumulative risk, whereby all PTEs are assumed to have equal impact on substance use (SU) or be equally impacted by SU. However, this dubious assumption could be obscuring important differences in the PTE-SU relationship. We operationalize McLaughlin &amp; Sheridan’s (2016) dimensional model of trauma exposure to examine the impact of PTEs types on SU and SU on PTE types concurrently and prospectively. We leverage data from 11,800 community youth (ages 9-15 years old) enrolled in the nationwide, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We analyze concurrent and prospective (one year later) associations between PTE types (physical abuse, domestic violence, community violence, emotional neglect, poverty, and institutionalization/deprivation) and substance use (pooling alcohol, cannabis, or nicotine) whereby exposure to different PTE types predicts SU (self-medication), and SU predicts different PTE types (susceptibility). Concurrently, we find emotional neglect was significantly positively related to SU. Prospectively, institutionalization/deprivation, emotional neglect, and physical abuse significantly positively predicted SU and were predicted by SU. A majority of associations between PTE types and SU were accounted for by other PTE types and time-varying covariates (e.g., age, internalizing/externalizing symptoms). Emotional neglect is more likely to lead to SU and be predicted by SU than other PTE types. Findings suggest that surveillance for SU is especially warranted in youth with emotional neglect, relative to other PTEs. Future research should examine more types of PTEs along a wider age span to replicate findings.",

In addition, we discuss how calls for increased implementation of open science practices in psychological research can be reconciled with some of the challenges, concerns, and conflicts that can arise around open science practices, especially in clinical psychology. Finally, we extend open science's inclusive and collaborative stance to include \"experts by experience\" in the research process. Including our research topics in the research process is a specific facet of the open science approach in clinical psychology that has been overlooked.",

In particular, child abuse and neglect are thought to exert detrimental effects on neurocognitive development, including impairments in executive functions (EF) during childhood. We conducted a preregistered multilevel meta-analysis to examine differential associations between CM dimensions and core EF domains: working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Based on 59 studies with 13,022 participants, our results indicate a medium-sized association (g = 0.43) between overall CM and EF, although high levels of heterogeneity were observed both within and between studies. While differential outcomes as a function of EF domains may partly explain this heterogeneity, maltreatment dimensions (i.e., abuse vs. neglect) did not account for it. These findings suggest a non-specific association between CM dimensions and EF domains, potentially driven by shared attachment-related characteristics of CM.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competitive speed climbing times (2007-2019). By analyzing the dynamics of the fitted model, we are able to gain some insight into the processes that may be driving cumulative improvement in speed climbing. Innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents in the model are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

The Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE) presents the first validated scale to assess a multitude of different emotional responses (anger, contempt, enthusiasm, powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety and sorrow) to the climate crisis. This pre-registered study aimed to translate and validate the ICE in a representative German sample (N = 966). We replicated the 8-factor structure and all subscales showed acceptable to good internal consistency. Furthermore, we replicate a positive association between multiple climate emotions (powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety, sorrow) with general depressive and anxiety symptoms. We also show that climate emotions are generally positively associated with pro-environmental behavior, the only exception being climate contempt, which was negatively associated with pro-environmental behavior. In conclusion, we present a validated German translation of the ICE and provide evidence for a negative association of climate emotions and mental health as well as a positive association of climate emotions and pro-environmental behavior.",

Two general linking approaches, joint and chain linking, are examined. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare these methods under different conditions of IPD and linking designs. The first simulation study compared linking methods under conditions of sampling error and uniform IPD, with results indicating that the Haberman joint linking method performed best regarding bias and root mean square error (RMSE), especially at larger sample sizes, while the concurrent calibration method was most accurate when no IPD was present. The second simulation study expanded the analysis by introducing two additional linking designs: one relying solely on anchor items across all three time points, and the other using only adjacent items between consecutive time points. Both designs were examined under the same conditions as the first study, revealing that under no IPD conditions, the concurrent calibration method remained the most precise across both designs, while under uniform IPD conditions, the Haberman linking methods outperformed other methods, offering the best balance of bias and precision. The third study examined nonuniform IPD, where the Haberman chain linking method delivered the best overall performance in terms of both bias and RMSE. Overall, chain linking methods generally outperformed joint linking when IPD was present. Implications for the analysis of longitudinal linking designs are discussed.",

In path analyses, independent and relative contributions of genetic (polygenic scores of parents and offspring) and environmental (harsh parenting) pathways were tested. Results confirm intergenerational transmission and consistently point to genetic nurture whereby genetic predisposition predicts parental problem behavior, which in turn predicts harsh parenting, which in turn predicts offspring problem behavior, all while accounting for offspring genetic predisposition, sex and family socioeconomic position. Though these findings are surprising in light of genetic contributions to behavior, they allow for tentative considerations regarding implication for practice to break intergenerational chains of problem behavior.",

Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose leveraging a well-known cognitive bias to develop scale-invariant RL algorithms: reward range normalization. We compare a classical RL algorithm to one leveraging reward range-adaptation, finding that while the standard model’s accuracy is limited to certain reward magnitudes, the range-adapted model maintains consistent performance across all magnitudes. We next show that range-adaptation acts as autonomously adjusting the exploration rate, keeping it close to optimal for any given reward scale. Further, we show that the range-adapted model extends effectively to more complex, noisy, dynamic, and multi-step tasks.",

However, the evidence to support this has not been fully synthesised to date.

Studies employing controlled designs to compare family interventions with other interventions or standard care were included. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tools. Bayesian meta-analyses were conducted to examine changes in psychosis symptoms and functioning. \nResults: Four studies (n = 111) met inclusion criteria. All studies assessed the effectiveness of different psychoeducation-based family interventions with varying duration and intensity. The quality of the studies ranged from a moderate to a critical risk of bias. The meta-analyses showed no significant effect of family interventions on psychosis symptoms or functioning and indicated anecdotal evidence in favour of the null hypotheses. \nDiscussion: We did not find evidence of a significant benefit of family interventions on psychosis symptoms or functioning in children and adolescents with psychosis. All included studies had significant methodological issues, which may have introduced bias. These results highlight a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of family interventions in children and adolescents with psychosis, and a need for high-quality research into psychosocial treatments for early-onset psychosis.",

          "abstract": "Head motion is one of the most common sources of artefacts for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain. Especially children, being intimidated by the dimensions and the noise of the scanner, tend to move considerably during image acquisition. Thus, the use of general anaesthesia or sedation is common practice in clinical routines to avoid motion artefacts. However, general anaesthesia requires additional equipment and personnel and concerns about potential drug-related risks are increasing.\nWith this thesis, I aim to compare different methods for motion correction of MRI as alternative strategies for avoiding motion artefacts during clinical MRI examinations. I evaluate the performance of prospective and retrospective motion correction on a set of six 2D- and 3D-encoded sequences from a clinical pediatric MR protocol. For each sequence, we acquired scans with and without a predefined motion pattern in 22 healthy volunteers. I analyse and statistically compare a set of image quality\nmeasures as well as observer quality scores. Furthermore, I quantify the influence of motion correction on motion-related changes in cortical thickness estimates using a general linear model.\nIn this work, I show that for the 3D-encoded sequences, image quality considerably increases from scans without motion correction, over retrospectively to prospectively corrected scans. Selectively reacquiring slices with the highest level of motion additionally improved image quality. Furthermore, cortical thickness estimates from motion corrected scans do not correlate with motion to the same extent as observed for uncorrected scans. For three of the 2D-encoded sequences I observe higher image quality due motion correction and reacquisition compared to the clinical standard, even though the effect size varies between the different sequences. I did not observe an improvement due to motion correction in the T2* sequence, which is known to be highly sensitive to field inhomogeneities.  owever, this sequence can be substituted by an accelerated, easily repeatable sequence. My findings confirm that the use of prospective motion correction is feasible for a full clinical children's protocol, reducing motion artefacts and ensuring diagnostic image quality. As a next step in establishing motion correction in clinical routines, the developed and validated set up will be tested on a clinical pediatric population.",

In all conditions,  events which were causally or semantically central to the story were better recalled.

This study explores distinct EMS clusters in a non-clinical adult sample and examines their associations with personality traits and emotional experiences.\nMethods\nNinety-one adults (mean age 42.5) completed the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S3), Big Five Inventory (BFI), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Dispositional Positive Emotion Scales (DPES). K-means clustering identified EMS patterns, and relationships between EMS clusters, personality traits, and affective states were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, t-tests, and Spearman’s rank correlations.\nResults\nThree EMS clusters—Low, Medium, and High intensity—were found. Neuroticism varied significantly across all clusters (p &lt; .001), showing a strong positive correlation with most EMS. Entitlement/Grandiosity was uniquely uncorrelated with Neuroticism but negatively associated with Agreeableness. Within the Medium cluster, two personality types emerged, distinguished by Neuroticism and Extraversion. The High EMS cluster had significantly greater Negative Affect than the Low cluster (p = .002). Love and Pride dispositions differed across clusters (p ≤ .001), showing negative correlations with specific EMS.\nConclusions\nThis study identifies distinct EMS patterns in non-clinical adults, highlighting Neuroticism as a major factor in EMS intensity and Entitlement/Grandiosity as a unique schema with atypical personality links. The findings reveal a “Schema Continuum” in the general population, challenging the clinical/non-clinical divide.

          "abstract": "As they age, adolescents tend to prefer sleeping and waking later due to biological maturation, social and environmental factors. Higher eveningness preferences relate to risks of developing physical and mental ill-health and/or academic underachievement. To identify individuals who are more vulnerable to these negative outcomes, prior studies have mostly established percentile cutoffs scores in questionnaires of moningness-eveningness (M-E) preferences, a method that is inefficient and leads to biased estimates, and/or used linear methods, which do not consider that M-E can fit other types of distribution. We reanalyzed cross-sectional data of 1815 10-18-year-old Brazilians who filled in the most popular circadian preference scale, the M-E Scale for Children (MESC). Age/sex differences in MESC scores were analyzed using correlations, general linear models and 44 different curve fittings based on fractional polynomials and exponential data transformation. We found a very slight correlation and general linear increase in eveningness with age, but none of the 44 tested curve fit patterns reliably explained score changes across development, which were highly variable at all ages. We conclude that MESC age reference scores are of little practical value. We discuss conditions which must be combined with MESC scores to identify adolescents at risk of circadian-related problem.",

          "authors": "Conor Thornberry; Sean Commins",
          "abstract": "The concept of healthy ageing and its impact on spatial navigation and memory ability is well-established in the literature. However, the neural basis of these age-related changes is not well understood. In particular, there is limited research that examines the impact of healthy ageing on the neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory retrieval for memories encoded recently (24-hours ago) compared to those encoded remotely (1-month ago). This study attempted to explore the neural basis of recent and remote spatial memory retrieval during navigation in older adults (n = 21) compared to younger adults (n = 31) using EEG and a virtual maze task. Our results suggest that although both recent and remote memories were poorer in older compared to younger adults, older adults’ remote memories were relatively well preserved. In parallel, we showed reduced high-frequency oscillations in older adults for both recent and remote conditions compared to younger adults. Specifically, older adults showed decreased activation at 15 – 30 Hz (beta) as well as a failure to increase activation at 30 – 40 Hz (gamma) frequencies when compared to younger adults. While remote memory evoked increases in delta and theta (2 - 7 Hz) frequencies compared to recent memories in both age groups, older adults showed significantly less increase. We suggest that these differences could relate to the storage of the memories and the regions required for retrieval. The results are discussed in terms of age-related compensation for spatial navigation skills in healthy ageing.",

          "abstract": "Il narcisismo maligno è un tema frequentemente discusso in ambito relazionale, ma raramente viene considerato all'interno delle dinamiche familiari. Questo articolo si propone di colmare tale lacuna, approfondendo l'impatto devastante che il narcisismo maligno può avere sui genitori vittime di un figlio narcisista. Attraverso una combinazione di prospettive teoriche, neuroscientifiche e pratiche, il testo esplora come riconoscere i segnali distintivi del narcisismo maligno, le modalità subdole di manipolazione utilizzate dai figli narcisisti e le implicazioni psicologiche per i genitori, tra cui la dipendenza emotiva, la riduzione dell'autostima e l'isolamento sociale.\nViene inoltre presentata una distinzione fondamentale tra narcisismo sano e patologico, sottolineando il valore evolutivo di una sana autostima e fiducia in sé stessi, in contrasto con i comportamenti distruttivi che caratterizzano il narcisismo maligno. Sono analizzati i meccanismi neurali, come il sistema dopaminergico e la corteccia prefrontale, coinvolti nelle dinamiche di manipolazione e condizionamento operante, evidenziando l'impatto sul benessere psicologico e relazionale.\nInfine, l'articolo propone strategie per interrompere il ciclo di tossicità, con un focus sulla prevenzione precoce e l'intervento tempestivo, promuovendo relazioni familiari più equilibrate e responsabili. Attraverso una trattazione chiara e scientifica, l’obiettivo è fornire strumenti utili non solo per il genitore vittima, ma anche per prevenire che il figlio perpetui schemi comportamentali distruttivi in altre relazioni future.",

          "abstract": "In this study a method for detecting level stationarity in time series data based on recursive partitioning (regression trees) is examined. Recursive partitioning iteratively splits the time series into two segments with the goal of finding the most optimal difference between segment means, given certain criteria related to the length of the segments and the magnitude of the level differences. The performance of the method to recover the true transition points and the true stationary levels in simulated time series data is evaluated in terms of sensitivity analyses for different parameter settings. The performance is compared to a change point detection algorithm based on Binary Segmentation. The results show the recursive partitioning method, with an additional post-analysis adjustment which removes likely false positives, performs equally well as the change point analysis in detecting the true transition time. The recursive partitioning method appears to perform better when the estimation of the true stationary level is concerned.",

          "abstract": "The transition out of upper secondary education represents a critical life event for young adults. Research on trajectories of affective well-being during this period is limited and inconsistent. The present work investigated changes in well-being from shortly before graduating from upper secondary education to approximately one year later. The motivation for a post-school pathway, as well as perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and additionally indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics. Understanding these well-being trajectories is crucial for supporting young adults in their future decisions and improving their overall well-being.",

Specifically, low socioeconomic status (SES) negatively impacts children's intelligence quotient (IQ). Most data on this topic comes from high-inequality countries such as the United States. Here, we investigate the impact of SES on IQ and attention and how it might be mediated by early-childhood factors in 10- to 13-year-old children in Poland, a country with relatively low socioeconomic differences and medium incomes. Inhibitory attention was measured using a go/no-go task. We found that parental education significantly influenced IQ and attention. Low SES children scored on average 3 IQ points lower than high SES children and had significantly longer reaction times and d’ (discrimination accuracies). Family SES had a clear non-mediated impact on IQ, and an overall effect on attention. On the other hand, smoking/alcohol during pregnancy,  and breastfeeding, while all correlated with SES, did not modify its effects on IQ or attention. We conclude that the impact of SES on cognition is considerable even in a low-inequality country such as Poland, and in our population it cannot be explained by these early-life factors.",

          "abstract": "Operational C2 systems, as realised in military headquarters, will involve in the future a far greater diversity of knowledge domain specialists than the traditional paradigm, expanding to encompass experts in warfare and manoeuvre across non-traditional domains, emerging digital technologies, and multi-agency linkages as demanded by the increasing complexity of the cooperation-competition-conflict environment. The integration of these elements will be critical to enable timely and accurate awareness and decision making to meet the challenges and threats of an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape in which military force is but one element of national power.\nThe integration of these specialists is not without its challenges, including problems with cross-domain communication, role ambiguity and team orientation. Generalists, individuals with a broader gambit of knowledge but less depth than specialists, are frequently touted as the solution to multi-disciplinary teams. Generalists alone however lack the domain expertise to complete the same depth of tasks as specialists. Organisational theory provides a plethora of literature examining the specialist/generalist composition of an organisation, which is known as the specialist vs generalist dilemma.\nThis paper will draw upon this body of research to build on the design of a 5th Generation Headquarters, a concept previously presented in ICCRTS. Included will be a model that enriches the binary conceptualisation of generalism v specialism, to explore the broad spectrum of knowledge heterogeneity and depth. Changes in structure, staff training, and automation/autonomous technologies are discussed as possible parameters that may be modified to enhance organisational effectiveness and agility.",

We found good fit indices for a reduced three item measure of Culture, and for the full seven item measure of C2 Agility. We believe this is the first published and validated measure of C2 Agility, and therefore offers a useful and rigorous tool for the C2 community.

          "abstract": "Metacognitive monitoring plays a central role in models focusing either on monitoring strategies (models of self-regulated learning) or on monitoring judgments and their accuracy (models of metacognition). Although strategies and judgments are both concerned with monitoring one’s learning progress, they have been analyzed only independently, so far. To combine these two research perspectives, an integrative model is proposed. Two studies empirically tested the structure of metacognitive monitoring and investigated the influence of metacognitive knowledge and motivational components. The studies focused on general (Study 1, N = 396) and situation-specific (Study 2, N = 225) monitoring as well as on quantitative and qualitative aspects of monitoring (both studies). Across the two studies, monitoring one’s own learning was characterized by three separate but correlated factors: use of monitoring strategies, quality of monitoring strategies, and accuracy of monitoring judgments. Furthermore, common (metacognitive knowledge, expectancy) and specific (value) predictors of metacognitive monitoring were identified.",

This follows a classic argument by Abelson (1985). However, it has also been argued that such long-term accumulation is entirely speculative, and need not happen. Here this is shown with a simple mathematical formulation. This formulation shows that the Abelson example is in fact maximally biased towards effects accumulating, in a way that real psychological effects are unlikely to ever fulfill. Even small deviations can have large consequences for the long-term effects. Further, it is shown how under simple conditions, long-term effects may be smaller than those observed at a single timepoint. If the theoretical value of an effect lies in the long term, that effect should therefore be examined in the long term, rather than merely speculated about in the short term.",

With these multi-method, multi-informant data, we evaluated program effectiveness on the six intended outcomes (attitudes (primary outcome), global self-esteem, skills, knowledge, SDV use and victimization, and sexual risk behavior) by 1) statistically comparing self-reports between the intervention and control groups; 2) thematically analyzing interview data. We found limitations in program integrity, and mixed evidence for program effectiveness on attitudes, knowledge, skills, SDV use and sexual risk behavior, and no evidence for effectiveness on global self-esteem or SDV victimization. We also found indications of adverse effects on SDV use and victimization. We offer suggestions for program refinement and future program evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Healthcare professionals seldom receive training on neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD. An online training was co-developed to address some of the gaps in knowledge and understanding in primary care. A randomised control trial demonstrated that the training increased knowledge and confidence and improved practice.\nObjectives: This report highlights the implementation of the training in practice and follow-up 4 years post-evaluation.\nMethods: The online ADHD training comprises two modules: \"Understanding ADHD\" and \"The Role of the GP in the Care Pathway,\" each taking approximately 45 minutes to complete. The training targets general practitioners primarily but is open to other healthcare professionals and parents. Feedback was collected through a survey at the end of the training, and the training has been widely adopted by various organisations internationally and nationally. \nImplementation Results: Between December 2019 and January 2024, the \"Understanding ADHD\" module was accessed over 13,486 times, while the \"Role of the GP\" module was accessed 7,018 times, primarily by users from the US and UK. Survey results from both modules showed positive feedback with high ratings for usefulness, likelihood to inform practice, and recommendation to colleagues. Some suggestions for improvement included reducing the negative focus on ADHD consequences and incorporating more positive aspects of ADHD. \nConclusions: This ADHD online training program, despite facing implementation challenges, has seen positive outcomes, including international translation and high user ratings. Suggestions for improvement were received, but some were not feasible due to regional variations in ADHD pathways. The training's impact extended beyond GPs to other healthcare professionals, though the COVID-19 pandemic posed obstacles to dissemination efforts. Nonetheless, ongoing plans aim to expand the training's implementation globally.",

First of all, this paper analyzes from the theoretical framework of the subject perspective, and expounds that the essence of consciousness is the change of content in the perspective of the subject, which is an equivalent to the change of the structure of the entity. Then, this paper discusses the formation law of various self-organization phenomena under the framework of self-evolution theory, how all things evolved from the basic structure, and analyzes and summarizes the self-evolution entity structure of each stage. At the same time, this paper analyzes how natural selection and profit avoidance can promote the evolution of adaptive and negative feedback structure, and gradually complicate the physical structure to simulate and respond to natural changes. Then, this paper discusses how intelligence emerges in the self-evolution mechanism, then summarizes the essence of intelligence, analyzes and defines the essential characteristics of general intelligence, and analyzes the essence of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper puts forward a thought experiment to realize AGI and analyzes the future artificial intelligence society. The systematic discussion and analysis of this paper is of profound value in the rapid entry of human civilization into the stage of artificial intelligence.

          "abstract": "Early environmental adversity has lasting implications for multiple psychosocial outcomes, including externalizing psychopathology and substance use initiation. Little prior research has taken a multidimensional approach to conceptualizing environmental adversity, its relationship to externalizing psychopathology, and how together they may predict substance use initiation. This study examined how dimensional measures of financial hardship, neighborhood disadvantage, family conflict, and cumulative trauma predicted Substance Use Initiation (SUI) by age 15 in a subsample of substance use naive individuals from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 3,811). SUI was defined as a single dose or more of any substance (alcohol, nicotine/tobacco, cannabis, other illicit substances, etc.) and was coded as a dichotomous categorical variable. An Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted to create latent variables of family conflict, economic deprivation, and neighborhood disadvantage. A sum score of adverse events from the KSADS PTSD scale was used to measure trauma. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine whether measures of environmental adversity predicted SUI, and test whether symptoms of psychopathology mediated that association. After controlling for sex and age, only economic deprivation at the family level and externalizing symptoms were significant predictors of SUI. Our results also supported an indirect mediation pathway in which family conflict impacted SUI indirectly through its association with externalizing symptoms. These findings may help improve public health efforts for substance use prevention by identifying environmental pathways to adolescent SUI.",

          "abstract": "Pavlovian threat acquisition and extinction are fundamental processes by which individuals learn about threat and safety in their environment. Research has shown that humans learn more rapidly and persistently to associate threatening and—somewhat counterintuitively— positive rewarding stimuli with aversive events, beyond their inherent threat value. However, the computational mechanisms underlying these Pavlovian learning biases remain unclear. Here, I examined the affective and computational determinants of Pavlovian threat acquisition and extinction biases for threat-related and positive emotional stimuli. I combined and reanalyzed data from four experiments (N = 247) using a differential Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm. Computational modeling techniques were applied to identify signatures of these learning biases. Threat-relevant (angry faces, snakes), positive-relevant (baby faces, happy faces, erotic stimuli), and neutral (neutral faces, colored squares) stimuli were used as conditioned stimuli, with skin conductance response serving as an index of learning. Model comparison indicated that a reinforcement-learning model differentiating between excitatory (e.g., learning from reinforcement) and inhibitory (e.g., learning from the absence of reinforcement) learning was the best explanatory model for the observed data. Whereas no evidence for differences in excitatory learning rates was found between stimulus categories, both threat- and positive-relevant stimuli exhibited a lower inhibitory learning rate compared to neutral stimuli, contributing to the persistence of the conditioned response during extinction. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying Pavlovian threat extinction biases, thereby advancing our understanding of how humans attribute and update affective value to their environment.",

          "title": "Tackling Traditional: Tamil Gender Ideologies and their Socioeconomic Correlates",
          "authors": "Keera Allendorf; Susan Short; Nancy Luke; Hongwei Xu",
          "abstract": "Modernization theory posed gender ideology as a unidimensional continuum ranging from “traditional” to egalitarian with egalitarianism increasing as societies progress. Recent research replaces a unidimensional view with multidimensionality, but other modernization remnants remain. We tackle such remnants by examining gender ideologies and their socioeconomic correlates in Tamil Nadu, an Indian context often labeled “traditional.” Using latent class analysis of 10 gender attitudes from the South Indian Community Health Study (SICHS), we identify six gender ideologies. Two ideologies are consistently egalitarian or essentialist, two are mixed, and two are characterized by ambivalent agreement. Attitudes toward mobility are a crucial divider; moderate support for equal mobility distinguishes “consistent egalitarians” from “seclusionist egalitarians” and “agreeable seclusionists” from the “highly agreeable.” These agreeable ideologies likely reflect acquiescence bias, but may also signal polite resistance to feminist scripts. The gender ideologies are correlated with gender, religion, and education, but have little to no association with caste, age, and class. These findings extend the multidimensionality of gender ideology to an Indian context and hint at the power of global and local cultural scripts. More broadly, they demonstrate the value – and challenges – of building a more global understanding of gender ideology freer of modernization remnants.",

Our research focuses on the concept of employee green behaviors (EGB) and seeks to empirically validate a set of EGB items derived from the Green Five Taxonomy. Through three surveys of full-time office workers in Poland (Ntotal = 2,985), the study identifies six distinct categories of EGB: reducing, recycling, reusing, prioritizing environmental concerns, counterproductive green behavior, and other behaviors beyond the 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) framework. These findings refine the initial taxonomy and offer a consolidated measurement tool.",

          "authors": "Mireia Triguero Roura",
          "abstract": "Research on national identity in Western Europe and the United States has found that people in these countries de-emphasize the ethnic components of national membership, such as having ancestry in the country, and favor civic components such as political participation. However, sociologists whose research center immigrants' experiences in these countries find that they are never fully perceived as \"national\" because of their ancestry. Using a pre-registered, nationally representative, novel conjoint experiment fielded in 5 different countries, I find that natives' understanding of who belongs in the nation might be understood as \"colorblind ethnocentrism\": while people espouse civic normative understandings of the nation, they draw symbolic boundaries of national belonging based on ancestry. Moreover, when respondents do express a normative preference for ancestry in survey measures, it translates to a revealed preference for white and Christian members of the nation. Finally, in Europe (outside the UK), people imagine the nation as White, while this is not the case in the US and the UK overall. These findings help us understand why nativist discourse can easily take hold in liberal democracies, despite people's explicit disavowal of such discourse.",

          "authors": "Frédéric Gimello-Mesplomb",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the evolution of French film policy from early cinema to the present, examining the complex interactions between state intervention, cultural production, and artistic creativity. Through a comprehensive historical analysis, the study traces the development of a unique French model of cinema support, characterized by robust state involvement, selective funding mechanisms, and a commitment to cultural diversity. The research demonstrates how the French state has progressively transformed its approach to cinema, from initial regulatory and taxation strategies to sophisticated support systems like the ‘Avance sur Recettes’ (Advance on Receipts). Key turning points include the Blum-Byrnes agreements of 1948, Jack Lang's cultural policies in the 1980s, and the ongoing challenges posed by digital technologies and global streaming platforms in the 2000s. The analysis reveals the tension between commercial imperatives and artistic quality, highlighting how state interventions have sought to preserve a distinctive French cinematic identity. By examining policy documents, parliamentary reports, and critical debates, the paper illuminates the complex negotiations between economic sustainability, cultural expression, and national prestige in French film policy. Ultimately, regarding the recent France 2030 Plan, the study argues that French cinema policy represents a unique model of cultural intervention, balancing economic pragmatism with a profound commitment to artistic innovation and cultural sovereignty.",

          "abstract": "Previous research raises the possibility that exposing young people to  videos from social media content creators that promote evidence-based mental health information may improve mental health outcomes. While previous field experimental research has increased the supply of evidence-based information on a platform like TikTok, less work considers how exposure to that information might influence mental health outcomes. In a large (N = 1,000) and demographically representative survey of young people in the US aged 14-22, we report the results of a pre-registered survey experiment that assesses the effects of evidence-based messaging on perceived and objective emotional support competencies. Our “creator-engaged” approach partnered with a TikTok influencer to create realistic control (pre-evidence-based content training) and treatment (post-training) videos that hold many design elements constant. We find that treatment exposure significantly increases both perceived and objective abilities to provide emotional support. Our results suggest that creator partnership programs can promote positive mental health outcomes on platforms like TikTok.",

          "authors": "Emil Kamalov; Ivetta Sergeeva",
          "abstract": "Autocrats often use legal repression to criminalize opposition organizations, targeting both domestic and exile groups to suppress dissent. While such measures may weaken cooperation with these organizations domestically, these organizations can simultaneously gain increased support from migrant communities. This study explores whether autocrats achieve their intended outcomes by legally repressing exile organizations through criminalization. Utilizing a conjoint experiment with 5,996 Russian emigrants residing in 89 countries who left their homeland following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, we investigate how attributes such as criminalization, anonymity of donations, and transparency influence their cooperation with exile organizations in a geopolitically shaped environment.\n\n\n\nOur findings show that criminalization can backfire: Russian exiles perceive it as a marker of political authenticity and effectiveness, providing crucial cues in an environment with limited information and fostering solidarity. Consequently, criminalization can facilitate collective action and the coordination of extraterritorial opposition, signaling which organizations are genuinely committed to opposing the regime. However, geopolitical alliances matter, as cooperation is hindered where perceived risks are high, particularly in host countries allied with the autocrat. Technological solutions, such as anonymous donations, significantly mitigate these risks and boost support, while transparency is key to engaging the most politically active donors. This study contributes to understanding the limits of autocratic transnational control and demonstrates how exile organizations can leverage low-cost measures to foster diaspora’s resilience and address problems of collective action and coordination.",

          "authors": "Sophie Morosoli; Kimon Kieslich; Valeria Resendez; Max van Drunen",
          "abstract": "AI-based technologies are having an increasing impact on society, which naturally raises the question of how this technology will be addressed politically. Thereby, political actors have a dual role to play: They can provide investment to enhance the efficiency and usage of these systems in different societal areas while also bearing the responsibility of safeguarding citizens from potential harm. Hereby, the degree of politicization of the topic, i.e. if a topic is part of the public and political debate, has an immense influence on the political approach to tackle the issue. The more a topic is politicized, the more urgency political parties experience to develop concrete governance approaches. Yet, existing research has not analysed party programs in terms of both discourse around artificial intelligence and policy recommendations within an election context. This study focuses on the Netherlands and considers and provides an empirical analysis to answer the following question: How do parties discuss AI in their political programs for the 2023 election in the Netherlands? We conducted a manual content analysis of all party manifestos for the 2023 elections in the Netherlands. Our analysis shows that most parties are not laying a big emphasis on AI. And if so, most of the policy proposals are rather reactive to issues that happened in the past rather than taking a prospective governance approach. We critically discuss the low level of politicisation of AI with a focus on practical governance issues that emerge as a result.",

          "authors": "Maneesha Perera; Rajith Vidanaarachchi; Sangeetha Chandrashekeran; Melissa Kennedy; Brendan Kennedy; Saman Halgamuge",
          "abstract": "This systematic literature review addresses the intersection of two rapidly evolving areas of knowledge and practice: Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). There is growing scholarly recognition of the rich and diverse nature of IKS, which are unique intergenerational understandings of worldly relations from an Indigenous standpoint. There is now a vast literature on the promise and pitfalls of AI. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews showing how these two dynamic literatures are intersecting, and what the major themes are. AI has the potential to assist the promotion of IKS; however, there are also potential risks arising from AI for Indigenous peoples, such as the erosion of cultural knowledge, and data-grabbing that fails to respect principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These risks can exacerbate existing knowledge hierarchies and socio-economic inequalities. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2023 (January) on Indigenous peoples and AI. We shed light upon four unique overlapping categories into which existing literature can be classified and comprehensively discuss literature under each category. The first two categories discuss AI’s role in assisting the promotion of IKS and the third focuses on the pitfalls of using AI for Indigenous peoples. The final category discusses how IKS itself can enrich the development of AI. We further identify several gaps in the literature and highlight avenues requiring attention on AI’s role with Indigenous peoples and their knowledge systems.",

          "abstract": "In the context of environmental challenges and overreliance on technology, the current study explores how environmental communication (EC) research tackles sustainable development, public engagement, and critiques infinite economic growth and technological dependence. Accordingly, this study is guided by the question: How has EC research evolved in engaging with sustainable development, public involvement and critiquing infinite economic growth and technological triumphalism?  Guided by the question of how EC research has developed over time, this analysis particularly focuses on three distinct time periods—1967-2000, 2001-2015, and 2016-2021—to accurately trace the progression and shifts in the field.  A comprehensive bibliometric analysis, utilizing Python scripting for keyword co-occurrence network diagrams was used to ensure a rigorous examination of the literature. The study's findings highlight the crucial roles of sustainable development, public education, and engagement in EC research, emphasizing the need for an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the intricate interplay between environmental, social, technological, and political factors. This research contributes to advancing EC by advocating for more comprehensive, inclusive, and action-oriented approaches, paving the way for more effective communication strategies and better environmental outcomes.",

          "abstract": "An implementation of the journal club model to develop confidence in academic skills across speaking, writing and integrity domains, as well as socialising journal club members to academia, is reported. A journal club was established in a Foundation Year (Pre-undergraduate) context for ten physical scientists. A mixed-methods approach was used to measure self-reported confidence upon entering the university, which was contrasted after attending three, one-hour, journal club meetings, where contemporary literature across diverse subjects was discussed through the lens of ‘academic themes’ to scaffold discussions and support specific skill development. The self-reported confidence was captured through questionnaires and unpacked through semi-structured interviews, the themes of which were generated through qualitative reflexive analysis. Increased confidence in academic speaking was a notable result; journal club members valued the opportunity to present in small, regular, and informal meetings where discussions were appreciated between members. Exposure to subject domains outside of physical sciences where members were confronted with topics for which there is no clear answer, was uncovered as the impetus to disrupt members’ thinking, facilitated by the conversational medium of the journal club. The implementation reported here likely represents the scenario many professionals will find themselves in when considering establishing a journal club.",

          "abstract": "There is consensus that algorithmic news recommenders should be explainable to inform news readers of potential risks. However, debates continue over which information users need and which stakeholders should access this information. As the debate continues, researchers also call for more control over algorithmic news recommenders' systems, for example by turning off personalized recommendations. Despite this call, it is unclear the extent to which news readers will use this feature. To add nuance to the discussion, we analyzed 586 responses to two open-ended questions: I) what information needs to contribute to trustworthiness perceptions of new recommendations, and ii) whether people want the ability to turn off personalization. Our results indicate that most participants found knowing the sources of news items important for trusting a recommendation system. Additionally, more than half of the participants were inclined to disable personalization. The most common reasons to turn off personalization included concerns about bias or filter bubbles and a preference to consume generalized news. These findings suggest that news readers have different information needs for explanations when interacting with an algorithmic news recommender and that many news readers prefer to disable the usage of personalized news recommendations.",

This crisis is compounded by the lack of a comprehensive, up-to-date directory of local news outlets, hindering research and policy interventions. Existing directories are often incomplete, outdated, and fail to capture the diversity of the local media landscape. To address this, the Public Interest News Foundation (PINF) has developed a semi-automated system leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT) and computational workflows to maintain a comprehensive and current directory of local news outlets across print, digital, radio, and television in the UK. This system tracks closures, launches, ownership changes, and geographic coverage. Notable events are flagged for manual review. This research and review pipeline, combining computational analysis with human review, significantly reduces manual labor while enhancing data accuracy. Overall, the system offers a model for future initiatives aimed at tracking the health of local news ecosystems. The implications of this system for media pluralism, policy interventions, and the sustainability of local journalism are discussed, alongside suggestions for future research.",

          "abstract": "This study highlights how better demographic measurement more accurately informs public policymakers. In this era of renewed and more vigorous efforts to clear people experiencing unsheltered homelessness (unsheltered PEH) from city sidewalks, parks, and elsewhere, elected officials and other stakeholders need to clearly understand the dynamics of their unsheltered PEH populations. To advance understanding, this study investigated in-migration of unsheltered PEH in conjunction with the Los Angeles Continuum of Care’s 2024 HUD-mandated Point-in-Time count. In response to the measurement work of Mitchell (2024), the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s 2024 Demographic Survey of unsheltered PEH instrument included a new item distinguishing between perceptions of a place where one has lived versus stayed, which revealed whether in-migration of individuals and families coming to the area immediately experienced homelessness or became unhoused after relocation. This analysis of over one-thousand survey participants self-identified as having migrated into Los Angeles County (a quarter of the total sample of unsheltered PEH) also explored whether there were associations with first-time homelessness or with being accompanied by household members. Responses to this complex survey were analyzed using Stata 17 MP. Key findings include that most survey participants reported either arriving homeless and unsheltered or first staying in either their own or a friend’s or family member’s home. More than half of all in-migration was initially to housed situations (more so for first-time homelessness), not into homelessness. Lone adults were more likely to experience homelessness immediately while accompanied adults were most likely to first stay in someone else’s home.",

Focusing on Finland, which has a successful ethno-linguistic minority party (the Swedish People's Party) and an electoral system with a personalized vote, we analyze how ethnic markers such as party affiliation, home language and candidate names influence voter decisions. Using a conjoint survey experiment conducted in May 2024 among Swedish-speaking Finnish citizens, we assessed the importance of various ethnic attributes on candidate choice. The findings reveal that while multiple ethnic markers affect candidate choice, the most significant factor is whether a candidate is nominated by an ethnic party. This research contributes to the broader understanding of ethnic voting dynamics in diverse electoral contexts.",

          "authors": "Selim Tan",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes the authenticity of the music and the musicianship behind Suno, an artificial intelligence (AI) music generator. The developers launched Suno’s initial release on December 20, 2023, and the latest version, v4, on November 19, 2024. Behind this digital platform are AI experts and musicians based in Cambridge, MA. Suno does not participate in conventional composing, songwriting, performing, or recording practices. Instead, it generates music based on user prompts in a text/audio/image/video-to-music interface. Suno aims to democratize music production by enabling anyone to become a “musician.” However, the absence of a conventional “real” artist or author (auteur) responsible for these music productions raises questions about how various agents will perceive the music’s authenticity. Through observations and conceptual reflections, this paper explores the possibilities of authenticating Suno’s productions, their implications for music scenes, and the potentially changing nature of musicianship. Finally, this paper argues that AI-based music can achieve authenticity without conventional musicianship, allowing for the emergence of a new, albeit contested, form of musicianship.",

          "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising opportunity for how we\nanalyze text and, by extension, can study the role of culture and symbolic meanings in social\nlife.

We also discuss broader applications of LLMs in cultural sociology,\nsuch as investigations on established concepts (e.g., cultural consecration) and emerging\nconcepts (e.g., future-oriented deliberation). This discussion underscores that AI-tools can\nsignificantly augment the empirical scope of research projects, building on rather than\nreplacing traditional qualitative approaches.

          "abstract": "This study investigates whether higher education—often regarded as an equalizing force that reduces group inequalities—can effectively address gender wage gaps. Despite the narrowing of gender disparities in access to higher education in Korea, this study examines whether obtaining a university degree reduces gender wage inequality. It focuses on the effects of college selectivity and field of study, analyzing how horizontal stratification in higher education influences the gender wage gap in the early labor market. Furthermore, it compares results from traditional linear regression with debiased machine learning, which accounts for selection bias and high-dimensional data.\nUsing data from the Graduate Occupational Mobility Survey (GOMS), the analysis reveals that linear regression estimates a consistent gender wage gap of roughly 10% across all levels of higher education. In contrast, double machine learning identifies a 15% wage gap for graduates of two-year colleges and around 10% for those with four-year degrees. By field of study, linear regression reports consistent gaps, while double machine learning identifies a 6% gap in the humanities, 10-12% in education, natural sciences, and social sciences, and 14% in engineering. This study underscores that accounting for selection bias and high-dimensional data reveals nuanced insights, uncovering significant gender wage gaps among two-year college graduates and notably larger gaps in engineering compared to other fields.",

          "abstract": "Historical estimates of the total fertility rate (TFR) are relatively uncommon, owing to the onerous data requirements for direct calculation and the lack of digitized records. Recent advancements in indirect fertility estimation 1 allow for estimation of TFR using data as minimal as a population pyramid – relatively common data in historical contexts through census records and population registers. Here we use published data on the age structure of Roman Egypt circa AD 12 to AD 259 2 to estimate TFR and 90%ile credible interval in an ancient time period and place using a Bayesian approach. Furthermore, the population data is separated by urban and rural areas, allowing for an unprecedented glimpse into ancient fertility levels. We find that ancient Roman Egyptian women in urban areas had considerably lower fertility than women in rural areas -- urban TFR: 3.37 [2.26 – 4.55], and rural TFR: 8.57 [6.01 – 11.25]. Our findings suggest that the modern day urban/rural fertility differential dates back nearly 2000 years. As demonstrated here, the advancements in indirect estimation could be deployed to better understand historical and ancient fertility regimes, shedding light on societies far before the existence of modern vital statistics systems.",

          "abstract": "Rarely are those most impacted by climate change the same as those most responsible for global carbon emissions. Assignment of responsibility for carbon emissions typically differentiates emissions across space and time but not birth cohort. Including young birth cohorts complicates assessments as they have yet to emit as much as older cohorts. Using formal demographic methods, we develop an approach to estimate carbon emissions across space, across time, and across the life course, creating a unified carbon emissions identity, comparable to other well-known carbon identities. We estimate the birth cohorts born between 1850 and 2020 with the highest lifetime carbon emissions. We show that globally, cohorts born between 1970 and 1990 have the highest lifetime emissions under a moderate carbon emissions pathway and those born since 2000 under a high emissions pathway. Our results suggest that carbon emissions pathways play the strongest role in determining which cohorts will be associated with the highest lifetime carbon emissions, with lower pathways suggesting earlier cohorts and higher pathways suggesting later cohorts.",

We investigate differences in the structure of these bipartite networks using exponential random graph models, distributions of network statistics, and comparisons between the collapsed single-mode actor and event networks. Using these tools, we make estimates of influence and structural features that predict the probability of edge formation, highlighting patterns that contribute to the understanding of the structural dynamics of the edtech market, the key players driving its evolution, and the way each respond to exogenous shocks in the educational space.",

These contemporary theories highlight how various organizational factors affect individual and organizational performance, change, innovation, wellbeing, and inequality. In organizational theory, structure focuses on formal elements like rules, roles, routines, and rewards while culture refers to informal elements like climate, identity, and sensemaking. Relations refer to effects of interpersonal and interorganizational networks while institutions refer to norms that influence isomorphism and dynamism. Professions feature psychological factors affecting performance and sociological factors shaping work and occupations. Transformation refers to episodic and continuous changes while social conflict foregrounds power, inequalities, and competition over resources. I map how these perspectives are connected with each other and also suggest future directions in the field by intersecting organizational theory with studies of new technologies, historic organizations, global interconnections, marginalized populations, political institutions, and larger societal consequences.",

          "abstract": "The increasing share of women achieving higher education in the second half of the twentieth century in Western countries has led to changes in the educational distribution of couples in the population. The consequences of the educational expansion for health, and especially mortality, have not received enough attention. We use Finnish full population register data and focus on married and cohabiting couples in 1987–2020, born up to 1970, to examine how the partner’s education is associated with individual-level mortality risk. Accelerated failure time models show that the individual and the partner’s educational level significantly relate to individuals' death risk. Overall, the higher the education level of both an individual and their partner, the lower the individual's mortality rate (p&lt;0.05), with men presenting stronger associations than those of women. Additionally, the type of couple to which individuals belong has a distinct association with their mortality. Homogamous highly-educated couples have the highest survival advantage, while low-educated couples have the greatest disadvantage. Heterogamous couples, where one partner is low-educated and another highly educated, are in between. These results are similar for marriage and cohabitation, and across cohorts. The latter finding highlights the importance of both men’s and women’s education for mortality outcomes. While both men and women show these trends, women present much lower differences in mortality than men. These results indicate that there is a clear resource multiplication mechanism influencing the relationship between partners' education and mortality for men, while for women, the mechanisms seem to fall between resource multiplication and substitution. Consequently, low-educated men partnered with low-educated women emerge as the most vulnerable group in terms of mortality risk.",

This study estimates and decomposes this elasticity using data from Japan’s largest private job-matching intermediary. On average, our findings reveal that recruitment elasticity is not significantly different from zero. However, this average masks important heterogeneity: workers earning above the median wage exhibit positive elasticity, while those earning below the median show an insignificant but negative elasticity. Further analysis suggests that the negative elasticity among lower-wage workers stems from their reluctance to inquire about higher-wage vacancies. Additionally, we uncover several notable patterns: there are minimal systematic differences in elasticity between on-the-job and off-the-job searches; workers tend to choose similar job types and locations during the inquiry and application stages; and the matched wage is largely determined by the lower bound of the posted wage range.",

We found a direct association between supervisory procedural justice and organizational citizenship behavior, and an indirect association between organizational justice and organizational citizenship behavior, through mental wellbeing. These findings suggest that while prison officers directly reciprocate the fair treatment received by supervisors by engaging in discretionary actions benefiting the organization, fair treatment by the organization has more of an indirect effect via influencing officer wellbeing. Our results highlight the importance of both supervisors and organizations treating their staff with procedural justice; not only does fair treatment increase mental wellbeing, but it encourages behaviors that extend beyond formal job requirements. Cultivating such behaviors among new prison officers may ultimately improve practices, cultures, and outcomes for people in custody within prisons.",

Despite its shared understanding as beneficial resources available from the connections between people, authors vary widely in their conceptualizations of social capital. To extract clarity from these disparate perspectives, we offer a systematic framework for conceptualizing social capital, which identifies three primary theoretical dimensions of scholars’ conceptualizations of social capital: (1) where beneficial resources reside, ranging from within individuals to the relationships between individuals, (2) beneficial network structure, differentiating closure from brokerage arrangements, and (3) the level to which rewards accrue, distinguishing individual from collective benefits. We illustrate how combining these dimensions produces a unifying perspective that fosters reintegrating social capital’s disconnected conceptualizations. Finally, we draw on this framework to both reconcile seeming contradictions and gaps in social capital scholarship and provide a principled means for prioritizing questions for future developments of social capital.",

The paper reconstructs long-term trends in wealth inequality for the period 1550-1800 for a sample of communities in the region Apulia and produces estimates of overall inequality levels across the region. These estimates are compared with those which have recently been published for other Italian and European regions or states. The article also reconstructs the total income distribution for the mid-eighteenth century, then comparing wealth and income inequality. Overall, the evidence for the Kingdom of Naples suggests a tendency for economic inequality to grow continuously over the early modern period. As this was mostly a period of economic stagnation or decline for the Kingdom, the article provides further insights to the debate on the long-run relationship between economic growth and inequality change.

This study explores local perceptions of common pool resource management in the Tana River using vignettes characterising hypothetical rivers with declining or sustainable fish stock levels. Participants were asked about ideal catch redistribution levels, beliefs about actual contributions, and factors necessary for successful common pool resource management. An allocation game was also played to measure actual cooperation. The results show that while participants believe around 35-50% of the catch should be redistributed, they expect actual contributions to be lower at 15-30%. In the allocation game, the modal proportion that participants gave away was 0% of the stake. Participants also rated the likelihood of various outcomes if a common storage facility was introduced, with those from Karasjok having a more pessimistic outlook than those from Tana. Substantial agreement was found for monitoring, shared traditions, and co-management in both municipalities. Almost all participants indicated disagreements over river use, with tourism and specific fishing gear being the main points of contention. The study discusses the role of traditional ecological knowledge in management, highlighting the limitations of traditional ecological knowledge when designing effective conservation schemes.",

          "abstract": "This paper uses survey data from Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain and the United States to analyze how inheritances impact wealth inequality in a range of rich countries. Adopting an influence function regression approach, the paper calculates the counterfactual effects of small increases in the share of recipients of different-sized wealth transfers in each country. Results suggest that while a marginal increase in inheritance recipients generally contracts wealth inequality measures – confirming a common finding in the literature that inter-generational transfers tend to reduce relative wealth inequality – an increase in recipients of ‘large’ inheritances has the opposite effect. We determine what ‘large’ means in this context by point-estimating the thresholds above which transfers become disequalising. Such thresholds are then put in perspective against the inheritance tax schedules in place in the six countries analyzed. No unique pattern emerges. While the thresholds are very close to tax exemption thresholds in Britain and Germany, they are somewhat higher in France and Spain and they are much lower in Italy and the United States.

          "abstract": "This study explores the effectiveness of Germany’s rent control regulation in the context of Munich's housing crisis. The rent brake, aimed at preventing excessive rents in tense housing markets, was implemented in 2015 in Germany but has faced challenges in practical application. This research evaluates the number of tenants eligible to use the rent brake, investigates how eligibility of the rent break varies depending on housing conditions and landlord types and identifies factors hindering its application.\nA sample of 10,000 individuals from Munich's registration database, covering residents who moved after 2019, was drawn, resulting in 356 complete responses for analysis. The survey assessed demographics, rental conditions, and knowledge of the rent brake, with findings weighted by city district and household size.\nThe study reveals that while 13% minimum and up to 38% of tenants could potentially apply the rent brake, only 2% of respondents had successfully secured a rent reduction. This low uptake is attributed to limited awareness—only 38% of participants knew about the rent brake—and fears of landlord retaliation, such as potential termination or strained relationships. The study concludes that the tenant-dependent enforcement undermines the effectiveness of the rent breake. Enhanced information access, tenant support systems, and institutional measures are needed to strengthen the regulation's impact and promote fair housing practices.",

Specifically, we used a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the treatment effect of CLS on care provision, reviews, and expenditure, using the Short and Long Term (SALT) dataset published by NHS Digital (2016 to 2021). Within local authorities that implemented CLS, we found evidence of changing care pathways for new clients, including a ten percentage-point reduction in funded care provision – though evidence for increased signposting to alternative services in this dataset was mixed. For existing clients, we found evidence of general improvements in the quality of practice, as indicated by higher ratios of planned to unplanned care reviews. These improvements were also realised without concomitant increases in expenditure rates. We believe these results can contribute toward an evidence base for CLS, and for strengths-based practice more generally.",

          "authors": "Darshan Vigneswaran",
          "abstract": "Around the world, a growing number of governments, private companies, and international organizations are actively working to establish a sustained human presence in outer space. Despite the growing importance of CES in both policy and academic debates, empirical data necessary for studying this sector remain fragmented and inconsistent. To address this gap, this article introduces the Crewed Exploration and Settlement Database. This tool is designed to enhance the empirical depth and methodological rigor of the social scientific study of crewed exploration and settlement.",

          "authors": "Thierry Rossier; Jacob Aagaard Lunding",
          "abstract": "In this article we delve into the elites’ evolving forms of power to study the relationship between social change and capital accumulation. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the field of power and relying on the identification of the field’s effective agents in Switzerland, we investigate the changing relations among the most important forms of capital. We use prosopographical data spanning six historical periods from 1910 to 2015 and thanks to multiple correspondence analysis we uncover the changing structure of the field of power. We show the dominance of economic and organisational network powers throughout history. While both forms of power opposed before World War 2, they could be accumulated together between the 1950s and the 1980s but opposed again in the recent period. The article contributes to 'big picture' sociology, offering historical accounts of broad social trends and provides evidence of a recent return to past inequality logics.",

          "title": "The Social Stratification of the Effect of Parental Investment on Grit: A Case of South Korea",
          "authors": "Eugene Hwang",
          "abstract": "Theory and empirical evidence suggest that parents often allocate their investments unevenly among their children, resulting in disparities within families. This study explores two key questions: (1) Do parents reinforce or compensate for differences in their children’s grit, a critical indicator of socioemotional development? and (2) Do these parental responses vary according to family socioeconomic status (SES)? Drawing on data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey, this study examines cohorts of elementary (4th grade) and middle (7th grade) school students to shed light on the mechanisms that perpetuate inequalities in socioemotional skills within a society characterized by intense educational competition.\nThe sibling fixed-effects models reveal three key findings. First, parental investment in children’s socioemotional development predominantly takes the form of reinforcement rather than compensation. Second, reinforcing parenting behaviors are more pronounced among middle-school children than elementary-school children, reflecting shifts in parental strategies during adolescence. Third, these reinforcement patterns are more prevalent in high-SES families, particularly those with highly educated parents. These findings highlight the role of family background in shaping access to socioemotional resources and have significant implications for understanding the reproduction of inequality through educational and developmental pathways.",

          "abstract": "Korea's rapid economic development has positioned it as a key player in Asia's economy and globally, albeit with significant environmental and societal consequences. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), serving as a buffer between North and South Korea, holds immense historical, cultural, and ecological value and conservation and transformation potential. This study presents visioning-based exploration of ecologically diverse and peaceful futures of the Korean peninsula with its DMZ as a potential global commons. Through a visioning workshop, stakeholders used the Nature Futures Framework and Seeds of Good Anthropocene to develop four visions that reflect diverse value and meanings of nature for sustainable and wellbeing-oriented futures. The co-developed visions emphasize the importance of harmonizing human activities with nature, envisioning the DMZ as a space for peaceful coexistence and ecological restoration. They offer citizens’ perspectives on sustainable and inclusive futures with existing initiatives as levers and inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary collaboration as mediums. This visioning highlights the role of science-policy-society interface, diverse stakeholder engagement, integration of history and culture, and convergence of ideas across generations. This paper reflects on the lessons from this process and the implications for the future development of scenarios that can identify policy options and societal transformations to catalyse nature-positive futures in Korea and beyond.",

          "authors": "Matthew Chima Amadi; JOHN CHIWUZULUM ODOZI",
          "abstract": "The increasing flow of remittances and the growth of Nigeria's diaspora population are attracting policy discussions and debates. Many scholars view the mobilization of remittances as a more resilient channel for development financing compared to other traditional sources.  The study explores the role of remittances in economic growth and the financial development pathway empirically. We used autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and Granger causality techniques and time series data covering the period from 1996 to 2020. From the table, we found a statistically significant negative long-run relationship between remittances and economic growth.  However, in the short run, a significant positive relationship was found to exist between remittances and financial development reflecting a complementary relationship. Our findings also showed that foreign direct investment (FDI) and gross domestic formation(GCF) were statistically significant in their relationship with financial development in the long run. From the  pairwise Granger test, a unidirectional causality from remittance inflows (Rem) to financial development was established while bidirectional causality between foreign direct investment (FDI) and gross capital formation (GCF). The study concludes that a certain degree of financial development might stifle long-term economic progress, and the combined effect of financial development and remittances should be of concern to policymakers. Given the study's finding of a negative contribution of remittances to economic growth in the long run, a significant policy consequence is that efforts to encourage remittances and those to improve the financial system should be undertaken concurrently.",
