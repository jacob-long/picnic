          "authors": "Isabella Simone Bower; Jaclyn Broadbent; Scott Coussens; Peter Gregory Enticott",
          "abstract": "Examinations are a widely used assessment method in higher education. They are often conducted in large indoor environments that can accommodate high numbers of students to maximize scheduling and cost efficiency. Recent evidence, however, suggests enlarged room scale impacts brain activity that is associated with concentration, which could negatively impact cognitive performance. We analysed data (N=15,400) from undergraduate students over eight years across three campuses at an Australian tertiary institution. Using linear mixed models, we compared examination performance across different room scales, while accounting for coursework performance, and other variables. We found some evidence that student examination performance was worse in rooms with elevated ceiling heights, but additional modelling indicated a more complex relationship (where ceiling height might be linked to improved performance). These results provide tentative support for the notion that built environment scale influences cognitive performance, and suggest caution in conducting examinations in large scale, high-ceiling rooms.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discriminate speech with background noise decreases with age. This study examined the effect of masker type and spatial location in older and young adults. Using Portable Automated Rapid Testing software on an iPad, participants were asked to understand target speech (always simulated at 0° azimuth) in the presence of speech or ‘garbled speech’ maskers (simulated from 0°, 6°, or 45° azimuth spatial locations). Additionally, suprathreshold sensitivities to temporal (TM), spectral (SM), and spectrotemporal (STM) modulation as well as binaural temporal fine structure (TFS) were estimated. Older adults showed worse speech in competition (SiC) performance with 6° and 45°, but not 0°, masker spatial locations and benefited less from only 45° of spatial separation compared to young controls for speech masking. For garbled-speech masking, older adults showed worse performance overall, but benefited similarly from spatial separation compared to young controls. Older adults also showed worse sensitivity for binaural TFS, but comparable TM, SM, and STM sensitivity. Age as well as TM and SM sensitivities predicted SiC performance, whereas STM and binaural TFS sensitivities did not. These findings expand our knowledge of how aging affects SiC comprehension and provide insight into training programs to improve older adults’ SiC performance.",

          "authors": "Yong Min Choi; Tzu-Yao Chiu; Jake Ferreira; Julie Golomb",
          "abstract": "How is visual stability maintained across saccades? One theory poses the visual system assumes the external world as stable unless there is extreme evidence against it. As support, prior studies demonstrated a “blanking effect”. However, there remains a considerable gap between these findings discovered with impoverished sparse stimuli and understanding trans-saccadic stability in naturalistic scenes. Here we tested 19 adult observers in a blanking paradigm with naturalistic scene images: AI-generated “scene wheel” stimuli that varied in a continuous and quantifiable manner. Psychometric modeling revealed that inserting a brief blank screen during a saccade increased sensitivity to trans-saccadic scene changes and decreased the stability bias. These effects occurred only when observers made actual eye movements, but not when eye movements were simulated with retinal image shifts. These findings demonstrate that trans-saccadic memory of complex scenes and an overarching stability assumption work in tandem to achieve stable perceptual experience in natural environments.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the importance of estimating demographic biases in research has become apparent. Here we provide a systematic review of the CHILDES database, the major source of naturalistic recordings of children’s linguistic environment. We analyzed the database according to four dimensions considered central to language learning: SES, urbanization, family structure, and language. We present descriptive statistics of each dimension to assess whether naturalistic recordings were biased regarding the demographics of the countries and the families recorded within them. We find that CHILDES’s recordings overrepresented wealthier countries and higher parental education levels; urban settings; and smaller households. Middle- and higher-class participants were likewise over-represented. The corpora were not representative of their countries in terms of urbanization either - with a larger percentage of families residing in urban settings than is overall true for their respective countries. In terms of family structure, nuclear families were more prevalent than in the countries where the data was collected. Last, we found that corpora were linguistically diverse, but we estimate that these recordings underrepresent bilingual and multilingual households. We conclude that researchers should be careful when generalizing from naturalistic recordings of children's input and output obtained from CHILDES.",

          "abstract": "We present findings from an interview study concerning Canadian college students with disabilities in clinical internships. The study explored the perspectives of seven college faculty internship supervisors, eight accessibility advisors, and 14 students with diverse disabilities who were currently doing - or had recently completed - a required internship for their program. Thematic analysis was used to uncover key themes related to facilitators and barriers relevant to accessibility, knowledge, communication, disclosure / self-identification, policies / legislation, support strategies, and useful technologies. Highlights of our results indicate that accommodations that are typically available in college classrooms are not appropriate for most internship settings, that policies and procedure manuals related to accessibility supports / accommodations in internships are scarce, and that communication among faculty, students and accessibility advisors is poor and do not typically include on-site clinical supervisors. In addition, we found that students are often reluctant to self-identify as having a disability because of fear of stigma and professional concerns. A variety of technologies that can be useful in internship settings was identified, but participants noted that internship settings were often reluctant to use these because of concerns with patient confidentiality and biohazard safety. We recommend that colleges develop Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility (EDIA) policies that reflect internships and that communication structures be developed that allow all stakeholders to participate.",

          "abstract": "How do people come up with funny ideas? Profanity—the language’s rich panoply of obscenity, vulgarity, and indecency—is a ubiquitous comedic device deployed in creative humor. The present research explored variation in profanity use generating jokes. A sample of adults (n = 618) completed a creative humor production task, and text-mining methods detected and coded the appearance and severity of profanity. Random forest models were used to identify potentially important predictors, such as variables relevant to profanity generally (e.g., age, gender, and personality) and variables specific to humor creation (e.g., humor self-concepts and self-ratings of their jokes’ funniness). Profanity in the jokes was reasonably common, used by 22% of the sample, diverse in type, and generally mild in severity. The random forest models identified a set of uniquely important predictors. Profanity use and severity were marked by being younger, identifying as male, rating one’s own jokes as funny, and expressing more confidence in one’s ability to be funny and make others laugh—a true profile in boorishness. The discussion explores roles for personality in indecorous humor and the broader question of strategic aspects of humor creation.",

          "authors": "Ceri Ngai; Sam Gilbert",
          "abstract": "Cognitive offloading refers to the use of physical action and the external\nenvironment to reduce cognitive demand. Offloading strategies such as creating\nexternal reminders instead of relying on internal memory are highly effective and\nplay a key role in supporting real-world cognition. Previous work has shown that\npeople have systematic biases in their offloading strategies, which are related to\nbiased metacognitive evaluations of cognitive ability. These metacognitive biases\ncould potentially be mitigated by metacognitive interventions. However research\ninvestigating the effect of metacognitive interventions has produced mixed results.\nHere, we investigated the influence of a brief intervention comprising just five trials\nof metacognitive feedback during an initial practice session. After this intervention\nparticipants performed a memory task where they decided between using internal\nmemory (for maximum reward) or external reminders (for reduced reward),\nallowing us to determine the optimality of offloading strategies. The key difference\nfrom earlier work was that task performance determined financial reward, to\nincentivise optimal offloading. As predicted, metacognitive training reduced\nmetacognitive bias and also led to more optimal offloading strategies. Therefore,\nmetacognitive feedback is an effective intervention to improve the optimality of\ncognitive offloading, which could improve the adaptive use of cognitive tools.",

          "authors": "Veenu Gupta; Suzy Syrett; Andrew Ian Gumley; Amy Hardy; Thomas Ward; Stephanie Allan",
          "abstract": "Mental health research often seeks to witness, understand and empower marginalised communities through methods such as qualitative research. Qualitative research favours rich and meaningful data segments representing peoples’ lived experiences. The neurodiversity movement has identified and challenged the ableism that can arise when applying research methods with normative assumptions about human minds and language production. However, schizophrenia and psychosis qualitative research has so far been under-considered in efforts to reduce these forms of ableism in research. This paper highlights how mental health researchers can resist and reject the ableism that comes from adopting ‘rich data’ as representative of the lived experiences of those with schizophrenia. Qualitative research may occlude the real experiences of individuals with schizophrenia if they are not heard or represented in the multitude of ways they communicate or articulate themselves, the language they use and the stories they tell. This article provides solutions to meaningfully represent those with schizophrenia and their voices in all stages of the research process so that the available research in the field accurately reflects the needs and experiences of those with schizophrenia.",

          "authors": "Sarah E. Stutterheim",
          "abstract": "HIV is a highly stigmatized condition, and negative beliefs about HIV and people with HIV are frequently internalized. This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "authors": "Svetlana Pinet",
          "abstract": "In this review, challenges related to the measurement of word durations in language production are identified, highlighting gaps in current theoretical frameworks and the resulting difficulty in interpreting available evidence. To compensate for limited theoretical predictions regarding response durations in spoken language, we turn to other fields, such as written production and motor control, to provide informative analogies. In written production, reliable effects on durations have been observed but the field similarly suffers from the absence of clear predictions from the available models, limiting interpretations. Since word durations are the result of motor programming and execution, evidence from motor control is particularly relevant. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that planning and execution stages overlap in time, with response planning continuing even after the initiation of the motor response, making variations in durations arise from either planning or execution processes. In addition, they propose a gating mechanism to launch response initiation. Similar dynamics could be easily assumed in language production, which could help bridge the gap from response selection to response execution and extend current models of language production to account for motor execution and predict word durations. We end by outlining pending questions for the field of language production, and some recommendations to tackle them in the future.",

          "authors": "Raquel Lezama; Carlos J. Gómez-Ariza; M. Teresa Bajo Molina",
          "abstract": "Neuromodulation was utilized here to investigate the distinct involvement of two recognized cortical hubs for semantic integration (the left anterior temporal lobe, lATL) and inhibitory control (the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, rDLPFC) in creative problem-solving. Participants were presented with a list of category-exemplar words, selectively recalled some of them, and then solved a set of RAT problems. Selective retrieval was introduced to trigger inhibitory control over competitors. Critically, some RAT problems could be solved with words from the previous phases of the experiment, including words that might be less accessible due to inhibition. Other problems, however, could only be solved with unpresented words. Experiment 1 showed that anodal tDCS over the lATL had a negative effect on the production of correct responses to baseline RAT problems, but not on those that required inhibited solutions. Experiment 2 produced the reverse pattern with cathodal tDCS over the rDLPFC. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained before and after delivering tDCS, which also revealed specific tDCS-induced changes in frequency bands depending on the site of stimulation. Overall, these findings provide support for the involvement of semantic and control processes in creative problem solving that are linked to different brain networks.",

          "authors": "Zhuo Job Chen; Heinz Streib",
          "abstract": "Objective: Based on Fowler’s wide definition of faith as finding meaning in life, and progressing with his perspective on faith as a typology of hierarchically ordered styles that can optimally be assessed with the faith development interview (FDI), this study breaks new ground by investigating predictors and outcomes of faith development. \nMethods: This investigation is possible, because in two decades of mixed-method research with the FDI in the USA and Germany, we accumulated over 1500 FDIs including n = 324 longitudinal cases with at least one re-interview. Based on this longitudinal sample, this article presents results from quantitative analysis of faith development associated with a wide range of variables. \nResults: Results confirm assumptions that faith development predicts the rejection of the representation of God as authoritarian and predicts the rejection of xenophobia and other prejudice. Faith development also results in higher need for cognition, tolerance of ambiguity, and openness to revising one’s viewpoint. Predictors for faith development are high openness to experience, low frequency of payer and of experience of divine intervention. Predictors are also low agreement to the truth of texts and religious teachings (Religious Schema Scale, RSS), high agreement to the fairness, tolerance and rational choice schema (RSS) and to the xenosophic-dialogical schema (RSS) that features openness to the alien and strange. \nDiscussion: After two decades of faith development research, we thus can present predictive validity for the RSS and, based on this evidence, conclude that the RSS can be used to predict faith development.",

          "abstract": "Prime surprisal - an increased likelihood of structural repetition following surprising input- has emerged as a key paradigm for testing the claims of error-based learning theories of language acquisition. However, the prime-surprisal effect predicted by these theories has been observed only inconsistently in previous studies. Our study addresses the two main limitations of existing research by (a) using a precise, LLM-based surprisal measure and (b) including the largest sample size to date by a factor of four. Although the expected syntactic priming effect was reliably observed, the present data provided strong Bayesian evidence against a prime-surprisal effect (which was also not significant in any frequentist analysis). These results confirm that the previous inconsistent results are not due to low sample sizes or inaccurate surprisal measurements. Crucially, the unreliable nature of the prime surprisal effect casts doubt upon the suitability of using this method for investigating error-based learning in future work.",

          "abstract": "What kind of information does perception represent, and in what format? How does perception interface with higher-level cognitive systems for thinking, reasoning, and language? Questions like these motivated Green and Hummel (henceforth, G&amp;H) in their seminal 2006 article in JEP:HPP, “Familiar Interacting Object Pairs Are Perceptually Grouped.” At first glance, the subject matter of G&amp;H’s article appears quite simple and mundane: actions like pouring coffee, cutting bread, or unlocking a door. Yet hidden at the core of such everyday routines are specific functional relationships between objects, such as a carafe and a mug, a knife and a loaf, or a key and a lock. G&amp;H’s article was a turning point in a long but sparse tradition of research that had considered such relations from a vision-science perspective (e.g., Scholl &amp; Tremoulet, 2000), as it steered many researchers — ourselves included — to explore questions in the burgeoning field now known as “relation perception.” This field advances the idea that, beyond objects, features, and locations, the visual system extracts and represents relations — properties that specify interactions or connections between objects, rather than each object’s characteristics. In this perspective article, we outline new aspects of human visual perception that have been the focus of this field, and the major outstanding questions that remain.",

          "authors": "Xiaohui Rao; Hanlin Wu; Zhenguang Garry Cai",
          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly proficient at engaging in human-like conversations, it is essential to understand how people process language generated by LLMs compared to language produced by humans. During language comprehension, people interpret incoming linguistic input by integrating it with their world knowledge (e.g., semantic anomalies can elicit an N400 effect in brain potentials) and linguistic knowledge (e.g., syntactic anomalies can lead to a P600 effect). Crucially, people adjust their language comprehension based on the perceived demographic attributes of the speaker, which has been shown to modulate both semantics-sensitive N400 and syntax-sensitive P600 effects. In two ERP experiments, we investigated whether people are sensitive to the fact that LLMs excel in linguistic formulation (i.e., consistently producing grammatically correct texts) but are prone to hallucination (i.e., occasionally generating nonsensical content). Participants were informed that they would be reading texts previously generated by either an LLM or a human. Experiment 1 revealed an N400 effect for semantically anomalous sentences compared to semantically coherent ones. Importantly, the N400 effect was smaller for LLM-generated texts than for human-generated texts. Furthermore, participants who more strongly believed that LLMs possess human-like knowledge exhibited a larger N400 effect. Experiment 2 demonstrated a P600 effect for syntactic anomalies in LLM-generated texts, with the effect being larger for LLM-generated texts than for human-generated texts (and not statistically significant in the latter). These findings suggest that people’s expectations about LLMs’ potential for hallucination and near-perfect grammatical competence modulate the way they comprehend LLM-generated texts. This research highlights the importance of considering perceived language model attributes when studying human language comprehension in the context of AI-generated texts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Access to mental health care is limited by financial, time, and resource restraints. Massive open online interventions (MOOIs), a form of online self-directed mental health interventions, work to address these barriers by providing evidence-based interventions to many individuals at little to no cost. The present meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of MOOIs to inform the development of future MOOIs for mental health. \n\nMethods: Following the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review of research investigating fully online and self-directed mental health interventions was conducted within the PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Academic Search Complete databases. Random effect models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes using mean differences for mental health outcomes to determine the efficacy of MOOIs. Person-level (age, gender, continental location) and program-level (control type, inclusion criteria, therapeutic orientation, treatment components, treatment format, time to follow-up, treatment duration) moderators were examined with mixed-effect or meta-regression models.  \n\nResults: The meta-analysis included 31 articles with 10397 participants. MOOIs (n = 5235) were more effective at reducing mental health symptoms versus controls (n = 5162). Small intervention effect sizes were observed for anxiety, depression, sleep, and stress at post-treatment. At follow-up, all mental health outcomes were null. Subgroup analyses indicated studies had a larger effect size at post-treatment if they had an inactive control (vs. active), were conducted in Europe (vs. other continental locations), and delivered the intervention through web-based formats (vs. mobile applications). No other moderators were significant. \n\nConclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates the positive potential impact of MOOIs in reducing mental health symptomology across various populations. However, due to the limited findings, it cannot be concluded which intervention components led to the most favourable outcomes and for whom may benefit most from MOOIs. Further research should investigate which aspects of MOOIs lead to meaningful results to help design and implement more effective self-directed online interventions.",

To consider the extent to which such essentialist views originate from culturally-situated processes, the present study tested the developmental trajectories of essentialist beliefs among children growing up in the United States and China (N = 531; ages 3-6). Essentialist beliefs emerged across early childhood in both communities, but their instantiation and trajectories varied across cultures. In the sample from the United States (but not from China), essentialist beliefs that categories and their features are fixed-at-birth and inflexible increased across age. On the other hand, in the sample from China, children held stronger beliefs that categories are objective and explanatory, and viewed them as more homogenous with age. Children sampled from these two contexts also showed variation in basic explanatory, linguistic, and inferential processes, suggesting that cultural variation in the development of essentialism across childhood might reflect variation in the basic conceptual biases that children rely on to build intuitive theories of the world.",

          "abstract": "Are distributional learning mechanisms capable of complex linguistic inferences\nrequiring compositional generalization? This question has become contentious with\nthe development of large language models, which mimic human language abilities in\nmany ways, but which struggle with compositional generalization. We investigated\na set of qualitatively different distributional models (word co-occurrence models,\ngraphical models, recurrent neural networks, and transformers), by training them\non a carefully controlled artificial language containing combinatorial dependencies\ninvolving multiple words, and then testing them on novel sequences containing\ndistributionally overlapping combinatorial dependencies. In this work, we show that\ngraphical network models and transformer models, but not co-occurrence space models\nand recurrent neural networks, were able to perform compositional generalization.\nThe work demonstrates that some distributional models can perform compositional\ngeneralization, and their success or failure turns on their ability of the models to\nrepresenting words both individually and as a part of the phrases in which they\nparticipated.",

          "abstract": "The present study investigates the development of single word processing and multiple word processing skills in French-speaking children from Grade 2 to Grade 6. One hundred and fifty children participated in two tasks: a Lexical Decision Task (LDT) and a Grammatical Decision Task (GDT). The LDT was used to test single word processing abilities whereas the GDT was used to test multiple word processing abilities. Signal detection theory analysis revealed that all children performed well in the LDT, whereas a different pattern emerged in the GDT, where only Grade 4 and Grade 6 children performed above chance in this task. Then, a cluster analysis was used to investigate the relation between LDT and GDT sensitivity. The analysis revealed two clusters that differed in reading fluency and sensitivity in both tasks. Children from Cluster 2, who exhibited the highest sensitivity in the LDT, were the only ones to perform on average above the chance level in the GDT. Moreover, a strong correlation (r = .64) between LDT and GDT performance was found in this group. Finally, we found that a sensitivity of 1.95 in the LDT almost perfectly predicted cluster membership. We estimated that such sensitivity is achieved at Grade 3, suggesting that the ability to process multiple word sequences first requires sufficient efficiency in processing words in isolation. Once this turning point is reached, single word processing skills support the development of multiple word processing, which could take several years to mature fully.",

          "abstract": "Despite the established efficacy of exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder, it is commonly underutilized by practitioners due to misconceptions and fears about negative outcomes. However, it is unknown if the general population holds similar misgivings. The current study attempted to gauge public perceptions of exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder using a series of surveys and vignettes in an online sample (n =495). Half of the sample was unfamiliar with exposure and response prevention. Respondents rated exposure effectiveness below many alternate interventions, some of which have been shown to exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In general, participants viewed the examples of exposure therapy as traumatizing, dangerous, unethical, and ineffective at treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. These views were consistent for exposures related to contamination, responsibility for harm, and unacceptable thoughts, but not for “not just right” experiences. These results highlight the importance of efforts to inform the public of evidence- based treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPurpose. In March 2020, a unique situation unfolded wherein the UK government announced social restriction measures to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Various remained in place until April 2021, with older adults, who were considered clinically vulnerable, being placed under stricter restrictions. This study aimed to determine the impact of psychosocial factors, including loneliness, depression, and engagement in various recreational lifestyle activities, on hearing and cognitive function in younger and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMethods. 112 older adults (62 female) aged 60-82 (M = 70.08, SD = 5.89), and 121 younger adults (85 female) aged 18-29 (M = 20.52, SD = 2.63) participated online between June 2020 - February 2022. Participants completed questionnaires assessing loneliness, depression, auditory and lifestyle engagement, and hearing ability, as well as behavioural tasks assessing auditory function and global cognition. All measures were completed 12 times at 4-week intervals. \nResults. Linear mixed effects analyses found that, of the variables examined, increased loneliness was a significantly associated with poorer auditory function. There were no main effects of time during the pandemic on auditory or cognitive outcomes. However, the interaction between time and age group significantly impacted global cognition; in younger adults, global cognition decreased overtime, whereas older adults displayed an unexpected positive change. \nConclusions. These data show that there are associations between loneliness and auditory function but provide a lack of support for the impact of time experiencing auditory deprivation, or other psychosocial factors, on hearing and cognitive function. Such observations may be underpinned by motivational differences, learning effects, or sample biases. Future research may wish to investigate these factors further, to determine how psychological factors like loneliness impact hearing and wider brain function across diverse participant groups.",

          "abstract": "Excess clothing consumption severely harms the environment, through greenhouse gas emissions, resource degradation and water pollution. For consumers, however, the trade-off between this environmental impact and the convenience of “fast fashion” is hidden at the point of purchase. We present a pre-registered, experimental test of two clothing eco-labelling systems using a large, representative sample of consumers (N = 1,200). Participants used a simulated online clothing store, with some chosen at random to receive their selected items. They were randomised to see (i) a binary label, informed by existing policy, applied to the most sustainable products, (ii) a colour-coded, graded “eco-score” applied to all products, or (iii) no label. Compared to the control condition, participants exposed to binary label chose 10% more sustainable products. Eco-score participants, however, chose 20% more, and were twice as likely to exclusively buy the most sustainable products. There was no effect on the number of items purchased, implying a shift towards more sustainably produced clothing. Exploratory analyses revealed that the effects were driven by greater salience of the eco-score system and that effects were stronger among those most concerned about the environment. Those who saw the eco-labels reported the same level of shopping satisfaction and willingness to wear selected clothes as those in the control condition. Additional findings revealed a general underestimation of clothing production's environmental impact and strong support for implementing the eco-score both online and in-store. The results have implications for enabling informed consumer choice in the clothing market.",

          "abstract": "People's subjective conceptions of truth and honesty have undergone significant changes in recent decades. Parts of society increasingly favour the sincere expression of personal belief,\nhowever inaccurate, over verifiable facts. This trend has been accompanied by increasing norm violations by political elites which have been identified as a significant contributor to democratic backsliding. Those two trends highlight the need for a thorough examination of the nexus between norm violations and conceptions of honesty. We present a series of preregistered studies that examined the conditions under which people acquiesce to democratic norm violations and politicians’ dishonesty. We find that when participants are asked to take a perspective of honesty that emphasises sincerity over accuracy, which we call ``belief-speaking'', they are more willing to accept norm violations by politicians than if participants take a perspective that emphasizes accuracy as a criterion for honesty, which we call ``fact-speaking''. When a fictitious politician is presented as telling untruths, tolerance of norm violations is reduced compared to when the politician is presented as truthful. The findings highlight the need to develop a better understanding of how individuals interpret and respond to political leaders’ behaviours, especially within the evolving landscape of  perception and the ensuing threats to democratic stability.",

This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

This call-to-action advocates for the integration of community-driven events, such as Science Adventures – a data collection and outreach event held at Newcastle University, UK - to bridge the gap between researchers and the public. Science Adventures (SA), one of a handful of such programmes in the UK, serves as an exemplary model, bringing primary school aged children and their families in the UK to university campuses during school holidays to participate in interactive, science-focused educational activities, whilst simultaneously contributing to live research studies. Here we provide a review of the current obstacles of carrying out developmental science and how initiative like SA can help mitigate the issues faced. This includes the practicalities of organising such events to building long-term reciprocal relationships with the community. By investing in community engagement, developmental science can benefit from richer, more diverse data.

          "abstract": "Trust in mainstream institutions is declining while people are increasingly turning to alternative media and conspiracy theories. Previous research has suggested that these trends may be linked, but the dynamics of trust across multiple sources has received little investigation. Is trust a neutral process, where each source is judged independently, is it a zero-sum competition, where a loss for one side is a gain for the other, or does losing trust in one source in foster a more generalized sense of distrust? Across three experimental studies (N = 2,951) we examined how people react when a source makes a serious error, testing several potential models of trust dynamics. We found that regardless of whether the outlet is mainstream, counter-mainstream, or neutral, trust drops for the erring source but does not rise for its competitors. This was the case in the context of both food regulations and COVID-19 precautions. Such a pattern suggest that each source may be judged independently of others. However, in several cases, an error made by one source led to a loss of trust in all sources, suggesting that rather than choosing sides between competing sources, people are also judging the media landscape as a whole to discern if it is feasible to find trustworthy information. However, correlational data did also find that the more people saw a source as politicized, the less they trusted that source and the more they trusted its competitors.",

The findings indicate that therapeutic tattooing can be both beneficial and harmful for CSs and TAs, that there is a need for better therapeutic tattooing training for TAs and healthcare providers (HPs), increased awareness of therapeutic tattoos, a reduction in barriers to the practice and greater collaboration between HPs and TAs. \n\nImplications for Cancer Survivors: Findings from this study have major policy implications for healthcare systems, non-profit organizations, and regulatory bodies, which could serve to empower cancer survivors to make more informed decisions about their bodies and support enhanced training and accreditation of this practice.",

After being assessed for SDO and street harassment tolerance, 136 Italian and 113 British heterosexual men viewed a video of a woman repeatedly subjected to street harassment. Participants reported beliefs about the emotions experienced by the victim and were again assessed for street harassment. Results revealed that street harassment tolerance both before and after the video was independently associated with lower cognitive empathy and higher SDO. These effects replicated across the two cultures. These findings suggest two possible attitudinal and cognitive targets for reducing street harassment tolerance across societies.",

          "abstract": "It is well known that perception and cognition are systematically biased towards the recent past. That is, a decision about the current state of a perceptual feature (e.g., orientation) can be predicted based on a recent state of the same feature. Such serial dependencies have been demonstrated across perception, memory, and cognition, and have been jointly attributed to an adaptive mechanism meant to promote stability in a constantly changing environment. Here, we argue that this adaptive mechanism prioritizes past information on the most basic structural level, such that the strength of the attractive bias is modulated by the amount of structural coherence in stimuli. We presented visual patterns of varied structural disorder (randomness) prior to a recognition memory decision that required discriminating between trained and novel visual patterns. Both highly generic geometrical shapes and completely random patterns failed to elicit an effect on decisional response times. By contrast, we found recognition memory decisions to be significantly faster in trials where the irrelevant probe pattern was “optimally” random. This result suggests that decision-making is influenced by the past’s informational worth. More importantly, it suggests an optimal amount of uncertainty to facilitate future decisions.",

          "abstract": "Sexual misperceptions refer to instances in which individuals wrongly infer sexual interest from other people. Traditionally, such sexual misperceptions have been studied within the dating context among student samples primarily. Our research extends this line of research and examines sexual misperceptions in the workplace. In a two-wave survey (N = 212), we show that employees with a higher dominance motivation are more likely to perceive sexual interest in the behavior of a co-worker with a different gender, regardless of one’s own gender or formal power position. In a preregistered three-wave survey (N = 349) we further show that perceptions of sexual interest are positively associated with the likelihood to sexually harass co-workers, and that perceptions of sexual interest mediate the positive relationship between dominance motivation and sexual workplace harassment. We discuss theoretical and practical contributions of our findings as well as suggestions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Between 50–70% of autistic individuals report clinically significant decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sound in one’s environment) at some point in their lives. DST in autism comprises multiple distinct disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust), although few studies to date have distinguished these conditions from one another or studied their correlates independently. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Univariate and multivariate Bayesian models were then used to examine the demographic and clinical correlates of each DST diagnosis (both alone and independently of the other condition) in the autistic adult population. \n\nResults: Hyperacusis and misophonia were strongly correlated. Accordingly, all significant correlates in univariate analyses were found to associate with both conditions. In multivariate analyses (including control for depression and generalized anxiety, which strongly related to DST symptoms), both disorders were independently associated with female sex; increased autistic traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and phonophobia symptoms; and increased likelihood of seeking medical care for DST. Most other significant correlates (primarily hearing-related or neurological symptoms/disorders) were found to be associated only with hyperacusis rather than misophonia, although misophonia was uniquely associated with anger symptoms and identification as a gender minority. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia explain substantial variance in clinical outcomes of interest in the autistic population and demonstrate utility as additional diagnoses for autistic adults who experience debilitating DST symptoms within clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether perceived racial and ethnic discrimination mediates the relationship between race and impulsivity, as measured by delay discounting, among adolescents aged 10–11 years.\nMethods: Utilizing data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study release 5.1, we analyzed a sample of 3,857 participants who completed the delay discounting task and perceived discrimination measures at the year-one follow-up. Delay discounting was assessed through a hypothetical monetary choice task, with the area under the curve (AUC) serving as the primary measure of impulsivity—lower AUC scores indicate higher impulsivity. Perceived discrimination was measured using an adapted Perceived Discrimination Scale. Linear mixed-effects regression models examined the direct effects of race, socioeconomic factors, age, and gender on impulsivity, as well as the mediating effect of perceived discrimination.\nResults: Black adolescents exhibited significantly lower AUC scores compared to White adolescents (p &lt; 0.05), indicating higher impulsivity. When perceived discrimination was included in the model, the effect of being Black on impulsivity was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. Perceived discrimination was associated with lower AUC scores (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting greater impulsivity. Males demonstrated higher impulsivity than females (p &lt; 0.001), consistent across models.\nConclusion: Perceived racial and ethnic discrimination significantly mediates the relationship between being Black and higher impulsivity in early adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of addressing discrimination to reduce racial disparities in impulsivity and associated risk behaviors. Interventions focusing on both systemic factors contributing to discrimination and enhancing individual coping strategies are crucial for promoting equitable developmental outcomes among minority adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Background: Decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sounds in one’s environment) is one of the most common sensory features of autism, with a lifetime prevalence between 50–70%. Multiple disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust) likely contribute to the burden of DST in the autistic population, but there has been little exploration of this symptom cluster in autism in a way that distinguishes these conditions from each other or that examines how these disorders potentially differ in autistic and non-autistic individuals. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Descriptive statistics were derived to report on the prevalence of each DST category, as well as clinical features of individuals in both categories.  \n\nResults: Across the sample, 40.2% met case criteria for hyperacusis (sex-weighted prevalence: 33.5%), whereas 35.5% met case criteria for misophonia (sex-weighted prevalence: 29.1%), and comorbid hyperacusis and misophonia was found in 27.0% (sex-weighted prevalence: 21.9%). Both hyperacusis and misophonia were associated with tinnitus and tinnitus disorder, although neither condition was associated with (diagnosed) hearing loss. Sound-evoked pain was a commonly reported symptom of hyperacusis, with 64.7% of autistic adults experiencing pain at least once per month and 24.7% of autistic individuals with hyperacusis meeting criteria for “pain hyperacusis.” Onset of hyperacusis was much earlier than previously reported in non-autistic samples, although most other features of both hyperacusis and misophonia did not differ from what is known from general population studies. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia (and their comorbidity) are highly prevalent in the autistic population and should be studied in tandem (rather than as a unified construct) in future investigations of autism-associated DST.",

In the present study, we set to study the transitions from one coherent thought\nepisode to the next. Participants (N=61) were asked to either perform spontaneous word\nproduction or to let their mind wander during runs of 3 minutes. They were instructed to report\nthought transitions with a key press (online segmentation). First, we validate the use of this online\nsegmentation as a report of thought transitions, enabling us to measure the duration of coherent\nthought episodes. Then, we show that among a reasonable set of candidate mechanisms, the\ntiming of thought transitions is best explained by an accumulation-to-threshold model. We further\nfind that the threshold of this accumulation – but not the drift rate – negatively correlates with\nparticipants’ trait tendency for mind-wandering.

          "abstract": "Our memories play a crucial role in many decisions. Recent work has begun to study how individuals recombine elements of past episodes stored in memory to evaluate the outcome of some decisions (Biderman et al., 2020; Shohamy &amp; Daw, 2015). However, memory is not infallible and can get distorted. Understanding the impact of a fallible memory system on decision-making is essential. To explore how rewards influence memory and subsequent choices, we employed a modified version of the classic Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995), where we assigned different levels of reward to different DRM lists at the encoding stage . Words were either novel, studied, or conceptually related critical lures. In Experiment 1, we tested the effect of reward level at encoding on subsequent memory performance. In Experiment 2, we tested the effect of reward level on subsequent memory-guided value-based decision making. We found that high-value critical lures were brought to mind more often than low-value critical lures overall. Interestingly, participants properly identified high-value critical lures as new, despite bringing those words to mind (i.e., participants successfully monitored their memory for high-value critical lures), but failed to so for low-value critical lures. Moreover, participants chose high-value critical lures more often than novel items that were not related to the studied lists when compared to low-value critical lures. These findings suggest that reward can modulate memory representations to be more generalizable and consequently shape decisions that rely on such representations.",

Video data from 53 toddlers (410-1080days, 27boys) were collected during free play time in 3 Portuguese nursery schools. Toddlers adjusted their vocabulary complexity and the temporal patterns of their gestures to the recipient’s age, but did not change their prominence. Toddlers communicated with younger peers at a slower pace and using a simpler vocabulary, following child-directed communication patterns. However, when comparing adult-directed with peer-directed communication, toddlers used a more diverse set of gestures and shorter gestures. This study suggests that our ability to accommodate our communication emerges before language is fully developed, and that accommodation is flexibly expressed as a result of intersecting features of social partners.",

          "abstract": "Confidence leak (i.e., confidence serial dependence) is a phenomenon where confidence from a previous trial predicts confidence in a current trial independent of current choice or accuracy. Confidence leak has been shown to robustly occur across various cognitive domains and tasks. However, it remains unclear what factors, if any, modulate the strength of the confidence serial dependence. Here we investigate whether switching the motor response in a perceptual decision-making task influences the strength of the confidence leak effect. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch using their left or right hand, with the response hand being randomly cued on each trial. We found that switching the response substantially weakened the confidence leak effect. We further replicated this finding in a second experiment in which left-hand responses were given using a keyboard and right-hand responses were given with a mouse. In both experiments, we also found that confidence leak was weaker whenever the left hand was used in the previous trial, suggesting that lack of motor fluency reduces the strength of confidence serial dependence. These results demonstrate that switching the motor response weakens serial dependencies and imply that the action required to make a choice can impact one’s metacognitive evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Despite widespread claims that music training enhances nonmusical abilities, causal evidence remains inconclusive. Moreover, much research has focused on potential benefits for perception and cognition, but socioemotional skills are often overlooked. Here, we used longitudinal and correlational approaches to ask whether music training improves emotion recognition in voices and faces among school-aged children. We also assessed musical abilities, fine- and gross-motor skills, broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory short-term and working memory. Study 1 (N = 110) was a two-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school environment with three groups: music training, basketball training (active control), and no training (passive control). Compared to both control groups, music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory short-term and working memory, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Study 2 (N = 192) compared musically untrained children with those attending a music school. Music training correlated with improved emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), but this association disappeared after accounting for musical abilities, short-term memory, or socioeconomic status. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with improved emotion recognition in prosody and faces independently of music training and other confounding variables. These findings suggest that while music training may enhance fine-motor skills and auditory memory, observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities.",

This study highlights the importance of researching positive mental health and resilience in doctors starting their careers, going beyond the mere absence of mental disorders. It emphasizes the need to understand resilience as an essential component in this context, especially in the face of challenges such as \"Burnout\" syndrome.\n Methodology: The \"Positive Mental Health (PMH) Scale\" and the \"Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale\" were administered to doctors beginning their career paths. A descriptive and correlational analysis was conducted between the results of both scales. Results: A total of 93 young medical professionals participated, with most women. The results reveal a positive correlation between positive mental health and resilience. Although, in general, an increase in positive mental health was associated with greater resilience, atypical cases showed inverse correlations, thus underscoring the complexity of this relationship.\n Discussion: The evident correlation between positive mental health and resilience highlights the importance of adaptability in challenging work environments. The low scores in criteria assessing physical and emotional aspects suggest potential deficiencies in the comprehensive understanding of what positive mental health entails in the studied population. There is a highlighted need to strengthen strategies to manage work-related stress, especially in improving equanimity. \nConclusions: There is a correlation between positive mental health and resilience in this group of professionals. Understanding this relationship enriches knowledge and suggests practical strategies to improve the quality of life of healthcare professionals, specifically doctors, prioritizing a balance between work and personal life.",

          "abstract": "A recent meta-analysis published in this journal included 27 studies that experimentally manipulated social media use and investigated their impact on mental health outcomes (Ferguson, 2024). The author concluded that social media effects were statistically no different from zero. However, this meta-analysis did not investigate potential moderating effects of length of social media reduction or abstinence interventions. We conducted a re-analysis to investigate the impact of social media reduction / abstinence intervention length on mental health outcomes. We used the information available on the OSF platform related to the original meta-analysis and excluded 7 studies because they were not reduction / abstinence interventions. We categorized studies into those with intervention lengths of less than 1 week vs. 1 week or longer, and tested for curvilinear relationships between intervention length (weeks and days as continuous variables) and outcomes by including quadratic terms. Stratified analyses indicated that interventions of less than 1 week resulted in significantly worse mental health outcomes (d=-0.168, SE=0.058, p=.004), while interventions of 1 week or longer resulted in significant improvements (d=0.169, SE=0.065, p=.01). Analyses of intervention length as continuous moderator included k=19 studies and showed significant quadratic effects for number of weeks (b=-0.022; SE=0.008; z=-2.6; p&lt;.01), as well as number of days (b=-0.001; SE=0.000; z=-2.5; p&lt;.05). These findings suggest that social media use reduction / abstinence interventions should have a minimum length of 1 week or longer to confer mental health benefits. An ideal intervention length may be around 3 weeks, but future research is needed to confirm this.",

          "abstract": "Sequence learning in the serial response time task (SRTT) is one of the few learning phenomena that are widely agreed to be implicit in nature (i.e., that learning may proceed in the absence of awareness). Evidently, it is also possible to explicitly learn a sequence of events. In the past few decades, research into sequence learning largely focused on the type of representation that may underlie implicit sequence learning, and whether or not two independent learning systems are necessary to explain qualitative differences between implicit and explicit learning. Using the drift-diffusion model, here we take a cognitive-processes perspective on sequence learning and investigate the cognitive operations that benefit from implicit and explicit sequence learning (e.g., stimulus detection or encoding, response selection, or response facilitation). To separate the processes involved in expressing implicit versus explicit knowledge, we manipulated explicit sequence knowledge independently of the opportunity to express such knowledge. Performance data from this experiment was fed into a dynamic drift-diffusion model that allowed us to disentangle the contributions of the above-mentioned processes to sequence-learning effects. Results revealed three findings that are relevant for sequence learning theories. We discuss how the diffusion model may be helpful in future research addressing these theories.",

          "authors": "Marius Barth; Christoph Stahl",
          "abstract": "The distinction between implicit and explicit learning is fundamental to theories of human learning. However, it remains an open question whether implicit and explicit learning are based on a single, unitary learning meachnism, or multiple learning mechanisms or systems. The dual-systems model (Keele, Ivry, Mayr, Hazeltine, &amp; Heuer, 2003) posits that, in addition to a multidimensional learning system that is accessible to consciousness, implicit learning may also proceed in a unidimensional learning. Learning in this system is considered to proceed within a set of dimension-specific, encapsulated processing modules, where strong separation between different kinds of information protects against interference. Parallel acquisition of multiple uncorrelated sequences has been considered crucial evidence in favor of encapsulated processing. However, recent work has demonstrated that parallel learning is also well accounted for by a single learning mechanism, and can therefore not provide convincing evidence for encapsulated processing. In a series of three experiments, we therefore aimed at testing the assumption of encapsulated processing more stringently. To this aim, we orthogonally manipulated sequences of stimulus and response features, and tested for selective influence of these sequences on the cognitive processes that are involved in SRTT performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, stimulus colors and response locations followed independent six-item probabilistic sequences. In Experiment 3, stimulus colors and stimulus locations followed such independent sequences. Replicating previous findings, we found learning of sequences of response locations. By contrast, we consistently found evidence against learning of sequences of stimulus colors or stimulus locations. First implications for the debate on encapsulated processing, and the organization of sequence learning systems, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "We used the Garner paradigm to examine the relationship between the perceptual and conceptual aspects of an image for identification. Participants completed tasks that required them to selectively attend to semantic identity (e.g., manmade vs. natural) while ignoring image format, and vice versa, with the irrelevant dimension either held constant (baseline block) or varying simultaneously (filtering block). Experiment 1 compared black-and-white and greyscale drawings (BWvGS) and Experiment 2 compared coloured and greyscale drawings (CvGS). The former assessed the contribution of structural form cues to perception, while the latter assessed the importance of colour. Garner interference was found with accuracy (with more errors in filtering than baseline) in both the BWvGS and CvGS experiments, but this was asymmetric and limited to the semantic classification task. Participants’ selective attention to semantic identity failed when the image format varied simultaneously, indicating that conceptual processing is not independent of perceptual processing. However, in the image format task, selective attention to image format was successful despite variation in semantic identity, demonstrating that perceptual processing can occur independently of conceptual analysis. Together, these results demonstrate that the semantic classification of images is influenced by the format of the stimulus.",

Objectives: To outline international initiatives that enhance awareness and uptake of open research practices in the discipline of psychology. Methods: A systematic, narrative review was conducted in three stages: (1) a web search to identify open research initiatives in psychology; (2) a literature search to identify supporting publications; and (3) a hand search of grey literature. Eligible initiatives were coded into a narrative theme of procedural, structural, or community-based change. Results: A total of 187 initiatives were identified; 30 were procedural (e.g., toolkits, resources, software), 70 structural (e.g., policies, strategies, frameworks), and 87 community-based (e.g., working groups, networks).

We develop\na language-based AI model for PTSD and rigorously evaluate replicability in a prospective\nsample.\nMETHODS: Participants from the Stony Brook World Trade Center (WTC) Health and\nWellness Program described their lives in an automated interview during a clinical monitoring\nvisit. The language was analysed using AI to assess PTSD CheckList (PCL) for total symptom\nseverity score and four symptom subscales and validated against medical record PTSD\ndiagnosis.\nTo yield realistic accuracy estimates in this cross-sectional study, we propose the Sequential\nEvaluation with Model Pre-registration design, consisting of an iterative, two-phase pre-\nregistration paradigm. The first pre-registration specifies the data split, the model development,\nand the initial hypotheses. The second pre-registration specifies the exact pre-trained models,\ndata cleaning procedures, and the refined hypotheses.\nRESULTS: The data split included a development (N=1437) and a prospective (N=346) dataset.\nWithin the prospective sample, the pre-registered models produced scores that significantly\ncorrelated with their targets: PCL total (r=.38, p-value&lt;.001) and the four subscales (r=.28–.37,\np-value&lt;.001).

          "authors": "Nigel Guenole; Andrew Samo; Tianjun Sun; E. Damiano D'Urso",
          "abstract": "Psychological measurement plays a vital role in many areas of science. Traditional methods for developing and scoring measurement instruments require large sets of human responses, making them time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new ways to tackle these challenges. In this brief note, we explore the use of convex hulls—a concept from computational geometry—in combination with AI-driven large language models to enhance psychometric practice. A convex hull is the smallest convex “boundary” around a set of points. By treating language embeddings as high-dimensional coordinates and forming convex hulls, we can interpret the structure of items and free text responses in new ways. We propose two novel applications of convex hulls: (1) item analysis without data: We use convex hulls to check if a test item “belongs” to a scale, providing a new indicator of item quality; and (2) scoring free text: By interpreting candidate responses in relation to the convex hull of other responses, we propose an objective way to score psychological constructs from natural language. Each method is possible in supervised and unsupervised modes. These methods are experimental and yet to be validated. We outline, but do not implement, brief methods for testing their efficacy. We discuss open questions that we expect will impact the utility of these methods, such as, a) why we don’t just ask the LLM to score the items and responses, b) why convex hull centroids might be preferred over clustering and scale embedding means c) what to do if the construct hull does not match the intended target, and d) whether the centroids of psychometric convex hulls represent the intensity or the essence of item discrimination and the constructs being assessed.",

          "abstract": "Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills are malleable competencies that can be developed through life experiences. The recent SEB skills framework (Soto et al., 2021) identifies five skills domains (self-management, innovation, social engagement, cooperation, and emotional resilience) associated with students’ achievement and well-being. However, the mechanisms by which SEB skills support students at school remain unclear. In the present research, we integrate research on SEB skills and student engagement, hypothesizing that SEB skills can be considered as individual antecedents of student engagement, a multidimensional construct encompassing four dimensions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, and agentic). A sample of 1642 high school students (Mage = 15.68; SDage = 1.47; 913 girls) completed measures assessing SEB skills, student engagement, and student outcomes (achievement, school satisfaction, life satisfaction, and school burnout). The results of a path analysis confirmed that self-management and social engagement skills domains are significantly associated with student outcomes, through the mediation of global student engagement. Further specific patterns of associations between the five SEB skills domains and the four dimensions of student engagement were also found. Our study emphasizes the value of integrating research on individual factors associated with student success and well-being into broader theoretical frameworks. This approach can enhance our understanding of how to support students throughout their educational journey.",

          "abstract": "The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of controlling one’s own actions and, through them, external events. It is a crucial aspect of consciousness, indicating that an agent can understand the causal relationship between their actions and environmental changes and, more importantly, voluntarily influence the environment through their actions. There has been extensive debate about when children and which animals possess the sense of agency, primarily because they cannot easily report it. Observing actions might be a promising way to estimate the sense of agency without relying on introspection. However, despite actions containing rich information about human subjective feelings, there are very few ways to abstract such information. In the present study, we aim to clarify the relationship between actions and the sense of agency during control exploration using a dataset of 167 children (6-16 years old) acquired by Nobusako et al. (2022). We employ action plan analysis developed by Chang et al. (2024) to analyze motion sequences data which was self-generated by participants during a control detection task. The action plan analysis uses transformer-LSTM-based autoencoders to capture high-level, abstract representations of sequences of motor commands (referred to as action plans). This approach allows us to quantify action plan diversity that reflects control exploration behaviors. The results showed that action plan diversity can be a promising way to measure the sense of agency both within individuals and among them. This suggests that simply observing how actions change under different control conditions can quantitatively reflect the emergence of the sense of agency in children. The findings and methodology provide a highly novel and useful tool for studying the sense of agency in broader populations and species in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that sporting experts show better response inhibition. Less is known about how expert athletes use cognitive inhibition to ‘forget’ previous errors (termed expertise-induced-amnesia). Moreover, whether the relevance of sporting expertise is greater at high-pressure, compared to low-pressure is also unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine if sporting expertise predicted response inhibition (effectiveness and efficiency) and cognitive inhibition (error awareness) and the impact of pressure levels on these relationships. Forty-five participants completed a measure of sporting expertise and a modified Stop Signal Task under two pressure conditions (i.e., high- and low-pressure). Regression results suggested that expertise only significantly predicted response inhibition effectiveness and efficiency at high-pressure. Interestingly, error awareness at high- and low-pressure were independent of sporting expertise. Finally, change scores across pressure conditions were small and near zero for all participants, not just experts, suggesting that all individuals performed similarly across low- and high-pressure conditions. Sporting expertise appears to facilitate response inhibition at high-pressure but the exact methods in which experts ‘forget’ errors and maintain performance remains unknown (i.e., might not be cognitive inhibition).",

          "abstract": "Sensory feedback is crucial for maintaining accurate motor control. One process of movement correction is sensorimotor adaptation, or motor learning in response to perceived sensory errors. Recent studies have demonstrated that people can simultaneously adapt to opposing errors on a single movement (e.g., leftward and rightward errors on a reach) given some context that differentiates when each error occurs. In speech production, linguistic structure (e.g., the same vowel in different words) has been shown to provide sufficient context for adapting to opposing errors, but it is not clear whether this is restricted to the same effectors (i.e. lips, tongue, jaw in the oral cavity) or also includes movements of other effectors used in speech (i.e., the vocal folds in the larynx). While manual reaching studies have shown that contextual movements need not be produced with the same effector as the learning target, they have thus far only tested left-right effector pairs. We present the results of three simultaneous adaptation experiments in speech that examine whether laryngeal movements for pitch control can provide context for oral articulatory movements for vowels. In each experiment, the resonances that correlate with articulator position during vowels were perturbed in three different directions that were predictable given a pitch context. First, Mandarin speakers differentially adapted given pitch contexts that signaled differences in word meaning, suggesting that lexical uses of pitch provide context for vowels. Second, English speakers differentially adapted given different arbitrary pitch matching contexts on the word “head”, suggesting that even non-meaningful pitch movements provide context for vowels. Third, English speakers were unable to differentially adapt when simply listening to a contextual pitch, indicating that mere auditory input of pitch is insufficient. Together, these results indicate that sensorimotor context for learning can be provided by different effectors than the learning target.",

          "abstract": "Pain negatively affects several cognitive abilities, but knowledge about its effect on reinforcement learning (RL) is limited. During RL, instrumental choices can be influenced by heuristic tendencies to approach rewards or inhibit actions when facing potentially aversive events, introducing “Pavlovian bias” in behavior. Recent studies suggest that compromised outcome controllability enhances Pavlovian bias, a phenomenon that may be linked to suboptimal decision-making in learned helplessness (LH). Since LH is common in chronic pain syndromes, this study sought to establish a link between experimental heat pain (EHP), uncontrollable reward/loss and RL performance in healthy adults. In addition, we investigated if intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the medial prefrontal/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/dACC) alleviates the deleterious effects of EHP on choice behavior. In a pre-registered, 2x2 between-group, double-blind study (N = 100), healthy adult participants underwent 3 blocks of an orthogonalized Go/NoGo task with two interleaved bouts of active or sham iTBS, and either EHP or warm skin stimulation combined with compromised outcome controllability during the task. Although EHP did not impact overall performance, it invigorated actions for rewards, reflecting enhanced Pavlovian bias. While two bouts of iTBS attenuated Pavlovian tendencies, this effect was counteracted by EHP, indicating antagonistic effects of pain and iTBS-modulated mPFC activity on Pavlovian-instrumental interactions. Surprisingly, EHP and iTBS exerted largely similar effects on other latent parameters of RL (go-bias, learning rate, exploration) in a manner that resembled LH. These findings shed light on the role of experimental pain and mPFC/dACC activity in LH-like choice behavior.",

          "abstract": "As mental health treatment seeking has increased recently, U.S. public mental health therapists have been asked to do more with less. Facing growing work demands, many have left the workforce, exacerbating existing mental health workforce shortages and mental health inequities. However, a growing share of therapists have sought to improve their working conditions through labor organizing. This qualitative study explored how unionized public mental health therapists in New York City and Chicago experience and seek to address their workplace challenges. Participants (N = 30) were interviewed for 60-90 minutes to gain their in-depth perspectives; interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The research team identified four main themes. First, public mental health therapists described that their under-resourced and diverse patients have complex social service and clinical needs —needs therapists are highly motivated to address. Second, therapists described significant workplace challenges (e.g., staffing shortages, demanding workloads, low pay, insufficient clinical support). Third, therapists described that these workplace challenges negatively impact them emotionally and negatively impact the care their under-resourced patients receive. Fourth, therapists described reasons for and benefits to labor organizing including improving their work conditions and the quality of services. Findings revealed that public mental health therapists are intrinsically motivated to support their under-resourced patients, but that their labor conditions often hinder them from offering the high-quality care they feel their patients deserve. Public mental health therapists across both cities view labor unions as a vehicle through which they can improve their working conditions and the treatment conditions of their patients.",

In Study 2, we examined the personal ICD effect: can the mere act of imagining oneself acting counterattitudinally induce cognitive dissonance in subjects?

We discuss relevant empirical evidence from the fields of cognitive psychology, cognitive neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience and take a philosophical perspective on this central question, considering issues such as how to weigh different types of evidence and how to conceptualize the relationship between language and memory. We conclude that elucidating questions about the nature of the relationship between language and memory requires not only more empirical data, but also parallel conceptual development.",

In coordinated joint actions, a sense of joint agency emerges, with interaction and cooperation being crucial for enhancing SoA. Prior research indicates that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is integral to monitoring social contexts of SoA, while the left angular gyrus (lAG) focuses on individual aspects of agency. This study examined the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on SoA and judgment of performance (JoP) in eighteen healthy young participants using a three-way crossover design that included inhibitory neurostimulation of the rTPJ, excitatory stimulation of the lAG, and a sham intervention on the Vertex. Participants completed musical tasks involving rhythmic coordination before and after neurostimulation, with self-reported scores for SoA and JoP collected via Likert scales, alongside performance metrics (action time error and number of errors) evaluated through software. While rTMS did not yield significant effects on SoA, JoP, or performance overall, notable correlations between these variables suggest that neurostimulation may influence the interrelations among them. These findings highlight the complexities of how neurostimulation impacts perceived agency and performance, warranting further exploration into their interconnected dynamics.\nKeywords: transcranial magnetic stimulation, right temporoparietal junction, left angular gyrus, sense of joint agency, musical rhythmic coordination, joint action",

For this purpose, we interviewed seven psychotherapists with a psychodynamic and seven psychotherapists with a cognitive behavioral background who participate in a naturalistic trial on BC in routine outpatient psychotherapy. \nResults: Psychotherapists considered few fixed inclusion or exclusion criteria when considering which patients to introduce BC to. The basic technical requirements had to be met and the patients had to be fit for outpatient therapy. Psychotherapists found patients’ response to BC, like their motivation, to be a decisive factor when considering BC. \nDiscussion: Patient motivation for BC emerged as another potential bottleneck in its implementation. Therefore, a successful implementation strategy should focus on strengthening both psychotherapists' and patients' motivation to engage with BC. The openness of psychotherapists towards patient characteristics suggests that BC in outpatient care may target a broad patient population.",

Unfollowing also led participants to engage with more accurate news and increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X feeds—without reducing engagement.

Here, in our Shopping Game, we investigated this trade-off in 5-8-year-olds. Using a touch-screen, children shopped in a virtual store. Their shopping list and the store were not visible simultaneously but could be toggled. We manipulated access cost by varying a delay (0 / 4 s) before the list’s reappearance. Across three preregistered experiments at two sites (US / China, N=141), a pattern emerged: when costlier, children revisited the list less often, studied it longer, and selected more correct items. Also, children recognized the costs, identifying the 0-delay condition as easier. Young children show a cost-dependent trade-off of external resource use versus working memory.",

          "abstract": "Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where victims are led to doubt their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories. Despite the growing popularity of the term and purported harmful implications, empirical efforts to operationalize and define gaslighting remain sparse. This study aimed to define common features and themes of self-reported gaslighting experiences. Young adults (N=250) completed several questionnaires and open-ended prompts relating to gaslighting experiences. Using a variety of natural language processing techniques, we explore the gaslighting construct using a data-driven approach from the perspective of self-reported targets of gaslighting. These data confirm that gaslighting is a type of interpersonal manipulation aimed at making a person feel 'crazy' or doubt their memories. Romantic partners were reported to be the most common perpetrators of gaslighting, and both beneficial (e.g., awareness of manipulative people) and detrimental (e.g., self-doubt) consequences of experiencing gaslighting appear to be long-lasting. Additionally, we found that more severe, frequent, and long-lasting gaslighting experiences are associated with broader subjective memory deficits, even extending to other memories outside of the gaslighting event itself. This study highlights pervasive cognitive and psychological impacts of gaslighting, and underscores the need for further empirical research and informed clinical strategies.",

In a between-subjects experiment, participants completed a difficult quiz with assistance from either a polite or neutral-toned AI chatbot, which occasionally provided hallucinated (incorrect) information.  Signal detection analysis revealed that participants interacting with polite-AI showed modestly higher sensitivity in detecting hallucinations and a more conservative response bias compared to those interacting with neutral-toned AI.

          "abstract": "Featuring climate content on screen is believed to be a highly efficient strategy for shifting audiences’ climate beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. With this objective, major studios and other media organizations have launched initiatives to increase the prevalence of climate content. Despite various psychological theories proposed for how climate content may influence beliefs resulting in climate action, many studies assessing the empirical evidence for this pathway rely on cross-sectional analyses with severely limited causal attribution and nearly all studies only measure the impact at a single point in time, limiting our understanding of the persistence of any estimated impact. In this study, we address these limitations through a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 1,014), estimating the impact of watching narrative climate content (a climate focused episode of the television series Madam Secretary) on a set of climate beliefs and attitudes, including belief in climate change, endorsement of government action, social norms around climate action, and other drivers of personal action. These measures were assessed at baseline, as well as three later points (immediately post-viewing, 3-5 days post-viewing, and 7-10 days post-viewing). We find that watching narrative climate content can significantly increase pro-climate beliefs and attitudes. While these positive changes tend to decline across time, they often persist 7-10 days post-viewing. This finding lends credible causal evidence for the claim that on-screen narrative climate fiction has the power to shift relevant climate beliefs and attitudes, even significantly post-viewership, and may be an effective tool supporting large scale social change towards climate action.",

          "authors": "Carmen Saldana; Patrick Kanampiu; Jennifer Culbertson",
          "abstract": "Languages exhibit a tremendous amount of variation in how they organise and order morphemes within words; however, regularities are also found. For example, gender and number inflectional morphology tend to appear together within a single affix. In the relatively rare cases in which they appear as two separate affixes, morphology encoding gender information tends to be placed closer to the stem than number morphology is. Alternative theories of gender and number have been designed (in part) to explain these tendencies. However, the typological data are very sparse, making it difficult to find clear evidence for the representations and mechanisms shaping the organisation of gender and number. Across a series of experiments, we use an artificial language learning paradigm to explore the inferences learners make about the order of gender and number affixes in the absence of any explicit information in the input. We show that language learners have a clear preference for placing nominal morphology containing gender information closest to the stem. This holds both for prefixing and suffixing morphology, and across different types of gender and number systems. Importantly, these biases are consistent across populations of participants with different L1 experience with gender morphology: English, Italian and Kîîtharaka speakers. These results provide a new source of empirical support for particular theories of gender, and in line with previous work, suggest that cognitive biases play a role in determining morpheme order in the world’s languages.",

          "authors": "Anne M van Valkengoed; Linda Steg; Goda Perlaviciute",
          "abstract": "Sustainable lifestyle changes are an important demand-side solution to reduce CO2 emissions. While sustainable lifestyles are increasingly included in integrated assessment models, modellers have so far not managed to realistically model what drives changes in lifestyles. Important questions about the feasibility and likelihood of lifestyle change, and how lifestyle changes can be accelerated or promoted thus go unanswered. Environmental psychology is a discipline dedicated to understanding environmental behaviour, and its theories and findings could therefore be instrumental to informing the modelling of lifestyle change in integrated assessment models. Yet, we identify two barriers currently hinder the systematic integration of this knowledge into integrated assessment modelling. The first barrier is plurality: there are many theories and findings that are potentially relevant to modelling lifestyle change, but guidance is lacking on which to apply when. The second barrier is ambiguity: many theories in psychology are not precise enough to unambiguously translate them into a mathematical model. To overcome the barrier of plurality, we introduce the Motivation, Agency, and Past behaviour (MAP) framework, which summarises and integrates the insights of 8 prominent behavioural theories used in environmental psychology and that can be used to determine which theories and determinants are most relevant for specific modelling applications. To overcome the barrier of ambiguity, we identify three areas where the precision of theorizing in environmental psychology can be improved, namely definitions and consistent use of constructs, the specification of relationships between constructs, and describing the strength and boundary conditions of these relationships. We urge for closer collaborations between modellers and environmental psychologists to successfully model the drivers and impacts of sustainable lifestyle change.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the use of diversity indices, typically employed in ecological studies, to measure verbal behavior in children with autism spectrum disorder. By drawing comparisons between species richness and abundance, we applied Shannon entropy and beta diversity measures to assess the diversity and distribution of a verbal repertoire over time. This analysis utilized the outcomes of three verbal operant experimental analyses that use a multi-element design to test for the occurrence of four elementary verbal operants. Using archival data, diversity measures were then used to conduct a detailed analysis of the richness and evenness of verbal responses. The results demonstrate that beta diversity and Shannon entropy effectively capture the richness and distribution of the verbal repertoire over time. These findings suggest that diversity indices can provide a robust framework for assessing language development and the effectiveness of interventions. This research underscores the importance of integrating ecological diversity models into behavioral science to better understand complex human behaviors like language. Future applications of this method may allow for more complex analysis of verbal behavior within and across individuals and interventions.",

          "abstract": "Beat gestures are common co-speech gestures, and closely coupled with lexical stress. Hence, seeing a beat gesture on an initial syllable can bias people to report hearing a word with initial stress. This study tested whether these effects reflect task-effects or genuine word recognition processes, using the visual world paradigm in eye-tracking. Participants heard auditory stimuli of disyllabic Dutch stress pairs (e.g., VOORnaam vs. voorNAAM) with clear or ambiguous stress cues, while seeing videos of a talker in the center of the screen producing a beat gesture on the first or second syllable (or no gesture). Results showed that on stress-ambiguous trials, beat gestures guided word recognition in an on-line manner, similar to acoustic stress cues. For instance, a beat gesture on the first syllable biased looks towards VOORnaam before word offset. These results suggest that beat gestures – despite their limited inherent meaning – can affect on-line lexical access.",

However, there is relatively little clinician-friendly guidance to support the interpretation or implementation of AA data in psychotherapy. As clinical researchers and practicing psychologists, we aim to outline how AA data can be used collaboratively between clients and clinicians. \nMethod: We describe a case example involving the collection of self-reported AA data, then explain the challenges with interpreting and implementing AA data for clinical care. \nResults: We discuss implementation-related barriers and provide recommendations for clinicians and those working in applied settings who are interested in integrating AA into their practice. For example, we recommend clinicians use a co-define client-centered variables and outcomes of interest, particularly a reporting period timeframe and a threshold at which change could be considered clinically meaningful. \nConclusion: We encourage the formation of research-practice partnerships between clinical researchers and clinicians to address barriers at the",

          "abstract": "We conduct tests of a hybrid-similarity exemplar model on its ability to account for the context-dependent memorability of items embedded in high-dimensional category spaces. According to the model, recognition judgments are based on the summed similarity of test items to studied exemplars. The model allows for the idea that “self-similarity” among objects differs due to matching on highly salient distinctive features. Participants viewed a study list of rock images belonging to geologically defined categories where the number of studied items from each category was manipulated.  Following study, the participants’ old-new recognition memory performance was tested.  We also manipulated across experiments the nature of the encoding task used during the study phase:  Experiment 1 used a category-description matching task, whereas Experiment 2 used more neutral encoding instructions. Hit rates were markedly lower in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 and participants relied less on the presence of distinctive features for recognizing old items in the second experiment.  With a minimum of parameter estimation, the hybrid-similarity model provided good accounts of a wide variety of fundamental benchmark phenomena across the two experiments.  These included changing levels of memorability due to contextual effects of category size, within- and between-category similarity, and the presence of distinctive features.  However, the hybrid model and a variety of extensions of the model fell short in accounting for the variability in hit rates within the class of old target items themselves.  We discuss future directions for potentially improving upon the current predictions from the model.",

Two experiments (N= 324) examined the role of selective attention in the emergence and prevention of learning traps. Participants learned to approach or avoid members of two categories that were associated with either gains or losses. A rule involving two visual feature dimensions predicted category membership, while a third dimension was irrelevant. Category feedback was provided only when an item was approached. Selective attention during learning was assessed using an eye tracker. Experiment 1 found that many participants fell into the trap of using a single-dimension rule to guide approach/avoid decisions and consequently missed rewards. Eye tracking confirmed that these participants narrowed their visual attention to a single dimension. In Experiment 2, we manipulated visual feature salience across three groups and found evidence for a causal role of selective attention in determining the emergence and prevalence of learning traps.",

          "abstract": "The consciousness-collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics was explored as a weak measurement quantum Zeno effect in an optical diffraction apparatus. Fifty participants were selected via a worldwide search for individuals with experience in focusing their attention. Each was mailed an optical apparatus and provided with software to run an experiment to see if illumination recorded in a portion of the interference pattern would be affected when it was observed versus unobserved. Another portion of the interference pattern was recorded simultaneously but not observed at any time to provide a real-time control. A variety of environmental sensors and real-time encryption of the key data were among the methods built into the apparatus to help ensure data integrity.\nForty-seven participants completed their assigned experimental tasks, and two of three preregistered hypotheses were significantly confirmed. However, data from two participants were deemed probable outliers because they each achieved results over 7 sigma from chance. Those outcomes appeared to be due to misalignments in their optical systems, likely caused by rough handling during shipping. The two participants were sent new optical systems to provide replacement data, which upon review was assessed to be reasonable. Analysis of the revised dataset no longer supported the preregistered hypotheses, but an exploratory hypothesis based on skewness was significant. An exploratory time-series analysis found strong evidence that during observation periods interference progressively declined as compared to unobserved periods, in accordance with the proposal that human consciousness can act like a weak measurement quantum Zeno effect. In addition, performance by participants experienced in an outward focus of attention performed significantly better than those experienced with an inward focus of attention.",

          "authors": "Paul Linton; Nikolaus Kriegeskorte",
          "abstract": "We present a new illusion that challenges our traditional understanding of stereo vision. Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. There is no scaling of disparity with distance. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth.",

          "abstract": "The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) has gained significant interest in the scientific community in recent years. Despite its demonstrated impact on social and personal functioning, the neural bases underlying EI remain poorly understood. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of the existing literature on the neural correlates of EI. The search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. A total of 849 studies were initially identified (after duplicates were removed), of which 34 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the final synthesis. These studies employed various neuroimaging techniques such as lesion studies, grey and white matter structural MRI, task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and EEG. The findings of this review suggest that EI is supported by a complex and widespread brain network primarily implicated in the integration of cognitive and emotional processes, with significant involvement of structures commonly linked to social cognition. The literature mainly emphasized the role of the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and amygdala in conjunction with brain networks comprising these areas, such as the somatic marker circuitry and the social cognition network. Other brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cuneus, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, frontopolar gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and superior longitudinal fasciculus were also frequently mentioned. However, further research is needed to clarify the roles of some of these regions in EI. Limitations and future lines of research are discussed.",

However, the mechanism underlying people’s willingness to exert effort in exchange for information remains unclear. Previous work has suggested that valence and uncertainty are two key factors influencing information-seeking, but few studies have tested if these factors are important when exerting physical effort in exchange for information. Additionally, it remains unknown whether different kinds of uncertainty, i.e., risk and ambiguity, have differential impacts. In the current study, we developed a novel information-seeking task to quantify the value of non-instrumental information using incentive-compatible physical effort to examine how effort changes as a function of valence and uncertainty. Across two studies (N = 123), we found that people’s willingness to exert effort positively correlates with outcome expected value under both risk and ambiguity. Additionally, people exert more effort when outcome distribution uncertainty increases in risky situations, but are insensitive to ambiguity, except when facing extreme ambiguity. Our results demonstrate an unexpected dissociation. Humans will\nengage in effort-based information-seeking, even for non-instrumental information, when facing risk.

          "abstract": "Contrary to perceived tensions between addressing present and future societal needs, we find present-day poverty and inequality are deeply connected with attitudes toward far-future welfare at both societal and individual levels. Study 1 (144 countries) shows that poorer, more unequal nations score lower on indices of intergenerational concern and farsighted policies. Study 2 (34 countries, N = 123,502) shows that subjective SES predicts obligation to sacrifice for future lives, especially in nations with less inequality. In Study 3 (N = 1,264 Americans), individuals randomly assigned more resources allocate more to future generations, though not proportionately more. Replicating Studies 1 and 2, real-world SES predicts higher donations beyond situational framings. Thus, combatting present-day societal challenges may be key to increasing concern and action for humanity’s future.",

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 19th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i. e. perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, even though their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the basis of these assumptions and exam-ines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreas-ing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Addi-tionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable This study also derives new formulas for the biased estimation of the TRC, based on empirical results. These findings demonstrate that while the TRC may perform well under ideal conditions, even slight deviations from its assumptions can lead to significant inaccuracies. Therefore, the TRC may be unsuitable for practical applications, particularly when test condi-tions are uncontrolled, or traits vary over time.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly transformed numerous facets of both private and professional life. Understanding how people evaluate AI is crucial for predicting its future adoption and addressing potential barriers. However, existing instruments measuring attitudes towards AI often suffer from conceptual and psychometric limitations. To address this gap, this study introduces the nine-item Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence in Work, Healthcare, and Education (ATTARI-WHE) scale. Using a diverse sample of N = 1,083 respondents from Germany, the psychometric properties of the instrument were evaluated. The results demonstrated low rates of missing responses, minimal response biases, and a robust measurement model that was invariant across sex, age, education, and employment status. These findings support the use of the ATTARI-WHE to assess AI attitudes in the work, healthcare, and education domains, with three items each. Its brevity makes it particularly well-suited for use in social surveys, web-based studies, or longitudinal research where assessment time is limited.",

Low-active adults (N=233; Mage=46.7) predominantly non-Hispanic (92.3%), White (81.1%), female (65.6%) with a college degree (74.7%) were recruited to participate in a 13-month study. Participants completed a battery of assessments (psychosocial, neuropsychological, and physical functioning) at baseline and subsequently were randomly assigned to receive 20 hours of cognitive training via Games (stationary computerized tasks emphasizing executive functioning and exerciser self-certainty, and exergaming with dual-task components; n=118) or attention-control health educational Videos (n=115). Training was split across five 2-hr lab sessions (overall adherence=98.3%), followed by five 2-hr home sessions. Among Games, 81.4% fully complied with our exergaming protocol (lab &amp; home) and 88.4% completed the cognitive training protocol. Video engagement was assessed via accuracy to attentional checks (Ms=82.4% accuracy in lab, 82.0% accuracy at home). The primary outcome was physical activity engagement (PAE), a latent factor based on physical activity steps &amp; moderate intensity minutes derived from yearlong Fitbit step recordings, visitations &amp; classes, &amp; Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire). As hypothesized, Bayesian multiple-indicator, multiple-cause model analysis indicated a significant group effect (PAE score M±SD is 4.20±1.02 in Games and 3.77±0.92 in Videos; Cohen’s d=0.19 and one-sided p= 0.03) after adjusting for a set of background variables. Based on 58.4% respondents to our study evaluation survey, 87.3% enjoyed the intervention they were part of, 87.4% enjoyed the yearlong exercise program, and 97.1% would recommend it to friends/family. Only 4.1% of study completers were able to guess the study's true purpose. Results associated with hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change, including cognitive functioning and psychosocial outcomes, will be discussed. Our findings replicated our previous trial and show reliable effects for promoting exercise engagement within an unsupervised community-based exercise program for middle-aged adults.",

Our theory assumes an evolving representation of temporal context that binds to items and associations, allowing the rememberer to make judgments based on the occurrence of a mnemonic target within a particular context. In addition to the assumptions inherited from prior retrieved-context theories, CMR-IA assumes a conjunctive (Gestalt) representation for paired associates, increased attention to rare items, and variable thresholds for recognition decisions. We apply CMR-IA to key findings concerning recognition of items and associations, including effects of recency, similarity, receiver-operating characteristic curves, word frequency, differential forgettings of items and associations, and contiguity effects for successive probes. We also apply CMR-IA to cued recall phenomena, including serial position effects, distribution of correct responses and errors, contiguity effects, associative symmetry, and similarity effects. Finally, we ask whether CMR-IA can account for the dependencies between successive tests of item and associative memory. We show that combining a Gestalt associative mechanism with retrieved-context theory provides a good account for many empirical phenomena concerning item and associative memory. The analysis of successive memory tests highlights the important role of output encoding in our model.",

          "abstract": "Background: Racialized heteroscedasticity, characterized by unequal variance in neuroimaging data across racial groups, may challenge the assumptions underlying brain-behavior predictive models. These models often assume homoscedasticity, potentially leading to biased predictions, particularly when applied across diverse populations. This study investigates the presence of heteroscedasticity in functional connectivity data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and examines its implications for predictive modeling using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data.\nMethods: We analyzed resting-state functional connectivity from 5,084 participants in the ABCD study, comparing variance in rs-fMRI connectivity between Black and White participants across 35,912 non-redundant connectivity edges. Levene’s test, adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic covariates, was used to assess differences in variance, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction applied. Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM) was employed to predict performance across 15 behavioral and cognitive tasks, and 95% confidence intervals were generated for prediction intervals via bootstrapping over 1,000 iterations.\nResults: Significant differences in variance were observed in 10.5% (n = 3,768) of connectivity edges, with 98.5% (n = 3,712) showing greater variance in Black participants. CPM analysis revealed significantly wider prediction intervals for Black participants across 10 of 15 tasks, particularly in measures of working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. These results suggest that increased variance in functional connectivity in Black participants contributes to greater prediction uncertainty in brain-behavior models.\nConclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for racialized heteroscedasticity in neuroimaging-based predictive models. Failing to account for differences in variance may exacerbate health disparities and lead to less reliable predictions for Black participants. Addressing these disparities is essential for the development of more equitable predictive models in neuroscience and psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Perceived discrimination is a pervasive social stressor with significant implications for adolescent mental health and neurodevelopment. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we investigated the relationship between perceived discrimination and functional connectivity patterns in the adolescent brain. We applied a Network-Based Statistic (NBS) analysis to 268x268 connectome data from 5,084 participants who provided data on perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was coded as a binary variable (Yes/No) based on participants' responses to a validated discrimination scale. Our analysis identified two primary subnetworks associated with perceived discrimination: a positive subnetwork, characterized by increased connectivity between the right prefrontal cortex, left insula, and subcortical regions, and a negative subnetwork, marked by disrupted connectivity between the right prefrontal cortex and left temporal regions. The positive subnetwork suggests enhanced cross-hemispheric communication in adolescents reporting discrimination, while the negative subnetwork indicates reduced cross-hemispheric integration in those reporting no discrimination. Additionally, significant alterations in connectivity across large-scale brain networks were observed. Specifically, adolescents reporting discrimination exhibited increased connectivity between visual processing networks and regions involved in attentional control, while showing decreased connectivity in other network interactions. These findings offer novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of perceived discrimination on adolescent brain function, particularly in regions related to emotion regulation, social cognition, and stress responses. Our results underscore the importance of considering discriminatory experiences in the context of adolescent neurodevelopment and mental health.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel methodological framework for cognitive control training, embedded in a video game that incorporates action-based gameplay and a multidimensional Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) system. This system adapts to individual player performance in real-time, ensuring a personalized and engaging experience. The game architecture is modular, including a configurable set of cognitive training modules which are tailored according to one’s training goals. Transitioning between modules occurs through an action-based central hub following the literature on action video games and their positive impact on brain plasticity. Analysis of data from 34 players demonstrates how they progress through each module, with most players reaching their zone of proximal development after approximately 30-45 minutes of playing a module. Once players stabilize in their skill progression, the DDA system maintains variability in gameplay, a feature that has been suggested to promote the transfer of skills to novel situations. This analysis also highlights how our novel multidimensional DDA system accommodates a wide range of skill levels, offering a seamless on-boarding experience across a variety of players. Together, this novel architecture and DDA framework provide a new, rigorous methodological blueprint for the design of computerized cognitive training tools.",

          "abstract": "Compulsivity is a key feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with compulsions—repetitive, stereotyped behaviors and mental acts meant to relieve distress—often posing significant obstacles to daily function. The last few years have seen increases in compulsive behaviors; yet, the specific mechanisms of compulsions in OCD remain unknown. Previous research holds mixed findings on compulsivity-linked cognitive deficits, and, while many accounts assume compulsions aim to reduce anxiety, most individuals with anxiety do not develop compulsions—suggesting that the anxiety-reduction account is incomplete. A deeper insight into the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning compulsions holds immediate potential benefits for improving treatment options for OCD patients. We propose here that one factor in the formation of compulsions is the inability to integrate uncertainty across hierarchical goal levels. Using a predictive inference task with a hierarchical structure relying on local uncertainty reduction (short-term goals) in the service of global uncertainty reduction (long-term goal), we tested local and global learning in OCD patients (n = 20) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). Both groups showed the ability to reduce uncertainty locally, learning the statistical structure of the local environment based on observed data; however, only the healthy volunteers showed evidence of integrated learned knowledge at the local level into reducing uncertainty about the higher level of the task hierarchy. We suggest that this indicates a potential mechanism for compulsions that relies on the inability to adaptively prioritize and “toggle” among different local goals in the service of global goals.",

          "abstract": "An intriguing finding in human decision making is that the act of choice itself affects preferences − chosen options often increase and unchosen options decrease in subjective value. The observation of such choice-induced revaluation inspired the theory of cognitive dissonance, which posits that human behavior generally strives for internal consistency. Yet, which aspects of choices are responsible for choice-induced revaluation has remained unclear. Here we argue that previous research has overlooked an important explanatory variable: choice confidence. While the original cognitive dissonance theory posits stronger revaluation for low-confidence decisions, a recently proposed theory that parallels confidence and reward predicts stronger revaluation for high-confidence decisions. To arbitrate between these hypotheses, and a confidence-independent mere-choice hypothesis, we employ an instrumental conditioning paradigm and quantitatively compare computational models of choice revaluation that operationalize the hypothesized confidence effects. Our results will clarify the mechanism of how choices and preferences interact in human decision making.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of the impact of SCEs on health outcomes among sexual- and gender-minority populations.  \nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on preregistered search criteria. The initial search identified 3,067 articles from 2013-2022, narrowed to 64 independent studies following double-reviewer abstract and full-text screening. Seven health outcomes were identified: psychological health (k = 26), suicide and related behaviors (k = 23), substance use (k = 14), sexual health (k = 13), physical health (k = 5),  housing instability (k = 3), and adulthood abuse/victimization (k = 3). An individual meta-analysis was conducted for each health outcome. \nResults: Across all health outcomes, there were increased odds (31 - 132%) for sexual- and gender-diverse-identifying individuals who experienced SCEs before age 18 to develop an adverse health outcome after age 18. \nConclusion: Increased odds for the development of an adverse health outcome following SCEs among sexual- and gender-diverse populations highlight the need to assess SCEs in research and clinical practice. This is one of the largest meta-analyses to examine the impacts of SCEs on health outcomes among LGBTQ+ populations. Beyond research and the clinic, these findings have critical policy implications for creating environments that mitigate the impact of SCEs on health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals.",

A major limitation of that study was the use of the binary measurement. In this paper, we show that the same effect is detectable with a new, near-Gaussian measurement of leftism. The correlation between this measurement and paternal age was r = 0.12 (p &lt; 0.001). This measurement has high reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.93) which far outperforms the commonly used Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale (α = 0.71) [2] as well as high criterion validity, as evidenced by the Cohen’s d between Republicans and Democrat on the measurement (d = 2.31, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, we show that, as before, there is no significant correlation between general leftism and age when having a child in fathers, suggesting this result is not due to older fathers being more leftist.",

In spite of the dire consequences of allowing inequality persist unabated, efforts to mitigate inequality via redistribution typically fail, often because economically disadvantaged people oppose the very redistributive policies which would improve their lives. This counterintuitive finding has posed challenges to existing theories of human behavior, leading many to speculate that it is fairness, not material interest, which underlies redistributive choice. In the current study, we propose a novel experimental paradigm to assess how both fairness and self-interest impact redistributive choice. In an online sample of 231 participants, we demonstrate that the choice of redistributive tax rate was impacted by both factors. However, employing a computational modeling approach, we also find evidence that strategic norms underlie redistributive choice, both in choices observed in the laboratory and the policy views that participants hold.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the interplay between cognitive tasks and physical performance has drawn increasing attention, with research suggesting that engaging in cognitive effort prior to exercise can impair subsequent physical performance due to heightened mental fatigue. However, recent studies have cast doubts on the robustness of this effect, prompting for a reassessment of the mechanisms underlying cognitive fatigue and its impact on physical performance. In this study, we present a novel approach aimed at addressing methodological limitations in prior research, with a focus on individualizing cognitive task difficulty and duration. By integrating innovative techniques such as Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) and psychophysiological monitoring, we sought to unravel the complex dynamics between cognitive engagement, subjective states, and physical performance. In a pre-registered (https://osf.io/8rkxq/), randomized, within-participant design experiment, 21 recreational athletes completed a running task to failure test at 90% of their maximal aerobic speed after performing a cognitive task until failure or watching a self-selected documentary (control). Six different subjective dimensions were recorded with the TET and pupillometry was recorded during cognitive task performance. The key findings of this study were: 1) subjective changes during effortful tasks are not limited to a single experience, such as mental fatigue or boredom, but can be grouped into distinct patterns; 2) despite the individualized and demanding cognitive tasks, completing them before exercise did not impair subsequent physical performance; 3) pupil size reliably reflected cognitive task performance until failure and partially reflected changes in subjective states, while fixation on the stimulus decreased over time, especially during high-demand periods. These results provide a new approach for understanding physical and behavioral responses, with implications for psychology and sports science.",

          "abstract": "Children born preterm are at higher risk of attention problems compared to children born at term, yet not all preterm children are affected. The purpose of this study was to identify epigenetic predictors of early childhood attention problems among children born very preterm and to examine the joint role of epigenetic and environmental factors in predicting attention problems in this population. We studied 242 participants from a multi-site study of infants born less than 30 weeks gestational age. Neonatal buccal swabs were assayed for DNA methylation levels at over 450,000 CpG sites and age acceleration metrics were calculated using existing epigenetic clocks. A composite of postnatal environmental adversity was calculated using maternal reported risk factors. Attention problems were assessed in early childhood (mean age 6.58 years) using the Conner’s Kiddie Continuous Performance Test 2nd Edition. After adjustment for multiple testing, we found that DNA methylation of 9 CpG sites was associated with childhood attention problems. Several CpGs were located in genes previously linked to neurodevelopmental traits and inflammation in prior epigenome-wide and genome-wide association studies. Greater environmental adversity was also associated with increased attention problems. When tested together, DNA methylation and environmental adversity independently predicted attention problems. This study is the first to show associations between DNA methylation, environmental adversity, and objectively measured attention problems in school-age children born very preterm. These results could shed light on the etiology of attention problems in this population and may help us identify at birth preterm children at highest risk for later ADHD diagnosis.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on spirituality. In the proposed study, we aim to assess the efficacy of a second-generation mindfulness intervention (SG-MBI) on spiritual distress, spiritual decline, and spiritual growth in women with advanced cancer. A secondary aim is to examine the impact of the intervention on psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, loneliness, nonattachment to self, and self-transcendent states. A third aim is to explore any benefit of nature immersion on intervention outcomes.  \n\nMethod: This study will utilize a three-arm RCT with wait-list control design. A total of 198 women will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (treatment indoors/outdoors) or wait-list control group. Participants in the 8-week intervention groups will be introduced to Buddhist-derived wisdom practices that draw upon the sublime attitudes or abodes (Sanskrit: brahmavihārā): compassion (Sanskrit: karuṇā), loving kindness (Sanskrit: maitrī), appreciative joy (muditā), and equanimity (Sanskrit: upekṣā). Assessments will be conducted at three time points: before random allocation and post-intervention at 8 weeks and 20 weeks. \n\nProposed Analytic Plan: Linear mixed models will be used for intention-to-treat (ITT) primary analyses. Per-protocol (PP), subgroup, and secondary outcome analyses will also be conducted. Results will provide critical information about the utility of SG-MBIs for meeting the spiritual and psychological needs of women with advanced cancer.",

          "authors": "Danai Papadaki; Ramakrishna Chakravarthi; Søren K. Andersen",
          "abstract": "Recognising and responding to task-relevant stimuli may be hindered by nearby task-irrelevant flanker stimuli. Such effects occur both in visual crowding and in Flanker Compatibility Effects (FCE). Whereas crowding is a visual phenomenon that reflects a breakdown of object recognition in clutter, the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task is thought to be due to conflict during decision-making. In two experiments we investigated if and how these two seemingly independent phenomena are related. We employed an orientation categorisation task that allowed us to concurrently quantify crowding and FCEs. Specifically, we examined whether the spatial arrangement of stimuli affects the FCE in a similar way as in crowding. Interestingly, even when flankers were outside the crowding range, larger FCEs were observed for radially placed flankers compared to tangentially placed ones and for two compared to one flanker, corresponding to established patterns in crowding. However, inner flankers produced larger FCEs than outer flankers - the opposite of what is observed in crowding. In Experiment 2, we further investigated this reversed inner-outer asymmetry while manipulating the magnitude of crowding through varying target-flanker spacings. As expected, the outer flankers produced stronger crowding than inner ones. Crucially, the inner flankers produced a larger reaction time FCE and this inner-flanker interference was highest at the largest spacing. These findings demonstrate that the spatial layout of visual stimuli modulates conflict at both visual and decision-making stages, but the opposite patterns of the inner-outer asymmetry in the two phenomena provide a clear demarcation between the processes underlying them.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can represent information about multiple objects in the form of ensemble statistics, such as their mean feature. Although ensemble representation is often considered a strategy to deal with attentional capacity limitations, it is under debate whether it requires attention. We investigated this question using two ERP markers, the P3 which is evoked by change detection of attended stimuli, and visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) which is elicited by automatic sensory discrimination under attention diverted from the critical stimulus. In Experiment 1 (attended ensemble changes), observers attended to ensembles and reported rare changes of their mean orientation, while fixating on a central cross. In Experiment 2 (unattended ensemble changes), participants attended to changes in a central cross and ignored the background ensemble stimuli which also sporadically changed mean orientation. When ensembles were attended, changes in their mean evoked the P3 component, a marker of conscious change detection. When the same ensembles were unattended, no evidence for the vMMN, a marker of automatic discrimination, to ensemble mean changes was found. These results let us suggest that attention is critical for ensemble discrimination.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that selective attention can be strategically directed to prioritize items of higher ‘value’ in working memory. This work has typically been limited to tests of feature binding using simple ‘unitized’ colored shapes as memoranda. The current study explored whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiments 2a and 2b). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2a and 2b found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across these experiments, there was no evidence for interaction between binding condition and prioritization; participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space or modality. The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, and suggest that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of material.",

In this paper I explain why Johnston (1991) cannot explain the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’. Indeed, Johnston (1991) makes predictions that are the exact opposite of those observed in the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’. I also highlight a key concern with Johnston (1991)’s account that has so far been overlooked. Johnston (1991)’s account predicts that vergence eye movements will cause massive stereo distortions, leading to a world of unstable stereo perception.

Yet, theoretical models of EF and tasks used to measure them were developed mainly for highly educated young adults from developed countries. Here we assessed EFs in a diverse cohort from a rural town in Brazil (Baependi Heart Study: N=1253; 753 females), in which age (18-88 year) and schooling (0-23 years) varied widely. Based on a popular theoretical model of EF (the unity diversity EF framework), which describes the pattern of inter-associations of three specific types of EFs (inhibitions, shifting and updating), we developed a short, nonautomated, open-access EF test battery adapted for use in samples with varying schooling and age that included EF indicators obtained from three tasks (Plus-Minus, Trail Making and Random Number Generation tasks). Using Confirmatory Factor Analyses we found a good fitting three-correlated factor solution confirming the fractionation and inter-association of the three EF domains that was invariant (except for one of eight indicators) to age, schooling and sex. More years of schooling was related to higher latent traits in all domains, older age to worse shifting and women scored lower in latent shifting and inhibition. We conclude that the unity-diversity EF framework can be determined across adulthood in diverse samples with tasks adapted for these populations, allowing the theory-oriented investigation of sociocultural and demographic factors that influence EFs.",

There is emerging evidence that executive function is associated with mental health. However, less is known about a) everyday inhibitory control difficulties among autistic adults; b) the influence of sex assigned at birth and co-occurring attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) features on inhibitory control challenges; and c) relations between inhibitory control challenges and anxiety symptoms.\n\nMethods\nDrawing upon data from 732 autistic adults aged 18-83, this study examined self-reported inhibitory control in autistic adults and the influence of assigned sex and suspected co-occurring ADHD on the degree of inhibitory control challenges experienced. In addition, this research examined relations between inhibitory control challenges and anxiety symptoms, and the moderating role of assigned sex and suspected ADHD status in this relationship.\n\nResults\nAutistic adults endorsed significantly more challenges in inhibitory control relative to published norms. Participants assigned female at birth reported more difficulties in inhibitory control relative to sex-adjusted normative expectations than participants assigned male, and participants suspected to have co-occurring ADHD reported more inhibitory control challenges than those not suspected to have ADHD. Greater endorsement of inhibitory control challenges was associated with greater anxiety symptomatology; this relationship was moderated by suspected ADHD status, but not by assigned sex.\n\nConclusion\nInhibitory control is an area of difficulty in this group and is associated with anxiety symptomatology, suggesting that inhibitory control may be a valuable intervention target to improve emotional well-being in autistic adults.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been increasing observational research into the impacts of arts and cultural engagement on health, drawing on the surprisingly rich phenotyping of these behaviours in observational studies. This, alongside a broader growing evidence base, has led to recent calls from the World Health Organisation for the arts to be formally recognised as a health behaviour. However, access to the arts is not equitable, so a key challenge in observational research is disentangling any causal effects from this social gradient in engagement. In this paper, we consider five of the key methodological challenges in epidemiological research on arts and health and propose solutions by combining causal inference approaches with a new theoretical framework on the determinants of arts and cultural engagement (RADIANCE), which uses a socio-ecological approach to identify multi-level factors influencing patterns of arts behaviours. We end with recommendations for researchers incorporating questions on arts and cultural engagement within the design of longitudinal cohort studies.",

Others have said that the value of money depends on the way it facilitates trade, but even that doesn't explain where the value emerges before people agree to use money to trade. In actuality, there's a real value to gold, silver, and other forms of money that makes them reliably gain worth to people, and will emerge eventually even if everyone in a society does not like or believe in those precious metals or possessions. This is because possessing scarce objects has real reputational value among people, since having those objects indicates that we can go outside the known territory, and we instinctively collect and want things that have known scarcity. When that scarcity combines with other traits like transferability, durability and so on, we can see that money naturally emerges in society. We can use this idea to also see the real value and desire that people have for new forms of money like cryptocurrencies, and to know what will or won't emerge and last as a form of money in the future.",

          "abstract": "Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to changes in healthcare. Government and regulatory bodies have advocated the need for transparency in AI systems with recommendations to provide users with more details about AI accuracy and how AI systems work. However, increased transparency could lead to negative outcomes if humans become over-reliant on the technology. This study investigated how changes in AI transparency affected human decision making in a medical screening visual search task. Transparency was manipulated by either giving or withholding knowledge about the accuracy of an ‘AI system’. We tested performance in seven simulated lab mammography tasks, in which observers searched for a cancer which could be correctly or incorrectly flagged by Computer Aided Detection (CAD) ‘AI prompts’. Across tasks the CAD systems varied in accuracy. In the ‘Transparent’ conditions participants were told the accuracy of the CAD system, in the ‘Not Transparent’ they were not. The results showed that increasing CAD transparency impaired task performance producing an increase in false alarms, decreased sensitivity, an increase in Recall Rate and a decrease in Positive Predictive Value. Along with increasing investment in AI this research shows that it is important to investigate how transparency of AI systems affect human decision making. Increased transparency may lead to over-trust in AI systems, which can impact clinical outcomes.",

In the current study, we sought converging evidence for knower-levels by examining the correspondence of knower-level classifications between the Give-N Task and the Point-to-X Task. In Study 1, we tested 69 preschool-aged children and found that children at the higher knower-levels often did not receive the same classification across tasks. Further, children who were classified as having acquired the cardinal principle on the Give-N Task were more likely than subset-knowers to count on the Point-to-X Task, but they did not count very frequently. In Study 2, we conducted secondary data analysis on an existing study that included a Point-to-X Task with different stimuli and more trial types. We again found that children’s knower-level assessed with Give-N was not always associated with above chance performance for that number on the Point-To-X Task. These data suggest that knower-levels may adequately capture cardinal number knowledge for very small numbers but not for higher numbers. We discuss the practical implications of these findings and highlight a need for future studies to adopt a multi-method approach to establish a robust pattern of children’s number word acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "authors": "Yi Yang; David Victor Smith",
          "abstract": "As a social species, making redistribution decisions about how to allocate or reallocate resources across different individuals or groups is crucial for human’s survival and well-being at both micro (e.g., disaster relief distribution, charity donation, household income budget) and macro levels (e.g., national budget allocation, public support to wealth redistribution policies) of human society. Dictator games, among other economic games, have been used intensively to study such decisions regarding resource (re)allocation. In a typical dictator game, there are two players: a dictator and a recipient. The dictator decides how to redistribute an endowment, which the recipient cannot reject. Various factors, including dictator personality traits, recipient identity, and endowment transfer actions, have been found to influence dictators' decisions. Several models have been proposed to explain why dictators make certain redistribution decisions in dictator games. While insightful, existing models often oversimplify complex factors, such as task economic structure (e.g., source of endowment, price of transferring endowment between dictators and recipients) and partner identity (e.g, group membership, social closeness), hindering a holistic understanding of redistribution decisions. In this narrative review, we present an integrative framework categorizing factors into four main categories: task structure, dictator trait (trait), recipient identity (identity), and framing. We discuss potential interactions between task economic structure, dictator trait, and recipient identity. We also discuss how framing may influence redistribution decisions through multiple domains. This Structure-Trait-Identity Relation (STIR) framework provides a systematic approach to analyzing decision dynamics and resolving empirical inconsistencies. Future directions are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Recently, there have been growing efforts in developing fair algorithms for treatment effect estimation and optimal treatment recommendations to mitigate discriminatory biases against disadvantaged groups. While most of this work has primarily focused on addressing discrimination due to individual-level attributes (e.g., race/ethnicity), it overlooks the broader impact of societal structures and cultural norms (e.g., structural racism) beyond the individual level. In this paper, we formalize the concept of multilevel fairness for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects to improve fairness in optimal policies. Specifically, we propose a general framework for the estimation of conditional average treatment effects under multilevel fairness constraints that incorporate individual-level sensitive variables, cluster-level sensitive variables, and their combinations. Using this framework, we analyze the trade-off between fairness and the maximum achievable utility by the optimal policy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework through a simulation study and a real data study on advanced math courses using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009.",

          "authors": "Hunter DeBoer; Hannah Fitzpatrick; London M. Wolff; Anwyn Gatesy-Davis; Jeffrey R Stevens",
          "abstract": "Weber’s Law states that the ability to distinguish different stimuli depends on the relative magnitudes of those stimuli. When applied to quantity judgments, this means that the numerical ratio between two quantities (small amount / large amount) will underlie the ability to distinguish the quantities. Ratio-dependent quantification is a hallmark of Weber’s Law that has been demonstrated across a range of species, including dogs. However, other factors such as numerical difference (large amount - small amount) are confounded with ratio but would not support Weber’s Law. Most work on dog quantification abilities has only considered ratio and not difference. Here, we offer dogs a food quantity preference task where we varied both difference and ratio in quantity pairs to investigate which of these factors influences preferences. To address this, dogs could choose to eat one of two plates of food with different quantities of treats on them. We found that, when analyzed separately, both difference and ratio predicted whether the dogs chose the larger quantity of treats. However, when analyzed together, only difference predicted choice when controlling for ratio. This finding does not support the ratio-dependence required for Weber’s Law, raising questions about its importance for quantity preference tasks in dogs.",

          "abstract": "Pain is central to numerous clinical conditions and is the main reason that individuals seek medical treatment. Although pain involves subjective decisions and the psychophysics and neural basis of pain have been studied for decades, few have applied neuroeconomic approaches to the study of pain and its modulation. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to pain for those in the field of neuroeconomics. We focus on acute pain, which can be experimentally manipulated and studied using neuroscience tools. We first review aspects of pain-related decisions and the circuits that support different aspects of pain. We then discuss the common neural pathways that support pain and reward, as well as evidence of their interactions. Next, we introduce how pain might be viewed from a neuroeconomic perspective, focusing on the value of pain. Finally, we address hypotheses and outstanding questions for those at the intersection of pain and neuroeconomics. By providing this introduction, our goal is to inspire a new generation of studies that bridge neuroeconomics and pain to tackle critical challenges such as those brought about by the opioid epidemic.",

          "abstract": "Spacing, distributing practice over time rather than in a single session, often benefits long-term memory of simple material. However, it is less clear whether spacing is effective for more complex material. As more educators harness the spacing effect, it is important to know under what conditions it is most effective. We investigated the impact of procedural complexity on the efficacy of spacing, by varying the number of steps in arithmetic procedures. Participants were taught two procedures, either in a single session (massed) or over three sessions spanning three consecutive days (spaced). Experiment one compared learning a two-step with a three-step procedure. Spaced practice led to significantly higher performance, relative to massed practice, with no evidence for a difference in the spacing effect as a function of procedural complexity. However, there was also no evidence for a difference in performance between the two procedures, suggesting the three-step procedure was not sufficiently more complex than the two-step procedure. Experiment two compared learning a two-step with a five-step procedure. We again saw a significant spacing effect, as well a main effect of complexity, with performance in the five-step procedure being significantly lower than the two-step procedure. As in Experiment one, we found no evidence for an interaction between procedural complexity and the spacing effect. Our results show that spacing benefits the learning of arithmetic procedures. Critically, we also show that the spacing effect is not negatively impacted by the procedural complexity of the procedure learnt.",

          "abstract": "Background: Positive psychological factors may serve as a potential protective mechanism contributing to the preservation of cognitive function in late life. Longitudinal evidence is still lacking to characterize the interplay between emotional well-being (EWB) and cognitive function over time. Using positive affect (PA) as the primary index for EWB, we examined the longitudinal, reciprocal relationships between the three EWB constructs (PA, meaning and purpose [Purpose], and life satisfaction [LS]) and the cognitive domains of recall memory and retrieval fluency. Methods: Based on 4583 participants who completed three waves of data in a large-scale national survey from 2008 to 2018, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models  were used to examine the concurrent and cross-lagged relationships between each of the three constructs (PA, Purpose, and LS) and the two cognitive domains (recall memory and retrieval fluency) across the three time points adjusting depression. Results: PA and Purpose had significant reciprocal, within-person associations with memory and retrieval fluency. Random intercepts were significantly correlated, indicating that older adults with higher PA and Purpose typically had better recall memory and retrieval fluency. Conclusion: PA and Purpose had positive feedback loops with recall memory and retrieval fluency. Future studies should further explore the potential mechanisms and pathways of these observed relationships.",

          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive System of Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI – the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "Human and LLM-based annotation of constructs of marginalization such as discrimination or hate speech comes with challenges. One such challenge is coder bias, the systematic variation in annotations driven by individual characterstics. To systematically understand the presence and sources of such biases, we conducted two studies and compared both. In Study 1, we surveyed crowdworkers on marginalization-related characteristics and analyzed their annotations of racism. In Study 2, we assigned personas to LLMs and studied variations in the annotations. Moreover, we compared human and LLM coder bias from a text-level perspective to account for textual properties driving variation. Our findings suggest that being affected by or aware of marginalization causes systematic variation in human annotations, while persona assignment significantly impacts LLM outputs. Against this backdrop, we advocate for ‘inclusive annotation’ which introduces variance by intentionally integrating coders with lived experience or awareness of the constructs, thereby enriching measurement quality.",

          "abstract": "The cultural evolution of literary fiction is rarely studied, but rich literary data can help address some of the general problems of cultural change. In this paper, we use a massive dataset of Anglophone fiction (over 23,000 books) and the tools of natural language processing to understand whether the long-term change of topics in books is driven by the individual change of authors or by the cohort turnover in author populations. To answer this question, we borrow a method from evolutionary ecology: decomposition analysis based on the Price equation. To prove the suitability of this method, we first apply it to simulated data and show that it does allow distinguishing between these two processes. Afterwards, we decompose the temporal trajectories of topics and measure the relative effects of the arrival of newcomer authors (entrances), the retirement of authors (exits), and the change of topic preferences during authors’ lifetimes (individual change). We find that cohort turnover is a stronger force than individual change. Within the cohort effects, the effect of entrances is almost twice stronger than the effect of exits. Using simulated data, we discover that this difference stems from the unequal lengths of authors’ careers.",

          "authors": "Yuning Liu; Matt Motta; Amanda Yarnell",
          "abstract": "Background: Social media platforms like TikTok are pivotal for mental health communication (MHC), providing accessible, trusted content. Despite known benefits of creator training programs in improving content quality, it's uncertain if or how these enhancements affect people who watch that content. This study examines how training programs for TikTok creators influence TikTok users’ mental health knowledge construction and intended behaviors by analyzing user comments on TikTok videos.\n\nMethod: We employed LLM-assisted content analysis to annotate TikTok video comments for mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions. We then analyzed the impact of a creator training program on users' mental health knowledge construction through within-subject field experiments. Additionally, we extended this method to measure how TikTok's Mental Health Awareness Month (MHAM) in May 2023 affected user mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions.\n\nResults: LLM-assisted analysis showed that asynchronous toolkits significantly enhance mental health knowledge construction among video commenters, particularly among creators with high engagement, fewer followers, who are licensed mental health professionals, or  who do not offer paid coaching services. MHAM increased mental health knowledge construction among users, though the audiences of the 7 institutions and 10 content creators that were spotlighted by TikTok during MHAM did not show this effect.\n\nConclusions: Asynchronous toolkits improve mental health knowledge construction among video viewers. Future training should focus on emerging creators and separate toolkit learning from conference training to enhance training efficacy. In addition, promoting hashtags such as #MentalHealthAwareness can drive meaningful discussions and knowledge construction in video comments, but there is an opportunity for platforms to refine their creator selection criteria to improve on-platform mental health knowledge construction.",

          "abstract": "Given the global displacement crisis, the integration of refugees has emerged as a critical policy issue for many host countries. A key challenge involves supporting refugees in learning the language of their host country. While several European nations have instituted publicly funded language training for asylum seekers and refugees soon after their arrival, evidence on the efficacy of these early language programs in promoting economic integration remains limited. This study examines the impact of a pioneering, large-scale ad hoc program introduced by German policymakers, which provided basic language training to over 230,000 refugees arriving in 2015-16. Utilizing register data on the population of asylum seekers and exploiting a cutoff date in program eligibility, we assess the program's effectiveness using a regression discontinuity design. Our findings reveal no discernible effect on refugee employment over the subsequent two years. To explore whether language programs are generally ineffective during refugee crises, we contrast these results with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting, yet smaller-scale program. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, we find that this program considerably increased refugee employment. These contrasting findings offer important insights for policymakers on designing effective language training programs for refugees.",

The study is designed to answer this research question: Does participating in a youth philanthropy program foster positive outcomes for young people? Data are from a youth philanthropy program hosted within 12 community organizations in 7 US states. The program is two years in duration: youth participate as juniors and seniors in high school. Data were collected through surveys with graduating youth who had completed both years of the program (n=180). Findings indicate that the program “works” in fostering engagement in philanthropic activities, gaining prosocial orientations, and having rewarding program experiences. When available, youth outcomes from program participants are compared to national or global data on comparable measures to assess whether youth in this program appear to be participating in philanthropic activities at rates greater than average. Results show that youth participants are high on philanthropic activities and prosocial orientations, and their rates are 30-50% higher than comparable rates. Additionally, youth demonstrate positive growth in targeted philanthropic learning and skills, and youth participants gain a greater network of engaged peers and supportive mentors. The implication is that this youth philanthropy program is successful in fostering positive youth development.",

Our results contrast sharply with previous evidence from acceptance decisions showing bias in favor of Black applicants. We introduce a model of university pricing and use information from counselors' LinkedIn and university profiles, along with university characteristics, to test predictions. We find evidence consistent with agent-taste-based discrimination, where biases stem from counselors' preferences, and profit-maximizing statistical discrimination.

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines whether kindergarten-level Urdu phonological processing predicts the future Grade 1 English word and non-word reading accuracy skills of Urdu-English bilinguals in (i) Pakistan, with an Urdu as a national/societal-language country context, and (ii) Canada, with an Urdu as a heritage-language country context. Method: At Timepoint 1 of this longitudinal study, we assessed 154 Urdu-English kindergarten-aged bilinguals in Pakistan (n = 104) and Canada (n = 50) on their Urdu phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills, via the Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment Tool (U-PASS). After 1 year at Timepoint 2, we tested their English word and non-word reading accuracy skills at the Grade 1 level. Result: Our hierarchical linear regressions consistently demonstrated cross-language transfer between Urdu phonological awareness and the English word and non-word reading accuracy measures in both Pakistan and Canada. Predictive strength differences were demonstrated between RAN and reading outcomes, based on country-specific contexts. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that languages learnt in both a societal or heritage context (i.e., Urdu) contribute to early reading skills in another language (i.e., English), thereby emphasizing the importance of overall cross-language knowledge at the early stages of learning to read. This study also emphasizes the role of cross-language transfer for facilitating equitable access to early assessment for bilingual populations: Urdu phonological processing skills can be used to identify bilingual children’s future English reading abilities, rather than waiting until the child demonstrates adequate English language proficiency for completing traditional English phonological processing assessments.",

          "abstract": "Environmental performance indices play a crucial role in evaluating countries' environmental efforts and advancing global environmental governance. This study critically examines disparities among prominent climate performance indices, including the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), and Climate Action Tracker (CAT). We reveal significant divergences in country rankings, particularly between ‘developed’ and ‘least developed’ nations, underscoring how methodological choices profoundly impact outcomes and interpretability. We develop an analytic tool, called EPI-equity, to demonstrate how integrating equity principles can substantially alter performance assessments. We propose a conceptual framework to classify indices based on the perspectives they embody, highlighting how these can shape the interpretation of performance. Our results suggest that the outcomes of environmental performance indices are more likely to concur when they represent similar perspectives. We propose that explicitly articulating the perspective implied by the formalism of performance indices can enhance transparency, guide developers in aligning methodological choices with intended interpretations, and equip users with a clearer understanding of the results. Our analysis highlights the importance of employing multiple indices that encompass a range of perspectives for a comprehensive evaluation of countries' environmental performance. Our adaptable framework provides a structured approach to guide the selection of indices ensuring that they span a broad spectrum of viewpoints.

          "abstract": "Workplace surveillance is a common occurrence in many traditional workplaces and excessive forms can lead to resistance efforts from employees. However, most of the literature on this topic has been focused on the traditional office worker. There is now a new evolutionary worker that goes against social norms by travelling around the world while working remotely, the Digital Nomad. Therefore, this article aims to incorporate Digital Nomads into workplace surveillance research. This resulted in the research question “How does the Digital Nomad lifestyle interact with workplace surveillance and resistance acts”. To answer this, 5 semi-structured interviews were conducted on Digital Nomads recruited from social media platforms. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic data analysis where 3 main themes were identified: Shift from Traditional Restraints, Perks of Elite Workers, Panopticon’s Future. Overall, Digital Nomads did not experience intensive surveillance and findings supported the idea that they are productive, elite workers, opting to work for employers that do not monitor their employees. It was also found that Digital Nomads take part in minor acts of resistance, but they were not actively resisting their employers. These results suggest the need for future researchers to further expand upon the status of the Digital Nomad worker and explore their experiences of workplace surveillance and resistance.",

Mothers' speech is likely a key driver of the transmission of family background inequality in education. Yet, long-term associations between mothers' speech and children's education-related outcomes beyond the early years have not been studied previously. Here, we quantified differences in mothers' vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity from 10-minute-long naturalistic speech samples audio-recorded when children were age 5 and starting formal education. Children completed measures of cognition at age 5 and measures of literacy at ages 7 and 10 years; teachers rated their educational achievement at ages 7, 10, and 12 years. Data came from E-Risk, a UK cohort study that recruited families with twins born in 1994 and 1995 who represented the full range of Britain's socioeconomic conditions (analytic sample N = 894 mother-child trios). Mothers' vocabulary sophistication significantly predicted children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement between the ages of 5 and 12 years, accounting for 2% to 5% of the variance. These estimates were reduced to 1% and 2% or became altogether non-significant after adjusting for mothers' educational attainment and household income. Our findings suggest that mothers' speech plays a small independent role in the long-term transmission of family background inequality in education.",

The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.",

The study suggests that the Norse mythology in the video game Skyrim does not directly correlate with contemporary social conflicts. Instead, it suggests that socially relevant themes and ideologies may be attracted to different channels, such as less specific spaces. This aligns with the echo chamber model, where different themes correspond to different communicative and performative spaces. The Norse mythology serves as an open narrative infrastructure for the game's designers and players, supporting the construction of the possible world of the lore. However, the study does not show direct contamination effects on communities, suggesting that the lore may indirectly produce ideology on socially relevant issues.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces the term Northilization to refer to the utilization and commodification of Northern cultural and regional identity, impacting various sectors such as fashion, media, branding, and cultural tourism. The study examines the Czech Vikings, a unique community that embodies Northilization in Central Europe, focusing on their practices and broader implications for cultural preservation and commodification. Through theoretical frameworks and a case study based primarily on social media research, this study explored how Northern cultural elements are recontextualized in contemporary settings, emphasizing the balance between cultural appreciation and appropriation.",

          "authors": "Garen J. Wintemute; Andrew Crawford; Elizabeth A. Tomsich; Veronica A. Pear",
          "abstract": "Background: In 2022, a nationally representative longitudinal survey in the USA found concerningly high prevalences of support for and personal willingness to engage in political violence, but those prevalences decreased in 2023. This study examines changes in those prevalences from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA.\n\nMethods: Participants were members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Wave 3 of the survey was conducted May 23-June 14, 2024; invitations to participate were sent to all respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions. Year-to-year change is based on the means of aggregated individual change scores, which have a potential range from 0 (no change) to ±2. \n\nResults: The 2024 completion rates were 88.4% (8896 respondents/10,064 invitees) overall, 91.6% (8185 respondents/8932 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2023, and 62.8% (711 respondents/1132 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2022 but not in 2023. After weighting, 50.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%) were female; weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. From 2023 to 2024, the prevalence of the view that violence was usually or always justified to advance at least 1 political objective did not change (2024: 26.2%, 95% CI 25.0%, 27.5%; 2023: 25.3%, 95% CI 24.1%, 26.5%). There were no changes from 2023 to 2024 in willingness to damage property, threaten a person, injure a person, or kill a person in an act of political violence, and no changes in expectations of firearm use in situations where respondents considered political violence justifiable. Changes on other measures were infrequent (17 of 58 comparisons in the main analysis) and small where they occurred (with 2 exceptions, change &lt; 0.05). \n\nConclusions: Contrary to expectation, support for and willingness to participate in political violence in this cohort showed little to no change from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA. These findings can help guide prevention efforts.",

          "authors": "Jinchi Li; Eric Zhao; Zhixiang Li",
          "abstract": "Accurately predicting football match outcomes is valuable for stakeholders such as fans, analysts, sports betting companies, and team strategists. In this study, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for predicting football match results by transforming numerical features into contextual inputs. Key features include historical match results, player ratings, coach ratings, and other relevant conditions, which are processed by the LLM to predict the match winner. We compare the performance of LLM-based predictions with traditional machine learning (ML) models, including random forest and XGBoost. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs achieve comparable accuracy to these conventional ML techniques. Additionally, the LLM offers a significant advantage in that it requires no model training, simplifying implementation and reducing computational costs. This makes LLMs a promising, resource-efficient alternative for football match prediction, presenting new opportunities for AI-driven sports analytics.",

          "abstract": "As the concept of polycrisis gains popularity among academics, policy-makers, and the general public, many questions linger about the utility, scope, and applicability of the term in different contexts. Building on prior work, we argue that crises can fruitfully be understood as existing along a spectrum, characterized by multiple different factors, with our modern polycrisis at one extreme. We illustrate this by surveying three historical periods with varying geographical scope – late 1st-millennium CE Mesoamerica, Late Medieval Eurasia, and the early modern Northern Hemisphere – arguing that these exhibited many, but not all, of the key characteristics that make up a polycrisis. We detail the experience of individual societies during these periods, focused on regions to highlight how stresses and dysfunction across multiple systems combined to produce devastating impacts and contrast these with the relatively mild experiences of others facing the same conditions. We highlight how the interaction of stresses across ecological, economic, social, and political systems produced disasters that further deepened these crises and so led to yet more disasters and further devastation. We illustrate how viewing these historical periods through a polycrisis lens can not only inform our understanding of the past but can produce valuable lessons for our modern world. The multi-faceted, far-reaching, and devastating consequences of our current polycrisis should not be viewed as entirely a recent phenomenon. Ultimately, we argue that studying historical polycrises as we do here can help us learn lessons from the past that allow us to hone strategies for addressing the comparable issues we face today and will continue to contend with for the foreseeable future.",

          "abstract": "Home care (or home health care) makes a critical contribution to the care of older people, yet many people have little experience or knowledge of this service, and its component parts. Many older adults receive home care, but the nature of the support varies from country to country. This Forum Article considers how home care is defined, its scope and purpose and how services are shaped by the systems in which they operate. Systematic data collection in home care services already exists in some countries, while in many others, such as the UK, it is being planned. Defining data requirements for home care is critical to evaluation of care quality and cross-country comparisons. Data have the potential to play an important role in shaping perceptions of home care.  For information to be useful, we require a shared understanding of what constitutes home care, what people want and need from a service and which data should be captured.",

          "title": "A new method for calculating the food self-sufficiency ratio: Supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio",
          "authors": "Goro Takahashi",
          "abstract": "Background: The conventional formula for calculating food self-sufficiency cannot cover all the food we eat on a daily basis, and the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of each country cannot be calculated. The conventional food self-sufficiency ratio (CFSSR) can only calculate the FSSRs of each country for grains. To determine the actual state of food insecurity worldwide as accurately as possible, a method for calculating the FSSR of each country for all the foods we eat on a daily basis is needed. To address this situation, this study proposes the supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio (SSFSSR), which can be used to systematically calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of all foods in all countries/regions.\n\nResults: We compared the results of both calculations under the same conditions and used the same data to determine whether the CFSSR or the SSFSSR is a more suitable method for obtaining basic information and formulating measures of global food security. The results showed that the SSFSSR has advantages and practicality over the CFSSR. The SSFSSR can calculate self-sufficiency ratios for all foods in all countries/regions of the world, and the figures for various statistical tests are better. The food that is the subject of the calculation in the SSFSSR formula is the entire supply from production, distribution, storage, and consumption, excluding duplication in the calculation, and includes primary products required to produce secondary products, such as livestock products and edible oils. The study also highlighted the value of reducing the amount of primary products used to produce secondary products such as livestock and edible oils, thereby lowering the primary product conversion rate (PPCR).\n\nConclusion: This study used actual data to estimate the SSFSSR for each country/region to demonstrate the applicability of this method and that lowering the PPCR would lead to an increase in the food self-sufficiency ratio. To further refine this methodology, we find that the most important tasks for the future are to collect more reliable data on calories per weight for a large number of foods, expand the number of types covered by more reliable PPCRs, and analyze those data.",

          "abstract": "Supply of more housing options for people on social housing waiting lists should be given increased priority, as longer wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing creates further mental health challenges for applicants already facing increased health needs, according to new AHURI research.\n\nThe research, ‘The role of housing providers in supporting clients with complex needs’, was undertaken for AHURI by researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Tasmania. It investigates the current challenges in providing social housing to people with complex support needs and considers potential alternative policy responses. \n\nMental health was identified at the centre of many clients’ health needs. Longer social housing wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing was seen as increasing mental health challenges for clients. An increasingly uncertain and expensive rental market was also recognised as exacerbating the issues.\n\nAt the simplest service response, connecting people to secure housing helped their mental health. Indeed, social housing providers may be the first and only point of contact that clients with unmet mental health needs have with the service system.\n\nDeveloping the housing service providers’ workforce could improve the effectiveness of support provided to people with multiple support needs, together with providing individual casework support for with clients to helping people navigate support networks, including ensuring that clients are designated as priority clients on social housing registries. \n\nThe provision of secure, genuinely affordable housing for people with low and moderate incomes would reduce the pressure on social housing registries. Affordable housing rents need to be reviewed and set based on percentage of income formulae, rather than setting rents as a percentage of market rents.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the potential of multimodal large language models (LLMs) for plant species identification and educational enrichment. Using an annotated dataset focused on fungi, particularly those classified as edible or non-edible, we implement a practical application that allows users to upload plant images. The LLM then identifies the species, determines its edibility, and provides detailed information on its characteristics. For edible species, the model offers culinary insights and preparation methods, while also delivering comprehensive educational content on plant ecology and cultural significance. Our approach showcases the ability of LLMs to bridge image recognition with rich, text-based knowledge, facilitating an interactive learning experience that promotes plant literacy and practical understanding. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLMs in educational tools and their potential to enhance public awareness of plant species, including fungi, through visual and contextual data fusion.",

          "abstract": "Research on the impact of elections on attitudes toward democracy has focused\nprimarily on satisfaction with democracy. Building on this, we analyze how win-\nning and losing elections, along with affective polarization, shapes citizens’ support\nfor norms of democratic restraint and consent. We propose that partisan animus\nweakens the “reservoir of goodwill” that helps citizens accept democratic norms of\nrestraint and consent that may go against their self-interest. However, a compara-\ntive study of 36 elections and two quasi-experimental case studies show that win-\nners and losers do not differ significantly in their support for these key democratic\nnorms. Even in highly polarized contexts, winners’ restraint and losers’ consent\nremain relatively robust. While satisfaction with democracy is shaped by winner-\nloser dynamics, especially when polarization is high, support for core democratic\nprinciples is not, despite increased partisan hostility. These findings have positive\nimplications for our understanding of the role of citizens in democratic processes.",
