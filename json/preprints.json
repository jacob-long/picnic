          "authors": "Paweł Lenartowicz",
          "abstract": "Publication bias poses a serious challenge to the integrity of scientific research and meta-analyses. There exist persistent methodological obstacles for estimating this bias, especially with heterogeneous dataset, where studies vary widely in methodologies and effect sizes. To address this gap, I propose a Likelihood Ratio Test for Publication Bias, a statistical method designed to detect and quantify publication bias in datasets of heterogeneous studies results. I also show the proof-of-concept implementation developed in Python and simulations that evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate that this new method clearly outperforms existing methods like Z-Curve 2 and the Caliper test in estimating the magnitude of publication bias, showing higher precision and reliability. While inherent challenges in publication bias detection remain, such as the influence of different research practices and the need for large sample sizes, the Likelihood Ratio Test offers a significant advancement in addressing these issues.",

          "abstract": "Preregistration, the process of publicly recording a study’s hypotheses, design, and analysis plan before data collection and/or analysis, is an essential practice for enhancing transparency, methodological rigour, and reproducibility in research. This chapter provides a practical guide for integrating preregistration into teaching and supervision.\n\nThe first section highlights arguments for adopting preregistration, emphasising its role in reducing biases. It introduces preregistration as a critical skill for academic development and offers guidance for designing learning exercises, including activities that build competencies in hypothesis formulation, study design, and analysis planning relevant to both quantitative and qualitative studies.\nThe second section addresses the practical implementation of preregistration in student-led projects. It discusses how to support preregistration across methodological traditions—quantitative, qualitative, and systematic reviews—and offers concrete guidance on template selection, platform use, managing deviations from preregistered plans, and reporting exploratory analyses.",

          "authors": "Magda Skubera; Roksana Sobolak; Thomas Rhys Evans",
          "abstract": "Feedback is an important mechanism to support education, development and quality within research. Yet current feedback mechanisms are often hard to navigate and sub-optimally timed such that feedback often extends existing inequalities. Much knowledge about how to ‘do’ feedback is not formally taught or trained and remains a significant part of the hidden curriculum of research. Using qualitative insights drawn from a trans-disciplinary global survey of researchers (n=867), the current study provides seven recommendations for improving feedback. Moving beyond widely accepted ‘good’ feedback practices, and exposing some of the unspoken realities of navigating the feedback culture of research, we hope the collective wisdom of this vast array of researchers supports researchers (especially early career, and those from minoritised backgrounds), towards a more accessible research culture for all.",

          "abstract": "Background\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the mental health of young people from minority ethnic communities, yet effective interventions such as mental health psychoeducational workshops shown to work for other populations have rarely been offered or investigated among this population.\n\nObjectives\nThis qualitative study examines the impact, challenges, and benefits of mental health psychoeducational workshops co-created with and for 12-to-16-year-olds from black and mixed ethnic minority groups in London United Kingdom\n\nMethods\n12 (8 female: 3 male) black and mixed ethnic minority 12-to-16-year-olds (M = 16, SD= 1.55 years) currently attending a West London community centre co-created, participated in, and fed back on the impact of five mental health and life-skill workshops through 1-on-1 semi-structured interviews (M = 10 minutes 8 seconds, range = 3-16 minutes), which were transcribed verbatim.\n\nFindings\nInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) of the interviews revealed three superordinate themes, with a total of 8 codes clustered: (1) workshop features promoting positive mental health, (2) positive mental health outcomes and, (3) workshops features impeding positive mental health outcomes. Overall, young people perceived workshops to have a positive impact on their mental health and helped provide support in coping with the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nConclusions\nStudy findings highlight the potential benefits and barriers to entry of mental health and life-skill workshops for young people from minority ethnic communities.\n\nClinical Applications\nCommunity-based and co-produced workshops were perceived as beneficial to mental health by BAME young people, warranting greater consideration and implementation in practice.\n\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC\n•\tBlack, Asian, Minority Ethnic (BAME) young people have experienced difficulties during the pandemic and would benefit from mental health support. \n\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\n•\tWhile the efficacy of co-created and community-based workshops are known, little research has demonstrated if this method resonates with BAME young people as a way to cope with the psychological impact of the pandemic. \n\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n•\tFuture research and policy should prioritise continued collaboration with young people from BAME communities, a population that is often not represented in the literature and poorly understood in terms of their support needs. This study recognises the value of community-based co-produced workshops by young people from BAME communities and believe more support in this format is needed for this group.",

          "authors": "Hyoju Kim; Wi-Jiwoon Kim; Bob McMurray; Dongsun Yim",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Speech perception continues to develop throughout school age and plays a fundamental role in language and reading development. Recent findings in English-speaking children suggest that speech categorization consistency—the stability of a listener’s percept across multiple encounters with a speech sound—predicts both language and reading abilities, with a particularly strong link between reading skills and vowel perception. One hypothesis is that this is due to complex grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs) in English vowels. The present study tested (1) whether the relationship between categorization consistency and language/reading abilities extends to typologically different languages and (2) whether the vowel-specific link observed in English is shaped by GPC complexity, using data from Korean, a language with relatively transparent GPC mappings.\n\nMethod: Forty-four 1st-grade Korean-speaking children completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, in which they heard tokens from a speech continuum and rated the correspondence between the stimulus and each word on a continuous scale. Standardized assessments of language and word reading were also conducted. \n\nResults: Children with poorer language/reading abilities exhibited lower categorization consistency, which is consistent with the findings from English-speaking children. In contrast to prior findings, however, this relationship was not specific to vowel perception but was held across all contrast types tested. Categorization gradiency (slope of the categorization function) was not significantly associated with any outcome. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend prior work by demonstrating that categorization consistency predicts language and reading abilities, even in a language with transparent GPCs. Importantly, this association was observed across all phonemic contrasts, not just vowels—suggesting that the previously observed vowel-specific link in English may stem from the greater GPC complexity of English vowels. Together, while categorization consistency appears to be a critical predictor of linguistic outcome, the specific pattern may vary across languages depending on the structure of their GPCs.",

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

          "abstract": "Content moderators aim to prevent misinformation and abuse in online communities. Human moderators have limitations like limited capacity that can potentially be addressed by AI moderators. However, in order for AI to be effective as a moderator, we need to understand how people perceive an AI moderator compared to a human moderator. We report two experiments (N = 698) that showed a human or AI moderating misinformation in online groups, varying the moderator's arguments and the group's size. In Experiment~1, AI was seen as less effective when it used harm-based arguments to refute misinformation; however, this gap disappeared a year later in Experiment~2, perhaps as attitudes towards AI shifted. Perceptions of AI moderator effectiveness were unaffected by the moderated group's size. We suggest that there may be growing acceptance of AI as content moderators in online groups, and highlight some of the potential challenges their use may raise.",

Ancorado nessa visão dinâmico-complexa, em diálogo com o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala (Flege, 1995; Flege; Bohn, 2021), este estudo investiga, entre aprendizes brasileiros de inglês, o padrão de pre-fortis clipping de vogais diante de plosivas finais. Três participantes foram acompanhados longitudinalmente em 12 coletas ao longo de 13 semanas. Entre a primeira e a segunda coleta, receberam insumos distintos: nenhum tipo de intervenção pedagógica referente à pronúncia (Participante 1), treinamento perceptual (Participante 2), e treinamento perceptual associado à instrução explícita de pronúncia (Participante 3). As produções da forma-alvo foram analisadas acusticamente e submetidas a Análises de Picos com simulações de Monte Carlo e a Análises de Pontos de Mudança. Os resultados apontam padrões individuais de variabilidade e mudança possivelmente ligados aos tratamentos pedagógicos. Os achados reforçam a pertinência de estudos de processo para o desenvolvimento fonético-fonológico em LNN e a compatibilidade entre a TSDC e o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala, além de evidenciar ganhos do uso complementar dos dois métodos de análise.",

This study examines the structural validity of scales measuring daily-life social experiences, namely the quality of social company, online company, in-person solitude, and online solitude, using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis on N = 1,913 adolescents. We tested measurement invariance across groups based on sex, age, and a clinical characteristic relevant to social interaction and solitude: lifetime history of self-harm. Results indicated structural validity of scales measuring the quality of social company, the quality of online company, and the quality of in-person solitude in the whole sample.

          "authors": "Camilla Bank Friis; Lars Peter Sønderbo Andersen; Marie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard; Lasse Suonperä Liebst",
          "abstract": "Purpose. Research on workplace violence has predominantly focused on individual, organizational, and situational risk factors associated with employee victimization. However, limited attention has been paid to the interactional processes that shape workplace violence events despite microsociological theories and evidence underscoring the critical role of face-to-face interactions in conflict situations. This paper proposes a microsociological approach to better understand how workplace encounters escalate into acts of victimization. Methodology. To exemplify the value of a microsociological approach, we analyze body-worn camera footage of a work situation that escalates into aggression between a ticket inspector and a bus passenger without a valid ticket. Using qualitative process analysis, we examine how interactional dynamics involving status and emotions shape the step-by-step progression of this high-risk encounter. Findings. We demonstrate how the imposition of a fine transforms the inspector-passenger interaction into a status negotiation, with passenger aggression emerging in response to the inspector’s exercise of authority. Moreover, the inspector’s emotion management plays a key role in preventing the situation from escalating further into mutual displays of anger and aggression. This case illustrates how a micro-interactional analysis of risky work situations can reveal the mechanisms of violence and inform situational prevention strategies. Implications. We provide methodological and theoretical guidance for incorporating microsociological analysis into workplace violence research. Originality. This study demonstrates how a microsociological approach, grounded in a novel video-observational method, yields unique insights into the interactional dynamics that causally shape incidents of workplace violence.",

          "abstract": "The perspectives on the genuine basis of self and self-consciousness are diverse. Against the background of two exemplary theories, a concept is presented which modifies otherwise contrasting models and merges essential features of consciousness into a modified concept. This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Curiosity scaffolds children’s exploration and learning. Yet, the neural mechanisms of curiosity-modulated learning in children remain unclear. Here, we designed an fMRI task to test how curiosity, as defined by children’s self-reported excitement about learning information, modulates memory and neural activity in 5- to 8-year-olds (n = 60 with behavioral data, n = 51 with fMRI). We observed greater learning when children reported more curiosity. In whole-brain analyses, high-curiosity was associated with greater activation in inferior frontal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, the thalamus, and the putamen. Curiosity did not modulate activation in preregistered regions of interest (dorsal attention network, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens) but did modulate activation in an exploratory region of interest, the amygdala. Multivariate searchlight decoding revealed local activity patterns that reliably distinguished reported curiosity levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, and cerebellum. Together, these findings suggest that curiosity enhances engagement of language, visual, and attention-related regions during learning in children.",

          "authors": "Anna Hollis; Phoebe E. McKenna-Plumley; Raluca Roman; Gary John McKeown",
          "abstract": "Autistic adults experience disproportionately high levels of loneliness, often influenced by social environments that are inaccessible or unaccommodating, rather than a lack of social interest. To address this, some individuals have turned to digital tools, such as companion chatbots, which simulate emotionally supportive conversations as an alternative means of connection. This article critically examines the role of chatbots in alleviating loneliness and promoting the well-being of autistic adults. Following a brief overview of chatbot companions’ technologies and current theories of loneliness dimensions, this argument examines whether these technologies truly provide meaningful support for autistic individuals. By analysing chatbots through the lens of methodologies frequently proposed to mitigate loneliness, the paper highlights the benefits of these technologies in conjunction with ethical considerations, emotional risks, and design limitations—particularly when grounded in normative assumptions regarding communication, loneliness, and relationships. It concludes that, although companion chatbots may function as temporary support for companionship, they must be developed in accordance with neurodivergence-affirming principles to effectively alleviate loneliness and avoid further isolation or dependence for autistic users.",

We also show that an extended version of the REM, endorsed by Marsh et al. (2024), may seemingly be supported by data generated without any direct effects between self-concept and achievement. This means that such effects in observational data may be spurious and do not provide strong evidence for a causal effect of self-concept on achievement.",

While much is known about non-conscious visual perception, the auditory modality has received less focus. Here, we examine the level of processing for audible and intelligible spoken words that participants did not notice during the performance of another difficult visual task. Using repeated occurrences of such inattentional deafness, alongside objective and subjective awareness probes, we measure the processing of supraliminal, but undetected words. In two pre-registered EEG experiments (N = 67), we show a unique, temporally late, neural response that differentiates words from pseudowords in the absence of conscious awareness. Additionally, an exploratory analysis found a behavioral interference of undetected words with visual task performance. Both results were contingent on the relevance of word detection to participants, implying that auditory non-conscious processing is not automatic but goal-dependent. Overall, our results support flexible capabilities for non-conscious speech perception, suggesting the ability to integrate acoustic information over time.",

          "abstract": "In today’s world, humans collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) and often make judgments with the help of AI assistance in such contexts as medical diagnoses. Greater AI accuracy and trustworthiness is generally regarded as the goal of designing decision-support AI systems. However, highly accurate AI may not always provide optimal assistance. Rather, AI with bias, especially in the direction opposite to an individual’s bias, may improve the accuracy of individual judgment. This is because the AI’s bias will cancel out the individual’s bias (e.g., individuals’ overestimation bias is corrected by AI’s underestimation bias). In this study, we call such aggregation of human and AI biases resulting in a change of final judgment “bias interaction.” We investigated such interactions using a simple perceptual judgment task simulating medical judgments. First, a theoretical analysis using computer simulations showed that optimal AI assistance depended on individuals’ biases. Second, two behavioral experiments demonstrated that AI with biases in the direction opposite to participants’ biases tended to improve participants’ accuracy. However, participants tended to evaluate such AI as being less trustworthy. The theoretical and empirical results of our study raise questions about conventional beliefs that attribute superiority to more accurate and trustworthy AI. We also discuss the practical implications of designing AI to be a better collaborator.",

          "abstract": "Climate misinformation has been identified as a barrier to mitigative action. One prominent example occurred when the 2019/2020 “Black Summer” bushfires in Australia were blamed on arson. This claim is cognitively attractive because of its simplicity and was widely publicised at the time, but also thoroughly debunked. In two experiments, we examined the impact of a misleading article implicating arson as the primary cause of the Black Summer fires on Australian (Exp. 1, N = 509) and Canadian (Exp. 2, N = 506) participants’ reasoning, associated donation behaviour, and climate change attitudes. The misinformation significantly influenced reasoning about the Black Summer and future fires in both experiments; it also reduced the donations of Australian participants to a local climate organisation and impacted Canadian participants’ reasoning about a novel, conceptually related (but fictional) flooding event. Corrections were largely effective at mitigating misinformation impact. A bolstered correction that portrayed climate change as an important causal factor through its impact on risks and emphasised the multicausality of natural disasters was more effective than a simple correction that merely refuted the misinformation. Climate change attitudes were largely unaffected by the misinformation and interventions. Our findings demonstrate that event-specific climate misinformation can influence reasoning beyond a specific event, and that corrections are broadly useful for combatting its effects.",

          "abstract": "Humans are inherently driven to build meaningful relationships, but attempts to socially connect with others are not always successful. This study investigates whether social connectedness can be improved by modulating inter-brain coupling, a neural correlate of successful social interactions, through neurofeedback. Using an inter-brain neurofeedback system (i.e., a multi-brain computer interface that provides real-time visualizations of inter-brain coupling between dyad members), we showed dyads real-time visualizations of the extent to which their brainwaves (electroencephalography signals) were “in sync”. Our results showed that, compared to a sham control group, who received feedback based on randomly generated signals, dyads receiving real multi-brain neurofeedback exhibited an increase in inter-brain coupling, and, critically, that this increase was associated with a higher sense of social connectedness. A chain mediation analysis suggested that this experience of enhanced social connectedness may have been driven by a sense of joint control and shared intentionality. Together, our findings demonstrate the potential of inter-brain neurofeedback to modulate inter-brain coupling and to support key components of social connectedness.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation plays a role in the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Most of the research in this area has focused on how people regulate their own emotions, a process called self-emotion regulation, or self ER. Self ER strategies are well-established predictors of PTSS. However, people also regulate their emotions with the help of others, a process called social emotion regulation, or social ER. Relative to self ER, social ER is understudied, and its associations with PTSS and self ER are unclear. Therefore, we examined the relationships between self ER, social ER, and PTSS using a network analysis. Adults with a history of direct trauma exposure (N = 1,061) reported on their use of four social ER strategies (soothing, social modeling, perspective taking, and enhancing positive affect), two self ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and PTSS. We identified ER nodes that had the greatest bridge expected influence (EI) centrality with PTSS. Expressive suppression (a self ER strategy) had the strongest bridge EI centrality in the network, followed by soothing and social modeling (two social ER strategies). Expressive suppression was also differentially associated with social ER strategies. Although longitudinal research is needed to establish the direction of effects, these findings underscore the importance of evaluating the roles of both self and social ER in the development and maintenance of PTSS.",

          "abstract": "Prototype and exemplar theories of categorization have been compared for decades. However, little research has examined why individuals adopt different approaches to categorization. The aim of the present studies was to investigate individual differences in prototype and exemplar categorization. Study 1 examined how global and local processing, autistic traits, and analytic-holistic cognition relate to category representations using Medin and Schaffer’s (1978) 5–4 categorization task. Participants completed the classification task, followed by a Navon task to assess attentional processing and self-report trait measures. Results showed that reaction times on the Navon task had some associations to categorization strategy, suggesting that global processing abilities may be related to category learning. Study 2 experimentally manipulated attentional focus by priming participants’ attention either globally or locally before completing the 5–4 categorization task. Although priming did not significantly influence strategy use, attention weight analyses revealed nuanced differences in how participants allocated attention to stimulus features. Specifically, participants who focused on the details, attended to less optimal stimulus features when classifying. These findings contribute to our understanding of individual differences in categorization and category learning and highlight the role of attentional focus in shaping category representations",

          "abstract": "AI chatbots have been shown to be successful tools for persuasion. However, people may prefer to use chatbots that validate, rather than challenge, their pre-existing beliefs. This preference for “sycophantic” (or overly agreeable and validating) chatbots may entrench beliefs and make it challenging to deploy AI systems that open people up to new perspectives. Across three experiments (n = 3,285) involving four political topics and four large language models, we found that people consistently preferred and chose to interact with sycophantic AI models over disagreeable chatbots that challenged their beliefs. Brief conversations with sycophantic chatbots increased attitude extremity and certainty, whereas disagreeable chatbots decreased attitude extremity and certainty. Sycophantic chatbots also inflated people’s perception that they are “better than average” on a number of desirable traits (e.g., intelligence, empathy). Furthermore, people viewed sycophantic chatbots as unbiased, but viewed disagreeable chatbots as highly biased. Sycophantic chatbots’ impact on attitude extremity and certainty was driven by a one-sided presentation of facts, whereas their impact on enjoyment was driven by validation. Altogether, these results suggest that people’s preference for and blindness to sycophantic AI may risk creating AI “echo chambers” that increase attitude extremity and overconfidence.",

Implanted BCIs can record signals directly from the brain and translate them to computer commands at high speed and fidelity, in a continuous manner. About 100 people worldwide have been implanted with a BCI, all in research settings, and this number is expected to rapidly increase as implanted BCIs become commercially available. Individuals with pediatric onset conditions represent a large proportion of the global burden of complex and severe disability, and will likely benefit significantly from such systems. Despite the progress that is being made in the development of safe, wireless, and highly effective implanted BCIs, none of these have been considered for persons with pediatric onset conditions. Here we present a summary of two years of cumulative effort in establishing a world-first roadmap toward implanted BCIs for youth with complex needs. This roadmap encompasses discussions and findings from multiple transdisciplinary engagement sessions, including the first International Virtual Summit on Implanted BCIs for Children with Complex Needs (February 2024), follow-up themed workgroup sessions (May 2024-March 2025), and a final in-person workshop held at the 11th International BCI Society Meeting (Banff, June 2025). This work aims to provide a visionary, community-and-partner-engaged roadmap for the design, development and implementation of implanted BCIs to enable persons with pediatric-onset conditions.",

          "authors": "Paul Henne",
          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that people tend to use lexical causal statements (like X activated Y) to\nexpress a productive concept of causation—where one event causes another when the first event\nproduces the second—and periphrastic causal statements (like X caused Y to activate) to express\na counterfactual concept—where one event causes another when if the first had not happened,\nthe second would not have too. A critical test for this account comes from the action effect and its\nreversal: in conjunctive structures (X and Z cause Y), people tend to judge actions as more causal\nthan inactions, but in disjunctive structures (X or Z cause Y), people tend to judge actions as less\ncausal than inactions. Critically, productive concepts of causation have no explanation for the\nreverse action effect. So, if people use lexical and periphrastic causatives to express distinct\nconcepts of causation, they should show a reverse action effect for periphrastic but not for lexical\ncausal statements. If, however, people use counterfactual thinking when considering causal\nstatements generally, they should show a reverse action effect for lexical and periphrastic causal\nstatements. In Experiment 1, I replicated the action effect and its reversal with periphrastic causal\nstatements. In Experiment 2, I investigated whether the reverse action effect depends on\ncausative type, and I found the reverse action effect for lexical and periphrastic causal\nstatements. These findings suggest that counterfactual thinking affects causal judgment across\ncausative types, which is consistent with the view that people have a singular, counterfactual\nconcept of causation.",

The present study provides the first nationally representative data on ACEs in Serbia while critically examining current scoring practices and proposing a novel normalized scoring system. Data were collected from a stratified national sample of adults in Serbia using the ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ; WHO, 2018). Thirteen ACE domains were assessed with binary and scaled items. Prevalence was calculated using two recommended WHO scoring methods (binary and frequency), and a new normalized scoring approach in which each domain was rescaled to a 0–1 range. Criterion validity was tested against trauma-related symptoms and physical health outcomes. Prevalence estimates varied dramatically depending on the scoring method: physical abuse was reported by 50.2% (binary) versus 7.8% (frequency), and emotional abuse by 78.8% versus 23.9%. Binary scoring suggested that over half of respondents experienced four or more ACEs, while frequency scoring indicated that 37% reported none. The normalized scoring approach produced more nuanced distributions and showed consistent associations with both trauma symptoms and health outcomes, particularly respiratory and neurological problems. Findings underscore the need for standardized ACE scoring methods. The proposed normalized approach enhances psychometric clarity, facilitates cross-cultural comparability, and improves the utility of ACE assessment for epidemiological research, clinical practice, and public health interventions.",

          "authors": "Mike W.-L. Cheung",
          "abstract": "There are various statistical models with different features and assumptions in meta-analysis. Popular models are, for example, the fixed-effect (or common effect), random-effects, and mixed-effects models. Apart from these models, several alternative models, such as the multiplicative error model (unrestricted weighted least squares model), the hybrid of additive and multiplicative error models, and the location-scale model, have been proposed in the literature. Understanding these models can be challenging for researchers without a solid mathematical background. Implementing or modifying these models is even more challenging for researchers unless they have advanced statistical and programming knowledge. This tutorial elucidates a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework to understand these models. Several R packages are introduced to facilitate the\nspecifications and generation of graphical models for these meta-analytic models. More importantly, researchers may use the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation method to fit these models. This holds significant potential across two domains. First, it can be used as an educational tool in teaching and learning meta-analytic models. Second, the framework supports developing and evaluating novel meta-analytical models,\nwhich have not yet been implemented in current meta-analysis software, fostering advancements in meta-analytic methods. This tutorial also demonstrates with three real datasets how to extend it to address research questions involving complicated meta-analytic models, including nonlinear models, multivariate meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM). Limitations and future directions to extend the SEM-based meta-analysis are discussed.",

Reflexive thematic analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews with menstruating women, provides insights into the complex interplay between hegemonic femininity and menstrual stigma in how women approach menstrual health conversations with each other and healthcare providers. Results illustrated how enacted stigma as well as internalisation of stigma and hegemonic femininity contributed to participants’ sense of anticipated stigma, which inhibited their ability to communicate openly about menstruation outside of close informal support networks. Stigma experiences eroded participants’ trust in healthcare providers, and resulted in self-censorship in conversations about menstruation more broadly. However, the research also shows how empowering positive healthcare interactions can be, and a number of participants engaged in menstrual activism by resisting menstrual taboo. By highlighting the experiences of young women in menstrual health communication, this research contributes to our understanding of the pervasive impact of menstrual stigma and patriarchal norms of femininity, while shedding light on the potential to harness change through supportive healthcare interactions and everyday menstrual activism.",

The current study examined changes in secondary school students’ social and emotional loneliness and problematic social media use (PSMU) following a total smartphone ban, and the extent to which these changes depended on students' initial levels of social avoidance and distress (SAD). Our sample included 982 students (Mage = 14.1) from two Dutch secondary schools implementing a total smartphone ban. Students completed questionnaires about loneliness, PSMU, and SAD before the ban (W1) and three months following the ban (W2). Data were analyzed using difference score and multiple regression analyses. Students used substantially less social media during school breaktimes post-ban compared to pre-ban. Further, we found a small mean-level increase in emotional loneliness from pre-ban to post-ban. While mean levels of social loneliness remained stable, higher baseline levels of SAD predicted increased social loneliness post-ban. There were no changes in PSMU at the mean level nor in relation to students’ baseline levels of SAD. Taken together, we did not find that a total smartphone ban alleviates secondary school students’ loneliness and problematic social media use in the short term. On the contrary, such a ban may entail an initial adjustment period and may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for improving students’ socio-emotional functioning.",

          "abstract": "The achievement goal perspective highlights the importance of mastery-approach goals in facilitating students’ academic achievement. However, a socio-ecological lens would suggest that the effectiveness of these mastery-approach goals might vary across different levels of income inequality, specifically national- and school-level income inequality. Understanding the role of income inequality is essential for advancing a socio-ecologically sensitive achievement goal approach. This study examines whether the association between mastery-approach goals and academic achievement is moderated by national- and school-level income inequality. Our hypothesis is that the adaptive benefits associated with mastery-approach goals are weaker in socio-ecological contexts with higher national- and school-level income inequality. The study involved 273,269 students nested in 10,785 schools from 33 countries. The results revealed that both national- and school-level income inequality significantly moderated the associations between mastery-approach goals and academic achievement in the three focal subjects of mathematics, reading, and science. Both national- and school-level income inequality weakened the positive role of mastery-approach goals, and this was especially pronounced for lower socioeconomic status students. These findings underscore the importance of considering socio-ecological contexts when evaluating the impact of mastery-approach goals on academic outcomes, highlighting the need to address both achievement goals and broader socio-ecological contexts to support academic success for all students.",

DynAffect-C recovers known value-signaling effects and, with regulatory baseline-attraction terms, explains substantially more moment-to-moment variation than value-only models. The model reveals nonlinear pull toward baseline affect, alternating mood states in a subset of participants, and a trade-off between stronger internal momentum and transient impacts of external events.

The most common approach reports a Bayes factor that compares the null hypothesis to a “default” alternative. This approach can show that the data is more likely to have been generated under the null hypothesis than under the specific alternative tested, but it cannot provide evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, analyses using default alternatives can return evidence in favor of the null hypothesis when the data is consistent with medium to large effects. I show that common interpretations of these Bayes factor analyses are misleading, and I provide examples and simulations that help to understand what a Bayes factor in favor of the null does and does not tell us. I argue that Bayes factors have no special ability to help us understand null effects when compared to frequentist methods such as equivalence testing and confidence intervals.",

          "abstract": "Apathy, characterized by diminished motivation and reduced goal-directed behavior, is prevalent in normal aging. Recent evidence suggests that it may result from biases in the evaluation of costs and benefits during decision making. However, most research has focused on simple decisions involving the trade-off between motor or cognitive effort and monetary reward. Meanwhile, it is possible that the disrupted real-life decisions of people with apathy reflect biases affecting many other dimensions of value. Additionally, the extent to which mood symptoms that frequently co-occur with apathy also contribute to biases in decision making is unclear. To address these gaps, we developed a novel online task completed by 158 older adults who first rated everyday activities (e.g., watching TV, going to the park) across 19 value attributes (e.g., enjoyment, social obligation), and then made a series of choices between random pairs of the different activities. A factor analysis of attribute ratings identified three latent factors representing reward, effort, and obligation, which strongly predicted choices and choice response times. Apathy was selectively associated with an overweighting of effort-related attributes in models controlling for impulsivity, depression, or anhedonia; it did not affect the weighting of reward or obligation-related attributes. Interestingly, impulsivity, which was positively correlated with apathy, was associated with an underweighting of effort. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling supported these findings, showing that apathy and impulsivity modulated the influence of effort on the rate of evidence accumulation in opposite directions. Overall, these results suggest that decisions about everyday activities rely on the integration of a wide range of value attributes and that apathy is selectively associated with an overweighting of the effort dimension of value, driving choices away from activities that require greater effort.",

In this study, we investigated how musical predictability and pleasure influenced how non-musicians learned to play short melodies, as well as post-learning recall. Participants listened to and rated perceived pleasure for melodies that varied in predictability while we measured pupil dilation as an index of attention and arousal. Participants then learned to play the ending of each melody. We found that pupil dilation during listening was sensitive to musical predictability and liking ratings, with pupil size increasing for more liked and more predictable melodies. During the motor learning task, participants’ asynchrony scores were modulated by liking and predictability: more predictable melodies resulted in lower asynchrony overall while more liked melodies elicited steeper learning slopes. During recall, more predictable melodies were better recognized. Finally, individuals with better recognition performance also showed greater pupil dilation during the initial listening, along with steeper motor learning slopes.

          "abstract": "Misinformation can negatively impact individual cognition and societal outcomes, but debates persist regarding its definition and scope. We argue that further theoretical and practical progress requires addressing three key challenges: (1) some claims are inherently difficult to identify as objectively false, (2) researchers and the public may not always share a common epistemology, and (3) each of these creates challenges in developing social consensus about what is and is not misinformation. To this end, we introduce a framework grounded in critical realism, which assumes that a mind-independent reality determines the consequences of (mis)information belief, but that evidence can be partial, contestable, and accessed through different psychological and epistemic lenses. Within this framework, we define evidence retrievability as a time-indexed property of claims and distinguish objective misinformation (claims that contradict reality) from attributional misinformation (claims labeled false within a given epistemology). We then present an agent-based model that assigns agents trust weights over different evidence channels, such that epistemic conflict arises when agents discount others’ evidential standards, and epistemic bridging occurs when they adopt them. Our simulations provide an initial illustration of how objective and attributional misinformation can diverge, and that bridging may produce a socially cohesive but objectively false consensus when evidence retrievability is low. We discuss implications for research and interventions.",

          "abstract": "Implicit statistical learning (ISL) is a fundamental cognitive process through which we extract regularities from environmental stimuli. While ISL has several characteristics of unconscious processing (e.g., it operates unintentionally, produces subjectively unconscious knowledge), participants in ISL experiments always report some fragmentary conscious knowledge. Thus, the notion that ISL is truly an unconscious process has been the subject of perpetual debates. In the present study, we challenge the assumption that these conscious reports reflect direct access to the acquired knowledge. Building on predictions from key theories of consciousness and suggestive evidence in the literature, we tested the hypothesis that participants’ conscious reports in ISL reflect a post hoc conscious model of their non-conscious knowledge. Across two artificial grammar learning experiments, participants were exposed to sequences of stimuli (letters, faces, or body movements in VR) generated by different artificial grammars. In a subsequent test, they decided whether novel strings were grammatical or not and reported their subjective awareness trial-by-trial. In both experiments, we found extreme Bayesian evidence that repetitions embedded in the testing strings made participants more aware of the knowledge driving their grammaticality decisions, above and beyond their influence on responses or accuracy. This suggests that, lacking access to the true basis of their decisions, participants attributed their responses to the most salient feature available—the repetitions. Thus, we find evidence that our conscious experience can misrepresent not only the external world but also our own unconsciously learned representations.",

          "abstract": "Who does not like visual illusions? Not only do they offer a wondrous experience to viewers, but they also compellingly reveal the inner workings of our visual system. Out of the myriad of existing illusions, however, rarely are they produced thanks to priors about the physics of our world. Here, we present a novel illusion of this kind — the Double Ring Illusion — which demonstrates that a representation of the physical constraint of solidity (i.e., objects cannot pass through one another) shapes perception. Thus, when viewing ambiguously rotating rings that are compatible with multiple interpretations, the percept is strongly altered by the solidity constraint: Observers predominantly perceive the interpretation respecting solidity rather than the alternative interpretation where solidity is violated. A series of experiments first confirmed that observers reliably experienced this illusion. We then demonstrated that the effects of the illusion influence orthogonal perceptual judgments of object width, thus ruling out decision-level processes as a driver of these effects. Furthermore, we showed that the solidity constraint shapes visual processing even when the stimuli are unambiguous thanks to additional motion and depth information. And finally, we found that the visual system predictably makes use of solidity even in contexts other than the Double Ring Illusion. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of a robust prior for solidity in visual processing, guiding the computations of object motion and interaction.",

          "abstract": "The early school years are a critical period for acquiring essential competencies in mathematics and reading, with learning and anxiety being closely interconnected. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for educators supporting children’s academic development and mental health. The present study examined the development of children's mathematics and reading skills alongside their corresponding anxieties, focusing on how and if these domains influence each other over two time points in grades 2 and 3. A Finnish sample of 800 children (409 girls) was assessed in Grade 2 (N = 668) and Grade 3 (N = 711) using standardized tests for reading and arithmetic fluency, while self-evaluation questionnaires measured reading and math anxiety. The single-domain models for math and reading revealed a bidirectional relationship between math anxiety and arithmetic fluency and a unidirectional relationship between reading fluency and reading anxiety. The cross-domain models revealed only one significant positive cross-domain path from reading fluency to arithmetic fluency. The lack of other significant longitudinal cross-domain associations suggests early domain-specificity. Concurrently, higher math and reading anxiety were associated with lower fluency across domains, but this may be due to being assessed in the same situation. No gender differences were found in the longitudinal associations between skills and anxiety. Overall, the findings highlight that the associations between skills and anxieties become interconnected as early as Grades 2–3, both concurrently and longitudinally, suggesting the emergence of potential reciprocal cycles that may contribute to slower learning and heightened achievement-related anxieties.",

          "abstract": "Background. Gender differences in academic performance are well documented, with boys often outperforming girls in mathematics and girls excelling in literacy. Yet, the psychosocial processes underlying these disparities remain insufficiently understood, particularly in primary school.\nAims. This study tested whether such gaps are already evident in third grade and examined the roles of academic self-esteem, achievement goals, and perceived parental academic involvement as explanatory mechanisms.\nSample. Participants were 185 French third graders (98 girls, 87 boys; M = 8.73 years, SD = 0.36) from 20 classes across eight socioeconomically diverse schools.\nMethods. Students completed standardized mathematics and literacy tests and questionnaires on psychosocial factors. Analyses included t-tests to assess gender differences, hierarchical regressions and mediation models to assess the role of psychosocial factors.\nResults. Boys outperformed girls in mathematics (d = 0.35), whereas girls outperformed boys in literacy (d = 0.52). Comparison of objective vs. subjective performance showed that boys tended to overestimate their abilities in both domains, whereas girls underestimated themselves, particularly in literacy. In mathematics, self-esteem fully mediated the gender gap. In literacy, gender, self-esteem and mastery-avoidance goals contributed to performance, but only mastery avoidance partly mediating the effect of gender on performance. \nConclusions. Mathematics disparities appear primarily driven by self-esteem, while literacy outcomes reflect a more complex influence. Detecting these processes by third grade underscores the need for early interventions that strengthen girls’ confidence in mathematics and reduce avoidance-oriented motivations in literacy.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have documented racialized disparities in school disciplinary practices, with students from stigmatized racialized groups facing harsher punishment than their non-stigmatized peers. These disparities are often attributed to teachers' negative stereotypes. However, psychological theories have largely overlooked the impact of contextual factors, such as racialized segregation and the demographic composition of school environments, on teachers' decision-making processes. Drawing on ecological systems theory, we identify three gaps in the psychological literature on racialized disparities in school discipline: (1) the restricted focus on teachers’ interactions with individual students, (2) the neglect of superordinate contextual levels, and (3) the limited consideration of racialized segregation patterns. To address these gaps, we introduce a context-based discrimination model, which holds that the racialized composition of school settings (classrooms, schools, and surrounding areas) shapes teachers’ social categorization, stereotyping, and decision-making processes. We define context-based discrimination as the phenomenon whereby overall discipline rates between school settings systematically vary with their racialized composition. Crucially, effects of context-based discrimination may not be limited to students from stigmatized racialized groups, but may also affect non-stigmatized peers in a school setting. To understand how inequality is reproduced in educational settings, psychological science must investigate how structural context shapes teacher behavior.",

This study explores the (1) prevalence, (2) quality of in-person and online-only friendships, and (3) age and gender differences in these characteristics among Latin American youth. In Study 1, 5159 students between 10–17 years of age from Peru reported on the prevalence and perceived positive qualities of online-only and in-person friendships. In Study 2, 3154 students from Bolivia and Uruguay reported on the prevalence and positive and negative qualities of their in-person and online-only friendship(s). We analyzed cross-sectional trends in friendship quality (Studies 1 and 2) and, for a subset of youth with available data in Study 2 (N = 516), changes in the prevalence and quality of friendships between two data waves. More than one-third of participants reported having an online-only friend and, on average, declared twice as many in-person friends. Best in-person friendships involved both greater closeness but also greater discord than best online-only friendships. There were no differences in exclusion. Boys reported greater intensity of overall discord towards their best in-person friends and online-only friends compared to girls. In contrast, girls reported stronger closeness towards their best in-person friends than boys. Older adolescents reported stronger closeness towards their best online-only friends than younger adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents rely on in-person friends for positive friendship support to a greater extent than online-only friends. However, despite overwhelming emphasis on the psychological drawbacks of online friendships, our findings suggest these friendships may also be associated with less negative qualities and do not necessarily discourage formation of in-person friendships.",

          "abstract": "While bystander reactions to violence against humans have been well studied, less is known about how people react to animal abuse. We studied whether the same psychological predictors are relevant to reactions to the abuse of animals and humans. We examined the role of Dark Tetrad traits (Narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and sadism), ideologies of superiority (social dominance orientation and speciesism – the belief in human superiority over non-human animals), as well as moral disengagement, self-efficacy, and descriptive social norms in predicting reactions to animal and child abuse. In a survey study (N = 518), participants indicated their general reactions to animal abuse as well as how they would react in a situation depicting the abuse of a dog and a child.  The general reactions to animal abuse were best predicted by the Dark traits and the endorsement of the ideologies of superiority, most significantly, sadism and speciesism. Both animal and child abuse elicited high and comparable levels of distress and active response intentions. In addition to the general predictors mentioned above, bystander reactions in the case of animal abuse were predicted by lower moral disengagement and perceived self-efficacy, while it was moral disengagement alone that predicted reactions to child abuse. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the relevant psychological aspects of reactions to violence and empowering citizens to react more actively to abuse and violence.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Determining which interventions meaningfully foster students’ socio-emotional learning (SEL) remains an urgent concern in educational and psychological research. Valid statistical conclusions about an intervention’s effect, however, require robust experimental designs with adequate sample sizes. Therefore, the availability of appropriate and reliable estimates of design parameters for a priori power analyses is crucial.\nMethods. To generate a comprehensive database of design parameters for SEL research, we analyzed data from nine German probability samples involving students in grades 1 to 13. These data covered self-oriented, other-oriented, and task-oriented domains of SEL outcomes, assessed via student self-report, parent rating, and teacher rating methods. Using linear and multilevel regression modeling techniques, we estimated the following design parameters: Intraclass correlations at the classroom and school level as well as the proportions of variance explained by different sets of covariates (sociodemographic characteristics, baseline measures, their combination) at the student, classroom, and school level. We also derived meta-analytic summaries of these design parameters, broadening their applicability.\nResults. The compiled SEL design parameters along with meta-analytic summaries span both the overall student population and subpopulations defined by academic tracking. This provides a flexible foundation for a range of study designs, including single-level (non-clustered), two-level (students nested within schools), and three-level (students nested within classrooms nested within schools) randomized experiments.\nDiscussion. The present database, complemented by extensive supplemental material, serves as a curated and practical resource for planning sufficiently powered randomized intervention studies targeting students’ SEL outcomes.",

Our objective in this research was to rely on the MEP to further our understanding of athlete perfectionism on two key points. First, we focussed on a scale designed to measure dispositional perfectionism and excellencism – the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism (SCOPE) – and tested the factor structure of an adapted version of the SCOPE for athletes (SCOPE-A). Second, we addressed the substantive question of whether perfectionism, beyond excellencism, is beneficial, unneeded, or harmful for athletes’ thriving (i.e., experiencing high levels of well-being and performance satisfaction). We analyzed data collected across four samples of athletes (total N = 1,549). The results of confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses provided evidence to support the factor structure of scores from the SCOPE-A, and the conclusion that, when it comes to athlete thriving, perfectionism is almost always unneeded and excellencism is almost always good enough. These results shed new light on the connection between excellencism, perfectionism, and athlete thriving, and contribute to future research examining the effects of excellencism and perfectionism in athletes using the SCOPE-A.",

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

However, responsible deployment requires controls around non-deterministic outputs and safety evidence.\n\n\nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate the user safety risk and early signals of clinical effectiveness of a clinician-curated generative AI care agent for anxiety and depression symptoms, using large-scale simulation and real-world testing.\n\n\nMethods: The digital program investigated delivers a structured Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) skills training program through a constrained generative AI architecture. A multi-agent safety system combining synthetic high-risk scenario testing, automated harm detection, and clinician oversight was developed to ensure user safety. Safety and early indications of symptom reduction were assessed through 1) evaluation of 43,325 simulated responses to a mix of high and low-risk synthetic patients, and 2) in a 2-week prospective study of US adults with moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression (N=85).\n\n\nResults: In simulation experiments, potentially harmful outputs occurred in &lt;1 in 10,000 responses (0.01%, 95% CI [0.01%, 0.03%]); none encouraged harm to self or others, judged or actively invalidated the user, or used offensive language. In real use, no harmful outputs were observed (&lt;1 in 12,000), no serious adverse events occurred, and deterioration rates were 5% and 3% for anxiety and depression symptom scores respectively (within expected bounds for psychotherapy). Clinically meaningful reductions were seen for anxiety (B = −5.3, d = 1.1) and depression (B = −5.8, d = 1.2) symptoms, with &gt;50% of users meeting responder criteria after a median of ~90 minutes of use.\n\n\nConclusions: A constrained generative AI architecture with multi-layered safety oversight can deliver clinically aligned and safe mental health support. Although controlled trials are needed to confirm intervention effectiveness, this dual evaluation, combining high-throughput simulation with real-world deployment, offers a scalable model for the responsible use and continual evaluation of generative AI in mental healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Prior knowledge strongly influences memories for new experiences, typically distorting a new experience to better ‘fit’ within our prior conceptions. While conceptual features, like category membership, have long been shown to induce memory distortions, perceptual features of to-be-remembered information, like color, can also distort memories. We investigated whether conceptual and perceptual features of new episodic memories – when in competition – equally contribute to a memory’s distortion, or if there is a hierarchy of featural influence. To do so, we used a spatial learning task that has been shown to induce distortions in new location memories due to the influence of prior knowledge. Image locations were organized by conceptual or perceptual features (e.g., separate clusters of birds and blue things), and some images were placed in locations that conflicted with one or both cluster types (e.g., a raven placed away from most birds, a blueberry placed away from most blue things, a blue jay placed away from both). Memory distortion was measured as the extent that these conflicting images were retrieved closer to their respective cluster locations relative to their encoded locations. We observed that in isolation, both conceptual and perceptual features contribute to memory distortions of equivalent magnitude, but when competing, images were predominantly biased toward their conceptual cluster. This greater conceptual distortion persisted even when changing the encoding task to one that prioritizes processing of perceptual features. These results suggest that conceptual features play a privileged role in the organization of new long-term memories regardless of encoding demands.",

          "abstract": "Cross-modal correspondence refers to systematic association between features across sensory modalities, such as lightness and pitch. While previous research suggests that correspondence enhances working memory, the conditions under which these effects emerge remain unclear. This study examined how lightness and pitch audiovisual correspondence influences visual working memory using an orientation change detection task, with visual stimuli paired with high- or low-pitched sounds across corresponding, non-corresponding, and visual-only conditions. We also manipulated perceptual load, memory stage (encoding vs. recall), and attentional focus on the auditory modality. \n\nOur design enabled us to isolate the contribution of cross-modal correspondence under varying cognitive demands. Under low load, sounds improved performance regardless of their correspondence, likely by enhancing alertness. Under high load, performance improved only when audiovisual correspondence was present and irrespective of attentional allocation. \n\n These findings suggest that lightness-pitch correspondence influences memory under increased cognitive demands, supporting predictions from Bayesian models of learned associations.",

          "abstract": "Over the last 20 years, personality development has become one of the most widely studied topics in personality science. However, evidence on normative and event-related personality development stems almost exclusively from Western countries, providing limited insight into the cross-cultural generalizability of personality trait changes. To address this limitation, we used data from the Africa Long Life Study to examine personality development in young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa over 1 to 2 years (N = 2,382). We found that the cross-cultural Big Two personality traits – Agency and Communion – were moderately rank-order stable over 1 year, with test-retest correlations of r = .38 to r = .55. In contrast to our expectations, Agency and Communion significantly decreased across the study period. Finally, using open-ended questions, we investigated the most important life changes of our participants and examined their associations with personality trait changes. We found that personality trait levels predicted the occurrence and perception of life events, while the occurrence and perception of life events, in turn, predicted personality trait changes. Overall, our findings were partly in line with but also partly diverging from findings on personality development from Western countries. This suggests that insights into personality development cannot automatically be generalized across cultural contexts but that a careful examination of which personality development phenomena are universal and which are culture-specific is warranted. Our study provides initial indications that environment-driven personality trait changes may be a mechanism of personality development that generalizes across cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether listening effort, as measured by pupil dilation and perceived listening effort (PLE) ratings, varies depending on whether the speech is produced by a speaker with mixed spastic-flaccid dysarthria secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus a neurotypical speaker, and whether the listener accurately perceives the spoken phrase.\n\nMethod: Thirty-four listeners completed a speech perception task while an eye-tracking camera tracked their pupil dilation. Phrases in the task were produced by a speaker with dysarthria secondary to ALS and a neurotypical speaker. After hearing each phrase, listeners repeated what they heard and rated PLE on a 7-point Likert scale. Phrase repetition accuracy (accurate vs. inaccurate) was determined from their verbal response. Generalized additive mixed-models (GAMMs) were used to evaluate the relationship of the speaker type (ALS vs. neurotypical), phrase repetition accuracy and their interaction with pupil dilation. PLE ratings were similarly evaluated using linear mixed-effects (LME) models.\n\nResults: Both pupil dilation and PLE ratings were greater when presented with the phrases produced by speaker with dysarthria relative to the neurotypical speaker, even when the phrase was accurately perceived by the listener. Inaccurately perceived phrases were associated with greater pupil dilation and PLE ratings than accurately perceived phrases. Interaction effects were revealed between speaker type and phrase repetition accuracy for pupil dilation but not for PLE ratings. Additionally, pupil dilation results indicated that the allocation of effort over time differed between the trials produced by both speakers.\n\nConclusions: The results suggest listening effort is increased overall when listening to speaker with dysarthria compared to neurotypical speech, even when intelligibility is preserved. Although there was some overlap in the results for the pupil dilation and PLE ratings, notable differences suggest these measures are likely sensitive to distinct factors influencing listening effort.",

          "authors": "Heiner Rindermann",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, the average age of parents at the birth of their children has increased. Older parents have generally completed their education, are emotionally more mature and usually have work experience and their own income, which can be an advantage for their children’s development. On the other hand, the risk of mutations (in the father) increases as the parents get older, and there are also general health risks (especially in the mother). This means that both positive and negative factors for cognitive development are linked to the age of the par-ents. In our study with five diverse samples from different ethnic backgrounds, we covered an age range of 6 to 18 years (primary and secondary schools in Austria and Ecuador, N=920), used tests for both fluid and crystallized intelligence, and used target-specific measures for control variables. We calculated correlations and regressions between parental age and chil-dren’s intelligence (controlling for parental education, parental income, number of children, birth order and sex of children). Positive (linear) correlations were found in four out of five samples, on average r=+.10 to r=+.11 (N=920). Curvilinear (quadratic, inverted U-shaped) correlations are higher than linear ones (R=.20). The association with the age of the mother is somewhat stronger (father RF=.16 vs. mother RM=.19). The effect of parental age remained positive when other family variables were taken into account in a regression: beta=+.19. The par-ents’ level of education was more relevant (beta=+.28). Even if the possible effects are not large, there are predominantly positive (statistical) effects of the age of parents at the birth of their children on the development of their children. The slight inverted U-shaped curvilinearity in-dicates an optimal age for expectant parents of around 25/30 to 40 years.",

          "abstract": "Humans are social, yet during moments of distress, brief time alone helps recovery. We ran two ecological momentary assessment studies – with adult (N=110; 6 prompts/day for 7 days) and preregistered adolescent sample (N=69; 6 prompts/day for 10 days). General negative experiences (negative emotions, worsened mood) predicted higher odds of preferring solitude, and so did social experiences (loneliness, high social load). Preference for solitude under distress emerged despite whether the person was with others or alone, so it is not just about wanting to get out of unpleasant social encounters. In adolescents, while such desire for solitude is generally avoidance-driven, those prone to social stress also preferred this time for regulatory aims – rest,  autonomy, and reflection. Overall, the patterns support an allostatic view: the everyday desire for time alone is to help manage demand, not merely to escape; it highlights moments when withdrawing, rather than seeking more socialization, may be preferable.",

However, after many decades of research, the evidence for a birth order effect is scarce at best. Less is known about the role of birth order for social relationships, in particular romantic relationships. This paper re-examines a previously reported finding that firstborns report less romantic jealousy than laterborns. We present data from four samples (total n &gt; 950) with a MANOVA design, mirroring the study on which this original claim was based. Across all samples and multiple robustness checks, we found no statistical support for the claim that firstborns report less jealousy than laterborns. Both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses did not support a birth order effect on jealousy (frequentist estimate:  r = .08, 95% CI [-.018, .172]). These findings challenge the notion of birth order as a significant predictor for romantic jealousy and suggest that research on romantic relationships may yield greater insight by focussing on other individual difference variables than birth order.",

          "authors": "Jordan Poppenk",
          "abstract": "Here I advance an account of hippocampal memory grounded in three features: locally integrated computation; representational plasticity; and graded long-axis receptive field sizes. Together, these premises reposition the hippocampus as a multiscale integrator, in which variable tolerances for pattern overlap are fundamental to operation. Lower tolerances (associated with the posterior hippocampus; pHPC) elicit frequent “trace breaks” in memory integration, yielding temporally dense and structured representations with high retroactive interference. These traces comprise an episodic memory store of detailed, sequential, and infrequently accessed information. Higher tolerances (associated with anterior hippocampus; aHPC) elicit less frequent trace breaks, yielding a lower density of sparse, accessible representations that support an atemporal and non-episodic hippocampal memory store of information integrated over overlapping events. By layering these experiences using non-monotonic learning rules, this store establishes summaries and inference without executive overhead, while also supporting episodic search and prospective thinking. Because these memory systems emerge from divergent tuning of a common hippocampal architecture, they share features such as shared circuitry, rapid encoding, and cortical reinstatement. I describe this more integrative aHPC store as tableau memory, based on its temporally folded synthesis of events, and propose testable predictions in the domains of list-learning, novelty, and contextual processing. By abstracting experiences persistently and automatically, this store helps to reconcile the hippocampus’ known roles in memory specificity and integration, and to support constructive operations required for numerous non-memory functions. Overall, the model reframes hippocampal memory as a system that captures and mobilizes meaning across a variety of biologically relevant timescales.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas; Melanie B. Fessinger",
          "abstract": "Research Summary\nWe compared ratings provided by 355 judges and 372 laypeople on the ethicality of various prosecutorial behaviors and whether they should be investigated as possible misconduct. Most prosecutorial behaviors were sourced from exoneration cases and varied from highly egregious misconduct (e.g., manipulating exculpatory evidence) to more questionable in nature (e.g., opposing a defense expert witness on Frye grounds). Results showed that laypeople had generally stricter ethical standards—perceiving acts as more unethical (d = 0.36) and more worthy of investigation (21 of 27 acts; 77%) compared to judges. Notably, however, this varied based on individual acts. For some acts, specifically those with clearly established legal rules, judges had stricter ethical standards instead. Overall, our data showed wide variation in ethicality and investigation judgments across individuals, across respondent type, and across specific acts. \nPolicy Implications \nLaypeople were more skeptical of prosecutorial discretion than judges—a skepticism that may be justified given that many of the behaviors stemmed from wrongful conviction cases. Yet, as experts, judges are in a better position to identify and report misconduct. This discrepancy between who perceives and who reports misconduct may partly explain why misconduct is seldom investigated or sanctioned. Laypeople, however, are not powerless to mitigate such injustices. As jurors, awareness of misconduct can protect them from being unduly influenced by improper prosecutorial tactics. As members of the court of public opinion, laypeople shape narratives about justice processes, apply pressure for institutional accountability, and can mobilize collective action when official outcomes clash with public values. Most critically, as voters, laypeople influence the platforms on which prosecutors run and who ultimately gets elected, which can help drive more ethical institutional norms within prosecutors’ offices. Our results highlight the challenges facing prosecutorial oversight and accountability, underscoring the roles that judges and laypeople can play in addressing them.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of religious beliefs and practices is puzzling from the evolutionary viewpoint, but previous research suggested that religious traditions provide cooperative benefits and improve well-being. Seemingly in contrast with this claim are worldwide secularization trends where people disaffiliate from religions and belief in god(s). Theoreticians suggested that diminished pressures on cooperation and well-being no longer motivate individuals to seek religious benefits and pay the participation costs. We investigate this causal claim using the National Study of Youth and Religion dataset, which tracks the development of religiosity among US Christians from adolescence to young adulthood (n = 3 370). Using a general lagged panel methodology, we found that material security in Wave 1 (early adolescence) predicts higher probability of decrease in belief in God in Wave 4 (young adulthood). This result provides support for the hypothesis that participation in religious traditions is associated with living in an insecure socio-ecology, where the systems may still confer benefits onto their members. We conclude with a call for further research using more nuanced measures and larger sample sizes that may provide further insights into the potentially adaptive  nature of cultural systems.",

          "abstract": "For decades, investigators have been wary of subjective measures of visual mental imagery such as the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) and have sought an objective alternative. A method for substituting a measure of hippocampal asymmetry for subjective measures of visual mental imagery ability is presented. Individual differences in VVIQ scores were shown to be strongly associated with left-right (L/R) asymmetry in hippocampal subfields. In samples of 20 and 53 healthy people, and 38 people with neurological conditions, a significant relationship was found between L/R hippocampal subfield volume ratios and VVIQ scores. A regression of VVIQ scores against hippocampal subfield asymmetry variance yielded R-squared values of .91, .91 and .99 respectively. A sample of 201 participants with the Memory Experiences Questionnaire yielded R-squared equal to 1.0 for the association between memory imagery experience and hippocampal L/R subfield asymmetry variance. A measure of anterior/posterior hippocampal asymmetry variance also yielded R-squared equal to one for its association with imagery ability. These finding points to a robust link between hippocampal asymmetry variance and the vividness of mental imagery. The greater variability in hippocampal subfield asymmetry may reflect enhanced lateral specialization and functional differentiation to support richer VMI. Individual differences in neuroanatomical asymmetry of the hippocampus appear to play a previously underappreciated role in controlling mental imagery experience.",

Study 2 (N = 44,458 participants from 52 countries) focused on interest groups-related COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs - a measure not explicitly refering to government actors. Moving to the individual level, Study 3 (N = 278) examined relationships between perceived societal freedom and various conspiracy beliefs, while Study 4 (N = 246) experimentally tested whether manipulating perceptions of societal freedom affected belief in generic conspiracist beliefs as well as those related to vaccines and financial crises. Results indicated that both greater societal freedom and higher perceived societal freedom are associated with lower levels of conspiracy beliefs. In Study 5 (N = 592), we examined the psychological mechanisms mediating the relationship between perceived societal freedom and conspiracy beliefs and found the significant indirect effect of political anger. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of how both macro-level conditions can be incorporated into efforts to reduce the prevalence of conspiracy theories.",

          "abstract": "Sharing a task in the real world can be more efficient than doing it alone. However, psychology experiments using shared task paradigms have often revealed a cognitive cost from working together. Research on joint action has shown how people track and prioritise the actions and intentions of task partners even when this generates cognitive interference and impairs performance. In contrast, we present four experiments using the picture–word interference (PWI) task in which joint action removed cognitive interference and facilitated performance. In the standard PWI task performed alone, participants respond to target pictures while ignoring distractor words written on top. If picture–word pairs are related (e.g., apple–orange) then responses are slowed compared to when they are unrelated (e.g., apple–book), known as semantic interference. In our joint version of the task, we removed semantic interference by telling participants they would be collaborating with a partner who was responsible for the distractor words (Experiment 1, N = 77). Furthermore, interference was only removed when participants believed that their partner was responding specifically to the words (Experiment 2, N = 78), was perceived as high in social status (Experiment 3, N = 80), or high in task competence (Experiment 4, N = 76). We propose this demonstrates how people can deprioritise information associated with partners on shared tasks. In doing so, they can reduce their own cognitive demands by leveraging the cognitive resources of others to support an efficient division-of-cognitive-labour. We term this social offloading.",

          "abstract": "Humans are efficient at learning new behaviors through verbal instructions, bypassing the need for trial-and-error learning, but requiring a certain degree of cognitive flexibility. Recent theories suggest that abstract functions of cognition, like cognitive flexibility, can be (up)regulated by contextual features in our environment with which they are associated. Here, we tested whether people show a more flexible control mode in contexts where one frequently learns new task instructions. Specifically, participants had to encode and execute a series of new task instructions, and the likelihood of encountering a new (relative to old) task instruction varied in function of whether the instruction was presented above versus below the center of the screen (Experiment 1, n = 40), or in a blue versus green font (Experiment 2, n = 40). We measured the level of interference from retained new task instructions on secondary task performance to index cognitive flexibility, and show enhanced flexibility (i.e., enhanced receptibility for new task instructions) for contexts in which the likelihood of encountering new task instructions was relatively high.  Similarly, participants were also faster to encode new instructions in these contexts. A third, online study (n = 77) replicated the main finding of Experiment 2, whose context manipulation (i.e., font color) was most effective. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive flexibility can bind to, and be signaled by, contextual features in our environment. Such ‘learning when to learn’ provides a (self-)regulating mechanism for the cognitive processes that support the encoding (and execution) of new task instructions.",

This study examines the cultural foundations, conditions, expressions, and outcomes of listening through a qualitative analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews with Israeli participants. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we identified five interrelated themes showing how listening is shaped by relational closeness, emotional safety, internal motivation, behavioral expression, and emotional impact. Participants described listening as an intentional and emotionally effortful process, grounded in trust, cultural norms, and personal willingness to remain present. It was experienced not only through visible behaviors but through authentic emotional presence and attunement. Crucially, listening was described as the most vulnerable and most revealing in contexts of conflict, emotional strain, or power asymmetries, where relational and ethical demands intensify. These findings highlight listening as a culturally situated, interpretive practice shaped by collective norms, emotional intensity, and social hierarchy. This study contributes to context-sensitive models of listening with implications for interpersonal relationships, organizational leadership, and intercultural communication, particularly in high-conflict or culturally diverse environments where listening serves as a key relational and managerial resource.",

Here, we assessed the psychometric properties of Western-derived instruments, prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms, association with psychosocial and socio-demographic factors, and symptom network structures in a large multi-year sample of Kenyan adolescents. \n\nMethods: We administered depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), social support, perceived control, and wellbeing measures to 7,865 Kenyan secondary school students aged 13-20 across three studies (2021-2023). \n\nResults: Both PHQ-8 (α = 0.70) and GAD-7 (α = 0.78) showed adequate reliability. Factor analyses yielded 1-factor structures with good model fit (PHQ-8: RMSEA=0.052, CFI=0.945; GAD-7: RMSEA=0.056, CFI=0.970). Overall, 30.3% and 25.1% met clinical cut-offs for depression and anxiety, respectively, with striking temporal variation: prevalence peaked in 2021 (41.9% depression, 37.7% anxiety), decreased in 2022, then partially rebounded in 2023. Mixed-effects modeling revealed social support (B = -0.10 for depression, B = -0.11 for anxiety) and perceived control (B = -0.27 for depression, B = -0.22 for anxiety) as robust protective factors. Final school year students showed elevated risk (B = 1.41 for depression, B = 1.36 for anxiety). Students in girls' schools demonstrated significantly higher symptoms (B = 1.57 for depression, B = 1.48 for anxiety) compared to mixed-gender schools. Contrary to expectations, minority tribal status showed no significant associations with either depression or anxiety symptoms. Academic performance demonstrated clear dose-response relationships, with excellent performance associated with substantially lower depression (B = -2.54) and anxiety (B = -1.78) symptoms. Network analysis identified worry-related anxiety symptoms as most central, with hopelessness and nervousness serving as key bridges between depression and anxiety domains. Elevated-symptom groups showed higher network connectivity (global strength = 3.58 vs 3.26). Multidomain analysis revealed optimism as the most central variable across psychological domains. \n\nDiscussion: Western-derived measures met psychometric standards with Kenyan adolescents. Depression and anxiety showed high prevalence with pandemic-related temporal patterns and significant associations with academic stress, school environment, and psychosocial resources. The elevated symptoms in girls' schools highlight important environmental factors requiring further investigation. Network findings identify potential intervention targets and demonstrate how mental health symptoms embed within broader psychological systems in this understudied population",

          "abstract": "Are children and adults sensitive to gaps in their knowledge, and do they actively elicit information to resolve such knowledge gaps? In a cross-situational word learning task, we asked 5-year-olds, 6- to 9-year-olds and adults to estimate their knowledge of newly learned word–object associations. We then examined whether participants preferentially sampled objects they reported not knowing the label in order to hear their labels again. We also examined whether such uncertainty-driven sampling behaviour led to improved learning. We found that all age groups were sensitive to gaps in their knowledge of the word–object associations, i.e. were more likely to say they had correctly indicated the label of an object when they were correct, relative to when they were incorrect. Furthermore, 6- to 9-year-olds and adults—but not 5-year-olds—were more likely to sample objects whose labels they reported not knowing. In other words, older children and adults displayed sampling behaviour directed at reducing knowledge gaps and uncertainty, while younger children did not. However, participants who displayed more uncertainty-driven sampling behaviour were not more accurate at test. Our findings underscore the role of uncertainty in driving 6- to 9-year-olds’ and adults’ sampling behaviour and speak to the mechanisms underlying previously reported performance boosts in active learning.",

          "authors": "Jicheng Chen; Jia Jiangkun; Jia Ensuo; Han Mengmeng; Huang Liwen",
          "abstract": "Natural science is founded on materialism. We treat the independent relationship between inner experience and outer physical entities as an axiom. This cognitive paradigm has successfully explained many natural phenomena; however, certain phenomena, such as those in quantum mechanics and psychological experiments, challenge this view, suggesting the inseparability of the inner and outer. Yet, the inner and outer appear to be distinct categories of existence, and experimental models demonstrating their transformative relationship remain lacking. This has led to issues like the explanatory gap. We propose that adopting holism is a potential solution to reconcile this dilemma: the inner experience can be objectively described and possesses objective causal efficacy. According to holism, objective reality and a causal relationship are not absolute but inseparable from the cognitive perspective. Materialism's view that the inner and outer exist as independent relations is an underlying assumption based on the third-person perspective rather than an axiom. From the third-person perspective, the physical properties of things are described, and we establish a causal relationship confined to spacetime, where things interact through physical medium. This cognitive perspective excels at describing the laws of motion governing simple systems but simultaneously introduces limitations, such as the explanatory gap. From the first-person perspective, the holistic attributes of things can also be objectively described. \"Inner\" and \"outer\" can be seen as two different states of experience, and things here interact holistically without a physical medium, forming causality unrestricted by spacetime. This perspective excels at revealing the laws governing complex systems/phenomena and can reconcile the explanatory gap. These two cognitive perspectives, although superficially opposed, are functionally complementary. Therefore, the generalized complementarity principle based on holism provides a falsifiable research approach for the \"subjective\" interpretation of quantum theory, potentially reconciling the contradictions between quantum theory and relativity. Holism also offers a solution for reconciling divergent viewpoints among consciousness theories, enabling phenomena related to consciousness across multiple disciplines to be explained within a unified theoretical framework. To test these hypotheses, we propose an experimental model to demonstrate that, similar to the role of force that we revealed in the third-person perspective, holistic interaction without a physical medium from the first-person perspective is also an objective way of interaction between things. Under holistic interaction, the inner experience, as a holistic attributes of things, can also produce observable and objective causal efficacy.",

Während ihre Relevanz auf internationaler Ebene hinlänglich nachgewiesen wurde, verläuft die Entwicklung im deutschsprachigen Raum langsamer, und es fehlt an wissenschaftlicher Evidenz zur Wirksamkeit pflegerischer Interventionen.\nZielsetzung: Darstellung und Analyse der Wirksamkeit psychiatrisch-pflegerischer Interventionen auf Basis randomisiert kontrollierter Studien (RCTs) einschließlich Metaanalysen.\nMethode: Es wurde eine narrative Literaturübersicht unter Verwendung von PubMed, Embase und CINAHL durchgeführt (Zeitraum: 2015–2025). Eingeschlossen wurden RCTs, systematische Reviews und Metaanalysen, die Interventionen untersuchten, welche von psychiatrischen Pflegefachpersonen durchgeführt wurden. \nErgebnisse: Es wurden 28 RCTs aus 13 Ländern eingeschlossen, die überwiegend in ambulanten bzw. gemeindenahen Setting durchgeführt wurden, häufig mit Fokus auf Personen mit Schizophrenie oder anderen schweren psychischen Erkrankungen. Die Interventionen lassen sich vier Gruppen zuordnen: psychologische/psychotherapeutische, psychosoziale/selbstmanagementorientierte, ganzheitlich-kreative sowie strukturell-systemische Ansätze. Die untersuchten Outcomes waren vielfältig, ließen sich jedoch in Symptome, Recovery-bezogene Perspektiven, soziale Teilhabe sowie Gesundheitsverhalten bzw. Inanspruchnahme von Diensten einteilen. Positive Effekte wurden konsistent für psychische Symptome, soziale Funktionsfähigkeit und Gesundheitsverhalten berichtet. Die Ergebnisse für Adhärenz und Krankheitseinsicht waren heterogen, während die meisten Studien überwiegend keine klaren Effekte für körperliche Parameter zeigten.\nSchlussfolgerungen: Psychiatrische Pflegeinterventionen zeigen ein deutliches Potenzial zur Verbesserung patientenbezogener Outcomes. Ihre breitere Implementierung im deutschsprachigen Raum erfordert gezielte Schulungen, klare Rollenprofile und unterstützende Rahmenbedingungen. Zukünftige Forschung sollte stärker Recovery-orientierte Outcomes, PROMs und PREMs berücksichtigen und Studiendesigns einsetzen, die komplexe pflegerische Interventionen adäquat abbilden.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show impaired social cognition, which may contribute to altered trust judgments and increased vulnerability to health risks like sexually transmitted infections. Along with aberrant salience attribution in SZ, the salience network, a key system for processing socially and emotionally relevant information, might contribute to altered social risk attribution.\n\nMethods: Patients with SZ, a clinical control group of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), and healthy controls (HC) were asked to rate the trustworthiness of persons pre-classified as HIV+ or HIV- based on a previous study, while imagining to be in a dating context. Behavioral ratings during fMRI, post-ratings of trustworthiness, attractiveness, and HIV probability were collected, and brain activity focusing on the salience network and its connectivity were analyzed.\n\nResults: All groups rated HIV+ pre-categorized person as less trustworthy than HIV− ones. SZ patients showed generally higher trust ratings, accompanied by reduced connectivity between the salience network and regions involved in social-cognitive processing. Activation in insula and nucleus accumbens was more influenced by attractiveness in SZ than HC. AUD patients exhibited increased insula connectivity during untrustworthy evaluations, and activation in reward-related brain regions was less modulated by perceived trustworthiness than in HC.\n\nDiscussion: Our findings point to differential biases in trust evaluation across clinical groups, and suggest distinct patterns of salience attribution. In SZ, increased trust and stronger neural responses to attractiveness, paired with reduced integration of risk-related cues, may reflect a diminished ability to detect socially relevant threats. In contrast, AUD patients showed enhanced sensitivity to negative social cues. These results demonstrate how altered salience attribution in trust perception shows differently across disorders, with SZ being characterized by under-attribution of social risk and AUD by heightened threat sensitivity.",

These effects hold across different manipulations of issue\ncongruence, issue salience, threat-related issues, slogans, politicians’ facial dominance,\nintuitive vs deliberative contexts, government versus opposition politicians and countries.\nThe only strong moderator we find is ideology: among right-wing participant candidates\nwith negative tone are more popular than among left-wing and centrist participants.\nTaken together, our findings demonstrate the persuasive power of positive emotional\nappeals, an important message in a time of increasing negativity in politics",

Across a 12-month longitudinal study with more than 2000 adults from four Western countries, we examined the bi-directional relationships between social chatbot use and loneliness. We found consistent evidence that increased social chatbot use predicted increased loneliness, using a single-item measure of emotional isolation. When we used a broader and more stable measure of social connection, we found consistent evidence that feeling less socially connected predicted subsequent increases in social chatbot use; however, chatbot use did not significantly predict decreases in social connection. Taken together, these findings provide initial evidence that being lonely may spur people to seek companionship through chatbots, but that such use may, over time, exacerbate feelings of loneliness. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong conclusions, given the exploratory nature of our analyses.",

          "abstract": "As part of a broader research programme, this paper empirically investigates the direct relationships between three prominent cognitive biases—Overconfidence Bias (OB), Herding Bias (HB), and Decision Avoidance Bias (AB)—and the behavioural outcome of Procrastination (PR) in workplace decision-making. Building upon the theoretical foundation of a preceding study  (Ohms, 2025g), and addressing gaps concerning non-investment contexts and the Singaporean workplace identified in a systematic review (Ohms, 2025h), this study employs a mono-quantitative, cross-sectional survey methodology (Ohms, 2025f). Data were collected from 365 Singaporean employees and underwent validation procedures, including outlier detection, normality assessment, and reliability testing (Ohms, 2025a) to ensure a robust basis for analysis. The paired sample t-tests, correlation analysis, and multiple regression results revealed a highly significant, strong positive relationship between AB and PR (r = 0.797, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, OB exhibits a significant weak negative correlation with PR (r = -0.222, p &lt; 0.001), while HB displayed no significant correlation. Therefore, AB was validated by multiple regression as the only significant predictor of PR in the base model. These findings show that procrastination is directly influenced by cognitive shortcuts, which supports behavioural economics and organisational practice. They also emphasise how crucial it is to address decision avoidance to improve the efficiency of decision-making in Singaporean work settings.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) frequently utilises a “cotherapy” model, in which two therapists jointly support participants or patients through preparation, dosing, and integration sessions. While common in clinical trials, the experience of cotherapy from the participant perspective remains underexplored. \n\nThis qualitative study examined experiences of cotherapy within a trial of psilocybin-assisted therapy for generalised anxiety disorder. Semi-structured interviews with 18 participants (29 interviews in total) were analysed thematically, guided by Affordance Theory to consider how cotherapy dynamics shaped therapeutic possibilities. Three major themes were developed: (1) Dose day cotherapy: safety, trust and the realities of access; (2) Cotherapy influences therapeutic processes; (3) Cotherapy shapes the impact and credibility of therapeutic insights.\n\nTogether, these findings position cotherapy in PAT as both a safety and supportive measure, and a potentiator of therapeutic processes. In the context of a single site with high levels of clinician qualification and training, participants generally valued cotherapy. Insights from this study can guide clinical practice and future research, so that feasibility and accessibility are enhanced while preserving the safety and therapeutic benefits afforded by cotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores how political demands transform into collective rights through a psychological lens, emphasizing the process of naturalization. Building on Moghaddam et al.'s framework, the authors introduce the idea that collective demands, when reframed as rights, are perceived as inherent, timeless, and essential to group identity. The paper discusses psychological mechanisms like essentialism, autochthony beliefs, and collective continuity, illustrating how groups come to view their demands as fundamental aspects of their existence. The authors explore examples from the Middle East’s ethno-political conflicts and food sovereignty movements, showing how rights claims are naturalized to strengthen group identity and mobilize action. However, the paper also highlights the potential negative consequences of this process, such as deepening social polarization and complicating conflict resolution. By framing rights as eternal, these demands become resistant to negotiation, often intensifying divisions rather than fostering shared human values. The study calls for a more nuanced understanding of rights discourse in contemporary political struggles.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): Strategic overcharging involves threatening disproportionately harsh punishment to widen the differential between the potential sentence if convicted at trial (PTS) and the plea sentence. Though larger discounts increase plea acceptance, excessive PTSs can counterintuitively reduce acceptances when holding discount constant. Drawing on anchoring theories, I investigated whether PTSs anchor defendants’ sentencing preferences, alter case appraisals, and influence plea decisions.\n\nHypotheses: I predicted (a) transparently irrelevant numeric anchors would not affect plea decisions; (b) a disproportionately harsh PTS would raise maximum acceptable sentences; and (c) higher sentencing preferences would increase plea acceptance.\n\nMethod: Prolific.com adults read a felony-DUI vignette and rendered a plea decision. Experiments 1 (N = 247) and 2 (N = 193) presented irrelevant anchors (48 vs. 8 months); Experiment 2 framed the anchor as a starting point for adjustment or hypothesis-testing. Experiment 3 (N = 844) presented more severe, prosecutor-threatened PTSs (18 vs. 4 years vs. none).\n\nResults: Irrelevant anchors did not alter plea decisions, ORExperiment_1 = 0.95 [0.57, 1.57]; ORExperiment_2 = 1.01 [0.56, 1.80]. In Experiment 3, the 18-year PTS increased sentencing preferences (d18_vs_4 = 1.04 [0.87, 1.22]; d18_vs_No-PTS = 0.75 [0.58, 0.92], but paradoxically increased estimates of acquittal (OR18_vs_4 = 1.74 [1.25, 2.44]; OR18_vs_No-PTS = 1.56 [1.12, 2.18]), strengthened perceptions of favorable evidence (d18_vs_4 = 0.26 [0.09, 0.42]; d18_vs_No-PTS = 0.22 [0.06, 0.39]), and increased plea rejections (OR18_vs_4 = 8.25 [4.41,15.42]).\n\nConclusions: PTS values may operate through distinct psychological pathways—altering sentencing preferences through less elaborative processes, but case appraisals via more elaborative processes. This challenges the rational-actor model assumption that treats PTS and conviction likelihood as independent, exogenous inputs to defendants’ plea decisions. Practically, overcharging may backfire from its intended strategic goal by causing defendants to overestimate their trial prospects.",

          "abstract": "Objective. The aging of the population has led to an increase in dementia diagnoses, highlighting the importance of neuropsychological assessments. However, several factors, including test anxiety, could significantly impact cognitive performance on these tests. While research has established links between test anxiety and poorer tests results in younger populations, the extent of its effects on neuropsychological testing in older adults remains largely unknown. Method. This study used data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) to examine the influence of test anxiety, assessed in 342 cognitively unimpaired older adults during a standardized clinical assessment (Benson Complex Figure Immediate and Recall Copy, Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test (TMT) part B, WAIS-R Digit Symbol, Craft Story 21 Recall Immediate and Delayed, Number Span Test Forward and Backwards and Multilingual Naming Test (MINT)). The Social Behavioral Observer Checklist was used to categorize participants based on their displaying of self-conscious reactions and anxiety responses during testing. Analyses of covariance assessed differences in performance across the cognitive tasks, adjusting for sex, education, and age. Results. Our study indicated that both anxious and self-conscious individuals performed significantly worse than their counterparts on tasks of delayed recall (Craft Story Recall and Benson Figure recall). Conclusions. These findings suggest that delayed memory is most vulnerable to test anxiety in older adults. Overall, the study emphasizes the relevance of addressing test anxiety in clinical assessments and further investigate the links with anxiety related to dementia to ensure accurate evaluations of cognitive function in older adults.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is to dissociate perception from awareness using\nrigorous, bias-free methods. Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight.

          "abstract": "Classical musicians’ individual practice time is central to their musical life and development, yet little research has examined the cognitive and affective processes that influence its effectiveness. This study investigates boredom, mind-wandering and flow during classical music practice, both on the trait and state level (i.e., during practice in general as well as during a specific session) as experiences associated with practice effectiveness. Classical musicians (N=105) completed two 20-minute practice sessions and filled out questionnaires beforehand, between sessions, and after the second session. Boredom emerged as a clear negative correlate for all performance outcomes: Trait boredom during practice was negatively associated with performance satisfaction, while state boredom was negatively related to both efficacy and creativity in a specific practice session. No significant associations were found between trait or state mind-wandering during practice and any outcome variables. Flow during practice, on the other hand, was positively associated with both efficacy and creativity. These findings suggest that while boredom is robustly linked to poorer outcomes and flow to better outcomes in classical music practice, the same is not true for mind-wandering. A possible explanation may lie in heterogeneous nature of mind-wandering and the relative freedom of practice. Given that boredom was consistently associated with less effective, less creative practice and lower performance satisfaction, whereas flow states were linked to more effective practice and higher creativity, future experimental or intervention-based studies should be developed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which cognitive and affective states influence musicians’ practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Children’s literature can teach life lessons and effective coping strategies, and can be a way to disseminate evidence-based practices (EBPs) for mental health as a universal prevention strategy. We conducted a content analysis on the presence of EBPs for youth anxiety in children’s literature picture books about anxiety. \nMethod: Analytic plan was preregistered on OSF. 1640 books were screened, and 191 books were coded for eight EBPs for youth anxiety: psychoeducation, labeling body sensations, relaxation, identifying/challenging anxious thoughts, problem solving, contingency management (e.g., rewards and praise), approaching-anxiety provoking situations (i.e., exposure), and post-approach processing.\nResults: Characters in the books modeled an average of 2.39 EBPs (SD = 1.76). The most frequently modeled EBPs were identifying/challenging anxious thoughts (60% of books), approaching-anxiety provoking situations (46%), and labeling body sensations (42%). The least commonly modeled EBP was contingency management (7%). Books written by licensed therapists were more likely to demonstrate post-approach processing. Books with self-help information at the end were more likely to model post-approach processing and relaxation skills. Books written for youth age 9-12 years modeled more EBPs than books written for youth age 8 years and younger.\nConclusions: Children’s books on youth anxiety model relatively few EBPs. Although approaching anxiety-provoking situations was one of the most used EBPs, 54% of books with an anxious character do not model having that character face their fears–a key strategy for youth anxiety. Additionally, few books demonstrate use of rewards and praise by caregivers, who often read stories with their children. Clinicians, caregivers, and librarians are encouraged to purchase books written by therapists or with self-help information in the back, given that these books are more likely to model EBPs.",

          "abstract": "Infant vocal production is closely linked to autonomic arousal yet the developmental transition from reflexive vocal production to vocalisations produced independent of internal state remains unclear. Using naturalistic daylong recordings from wearable devices, we examined the relationship between vocal output and heart rate in 92 infants aged 4 to 21 months. Early vocalisations occurred predominantly at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, but this coupling weakened progressively with age. Daylong heart rate time series associated with vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64) and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling confirmed a progressive developmental decoupling. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of both cry and non-cry vocalisations, with higher arousal associated with higher and more variable pitch, more harmonicity and longer duration. Notably, the influence of arousal diminished with age for non-cry vocalisations but remained stable for cries. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to speech communication. Importantly, infants whose mothers responded contingently to a greater proportion of non-cry vocalisations showed significantly greater decoupling, suggesting that caregiver responsivity plays a role in this developmental trajectory.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a pivotal time for peer relationships. However, there is a historic rise in adolescent loneliness, and autistic youth may be at particular risk. Evidence suggests feelings of similarity drive friendship formation and continuation. Youth who feel dissimilar to peers may have fewer opportunities to develop friendships. In the current study, we developed a Perceived Dissimilarity Scale to assess autistic and non-autistic youth perceptions of dissimilarity to other kids in general and to a friend. We then examined if youth perceptions of dissimilarity associated with related constructs and concurrent and future loneliness. 194 adolescents (36% autistic, 36% female, 64% White, Mage = 12.81) participated in the study. At the first assessment, youth self-reported perceived dissimilarity, perceived disconnection and loneliness and completed an fMRI scan to assess neural similarity. At the second and third assessments, youth self-reported loneliness. Exploratory factor analysis indicated we developed a Perceived Dissimilarity Scale with two discrete subscales (kids vs friend) that had high internal consistency across groups (α’s ≥ .80). Autistic youth experienced more perceived dissimilarity, perceived disconnection and loneliness than their non-autistic peers, particularly to kids rather than to a friend. Autistic youth with greater neural similarity reported more perceived dissimilarity to kids, whereas non-autistic youth with lesser neural similarity reported more perceived dissimilarity to kids. Additionally, perceived dissimilarity to kids mediated the relation between group and loneliness. Our Perceived Dissimilarity Scale is a valuable metric for understanding individual differences in youth and may better explain experiences of loneliness than an autism diagnosis alone.",

          "abstract": "A common challenge in longitudinal population-based research is the amount of incomplete and missing data that occurs for failing to complete the protocol, as well as potential loss to follow-up overtime. These types of missingness in a dataset can lead to problems such as biases in parameter estimates and loss of power during statistical testing, and ultimately, interpretation of findings. Yet, few studies report key information about missingness in their sample. Moreover, while a breadth of information already exists on the types of missingness and potential methods for handling missingness, the field lacks details on how to conduct a missingness analysis in a real-world setting. In this tutorial, we illustrate key steps in handling missing data and provide an opportunity for researchers to practice appropriate steps in identifying the magnitude and patterns of missing data, as well as assess both selection and retention bias. We utilize a large publicly available longitudinal pediatric population-based study with a focus on air pollution as the primary exposure and a type of emotional health behavior, known as internalization, as the outcome. We provide the reproducible R code for researchers to be able to easily adapt to their own longitudinal observational study.",

          "abstract": "Multimodal caregiver-infant interactions have both concurrent and long-term impacts of child attention, cognitive and social skills. These multimodal behaviours are manually coded by human researchers, making these approaches susceptible to observer bias, dependent on inter-rater reliability, and substantial demands on time and resources. In this study, we aimed to develop a multimodal machine-learning model that could be capable of automatically detecting and classifying multimodal behaviours from video recordings of caregivers and their infants (N=81; infant mean age = 251.334.9 days) engaging with objects. We focused on four behaviors i.e., caregiver scaffolding, caregiver intrusiveness, infant object engagement and infant distractibility. Low-level features from audio, video, and pose data were extracted using specific AI models, and input into a Transformer-based architecture capable of learning temporal patterns across modalities. Our findings revealed a significant contrast in model performance depending on how the data was partitioned. When the dataset was split such that data from all dyads contributed to the training, validation, and test sets - the models achieved notably high classification accuracy of over 98%. However, following 5-fold cross-validation with dyad-level separation, ensuring that test set dyads were entirely unseen during training and validation, the performance dropped markedly to ~55%. These results suggest that the models did not learn behaviors of interest but instead relied on video-specific or dyad-specific details. This work lays a foundation for future research aimed at refining these models and extending their applicability across diverse caregiving contexts.",

          "abstract": "Students often rely on flawed strategies to compare fractions, focusing on individual components rather than rational magnitudes. Only a handful of studies have explored whether these strategies result in difficulties in other fraction domains or whether they are the consequence of reduced cognitive capacities or attending to the wrong numerical distances (e.g., numerator and denominator distances). Mexican high school students (N=76, mean age=16.18 years) completed a fraction comparison task with pairs either compatible with whole-number rules (e.g., 18/19 vs. 12/19) or misleading (e.g., 23/49 vs. 23/30). Participants completed conceptual and procedural fraction knowledge tests and three executive function tasks. First, cluster analyses revealed that almost half of the students used flawed componential fraction comparison strategies. Particularly, we found two biased (whole-number bias and reverse bias) groups and a third group with overall high performance. Notably, whole-number biased students had lower math achievement, conceptual and procedural fraction knowledge than reverse biased or high-performance students. Next, we probed differences in rational and componential magnitude processing between these groups. Remarkably, both biased groups showed neither rational nor componential distance effects. In contrast, high-performing students' performance was better explained by robust rational distance effects. Together, these results suggest that while fraction conceptual and procedural knowledge distinguish whole-number bias students from reverse-bias and high-performing students, only rational magnitude processing distinguishes between students with flawed strategies and high-performing students.",

          "abstract": "Although moral attitudes are often characterized as stable and rooted in “moral truth,” whether people act on them depends heavily on situational factors. We present a framework for understanding how attitudes, social norms, and perceived control collectively shape moral behavior. People adapt their behavior as they move across social contexts, following norms that either encourage moral behaviors (e.g., expressions of outrage on social media) or restrain them (e.g., professional settings). We explain why people are influenced by norms, focusing on two goals – affiliation (desire to affiliate with one’s group) and accuracy (desire to be morally right in ambiguous situations) – and how these goals become uniquely intertwined in moral behavior. This framework can help explain why people overestimate their willingness to speak out on a moral issue, when people opt out of collective action, and why they engage in moral hypocrisy.",

          "abstract": "How does the brain prioritize information when visual scenes contain multiple relevant features? While emotionally evocative content has long been considered central to attentional capture, recent perspectives highlight the intrinsic relevance of social information. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of these relevance dimensions remain unclear. We co-registered event-related potentials (ERPs) and eye movements while participants viewed complex scenes varying in social content (social, non-social) and emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral). Early ERP responses (P1) showed enhanced amplitudes for positive social images, suggesting that social relevance can mitigate the early-stage negativity bias. Social content also modulated the EPN, while emotional valence shaped later components (P300, LPC), with larger amplitudes for negative scenes. Eye-tracking measures mirrored these effects: initial saccades were faster for social images, and fixation patterns showed increased visual exploration for both positive and negative social scenes compared to neutral. Together, these results support a sequential appraisal process in which social content is prioritized at early perceptual stages, while emotional valence influences later evaluative processing. This pattern challenges the notion of a general negativity bias and highlights the interactive and stage-specific contributions of social and emotional relevance in affective scene perception.",

          "authors": "Christy D. Yoon; Hedda Meadan; Frederick Shic",
          "abstract": "Background: Eye tracking has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing autism research, including diagnostics and interventions. However, studies on joint attention (JA) in autistic children have predominantly concentrated on the responding to joint attention (RJA) construct, with limited focus on the initiating joint attention (IJA) construct. Moreover, despite the interactive nature of JA, researchers have often relied on passive paradigms to study JA in this population. To address these gaps, we developed a gaze-contingent eye-tracking battery targeting three developmentally appropriate JA skills for young children: RJA, IJA to request, and IJA to comment or reference.\n\nMethods: The development process was multifaceted and iterative, involving a series of collaborative steps and the allocation of various resources. These steps included determining the motion format and type of stimuli, designing and prototyping the stimuli, recruiting an actor to serve as a communication partner in the stimuli, recording and editing videos for the stimuli, and building and test-running the battery.\n\nResults: We developed the Interactive Eye Tracking for Joint Attention (IET-JA) battery, which consists of 32 JA stimuli: 16 RJA stimuli, eight IJA-Request stimuli, and eight IJA-Comment/Reference stimuli. The stimuli are dynamic (i.e., videos) and feature a preprogrammed interactive human communication partner who is responsive to the participant’s gaze. The IET-JA takes approximately 8 minutes to complete, and its duration is expected to vary based on the participant’s level of engagement.\n\nConclusion: Implications for advancing methodologies, fostering team science, and enhancing iterative processes are discussed.",

Ethnicity and technology self-efficacy modestly influenced preferences, while cultural influences affected in-person acceptability among specific subgroups (e.g., Arab women). Thematic analysis identified themes: (1) connection and therapeutic presence, emphasising nonverbal cues and physical co-presence for understanding (2) therapeutic space, with structured environments valued for in-person; (3) safety and privacy, emphasising importance of confidentiality and emotional security; (4) practical aspects of online therapy, and (5) perceived suitability of format. \nConclusion: In-person psychotherapy was preferred by most participants, while online delivery was viewed as an acceptable and practical alternative.",

Die Interventionen lassen sich vier Gruppen zuordnen: psychologische/psychotherapeutische, psychosoziale/selbstmanagementorientierte, ganzheitlich-kreative sowie strukturell-systemische Ansätze. Die untersuchten Outcomes waren vielfältig, ließen sich jedoch in Symptome, Recovery-bezogene Perspektiven, soziale Teilhabe sowie Gesundheitsverhalten bzw. Inanspruchnahme von Diensten einteilen. Positive Effekte wurden konsistent für psychische Symptome, soziale Funktionsfähigkeit und Gesundheitsverhalten berichtet. Die Ergebnisse für Adhärenz und Krankheitseinsicht waren heterogen, während die meisten Studien überwiegend keine klaren Effekte für körperliche Parameter zeigten.\nSchlussfolgerungen: Psychiatrische Pflegeinterventionen zeigen ein deutliches Potenzial zur Verbesserung patientenbezogener Outcomes. Ihre breitere Implementierung im deutschsprachigen Raum erfordert gezielte Schulungen, klare Rollenprofile und unterstützende Rahmenbedingungen. Zukünftige Forschung sollte stärker Recovery-orientierte Outcomes, PROMs und PREMs berücksichtigen und Studiendesigns einsetzen, die komplexe pflegerische Interventionen adäquat abbilden.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discriminate experiences in memory is an important indicator of cognitive health in older age, and a sensitive marker of hippocampal integrity. Measures of mnemonic discrimination, such as the mnemonic similarity task (MST) have the potential to become early diagnostic tools of Alzheimer's dementia. It is thus important to understand how hippocampus-dependent memory functions interact with non-mnemonic processes to determine mnemonic discrimination performance. In this study we investigate which features contribute to mnemonic discrimination in younger and older age. First, we found in a sample of younger (n=93, 20-30 years) and older adults (n=103, 65-82 years) that age impacted performance on the MST above and beyond the effect of perceptual discrimination of 2D novel configurative objects. However, the association between mnemonic and perceptual discrimination slightly diverged across age groups. While we found a weak association in younger adults, there was no relationship in the older group. Next, we acquired similarity and feature difference ratings for the MST lures from younger (n=24, 20-25 years) and older adults (n=26, age&gt;65). Using random forest regression and representational similarity analysis, we found that the two groups exhibited unique similarity rating patterns. Finally, enriching our memory data with the feature information, we showed on the trial-level that mnemonic decisions of older and younger adults are affected by distinct object features. Altogether, these results provide evidence that older adults perceive the differences of lure images distinctively, and they may rely on different levels of representations for mnemonic discrimination.",

          "abstract": "As authoritarianism rises worldwide, understanding authoritarian tendencies among ordinary citizens is an increasingly urgent scientific and societal challenge. However, our understanding of individuals’ authoritarian tendencies is limited by thin empirical evidence on their everyday behavioral patterns. Here, we develop a comprehensive behavioral portrait of authoritarianism in everyday life using more than 280 million digital records collected via smartphones. These records include app usage, music listening, keyboard typing, calling and texting, locking and unlocking, and GPS location logs collected over three to six months from 669 volunteers’ smartphones. We processed the digital records using a theory-informed variable derivation approach, enriched them with data from external sources, and analyzed them using interpretable machine learning methods. Our findings are twofold. First, we find that everyday behavioral patterns predicted self-reported authoritarian tendencies independently of, and more strongly than, demographic characteristics typically linked to authoritarianism. Second, we find that behavioral predictors of authoritarian tendencies included reduced exposure to unfamiliar people and cultures, a preoccupation with status and hierarchy, and heightened aggression and emotionality. Notably, patterns of social media use—particularly greater Facebook use—were the strongest behavioral predictors of authoritarian tendencies. Overall, these behavioral patterns provide insight into the psychology of individuals with authoritarian tendencies, advancing psychological theories of authoritarianism. We discuss the implications of our findings for developing behavioral assessments and interventions that document and potentially counter authoritarianism’s rise among ordinary citizens in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to develop “empathic AI” often assume a universal definition for empathy—a singular, objective understanding of “human” experiences. This implies that achieving empathic AI is only a matter of optimization difficulty, where researchers should find the “correct” way to align AI systems with human-like empathy—essentially an engineering problem. In this chapter, we challenge this assumption. We begin by emphasizing the multifaceted nature of empathy. Then, we explore how variations in (1) the multiple forms of empathy and (2) the many groups we are embedded within present significant challenges in creating a universally applicable empathic AI. We discuss the difficulties of codifying empathy (an inherently context-dependent phenomenon) into AI systems, as well as the recent evidence for cultural biases and moral stereotypes in widely used Large Language Models (an important class of AI systems), highlighting the broader ethical, epistemic, and possibly existential issues inherent in designing machines that “understand” or “feel” others as humans do. We conclude by advocating for a more contextualized approach to empathic AI, one that is culture-aware, context-sensitive, and pluralistic, moving beyond the reductionist notion of “humans” as a monolith. We do not intend to address the question in our chapter’s title with a simple yes-or-no answer; instead, we advocate for asking questions such as “What kind of empathy?” and “Empathy for whom?” as researchers and engineers move toward developing more empathic generative language models.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving agency from motion cues is fundamental to social cognition. While goal-directed motion is a well-known agency cue, the role of synchronous motion between inanimate entities remains underexplored. This study examines whether synchrony contributes to agency perception, enhances goal-directed motion cues, and influences metacognitive confidence. In Experiment 1, 78 U.S.-based neurotypical participants watched videos of pre-programmed disc movements, judged whether the discs were chasing, and rated their confidence. Experiment 2 (78 participants) extended the investigation to purposeful interactions beyond chasing. Findings demonstrate that synchrony plays a fundamental role in agency perception, shaping judgments of chasing and purposeful interaction. While chasing perception requires cue integration, with synchrony amplifying directed motion effects, purposeful interaction perception is shaped independently by each factor. Response times and confidence ratings reveal cue integration, suggesting that even when categorical judgments treat cues separately, the perceptual system processes both. Data was collected in August 2024. Age and gender were balanced, but the sample was predominantly White, highly educated, and U.S.-raised, limiting generalizability. While perceptual mechanisms are likely universal, cultural, developmental, and neurocognitive factors may shape higher-level judgments. These findings inform social cognition and interactions with artificial intelligence, highlighting synchrony as key to perceived agency.",

However, such work has primarily been limited to dyads, and little is known about how the sense of agency changes when the number of followers increases. Furthermore, it is unclear if commanding social agents vs. mere physical events changes one's sense of agency. Three experiments, involving making virtual agents clap their hands and/or streetlamps turning on, explore this topic. All three experiments reveal a robust linear increase in explicit agency judgments with follower count. Interestingly, experiments 2 and 3 show that this effect is amplified with human-like avatars (relative to streetlamps), suggesting that there may be something special about commanding a group of human-like social agents. This research provides further insight to our understanding of the sense of agency in group dynamics.",

During this time, while governments were battling the health crisis, musical engagement provided key, individualized coping strategies for laypeople. This was first demonstrated anecdotally in captivating balcony music videos from Italy and Spain and later substantiated in large scale, multi-country survey studies. This chapter reviews the emerging research literature on music listening and making during pandemic lockdown to establish how music became a compensatory source of hedonic pleasure and how it satisfied the need for eudaimonic meaning in life during socially and psychologically impoverished times.",

The utility of the model was assessed by applying it to 30 well-documented real-world cases from a broad range of contexts (e.g., business, education, religion). We asked (a) how well the original 2007 version of the TTM is suited for understanding the dynamics of each case, and (b) which important insights from the case analyses exceed the scope of the TTM, suggesting a need for updates. This article presents a narrative review summarizing the insights that we gained.

          "abstract": "In this article I address different approaches to understanding processes of media-based collaborative knowledge construction. First, I describe various considerations of the nature of knowledge in the history of philosophy with a focus on the age-old epistemological controversy between rationalism and empiricism. Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",

          "abstract": "The balancing of cognitive flexibility versus stability is an important everyday skill that can be learned through reinforcement and may be impaired in autism or other transdiagnostic traits. In this preregistered study (n=412), we show that rewarding people more on task switch trials led them to show more voluntary switching behaviour, but also more task-rule interference. We further show that it is difficult to unlearn this shift along the flexibility-stability trade-off, even when the mapping between task switching and reward reversed. People with more autism traits or an autism diagnosis were equally fast at learning these contingencies but seemed to start from an overall smaller task-rule interference effect and larger switch costs – suggesting they show higher levels of cognitive stability at the cost of less flexibility. These patterns seemed unique to autism, as we failed to observe similar effects in four major transdiagnostic traits extracted from a principal component analysis based on 15 clinical questionnaires.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, demonstrate that numerical magnitude is represented along a left-right continuum. Theories of shared magnitude processing (ATOM) and polarity correspondence suggest that emotional dimensions might be spatialized in a similar way. Across two experiments, we tested whether emotional valence and intensity elicit spatial-emotional associations and whether exposure to emotional stimuli modulates numerical SNAs. In Experiment 1, participants completed a number parity judgment task (NT) and a gender judgment task with emotional faces (FT) that varied in both valence (happy/sad) and intensity (0%, 20%, 80%, 100%). Experiment 2 removed direct valence contrasts by presenting either happy or fearful faces per participant, isolating intensity effects. Across both experiments, the NT revealed a reliable reverse SNARC effect. Crucially, this effect disappeared when the FT preceded the NT, indicating that emotionally salient stimuli disrupted subsequent SNAs. By contrast, emotional intensity produced no consistent spatial mapping in the FT, regardless of valence. These findings challenge the view that emotional magnitude is spatialized like numerical magnitude and instead suggest that emotional stimuli indirectly influence SNAs by taxing attentional or control processes. Emotional salience thus modulates, but does not itself constitute, spatial-magnitude representations.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills.

          "abstract": "Individual family members impact each other and the family system at the physiological, brain, behavioral, phenomenological, and social level. Previous research used established methods, such as self-report and behavioral observation, to provide thorough insights into family dynamics. Here, we aim to complement existing methods and argue for a neurocognitive approach in family research. Neurocognitive tools can provide detailed and nuanced insights into complex family dynamics by capturing behavioral and brain processes at the individual and family level. By measuring neural activity and the alignment of brain activity between family members we can uncover complex recurrent and situation-dependent interactions that so far have remained hidden. Using this approach, we can increase the scope of family research, especially when measuring family members across generations with different levels of verbal ability. It allows to study emotionally interconnected family members across multiple generations. Measuring behavior and brain activity of multiple family members simultaneously is therefore a promising method to reveal additional factors contributing to family well-being and inform theory and practice. As mobile neuroimaging advances, studying family interactions in natural settings, such as the family home, becomes more feasible. This opens new possibilities for family research while simultaneously increasing ecological validity. The neurocognitive approach allows us to understand known and unknown factors contributing to family dynamics and brings a mechanistic understanding closer to “home”.",

          "abstract": "Risk perception is a central concept in the public health and prevention field. Alcohol-related risk perception is distorted in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), but it is rarely employed in substance use research and therapy. The German questionnaire “Form to assess Alcohol-related Risk perception (‘Fragebogen zur alkoholbezogenen Risikowahrnehmung’; FAR) is a 44-item self-report instrument measuring the subjective risk perception of typical dangers caused by hazardous alcohol use (health, risk behavior, social life, work, law). It is based on the theoretical framework of four risk perception domains and allows the quantification of the Optimistic Bias. In this study, we report on the validation of the German 20-item short version, FAR-S.\nWe used two secondary data sets: A first sample of 690 students was used to perform a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. In a second sample of 57 AUD patients discriminant and convergent validity was studied. Furthermore, we examined item characteristics and scale reliability.\nOur results show that the FAR-S replicates the theoretical factor structure, support confirmatory and discriminant validity and prove good psychometric characteristics. The theoretical expected distortion of comparative risk perception in AUD patients in comparison to students was shown.\nThe FAR-S is an economic and valid instrument to assess alcohol-related risk perception. The instrument seems appropriate for a variety of contexts, such as research, prevention, or therapy. Alcohol-related risk perception might provide new insights into important questions like who might develop AUD or relapse; it might allow to study psychological changes along alcohol use careers and to identify new treatment targets.",

          "authors": "Michael Odenwald; Natascha Buechele; Alexander Wolber; Sarah Stumpp; Leonie Lipinski; Brigitte Rockstroh; Daniela Mier",
          "abstract": "Background: How patients perceive the risks related to their antipsychotic treatment (e.g. unwanted side effects) is a crucial factor for adherence; however, our current understanding of cognitive constructs underlying antipsychotic adherence is scarce. Recently, the self-report questionnaire Form to Assess Risk Perception of Antipsychotics (FRA) was introduced. The instrument measures the patients’ subjective perspective of two antithetical aspects of the perceived risks related to antipsychotic medication: risks attributed (1) to continuously taking the prescribed antipsychotics (e.g. probably causing unwanted effects) and (2) to stopping them (e.g. probably causing relapse of psychosis). Based on the two subscales the Difference Score is calculated, indicating which of the two risk perception views is stronger. This paper aims to further validate the FAR and introduces an additional method to calculate a composite Ambivalence Score.\nMethods: Fourty-one inpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (ICD-10; F-2) completed the FRA and further questionnaires during inpatient treatment. Convergent and discriminant validity of previously reported and new scoring methods were examined via correlations with theoretically related and unrelated constructs.\nResults: Our data show the hypothesized contrastive correlations of the two risk perception subscales and the two composite scores with instruments measuring related constructs, i.e. medication adherence, insight into the disorder, beliefs about needing medication or concerns about taking these drugs, distress and tension-relieving impulsive behavior patterns, confirming convergent validity. Lack of correlations with non-related constructs, e.g. emotion regulation and social support, supporting discriminant validity. The combined scores of both contrasting dimensions of risks perception are not related. \nConclusion: Our study lends further support to the validity of the FRA and sheds new light on cognitive processes underlying non-adherence. Since both risk perception subscales and the two composite scores correlate antithetically with different related constructs, this supports that it is promising to consider perceived risks of medication adherence and of medication non-adherence in the assessment of antipsychotic risk perception. Risk perception might be a factor, which can shed new light on the understanding of medication adherence and, thus, might provide new impulses in therapeutic treatment of patients with psychosis.",

Yet, empirical evidence of the impact of adverse life experiences on specific cognitive functions, and decision-making in particular, is scarce. We address this research gap by relating the experience of traumatic events to performance in different decision-making tasks and explored whether the association is mediated by general cognitive indices or psychopathology in SZ and healthy controls (HC).\nIn study 1 (https://osf.io/dw2ps/), we examined the beads task for assessing a jumping to conclusion bias and hasty decision-making, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and a verbal IQ estimate in 97 SZ and 39 HC. In study 2 (https://osf.io/n7z6y), 40 SZ and 36 HC completed the Game of Dice Task (decision-making under risk), the Iowa Gambling Task (decision-making under ambiguity), the n-back task (working memory), a verbal IQ estimate, and the Trauma History Questionnaire.\nIn study 1, we neither found a direct association between ACE and hasty decision-making, nor mediated effects by IQ or psychopathology. Also in study 2, we neither found an association between trauma history and decision-making under risk or under ambiguity, nor any mediated effects by IQ, working memory, or psychopathology.\nTaken together, we find no evidence for an association of ACE/lifetime traumatic experiences and decision-making impairments, independent of the applied measure. This suggests that the assumed impact of adverse life experiences on cognitive functioning in SZ might not extend to decision-making.",

During the last two decades, the research field on ordinality has witnessed a significant rise in studies indicating that performance in different ordinality tasks are significant predictors of mathematics achievement. Crucially however, the research literature on ordinality is characterized by substantial ambiguity regarding its descriptions, measures, and terminology. \nAccordingly, the purpose of the present systematic literature review was to gather, evaluate, and analyze the literature on ordinality from these aspects. In total, 148 articles were included from the research areas of mathematics education and numerical cognition Across these, 151 distinct descriptions of ordinality were identified that clustered into ten categories. In addition, 18 types of measures were used to assess ordinality knowledge, and 638 unique terms referring to the construct were identified. Notably, studies including the same description often used different measures. The results suggested that ordinality cannot be captured by a single description or measure, but should be treated as a multifaceted construct.

          "abstract": "In stratified societies, structural and perceived socioeconomic inequalities increasingly shape adolescents’ learning trajectories—not only through access to resources but also through their self-beliefs and adaptive functioning. This study investigates how both objective socioeconomic status (SES) and perceived academic standing influence the development of general self-efficacy (GSE), a core motivational mechanism linked to learning and well-being. Using longitudinal survey data from 6,994 adolescents in Singapore, we show that subjective perceptions of academic standing significantly mediate the relationship between SES and self-efficacy, underscoring the cognitive salience of relative academic rank in high-stakes systems. We further disentangle adaptability into cognitive, behavioural, and affective domains and identify affective adaptability as the most robust predictor of GSE across all SES levels. Notably, for adolescents in the lowest SES deciles, the predictive value of perceived rank is attenuated, whereas affective adaptability remains a stable, universal predictor. These findings highlight GSE as a malleable cognitive-motivational construct shaped by both sociocultural and intrapersonal factors. We discuss implications for designing equity-oriented learning environments that support emotional adaptability and foster positive learning beliefs, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth.",

Prior research outlines support providers’ traits and methods that may improve support-giving, but the internal and psychological processes that underlie optimal support provision remain unclear. Here, we argue that self-regulation plays a critical and understudied role in giving effective social support. We leverage research on self-regulatory processes to examine how they influence effective support provision. We propose that support providers must first evaluate their aims and prioritize relational goals with recipients, and next utilize self-regulatory processes (e.g., effort, cognitive control) to understand recipient’s goals and deliver support. More effective self-regulation may enhance support exchanges for all involved. This framework generates testable research questions on how people give optimal support.",

          "abstract": "This study examines performance evaluation in perceptual detection tasks using response-time-based signal detection theory (SDT) analysis. A defining feature of detection tasks is the asymmetry between trials with stimulus presence and absence, often reflected in asymmetric type-1 ROC curves. This ROC asymmetry indicates greater signal variability in stimulus-present trials, which contradicts canonical assumptions in equal-variance SDT models. Across multiple datasets, we implemented an unequal-variance SDT model using response time (RT) data, and compared its estimates with those obtained from the traditional confidence-based method. RT-based estimates of SDT parameters, the SD ratio (σ) and mean difference (μ), aligned closely with confidence-based estimates. The resulting sensitivity measure dₐ—an unequal-variance extension of d′—derived from RT and confidence showed strong consistency across all datasets. Notably, the conventional d′ measure consistently overestimated detection performance compared to the dₐ measures, highlighting the importance of accounting for the degree of unequal variance. Our findings demonstrate that RT-based SDT analysis offers a reliable, cost-effective alternative for the precise evaluation of perceptual detection performance, particularly when confidence ratings are impractical or unavailable.",

Nine LLMs models (Deepseek, Gemini, Gemma, GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4, GPT‑4o, LLaMA, Microsoft, StabilityAI) were assessed using automated metrics, including BERTScoreF and ROUGE-L for differences from human-expert generated responses (degree of biasness). Analyses showed that models produced responses that differ lexically and semantically.. Moreover, the significant interaction effects of type of mental health symptom and severity across LLMs and type of social questions were indicative of weaker concordance of reasoning between LLMs and human-expert depending on specific symptom-severity, suggesting potential biases and differential generalization. Research and clinical implications, such as the importance of human expert oversight throughout the development and application of LLMs for mental health use, were discussed.",

          "abstract": "Music psychology researchers have long been interested in how emotions are expressed in music. Increasingly, researchers employ computationally derived measures of emotion (e.g., valence and arousal) from services such as Spotify. These measures are easy to use, but how they are calculated is not transparent. It is not clear whether these computational measures reflect how people rate perceived emotions in music. Addressing this, our study investigated the validity of Spotify’s automated ratings with subjective ratings from actual listeners. Participants were recruited from first-year university student cohorts and the general public (N = 244). Participants listened to 40 song excerpts, approximately 20-30 seconds in length, and rated tracks on their perception of its mood (valence), energy (arousal), danceability, familiarity, and enjoyment. Participant ratings were compared with Spotify’s automated ratings. We found that Spotify audio features energy and valence were positively associated with human ratings for these factors, with a strong relationship for arousal, and moderate relationship for valence. Spotify danceability, however, was not strongly associated with human ratings of danceability. These findings corroborate the utility of the widely used circumplex model for measuring emotions concisely. We further extend this by validating automated emotion ratings, such as those implemented by Spotify’s system, for use in music psychology, and highlight that if used cautiously, this is a useful tool in research.",

          "abstract": "Although people often exhibit temporal comparative optimism—expecting their own future to be better than others’—this pattern reverses when evaluating the natural environment. In this pre-registered brief empirical note, we provide further empirical support for temporal pessimism whereby people anticipate worsening environmental conditions over time, especially for future generations. Using a large cross-cultural sample (k = 110, N = 108,946), we confirmed that people consistently judge climate change as posing a significantly greater harm to future generations than to themselves—a pattern that remained robust after controlling for demographics and multiple comparisons. Exploratory analysis indicated that temporal pessimism was greater among individuals with higher levels of climate worry and in nations with higher GDP per capita, stronger environmental performance, and greater human development, but smaller in nations with higher economic inequality. We discuss the implications of these findings for motivated cognition and climate action.",

          "authors": "Shulang Yue; Iris Vilares",
          "abstract": "Numerous fields have demonstrated that our decisions are guided by social information, and one important piece of social information is social comparison. Previous research has suggested that social status can influence trust, but most prior studies examining the influence of social comparison on trust decisions employed social comparison contexts that potentially “justify” the difference in social status, such as performing better/worse in a task. The current study investigated how, instead, interpersonal trust and risk-related decisions are made after experiencing arbitrarily manipulated social comparison contexts. In addition, the study directly compared people’s behaviors in trust and risk environments under different social positions in a single experimental paradigm. Across two experiments (Experiment 1: discovery sample, N = 302; Experiment 2: validation sample, N = 299), we showed that exposure to randomly manipulated social comparison contexts significantly influenced participants’ economic allocation decisions, their perceived relative ranks, and their reported levels of envy towards their target of comparison. However, our findings suggest that participants’ subsequent decision-making regarding interpersonal trust and risk-taking were not affected by this arbitrary-based social comparison. Our results also show that participants perceived risk and trust environments differently, with smaller amounts invested in the risk scenario than in the trust scenario. Overall, our findings indicate which behaviors and feelings are more likely to be affected by being randomly placed in a favorable or unfavorable social comparison scenario, and increase our understanding of trust and risk across social comparison scenarios.",

Yet studies that explore how young people in the Global South perceive, emotionally respond to, and understand climate change are still scarce. Here, through a nationally representative survey of 2,220 Colombian youth (aged 18–32) we conducted, we examine young people's climate-related knowledge, emotions, and perceived efficacy of environmentally friendly behaviours in a Global South context. We also explore the role of socio-demographic variation in shaping those characteristics. Our findings reveal a high prevalence of negative “eco-emotions” (e.g., anxiety, fear) alongside widespread misconceptions about climate change causes and solutions. Most participants felt worried or fearful about climate change, yet only about one-third correctly identified fossil fuel use as the primary cause (with deforestation often mistakenly perceived as the leading driver). Respondents also overestimated the climate benefits of certain low-impact actions (e.g., banning single-use plastic bags, planting one tree) while under-recognizing higher-impact behaviours. Socio-demographic factors predicted distinct emotional and cognitive patterns: women and students reported more intense negative emotions, whereas rural and lower-income youth were less likely to demonstrate accurate climate change knowledge. Political orientation showed an influence on knowledge without the stark polarization observed elsewhere. Interestingly, colombian youth who fear comfort losses are 13 times more likely to dismiss eco-friendly actions. These findings underscore the need for climate education policy and practice with differential approaches across socio-economic levels in the Global South to empower young people as informed and emotionally-resilient agents of climate action.",

However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to these difficulties are not well established.

We use a converging approach which compares individuals with ADHD against neurotypical individuals and individuals with ADHD off medication against on medication on two conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that ADHD was associated with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both conflict tasks. These findings mark an important step toward elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to real-life challenges in inhibiting distracting information in adults with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: To compare spoken language input to young deaf/hard of hearing (DHH) children with cochlear implants and matched chronological- and hearing-age hearing controls. Method: We used long-form audio-recordings (M=14.3hrs) from 48 6-32mo’s (16/group). We manually transcribed 40min/recording, and ran automated LENA algorithms over the full daylong recording. We computed 10 automated and manually annotated metrics of input quantity, complexity, and conceptual content. We also computed speech outcomes, and linked the input metrics to those outcomes. Results: There were no significant cross-group differences in input quantity, or in any input metrics between DHH and chronological age-matches. The DHH group heard significantly shorter sentences and more highly auditory words than hearing-age matches. While they produced more (and more mature) vocalizations than hearing-age matches, they produced fewer mature vocalizations than age-matched peers. DHH vocalizations also increased less robustly with age. In regression models, only hearing status explained variance in child vocalizations for DHH and hearing-age matches. For DHH and same age matches, age, hearing status (hearing&gt;DHH), input quantity, and shorter MLU input collectively predicted &gt;50% of the variance in children’s vocal maturity. Conclusions: DHH children and hearing children differed little in their language input. Differences from hearing-age controls are likely explained by their younger age. Nevertheless, we find lower rates of child vocalizations in the DHH group and a weaker increase over age.

          "authors": "Daria Khanolainen; Elena Semenova; Yulia Nesterova",
          "abstract": "Measuring attitudes on sensitive topics such as immigration, prejudice, and multiculturalism is a persistent methodological challenge because standard self-report instruments are prone to social desirability bias. This bias—the tendency for participants to provide socially acceptable answers rather than their true beliefs—can distort both predictors and outcomes, severely compromising the rigor of research. Statistical control via social desirability scales offers only partial remediation, and when the same bias affects all measured variables, statistical control alone is often insufficient or even counterproductive. This tutorial introduces a novel methodological tool that mitigates social desirability bias by eliciting responses through creative reflection—an open-ended, low-stakes task that prompts participants to express their views indirectly. We detail the process of designing such tasks, coding and analyzing the resulting data, and integrating these methods into broader research designs. Our analysis applies a mixed-methods framework that integrates quantitative survey responses from 454 in-service teachers with qualitative creative narratives from 413 in-service teachers. Step-by-step code, annotated examples, and the full dataset are provided to enable replication and adaptation. While illustrated with a study of teachers’ multicultural attitudes, the approach is applicable to other sensitive psychological and educational research topics.",

          "authors": "Zekun Sun; Samuel D McDougle",
          "abstract": "Event segmentation is a fundamental component of human perception and cognition. The field of event cognition studies how people decide where distinct events occur in incoming sensory data, how these \"event boundaries\" alter decision-making and memory processes, how events reveal themselves in neural activity, and how events may be represented within perception itself. The latter point is critical — the representation of events in the first place is filtered through perception. But what counts as a minimal event that is perceptible to humans? And to what extent is the perceptual representation of minimal events driven by physical properties within stimuli (e.g., sudden changes of a tennis ball's direction when one player strikes it) versus the semantic structure of events (e.g., \"step one\" versus \"step two\" of a tennis serve)? Here, across seven preregistered experiments, we explore the perceptual representation of event structure within single brief actions, and dissociate the roles of visual features and semantic structures in the perceptual segmentation of minimal events. First, participants produced boundary labels by segmenting videos of brief physical actions (e.g., kicking a ball). Then, separate groups of observers were asked to visually detect subtle disruptions in the video clips, unaware that the disruptions systematically occurred at boundary versus non-boundary timepoints. The results consistently showed an interfering effect of event boundaries on the detection of disruptions, suggesting a spontaneous perceptual representation of action structure even in very brief single actions. Moreover, boundary effects were strongest when stimuli were presented in recognizable forms versus distorted forms that only preserved lower-level features. Thus, automatic and rapid perceptual segmentation of single actions that only last several seconds may be driven by both sensory cues and our internal models of the world.",

          "abstract": "We propose a behavioral view of authoritarianism, and argue that the everyday psychology of rules and punishment is at its core. Authoritarianism is often understood at the nation-state level, categorizing particular regimes and practices as authoritarian, or at the individual level, as a set of tendencies or worldviews. We reposition behavior as the main unit of analysis. We specify a set of behaviors made available only when people interact with the state, and use state rules and state punishment to carry out their own desires (e.g., for revenge, dominance) at the expense of the rule of law. Then, we propose that at the heart of these authoritarian behaviors is regular, everyday psychology—the psychology of norms and norm enforcement via third party punishment, albeit formalized, codified, and refracted through state procedures. States solve large scale coordination problems, largely with codified rules and official third- party punishments. Sometimes people use these procedures to fairly and legitimately uphold the rule of law, and sometimes people use them for their own ends, amounting to authoritarianism. We review how the state channels human desires for punishment and rules, and how people can use state punishment and state rules to behave in authoritarian ways; State punishments can be administered selectively and personally. Official rules can be made that keep individuals from public services, or exist only to keep some people in positions of power over others. The psychology of norms and third party punishment, which enables large-scale human cooperation, is at the heart of authoritarianism.",

          "abstract": "Emerging scholarship suggests that willingness to engage in violent or other risky behavior relates to Need for Chaos--a trait-state combination reflecting disaffection with society and politics, independent of political identity and beliefs. While previous research links Need for Chaos to a stronger gain-seeking mentality, it remains unclear whether those higher in Need for Chaos respond differently to gain and loss frames. We use a framing experiment based on prospect theory to test whether Need for Chaos moderates decision making about two salient policy issues in the United States: the debt ceiling and government shutdown negotiations in US Congress in 2023. Results from both studies (n=2,704; n=3,002) suggest that individuals low in Need for Chaos are risk-averse toward gains but risk-seeking toward losses, whereas those high in Need for Chaos exhibit the opposite pattern, seeking risk when anticipating gains and avoiding risk when anticipating losses. Our findings add important nuance to existing research by demonstrating that individuals higher in Need for Chaos are not merely indifferent to framing; rather, they also systematically respond to gain and loss frames.

This study, using a within-subject design, directly compared 24-hour consolidation trajectories of auditory, visual, and audiovisual SL in young adults. Twenty-six participants completed familiarization and an immediate test phase in all three modalities, followed by delayed testing after 24 hours. Multisensory input yielded higher recognition accuracy than unisensory input at both immediate and delayed tests, demonstrating a robust performance advantage. However, only auditory SL showed overnight gains, while visual and multisensory SL remained stable across the retention interval. Cross-task correlations—both within each testing timepoint and for consolidation magnitudes—were weak, suggesting that modality-specific processes make a substantial contribution to SL. These findings provide the first direct evidence on the long-term retention of multisensory SL. While multisensory input boosts overall performance, consolidation trajectories remain constrained by modality-specific mechanisms.",

How to pace or allocate work over time, whether to delay starting to work, and how much effort to exert are decisions people face daily. People sometimes procrastinate, facing detrimental effects due to delays. Previous research has recognised multiple shapes of pacing and types of procrastination, influenced by a myriad of psychological and situational factors. However, the main mechanistic explanation for delays and pacing, which concerns temporal discounting of distant rewards, focuses on only a subset. Here, we introduce a systematic taxonomy of pacing and procrastination, integrating multiple mechanistic routes to them within a common framework. The taxonomy is based on the sequence of temporal decisions involved in choosing how to distribute work in time, and shows how these decisions can be influenced by characteristics of the task and the (sub-)optimality of decision-making. Using reinforcement learning and decision-making models, we simulate diverse sources of pacing to illustrate aspects of the taxonomy and demonstrate how they give rise to different types of pacing and procrastination, showing the plausibility of our taxonomy. Our approach provides a theoretical foundation for understanding pacing and procrastination, enabling the integration of both established and novel mechanisms within a unified conceptual framework.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implant users can achieve high levels of speech recognition despite severe hearing loss. However, outcomes vary considerably, and some users continue to struggle. This study assessed Nucleus cochlear implant users’ sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulations, important acoustic features for speech recognition, using a reaction-time task with ripple sounds. Ripples contain similar spectrotemporal dynamics as speech, without resembling words, and allow precise control over spectral and temporal parameters. Cochlear implant users’ reaction times to ripple onsets varied systematically with modulation characteristics: temporal modulations around 16 Hz consistently yielded the shortest reaction times, while reaction times increased with increasing spectral density. These effects of modulation were nearly identical across participants, indicating a similar tuning to the tested spectrotemporal features. In contrast, the average reaction time, across all modulations, differed substantially between participants, ranging from 200 ms to about 1 second. These individual differences correlated modestly with phoneme recognition scores (r = 0.52), indicating that overall reaction times for the tested modulations relates to speech processing ability. These two findings (consistent modulation-dependent reaction times across participants, and their modest correlation with phoneme recognition) indicate that reaction times reflect underlying auditory sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulations. The substantial unexplained variance in phoneme recognition, however, suggests that modulation sensitivity alone is not sufficient to account for individual differences in speech understanding. This points to an additional role for non-acoustic, cognitive factors. Further, modeling results also suggest that individual differences in reaction times can be attributed to a combination of both sensory factors (i.e., modulation sensitivity) and non-auditory influences, such as decision-making processes.",

In the literature on mental health and politics -work that spans different disorders and political outcomes-there has been a turn to domain-specific measures of `political health'. However, when studying the complex relationship between mental health and politics, it is not yet clear if we need a disorder specific or general approach and to that end, if there is a need for domain-specificity (i.e., what it might contribute beyond traditional mental health measurements). To investigate this, we test and compare the construct and predictive validity of domain-specific political mental health (PMH) and general mental health (MH) in a study conducted in the Dutch population. Through our tests of construct validity, we find PMH is an independent construct to MH. Our tests of predictive validity demonstrate that while both PMH and MH have a range of political correlates, from political participation to external political efficacy, it is PMH that has stronger and broader political associations -- to affective polarization, ideological extremism and news aversion, among others. In the discussion we outline a research agenda for moving forward the study of mental health and politics in light of our findings: our results imply that domain-specificity is needed to properly identify the extent to which mental health is connected to engagement with politics and who may be the most affected and importantly, that PMH and MH have more far reaching political consequences than previously assumed.",

In five experiments with 136 participants, we employed a new auditory search task in which constant (vs. variable) human speech sounds (letters as distractors, numbers as targets) were presented sequentially from distinct spatial locations using five loudspeakers. We find that distractor identity is both necessary and sufficient for auditory contextual cueing. This finding stands in striking contrast to visual contextual cueing, where fixed spatial layouts are typically crucial for the effect. Thus, it highlights the complementary strengths of the two modalities: While the visual system prioritizes spatial context, the auditory system rapidly recodes input into categorical, identity-based representations, making these central to statistical contextual learning.",

We consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine bases of these computations. We propose that modulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during negative affective states enhances the pursuit of rewards by reducing goal-directed computations and increasing appetitive Pavlovian computations.",

          "authors": "Robert Ward",
          "abstract": "Expert judgement is inherently noisy, but the consequences of this variability are often underestimated. Here I examine the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) as a case study illustrating how judgment noise can interact with structural features of a multi-stage evaluation system. Simulations show that noise in both internal departmental reviews and REF panel reviews, in conjunction with the bounded REF rating scale, produces systematic underestimation of the highest-performing departments. Panel noise, rather than internal noise, had a disproportionate impact on department rankings, with even moderate noise producing severe distortions. At a policy level, these results underscore the need for a noise audit of REF panel ratings. More broadly, the case of REF demonstrates that noise embedded in sequential evaluation, for example, in hiring and grant review decisions, does not “cancel out”, but instead can propagate in potentially surprising ways.",

Teachers’ competence was assessed across\nTechnology Operations (GM = 2.41), Social-Ethical Responsibility (GM = 2.50), Pedagogical\nApplication (GM = 2.51), and Professional Practice (GM = 2.43), yielding an overall Grand\nMean of 2.46 (High Competence). Results indicate strong pedagogical use and ethical ICT\npractices, while technical skills such as database management, troubleshooting, and spreadsheet\nuse remain weaker. Younger and single teachers demonstrated higher technical proficiency, yet\noverall digital competence did not significantly correlate with ICT challenges (Overall Mean =\n1.74), suggesting systemic and institutional barriers are the primary constraints. Based on these\nfindings, a contextualized ICT Enhancement Program was proposed, including targeted skills\ndevelopment, hands-on exercises, ethical ICT training, peer mentoring, and enhanced\ninstitutional support, aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education).

          "abstract": "The perception of voluntariness in task failure during extreme physical effort is debated in endurance sports. This study tested whether power meter data availability affects perceived voluntariness and performance in cyclists accustomed to power meters. Forty trained cyclists completed two counterbalanced maximal incremental tests: one without feedback and one with real-time power visualization. Confirmatory analyses showed that power visualization increased maximal aerobic power (MAP) (p = 0.004, ES = 0.487) without affecting VO2MAX, maximal heart rate, RPE, or perceived voluntariness (p &gt; 0.05). Exploratory analyses revealed an order effect: participants who first performed the test with power data perceived their decision to stop as more voluntary in that condition compared to the subsequent no-feedback test (p = 0.029). This effect was absent in the reverse order group (p = 0.749). No order effects were found for other variables. Cyclists’ performance judgments aligned with actual MAP differences (p = 0.744). These findings suggest that removing power data after prior exposure reduces perceived control over task failure decisions, while access to power data enhances MAP. Further research is needed to confirm these effects in self-paced efforts. This study highlights the role of performance feedback in shaping effort perception and performance in cycling.",

This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Autistic individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with psychotic disorders and experience psychotic symptoms. This association may result from methodological issues, such as misinterpretation of psychosis questionnaires by autistic individuals and clinician difficulty differentiating between symptoms of autism and psychosis. This meta-analysis aimed to update the review of this association and examine whether it is moderated by the methods used to measure it. \nMethods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science. Included studies required: autism and psychosis measurements, comorbidity data, adult participants, and quantitative data. Risk of bias was assessed using Hoy et al. (2012) criteria, and analyses examined correlational data, computed odds ratios, and computed Cohen's d. \nResults: Sixty-three papers were included. Significant correlations were found between autistic traits and overall (r = 0.435, p &lt; .0001), positive (r = .274, p &lt; .0001), negative (r = .506, p &lt; .0001), and disorganized (r = .366, p &lt; .0001) psychotic symptoms. Individuals with one condition had increased risk of being diagnosed with the other (OR = 7.03, p &lt; .001), and scored higher on trait measures of the other (d = 1.187, p &lt; .0001). No moderating effect of measurement was found. \nDiscussion: This meta-analysis provides an updated overview of the association between autism and psychosis, with no evidence that methodological issues are specific to any measure. The weaker correlation between autistic traits and positive psychotic symptoms suggests symptom overlap may partly explain the association.",

          "abstract": "Moving towards more plant-based diets is a win-win for both human and planetary health. However, for successful adoption, such diets must be realistic and convenient. This study explored the factors influencing food choices among young women in Scotland and examined how they interpret and use plant-based and convenience food in their daily lives. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 women aged 18-24 and generated six themes using reflexive thematic analysis within a critical realist framework. We found meat consumption to be socially and culturally embedded, reinforced by family, peers, and social media (Theme 1). Participants expressed a sense of safety with familiar meat-based dishes and fear towards unfamiliar plant-based dishes (Theme 2). ‘Plant-based’ was widely perceived as meat alternatives only, which were rejected across health, taste, cost, and identity considerations. Although cost was the biggest driver of food choice, meat was perceived as a necessary expense, further justified by health motivations (Theme 3). Environmental concerns were less important, with participants demonstrating limited awareness about the environmental impact of food (Theme 4). Convenience was important, though ready meals were rejected in favour of batch cooking and quick-prep meals (Theme 5). Meat reduction was perceived as an all-or-nothing identity shift, with negative vegan stereotypes deterring even small reductions in intake (Theme 6). These findings highlight the need to reposition plant-based foods as affordable, convenient, healthy, and familiar, likely requiring wider food system changes. Further, health benefits of increased plant-based wholefoods and reduced meat consumption should be emphasised in government and industry messaging.",

          "abstract": "The assumptions of standard tests, such as the t-test, ANOVA, and ordinary least squares regression, are frequently violated, which may be consequential for the desired error rates. Using robust tests instead does not rely on assuming normality and equal variances. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives, like the Mann–Whitney U test or robust linear regression. Restricting on a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids multiple results, thus counteracts fishing for the desired result, which can occur subtly. It counteracts nonreplicated findings that are just due data anomalies like extreme values and outliers that occur differently across studies. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and there are many robust methods readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

Pain (global pain perception, pain intensity, pain affect, pain tolerance) and stress responses (subjective reports, autonomic [electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, salivary alpha-amylase] and endocrine activity [salivary cortisol]) were measured. Individual differences of the experience, trait empathy and absorption were investigated.\nExposure to multimodal art resulted in longer pain tolerance than single modality of visual art, but no difference was found for music. Other measures of pain intensity, stress intensity, and pain affect did not differ across the conditions. Regarding the mechanisms, exposure to all types of art distracted participants’ attention from pain, prompted mind wandering, and elicited greater enjoyment than the control condition. Physiological measures of electrocardiography and electrodermal activity validated our design: participants were more stressed during the cold pressor test, but no differences were observed across the four conditions. Also, no differences were found regarding cortisol and alpha-amylase. Regarding individual differences, higher trait absorption was associated with longer pain tolerance in the multimodal condition and with lower pain intensity in the music-only condition, compared to the other conditions. In conclusion, exposure to art can influence pain; however, the underlying mechanisms require further research.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is increasingly recognized as the outcome of recursive interactions among genetic, neurobiological, epigenetic, environmental, psychological, and psychodynamic factors rather than as the product of linear causal models. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence across these domains to advance a comprehensive framework for understanding BPD’s developmental pathways. While concepts such as equifinality, multifinality, and differential susceptibility have been sporadically noted in prior work, only a handful of studies explicitly apply them to BPD. To our knowledge, this article provides the most extensive integration of these perspectives to date, situating BPD within a developmental psychopathology model that explains both shared and divergent outcomes across individuals. By emphasizing plasticity alongside vulnerability, we propose an empirically grounded, multifactorial account that holds particular promise for psychiatric understanding as well as psychodynamic and other psychotherapeutic treatments. This integrative approach highlights the complex etiological architecture of BPD and underscores opportunities for tailoring interventions to patients’ unique developmental trajectories.",

While it is acknowledged that in nonhuman primates this decrease of tension is due to the calming effect exerted by bystanders on the stress of the antagonists, the emotional aspect of violence reduction remains largely unexplored in humans. In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effect of bystander affiliative intervention on stress-related behaviours indicating anxiety, anger and pain expressed by antagonists of conflicts. By conducting video analysis on interpersonal conflicts recorded by surveillance cameras in public spaces of Amsterdam, we found that antagonists displayed fewer anger-related behaviours after receiving non-physical affiliation, such as non-verbal interaction or proximity. Our findings suggest that bystanders adopt a safe option to regulate antagonists’ stress, showing a continuity in the conflict management strategies evolved in social animals.",

This study provides a comparative investigation of three widely used PSRA questionnaires – the Questionnaire for Psychosocial Risk Assessment (QPRA), the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ), and Welliba PSRA – to investigate their conceptual overlap and psychometric performance. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of N = 98 participants who completed all three questionnaires. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess relationships of scales within and between questionnaires, examining their convergent and discriminant validity. The results revealed substantial intercorrelations among conceptually related scales within and between all questionnaires, supporting convergent validity. However, numerous strong associations were observed between theoretically distinct constructs, highlighting poor discriminant validity across the tools. Hence, the investigated questionnaires appear to uniformly measure psychosocial risk as a general construct, while the lack of specificity outlines that their utility to assess delimited hazards is limited. The findings underscore the need for psychometric refinement of PSRA instruments and suggest that practitioners should supplement quantitative assessments with qualitative methods to ensure a rigorous and effective risk management process.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications for organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 702) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 14.2 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.6 percentage points (d = 0.13) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "abstract": "Watching what others put in their mouths is a powerful way to learn what to eat. Yet human diets and eating behaviors are complicated, and not everything that goes into another person's mouth is food: The fusilli is edible, but the fork is not. Therefore, some selectivity is necessary to guide social learning processes about food. Here we examined 6-month-old infants' expectations about what kinds of entities are likely to be edible using a violation-of-expectation setup in which infants viewed an actor eating from two different items. We hypothesized that infants may have selective edibility expectations about plants, and in particular fruits, that stem from humans' long evolutionary history of foraging wild plant foods and specialization in higher caloric density plant parts. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we found that infants expect plants, relative to feature-matched artifacts, to be edible, replicating a previous finding [Wertz &amp; Wynn, 2014a]. In Experiments 2 (N = 40) and 3 (N = 39), we examined, for the first time, whether selective expectations about plant edibility are tied to particular plant parts. Our results showed that infants do not differentially expect leaves to be edible, but our results for fruits were inconsistent. Taken together, these findings suggest that infants differentially expect plants to be edible, and that these expectations appear to be strongest for whole plants.",

          "abstract": "The construction of high-quality experimental stimuli is foundational to psychological research, yet current practices remain labor-intensive, reliant on expert intuition, and limited in scale and reproducibility. As the field increasingly pursues large-scale, cross-linguistic, and rapid experimental designs, stimulus generation has become a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automating aspects of stimulus creation, but questions remain regarding the fidelity, interpretability, and experimental validity of LLM-constructed stimuli. We, therefore, present StimMAS, which is the first multi-agent LLM framework that automates stimulus generation, validation, and evaluation, all within a psychologist-in-the-loop architecture. We validated the framework by comparing LLM-constructed stimuli against human-authored counterparts in three behavioral psycholinguistic experiments with 300 participants. Results show that LLM-constructed materials reliably replicate established effects. Stimuli produced by StimMAS yielded lower response entropy, indicating enhanced interpretive clarity, and interaction analyses revealed that key psycholinguistic effects were preserved or amplified. Ablation studies confirmed that, compared to a single-agent system, the multi-agent architecture significantly improves stimulus quality by reducing redundancy, enforcing experimental constraints, and—particularly when using GPT-4o—achieving stronger alignment with expert judgment than DeepSeek, especially in the construction of English-language items. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent LLM systems, when guided by domain expertise, can serve as scalable, reproducible, and theoretically aligned tools for stimulus construction. StimMAS offers a publicly available platform that lowers barriers to high-quality experimental design, advancing the integration of AI into the empirical workflows of psychological science.

          "abstract": "Measuring the subjective well-being of societies is important in its own right and as a determinant of health outcomes. Traditionally, self-report surveys such as Gallup’s daily poll have tracked well-being, but they are expensive and provide limited coverage of communities. Over the past decade, research has shown that social media (e.g., Twitter/X) offers a cost-effective alternative. Yet, through ownership and policy changes, access to these “digital commons” is increasingly restricted. What are we losing without access for researchers? We argue that well-being estimates derived from geolocated, demographically post-stratified Twitter language provided the most valid indicators of US population well-being available. We compare estimates for 1,208 US counties (~89% of the population) derived from 1.53 billion posts by 5.25 million users to Gallup estimates from 1.9 million survey responses. Twitter-based estimates were more predictive of external health and economic indicators and met a wide variety of validity criteria, including a convergent correlation of r = .70 with Gallup, high test-retest stability, linguistic face validity, and generalizability across US cities, states, and the UK. We further show that Gallup ground truth data is not required by building an independent language model on n = 9,419 Twitter users, which produced valid estimates that again outperformed Gallup in predicting external variables.

          "abstract": "While intergroup contact theory traditionally focuses on prejudice reduction, intergroup contact may paradoxically increase consensus in race-based thinking of others. We measured individuals’ mental representations of how personality traits interrelate for different racial groups at conceptual (abstract) and perceptual (face-based) levels. Stereotype structure alignment was defined as the extent to which an individual’s trait associations across racial group members align with group-typical structures averaged across all participants, capturing shared perceptions. In a diverse Singapore sample comprising Chinese, Malay, and Indian participants (N = 153), quality contact (but not quantity) predicted stronger alignment with shared trait structures for ethnic minorities. Specifically, higher quality contact with minority groups (e.g., Malays) predicted greater convergence in abstract trait associations (but not face-based representations). These findings challenge assumptions about contact’s de-stereotyping effects. Quality contact appears to help people develop more culturally informed trait representations, which shape face perception, revealing a paradox in how intergroup contact influences stereotype structure alignment.",

          "abstract": "Difficulties in speech perception in noise are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may be associated with an attentional bias toward non-social stimuli. Although our previous study found no interactive effect of (non-)social noise on the relationship between autistic traits and speech-in-noise perception difficulties, this effect could be observed in children and adolescents with ASD who have greater attentional bias than individuals with high autistic traits in the general population. In this context, the present study tested two hypotheses: (1) children and adolescents with ASD show greater difficulty perceiving speech in noise than those without ASD, and (2) they experience greater difficulty perceiving speech in non-vocal noise than in vocal noise. Participants detected words embedded in vocal and non-vocal background noise. Children and adolescents with ASD had greater difficulties in speech perception in noise than those without ASD, supporting the first hypothesis. This difference was not explained by performance in speech perception in silence or hypersensitivity to noise. However, the second hypothesis was not supported, which is consistent with the results of our previous study. These results suggest that autistic traits other than attentional bias toward non-vocal sounds explain the difficulties in speech perception in noise.",

          "abstract": "Reappraisal is a linguistic strategy for regulating emotions that has the potential to produce powerful therapeutic effects. Consequently, there is growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to help people reappraise. However, little is known about the factors that make one reappraisal more effective than another, or how these factors map to different individuals. A key challenge is the lack of a framework to differentiate reappraisals, making it difficult to characterize what is expected to work for whom. We conducted two studies (N = 471) examining values as a person-specific predictor of reappraisal effectiveness. Our findings suggest that LLM-generated reappraisals that aligned with individuals’ more strongly endorsed values (relative to their other values) were more likely to address their specific concerns, be perceived as more effective, and lead to greater emotional change. These results highlight the importance of tailoring reappraisals to individuals’ personal values and provide a foundation for improving the personalization of AI-assisted emotion regulation interventions.",

          "abstract": "Forming first impressions from faces involves inherent uncertainty, as perceivers must make rapid personality judgments from limited information. Individuals and cultures differ in how they handle this uncertainty, with some showing greater aversion to ambiguity. We propose that higher uncertainty avoidance leads to more differentiated personality trait impressions, as a cognitive strategy for managing social ambiguity. Across three studies, we demonstrate converging evidence that uncertainty avoidance systematically shapes impression formation. Study 1 (N = 10,552) analyzed face-based trait ratings from 40 regions, revealing that individuals from cultures high in uncertainty avoidance exhibit greater differentiation between trait impressions. Study 2 (N = 105) examined individual differences and found that personal uncertainty avoidance predicts impression differentiation. This relationship was mediated by how distinctly people conceptualize personality traits. Study 3 (N = 212, preregistered) experimentally manipulated uncertainty avoidance, establishing a causal effect: participants formed more differentiated impressions from faces with an uncertainty-avoidant mindset. These findings reveal how uncertainty avoidance systematically shapes person perception across cultural and individual contexts. This work provides new insights into the mechanistic understanding of person perception and challenges the assumption of universality in face-based impressions. It demonstrates how domain-general cognitive diversity creates rich variation in social perception.",

SL—the implicit detection and extraction of regularities from continuous input—has been documented across sensory modalities, but most work has focused on immediate learning in unisensory contexts. This study, using a within-subject design, directly compared 24-hour consolidation trajectories of auditory, visual, and audiovisual SL in young adults. Twenty-six participants completed familiarization and an immediate test phase in all three modalities, followed by delayed testing after 24 hours. Multisensory input yielded higher recognition accuracy than unisensory input at both immediate and delayed tests, demonstrating a robust performance advantage. However, only auditory SL showed overnight gains, while visual and multisensory SL remained stable across the retention interval. Cross-task correlations—both within each testing timepoint and for consolidation magnitudes—were weak, suggesting that modality-specific processes make a substantial contribution to SL. These findings provide the first direct evidence on the long-term retention of multisensory SL. While multisensory input boosts overall performance, consolidation trajectories remain constrained by modality-specific mechanisms.",

Ambivalent and indifferent people were less likely to vote for pro-Palestinian presidential candidates (Cornel West or Jill Stein) and more likely to vote for Trump, compared with pro-Palestinian participants. Finally, we reveal the ideological profiles of ambivalent and indifferent people based on egalitarianism, moral traditionalism, racial resentment, and nationalism.

We evaluated the long-term outcomes of psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDP) for MDD.\nMethods: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials in adults with MDD comparing PDP with treatment-as-usual (TAU) or other active care with long-term follow-up at 12 months or more following the treatment. Outcomes were clinician-rated and self-rated depressive symptom severity and relapse rate. Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses at 12 months used standardized mean differences (symptom severity) and risk ratios (relapse). Intention-to-treat was primary with completer sensitivity analyses. Trials not eligible for pooling were narratively synthesised.\nResults: Five RCTs (n=624 randomised) met inclusion criteria. Three RCTS contributed to pooled 12-month estimates. PDP was associated with greater efficacy compared to TAU measured by clinician-rated depressive symptom scales (SMD −0.40, 95% CI [−0.72, −0.07]), but not with self-rated symptom scales (SMD −0.32, 95% CI [−0.83, 0.19]). PDP was associated with lowered relapse risk at 12 months (RR 0.78, 95% CI [0.68, 0.90]), with an estimated number needed-to-treat of 5-6.\nConclusion: PDP was associated with greater long-term improvements in clinician-assessed depressive symptoms reduced risk of relapse at 12 months, while self-rated depressive symptom outcomes were less consistent.",

          "abstract": "Background: Although extensive evidence suggests domain-general differences in autistic attention are common and impactful, frameworks for understanding these experiences remain confused. Concepts like monotropism, autotelic (flow-prone) personality, and hyperfocus seemingly have overlapping features and distinct attributes. How they relate to one another is not empirically clear.\nMethods: 111 autistic and 39 non-autistic adults filled out a Prolific survey. We examined group differences in ADHD inattention traits and subscales from monotropism, autotelic personality, and hyperfocus measures, and how subscales were related in autism. We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as an initial exploration of dimensions potentially underlying these constructs. We also examined whether PCA components were related to anxiety and sensory hyperresponsitivity.\nResults: Autistic people reported more monotropism, hyperfocus, and inattention than non-autistic people. Autistic people reported more of some autotelic personality subscales (enjoyment of boredom, curiosity before correction) but less of another (attentional control). However, attentional control and self-centredness were largely unrelated to other autotelic personality dimensions; instead, they respectively converged with ADHD inattention traits and social anxiety. One PCA dimension seemingly reflected intense, enjoyable focus; it was related to sensory hyperresponsiveness, and indirectly via hyperresponsiveness with anxiety. Another seemingly reflected inattention and difficulties with attentional control; this was directly related to anxiety. These two PCA dimensions each explained relatively little variance, reflecting the complexity of autistic attention.\nConclusion: These results emphasise that attention in autism can have both positive (e.g., enjoyment) and negative (e.g., propensity to sensory distress) aspects. Underlying intense, enjoyable focus experiences likely contribute to hyperfocus, monotropism, and autotelic personality, but there appear to be many dimensions of attention in autism. Autotelic personality, as currently conceptualised, likely includes aspects that are more reflective of other existing constructs. Further research is needed to understand neurocognitive of and real-world manifestations and effects of these attention styles.",

We present the ten-item Words Can Harm Scale (WCHS) as a valid and reliable measure of this belief. Items assess attitudes about harmful speech (e.g., \"Vulnerable people should not be exposed to certain kinds of speech, as this might harm them\") and written words (e.g., \"I could be left emotionally scarred by something I read\"). In a representative sample of American adults (N = 956), the WCHS demonstrated strong internal reliability (α = .92) and robust test-retest reliability (r = .80). People higher in the belief that words can harm tended to be younger, female, non-White, and politically liberal. The WCHS was associated with self-reported intellectual humility, empathy, moral grandstanding, and the belief in the importance of silencing others. The WCHS was also associated with concern for political correctness and endorsement of trigger warnings and safe spaces. Individuals who believed that words can harm had worse mental health: they reported being more anxious and depressed, less resilient, and having more difficulties in emotion regulation. The WCHS is a reliable tool for measuring beliefs about the harmfulness of speech—a salient and divisive issue within modern cultural discourse.",

Taking part in this debate, social psychologists test whether letting participants read texts that argue against the plausibility of free will reduces their beliefs related to free will. However, this research leaves open whether merely reading such a text actually changes free will beliefs over and beyond a single experimental session in the lab. To fill this gap, in three experiments we investigated whether merely reading a short text claiming that free will does not exist, influences beliefs related to free will over time. Two experiments demonstrate that reading an anti-free will text (as compared to a control text) reduces participants’ beliefs related to free will when measured on the same day (Experiment 1 and 2), the next day (Experiment 1 and 2) as well as one week later (Experiment 2). Critically, when controlling for potential demand effects by making sure that participants do not associate the assessment of free will beliefs with the first session in which beliefs were manipulated (Experiment 3), results no longer showed an effect of reading the anti-free will text over time. Theoretical and ethical implications of these findings are discussed.",

The experimental podcast delivered nine evidence-based practice principles embedded in relatable scenarios about mental and physical health. Primary outcomes included critical thinking about health claims, intended health behaviors, attitudes toward evidence-based mental health practices, and treatment preferences.\nResults: Compared to the control group, parents who listened to the critical thinking podcast demonstrated significantly improved critical thinking about health information (p&lt;.001), more critical thinking–aligned intended behaviors (p&lt;.01), stronger attitudes in favor of evidence-based mental health practices (p&lt;.05), and more evidence-informed treatment preferences (p&lt;.05).\nConclusions: Findings suggest that a short, story-based podcast can meaningfully improve critical thinking about health among U.S. parents.

          "abstract": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM) – quantum theory applications outside of physics – are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) – a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical  ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., “mental entanglement.” We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing “local observables” and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on “mental entanglement” detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite research on case factors that can trigger confirmation bias in investigations leading to wrongful convictions, we know little about what sparks this chain reaction and why an innocent person initially falls under suspicion. Across four studies, we investigated what perceived behaviors exhibited by 911 callers (urgency, emotionality, cognitive load, impression management, and information management) are related to laypeople’s (Studies 1-2, 4) and police officers’ (Study 3) suspicion toward the caller. Hypotheses: We predicted, for lay and police samples, callers perceived as more urgent or emotional would be perceived as less suspicious, whereas callers perceived as more under cognitive load, managing information, or managing impressions of themselves would be perceived as more suspicious. We tested whether these relationships depended on caller gender—predicting gender stereotypes might play a role, particularly with emotionality. Method: Participants (Studies 1-2, 4: online laypeople, Study 3: police officers) listened to a real 911 call (Studies 1 and 4) or a more controlled, simulated 911 call (Studies 2 and 3) by a male or female caller. We assessed behavioral predictors associated with suspicion via participants’ spontaneous impressions and scales assessing these behaviors. Participants indicated how suspicious they found the caller and how much the caller violated their expectations. Results: Participants spontaneously mentioned the callers’ emotionality most frequently and consistently across studies (77-85%). Perceptions of callers being more urgent and emotional were associated with less suspicion and violation of expectations, while perceptions of callers engaging in more information management and impression management were associated with more suspicion and violation of expectations. Police, but not laypeople, perceived male callers as more suspicious than female callers—despite holding 911 call scripts constant. Conclusion: Citizens engaging in the well-intentioned act of calling 911 risk observers—including police—holding expectations for their behavior and targeting them as a suspect if they violate those expectations.",

This paper argues that belief in a true self provides a unifying framework to explain when participants will attribute one’s authentic preference to either System 1 or System 2. In line with predictions made by our theory, the results from four experiments (N=3,399 American adults) show that attributions about others’ authentic preferences vary predictably across normative and non-normative contexts. Further, we show that the more participants report believing in a good true self, the more their judgments about others adhere to a predictable pattern; and, directly manipulating information about a target’s true self changes people’s judgments about a target’s authentic preferences. By integrating theories of decision conflict and existing research on the true self, this work advances our understanding of how people reason about others’ minds, revealing how lay theories about identity can systematically shape social prediction and judgment.",

This question could be probed by asking individuals to define their understanding of loneliness. Using a meta-synthesis analytic approach on data from four studies which elicited such definitions from distinct populations, we report cross-study consensus on three characteristics of loneliness: its negative emotional valence; its standing as a consequence of 1) absence of genuine social connection, and of 2) lack of receipt of adequate social support. Other characteristics of loneliness are described for which there was not cross-study consensus. We conclude that there may be characteristics of loneliness which apply across multiple contexts, although we acknowledge the limited reach of our data.

          "abstract": "Youth psychopathology is a pressing global challenge. High comorbidity rates and only moderate psychotherapy effects highlight the need for transdiagnostic approaches, which target mechanisms cutting across diagnostic categories to better understand the etiology and maintenance of mental disorders. Traditional diagnostic instruments, however, face limitations such as recall bias and inability to capture the dynamic, context-dependent nature of youth psychopathology. Recent advances in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) now enable real-time, naturalistic measurement, but EMA studies in youth rarely adopt a transdiagnostic focus, and transdiagnostic research has seldom incorporated EMA.\nThis paper is a call for the integration of transdiagnostic science and EMA methods to advance clinical research and practice in youth. Although guidelines exist for EMA design in youth, recommendations on how to realize a transdiagnostic perspective using EMA is currently lacking. We summarize recent developments primarily in the field of adult research and outline key steps for the development and evaluation of a transdiagnostic EMA tool for youth. We conclude our call by outlining implications for transdiagnostic EMA research, including the potential of bridging theoretical transdiagnostic models and clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) performance declines with the quantity of material stored and the duration of its maintenance, but it is disputed whether these constraints are independent or interact. Specifically, different studies have reached contradictory conclusions on whether greater memory load accelerates deterioration of the stored information during retention, a question with implications for storage mechanisms. Meanwhile, prominent models of VWM based on stable attractors predict that recall should become increasingly biased towards a fixed set of canonical features with longer retention, but empirical support is mixed. Uncertainty is further exacerbated by limited data, methodological variation, and inconsistent analytical approaches across studies. Moreover, previous studies have not always distinguished response variability from stimulus-specific biases, nor considered the possibility of swap errors (intrusions). To address these issues, we conducted six new VWM experiments and reanalysed data from seven published experiments using consistent analytical methods to examine the effects of set size and delay on variability and bias. Our results show that recall variability increased with longer delays and higher set sizes, consistent with prior findings, and importantly, that these effects did not operate independently: the effect of delay was amplified at higher set sizes. We also observed consistent evidence for systematic biases across stimuli, but unlike variability, bias amplitude did not change with either set size or retention interval. These results support diffusion accounts of VWM maintenance, in which variability grows through the accumulation of random error, while challenging stable attractor accounts that predict systematic drift towards canonical values during maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Background. Opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment mainly involves long-term use of medications that either stimulate (agonists) or block (antagonists) mu-opioid receptors and that could potentially affect patients’ experiences of pain. We therefore conducted an observational study of pain symptoms and sensitivity in patients receiving opioid agonist and antagonist treatment for OUD, and healthy volunteers.\nMethods. Seventy-four OUD patients receiving the antagonist extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; n = 34) or opioid agonists (methadone or buprenorphine; n = 40), as well as 50 healthy volunteers participated in a single study session. Participants answered questions about their current pain symptoms, and completed a Cold Pressor Test (CPT) while we measured heart rate and salivary cortisol. Hypotheses and analyses were preregistered before data access. Group differences in chronic pain rates and cold pain responses were modeled with logistic, beta and linear regression and tested with likelihood ratio χ2- and F-tests.\nResults. Half of patients in either treatment reported living with chronic pain. Individual CPT responses were variable. Patients on opioid agonists and XR-NTX reported pain 2 and 9 seconds earlier than and removed their hand 34 and 46 seconds before healthy volunteers. These group differences align with prior findings of heightened pain sensitivity in agonist-maintained patients but were non-significant (ps = 1). Differences in cold pain intensity and cold pain-induced changes in heart rate and cortisol aligned with hypotheses but were also non-significant (ps ≥ 0.17). \nConclusion. Consistent with prior observations, the current findings indicate that a considerable number of OUD patients experience persistent pain symptoms while undergoing either opioid agonists or XR-NTX treatment. Major detrimental or beneficial effects of these medications on pain and pain sensitivity seem unlikely however.",

          "authors": "Elouise Botes; Ziwen Teuber; Nora Vitali; Jean-Marc Dewaele; Joanne Colling",
          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular, large language models (LLMs) have become embedded in the research process, with scientists increasingly using LLMs to assist with manuscript drafting. Previous studies have documented the linguistic fingerprints of LLMs in biomedical and technical sciences, whereas psychology has remained largely unexplored. This study investigates the presence of AI-associated linguistic markers in psychology publications between 2020 and 2024. We constructed a corpus of 368,531 abstracts indexed in Scopus across 1,121 psychology journals and analysed the relative frequencies of 28 words previously identified as overrepresented in AI-assisted writing. Results indicated that the use of these stylistic markers remained stable from 2020 to 2022 but rose significantly following the release of ChatGPT, with relative frequencies increasing in 2023 and showing a substantial surge in 2024. Counterfactual modelling suggested that at least 9% of 2024 abstracts contained linguistic traces consistent with LLM editing. Group-level analyses revealed that increases were not confined to lower-prestige outlets as higher-ranked journals, major publishers, and both English- and non-English speaking countries all showed significant growth in AI-associated word use. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence that generative AI has measurably shaped the psychology publication record. The results raise critical implications for research integrity, transparency, and equity in scientific publishing. As psychology continues to address its credibility challenges, proactive standards, ethical guidelines, and detection practices will be essential for integrating AI tools responsibly into the scholarly ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "A sense of belonging is linked to people’s engagement, performance and wellbeing in educational and workplace settings. However, previous literature on belonging at university lacks conceptual clarity, often using unidimensional measures that foreground social integration, which may not be valid and transferable to neurodivergent students and employees. Adopting an inclusive definition of neurodivergence, we report a participatory action research project in the context of a university in northern England, with the aim of understanding and promoting belonging on campus. At the first phase, 152 anonymous contributions were received across a multi-media cross-campus installation. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis, which identified key determinants of belonging for neurodivergent people: (1) Meaningful inclusive practice, characterised by flexibility and choice in learning, inclusion by default, validation and being believed; (2) Neurodivergent representation as a shared responsibility, supported by identity spaces and visible acceptance of difference; and (3) Navigating time, space and transition, highlighting the interdependency between space and experience, via constant cost-benefit decision-making. These themes informed a second phase of in-depth interviews with staff and students (n=13), analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. The findings are presented as a Model of Neurodivergent Belonging at University, framed through five questions that people negotiate to actively construct a sense of belonging in their contexts. We conclude that belonging at university for neurodivergent people requires authentic acceptance, rather than assimilation or institutional affiliation. Making small, achievable changes across university systems can cascade into meaningful gains in success and wellbeing for neurodivergent people.",

First, we manipulate within-subjects across 39 attitudes what year in the past we ask people to estimate American attitudes from 2012 back to 1822. We also manipulate whether we ask people at all about the past, or present, or future, across attitudes. Finally, we ask people to predict American attitudes in the future, within-subjects from 10 to 200 years in the future. Across 4,664 estimates—we replicate the finding that Americans believe progress has occurred. We also show, however, that Americans believe progress has occurred only relatively recently, attitudes in the more distant past were stable and unchanging. We also show that Americans believe progress will continue into the future, although at a slower rate. Overall, our findings replicate that stereotypes of the past lead people to misperceive attitude change, but largely because we misperceive how the past was. Americans see the past as a stable and unmoving place.",

          "abstract": "Humans organize semantic knowledge into complex networks that encode relations between concepts. The structure of those networks has broad implications for human cognitive processes, and for theories of semantic development. Evidence from large lexical networks such as those derived from word associations suggest that semantic networks are characterized by high sparsity and clustering while maintaining short average paths between concepts, a phenomenon known as a 'small-world' network. It has also been argued that those networks are 'scale-free', meaning that the number of connections (or degree) between concepts follows a power-law distribution whereby most concepts have few connections while a few have many. However, the scale-free property is still debated, and the extent to which the lexical evidence reflects the naturally occurring semantic regularities of the environment has not been investigated systematically. To address this, we collected and analyzed semantic descriptors, human evaluations, and similarity judgments from four large datasets of naturalistic stimuli across three modalities (visual, auditory, and audio-visual) comprising 7,916 stimuli and 610,841 human responses. By connecting concepts that co-occur as descriptors of the same stimuli, we construct 'multimodal' semantic networks. We show that these networks exhibit a clear small-world structure with a degree distribution that is best captured by a truncated power law (i.e., the most-connected concepts are less common than predicted by a perfect power law). We further show that these networks are predictive of human sensory judgments on these domains, as well as reaction times in an independent lexical decision task. Finally, we show that multimodal networks also share overlapping themes with previously analyzed lexical networks, which upon a more rigorous re-analysis are revealed to be truncated too. Our findings shed new light on the origins of the structure of semantic networks by tying it to the semantic regularities of the environment.",

This largely underappreciated polysemy problem prevents associative accounts of biological cognitive systems from being properly articulated, understood and criticized. Based on a review traversing psychological, neuronal and behavioral sciences, we delineate and characterize these five categories of usage, to show how such classification improves transparency across fields and casts new light on various debates.

          "abstract": "Disgust is a fundamental and multifaceted human emotion that plays a crucial role in survival by helping individuals avoid contamination and disease. Disgust manifests in response to odors, textures, and visual cues such as bodily fluids and insects, triggering avoidance behaviors like scrunching the nose or averting the eyes. It also influences social interactions, morality, and mate selection. Disgust is categorized into pathogen, sexual, and moral domains, each shaping human behavior differently. This study examines the social and pathological aspects of disgust, focusing on how personality traits and gender influence its manifestation. We found that disgust significantly impacts thoughts and behaviors, often leading to biases such as stigma, discrimination, and social rejection. Additionally, the experience of disgust varies between genders. Our review also highlights that heightened disgust sensitivity is associated with conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Our study shows that despite advancements in understanding the psychological implications of disgust, current intervention techniques often fall short due to its deep-seated, learned nature, highlighting the need for more effective behavioral and psychotherapeutic strategies to mitigate the maladaptive aspects of disgust, both in clinical settings and everyday social interactions.",

          "abstract": "Human beings rely on multiple sensory channels to share emotions, yet whether touch alone can convey specific affective states remains unknown. Previous studies often conflate tactile communication with concurrent visual or auditory cues, or reduce touch to artificial stimulation, leaving its independent communicative role unresolved. Here we introduce a dyadic paradigm that isolates touch as the sole channel of affective exchange. While Senders viewed negative or neutral videos, blindfolded Receivers—deprived of auditory input—were asked to infer the Sender’s emotional state based only on handholding. Across 59 dyads, tactile contact significantly enhanced behavioral alignment, particularly for arousal in negative contexts. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning revealed that handholding increased inter-brain synchrony (IBS) in prefrontal circuits, with the Receiver’s left inferior frontal gyrus emerging as a central hub. Moreover, trait empathy differentially modulated these effects in Senders and Receivers, highlighting the role of dispositional factors in tactile communication. Together, these findings provide convergent behavioral, neural, and dispositional evidence that touch constitutes a dedicated channel for emotional transmission, advancing a mechanistic framework for its foundational role in human social connection.",

          "abstract": "Aim. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) has become a widespread tool to study time-varying constructs across many subfields of psychological and psychiatric research. Variety in subfields of research and constructs of interest has contributed to considerable methodological variation. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to 1) describe the methodological variation  in ESM study designs and 2) assess the transparency (i.e., reporting and open science practices) of ESM studies. \nMethods. We developed an extensive list of data extraction items covering the entire workflow of an ESM study, from conception of the research question to reporting the results. This data was extracted from 150 recently published articles, describing 162 studies applying ESM in the field of psychology and psychiatry. \nResults.  As expected, variation was observed for every methodological decision. Some findings aligned with previous syntheses of the literature (e.g., a median study duration of ten days, a majority of studies including convenience samples of the general population, the high prevalence of multilevel modeling). Regarding other decisions, this review was able to provide new insights (e.g., questionnaire length and content often varied between and/or within participants, average sample sizes have increased over time). Transparency in reporting and open science practices seem to have improved in recent years, but there is room for further development of awareness and guidance. \nImplications.  This broad overview of ESM research serves as a first step towards a broader goal to improve the methodological quality of ESM research in psychology, contributing to a more rigorous, credible science of daily life.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground\nAlthough autistic adults experience depression at higher rates than non-autistic adults, little is known about how psychologists assess depression in this group. It is unclear whether psychologists apply DSM-5-TR criteria directly, adapt them, or supplement them with additional considerations, given that autism-related characteristics may influence how depressive symptoms are described and interpreted. This study examined how psychologists interpret depressive symptoms in autistic adults, and whether the use of DSM-5-TR criteria differs from assessments with non-autistic adults.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 20 psychologists who had experience assessing and treating depression in autistic adults. We conducted semi-structured interviews between October 2024 and January 2025. Using direct content analysis, we coded responses according to DSM-5-TR criteria and employed inductive analysis to identify additional features outside these criteria.\n\nResults\nPsychologists described using DSM-5-TR criteria as a guiding framework while adapting interpretation to account for autistic baselines. They described depressed mood as pervasive hopelessness, anger, or somatic complaints, more often than sadness, and more entrenched than in non-autistic adults. They described autistic anhedonia and depression attacks as alternative variations of core DSM-5-TR criteria, with depression attacks characterised as sudden episodes of acute hopelessness and suicidality distinct from chronic mood disturbance. Worthlessness reflected lived experiences of exclusion rather than cognitive distortion. Psychologists considered several DSM-5-TR symptoms diagnostically ambiguous. They also noted depression-related modulation of autistic characteristics and self-injurious behaviour as meaningful clinical indicators. Psychologists provided clinical observations across criteria to inform assessment.\n\nConclusion\nPsychologists emphasised that while DSM-5-TR criteria remain applicable, they require adaptation when assessing autistic adults. Psychologists highlighted autistic anhedonia, depression attacks, self-injurious behaviour, and depression-related changes in autistic characteristics as critical for accurate diagnosis and risk assessment. These findings underscore the need for autism-informed clinical guidance and co-designed diagnostic tools that reflect autistic experiences of depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms are related to emotion regulation difficulties which, in turn, are thought to contribute to negative outcomes such as mental health, social and behavioural difficulties. Emotion regulation theory suggests that the use of emotion regulation strategies is an important component of emotion regulation; however, whether and in which ways this may be disrupted by ADHD symptoms remains unclear. Capturing emotion regulation strategy use in daily life is particularly valuable for illuminating the reasons underlying emotion regulation difficulties in ADHD. Method: We used dynamic structural equation modelling (DSEM) to explore the associations between ADHD symptoms and the dynamics of four emotion regulation strategies in daily life: acceptance, rumination, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression. We used data from the D2M study (n= 451, nobservations =16,129), a two-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study of young adults.  Results: ADHD symptoms were associated with higher levels of negative affect, rumination and suppression in daily life, as well as lower use of reappraisal and acceptance. Subtler emotion regulation dynamics such as the strength of relations between strategy use and subsequent negative affect and between negative affect and subsequent strategy use were only significantly related to ADHD symptoms for a subset of negative emotion-strategy combinations. Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are associated with emotion regulation strategy use in the course of daily life. By implication, training strategy use, especially reducing rumination, could be a potentially valuable intervention target to reduce emotional difficulties associated with ADHD symptoms and their downstream impacts.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Live music provides a multisensory and socially engaging experience that may amplify emotional responses compared with passive listening. However, extant studies frequently rely on small samples and utilize limited statistical approaches, thereby constraining the generalizability of findings. \nObjective: The present study sought to compare valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) between live music attendance and passive listening using a large, ecologically valid dataset and employing both Bayesian and frequentist methodologies. \nMethods: A total of 17,498 observations were drawn from the Open Science Framework “Moods and Activities in Music” dataset. Following data cleaning, 15,007 valid cases for valence and 9,552 for arousal remained. Ratings of valence and arousal were recoded on a continuous scale ranging from −1 to +1. Independent-samples Welch t-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted, complemented by Bayesian t-tests and ANOVAs (Cauchy prior r = 0.707) to quantify evidence strength. \nResults: Live music attendance yielded significantly higher valence (M = 0.121, SD = 0.418) than passive listening (M = 0.057, SD = 0.394), t(15,005) = −8.432, p &lt; .001, d = −0.161, BF10 = 5.19 × 10¹³. Arousal was also significantly higher for live music (M = 0.130, SD = 0.528) versus passive listening (M = −0.011, SD = 0.448), t(9,550) = −12.645, p &lt; .001, d = −0.301, BF10 = 267.23. Classical (frequentist) and Bayesian analyses demonstrated convergent results. \nConclusions: The findings support the hypothesis that engagement with live music intensifies emotional responses, plausibly via enhanced dopaminergic reward processing and collectively synchronized neural activity. The results underscore the value of integrating Bayesian and frequentist approaches and advocate for future research employing physiological and neuroimaging measures to elucidate causal mechanisms underlying these effects. \nKeywords: live music; valence; arousal; Bayesian analysis; emotion; music psychology",

          "abstract": "Social cognition abilities develop rapidly in the second year of life, yet even in the first months, infants show sophistication in representing social events, such as dyadic interactions. The neural structures supporting these early capacities remain unknown. Human neuroimaging has identified a posterior occipitotemporal pathway, originating in the visual cortex, that responds selectively to interacting (vs. non-interacting) people by representing features (e.g., spatial relations) relevant to social event categorization. We asked whether such neural selectivity is present in preverbal infants, as a potential neural mechanism for early social perception. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we recorded brain activity in 6- and 10-month-old infants, as well as adults, while they viewed point-light displays of interacting (face-to-face) or non-interacting (back-to-back) dyads. In adults, interacting dyads yielded increased activity in posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and adjacent occipitotemporal and temporoparietal regions, replicating established neuroimaging findings. In infants, the same contrast engaged a similar network. No reliable difference emerged between 6- and 10-month-olds, though the effect was less widespread in the younger group, with a peak around pSTS. This social-interaction effect was distinct from that of body motion perception, suggesting separate mechanisms for perceiving general biological agents versus interacting agents. These findings demonstrate that, early in life, the human brain is tuned to visual cues of social engagement. We propose that early processing of human social relationships relies on a perceptual cue-based mechanism for recognizing interactions from relational properties in the stimulus, such as face-to-face interpersonal orientation.",

However, some studies suggest that such protective effects may be specific to certain types of dementia. Meanwhile, several prospective studies which investigated whether bilingualism reduces the incidence rate of dementia produced null results. Therefore, we conducted the first Bayesian meta-analysis to examine the relationship between bilingualism and age at onset of dementia and bilingualism and the incidence rate of dementia respectively. The results from 18 age at onset studies revealed that bilinguals were, on average, 3.45 years older than monolinguals at symptom onset (95% credible interval [CrI]: [2.8, 4.1]). Moreover, the result was only slightly influenced by years of education, although the effect of education on dementia remains uncertain. The results from 6 incidence rate studies did not provide robust evidence for bilingualism’s preventive effect. Therefore, this meta-analysis demonstrated that bilingualism has potential effects in delaying the onset of dementia but not preventing it. Moreover, subgroup analyses revealed a relatively consistent pattern of delayed symptom onset among bilinguals, though the estimated delays differed across dementia types. However, due to the limited number of studies available for each dementia subtype, uncertainty remains regarding whether bilingualism induces differential effects across dementia types. This highlights the need for further research specifically targeting non-Alzheimer’s dementias to better clarify these potential differences.",

          "abstract": "Cultural attractor theory proposes that recurrent psychological biases shape the persistence and transformation of cultural traditions. Portraiture offers a unique test case, embedding perceptual cues that reflect both individual choices and collective conventions. Using automated facial analysis (OpenFace), we examined over 2,000 digitized portraits from Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe, religious artworks, and Japanese ukiyo-e. Results replicated Morin’s (2013) finding of a Renaissance shift toward direct gaze, but this trend reversed after 1600, suggesting the attractor was not stable. Religious works diverged, becoming more averted, while secular portraits engaged viewers. The left cheek bias was strong in the Renaissance, weakened in later Europe, and remained stable in ukiyo-e. Across analyses, sitter fame—but not gaze—predicted cultural visibility. Our study demonstrates how computational analyses of artworks can recover long-term dynamics of human psychology, offering “cognitive fossils” that illuminate the coevolution of visual culture and social behavior.",

          "abstract": "Achievement emotions are a common experience in sport and exercise, yet comprehensive frameworks for conceptualizing and measuring these emotions are lacking. To address this gap, we introduce a taxonomy to the sport and exercise domain that organizes achievement emotions by valence (positive, negative), arousal (activating, deactivating), and object focus (activity, prospective outcomes, retrospective outcomes). To provide a measure that is consistent with this taxonomy, we further introduce the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire – Sport and Exercise (AEQ-SE), a new instrument assessing prototypical emotions across all twelve resulting emotion categories. Across two independent samples (total N = 862), results from network modeling and regression analysis supported the relevance of valence, arousal, and object focus for capturing the structure of achievement emotions in sport and exercise. Moreover, AEQ-SE scales were systematically associated with key theoretical antecedents (control and value appraisals) and outcomes (satisfaction, motivation, sport and exercise behavior, indicators of well-being). Together, our findings provide empirical evidence for the proposed three-dimensional taxonomy and establish the AEQ-SE as a psychometrically sound tool for studying achievement emotions in sport and exercise contexts.",

This study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of CBT trainer, an app facilitating training of CBT therapists through AI simulation of therapeutic interactions with feedback supporting competency development.\n\nMethod: This mixed-methods pilot study employed a two-stage approach. Stage 1 involved initial usability testing. Stage 2 included 59 participants from psychological practitioner training programs (77.2% from Low Intensity CBT Interventions program, 22.8% from Doctorate in Clinical Psychology) who engaged with the application over a month. Outcome measures included the System Usability Scale, platform engagement, post-study surveys on perceived learning outcomes, and qualitative feedback.\n\nResults: The CBT Trainer exceeded all pre-specified outcome targets, with participants spending an average of 95.24 minutes (SD = 134.58) engaging with roleplays. Participants voluntarily created an average of 4.15 role-play sessions each (SD = 3.55), with each session containing an average of 49.69 interactions. The platform achieved excellent usability with a mean SUS score of 82.20 (SD = 12.93). Assessment skills were the most significantly self-reported improved area (96.7%), followed by information gathering skills (66.7%). Participants valued immediate feedback (83.3%) and convenience (73.3%) as key advantages over traditional methods. \n\nConclusion: This pilot study provides evidence that AI-based virtual patient simulation offers a promising supplementary training tool for CBT therapists, with particular strengths in accessibility and immediate feedback. Future research should employ randomized controlled designs with objective competency assessments to determine whether simulated practice translates to measurable improvements in clinical performance.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge for psychological theorizing is: At what level(s) should we look for the best explanations and predictions of human behavior? The dominant view is that potentially the best theories to explain behavior are found in neuroscience and biology. Therefore, we start from the perspective of these lower levels, and consider the prospects of developing theories based on those levels. We focus on C. elegans, a model organism whose entire neuronal connectome is mapped, and use it as a case study to highlight the difficulties in developing neuroscientific theories of cognition and behavior. We argue that the neuroscientific levels are not promising avenues for constructing explanatory or predictive psychological theories. This is due to the immense complexity and context-dependency of biological systems, even those as simple as C. elegans. In order to tackle this complexity, we need higher-level variables that capture stable features of these systems. For psychological theory development, this implies that we should focus on conceptual work and discovering robust phenomena, and take psychology and behavior as the starting points.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how action histories – unfolding sequences of actions with objects – provide a context for both attentional allocation and linguistic repair strategies. Building on theories of enactive cognition [34] and sensorimotor contingency theory [40], we experimentally manipulated action sequences (action history) to create either simple or rich “situational models,” and investigated how these models interact with attention and reflect in linguistic processes during human–robot interaction. Participants (N = 30) engaged in a controlled object placement task with a humanoid robot, where the action (manner) information was either provided or omitted. The omission elicited repair behaviors in participants that were in focus of our investigation. For rich models (competing action possibilities) participants demonstrated: a) increased attentional reorientation, reflecting active engagement with the situational model b) preference for restricted repairs, targeting the specific source of trouble in action selection. Conversely, a simple situational model led to more generalized attention patterns and open repair strategies, suggesting weaker constraints on internal processing. These findings highlight how situational structures emerge externally to scaffold internal cognitive processes, with action histories serving as a crucial context for the interface between perception, action, and language. We discuss how to implement such a tight loop in the assistance of a system.",

Digital media use has proliferated dramatically during this developmental window, yet neuroscientific understanding of its impact on brain development remains limited.\nObjectives: To systematically review and synthesize neuroimaging evidence examining digital media effects on adolescent brain development, with focus on reward, salience, cognitive control, and social brain networks during critical developmental periods.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies examining digital media use in adolescents aged 11-19 years. Electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Neuroscience databases) were searched from 2015-2024. Inclusion criteria required original neuroimaging data (fMRI, structural MRI, DTI, EEG), validated digital media measures, and minimum sample sizes of 20 participants. Coordinate-based meta-analysis used Activation Likelihood Estimation, with qualitative synthesis organized by brain networks and developmental trajectories.\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria (N=11,234 participants total). Coordinate-based meta-analysis revealed significant convergence in bilateral amygdala (left: x=-26, y=-2, z=-12; right: x=22, y=4, z=-18), ventral striatum (x=-24, y=14, z=-4), anterior insula (x=36, y=22, z=-4), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (x=42, y=-42, z=28).

This approach creates adversarial dynamics between adolescent privacy rights and family safety concerns, potentially damaging family relationships while inadequately supporting healthy development.\n\nObjective: To develop an evidence-based framework integrating developmental psychology research with privacy technology design to support healthy adolescent autonomy development while preserving and strengthening family relationships.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic interdisciplinary review examining autonomy development research (psychology literature) and privacy technology capabilities (computer science literature) from 2000-2024. Electronic databases searched included PsycINFO, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. Expert validation employed a modified Delphi technique with three rounds across interdisciplinary panels including developmental psychologists, privacy researchers, and family therapists (N=9 experts).\n\nResults: Systematic review identified 127 studies across psychological and technical literature. Key findings include: (1) autonomy development occurs gradually with significant individual variation; (2) family communication quality mediates privacy-autonomy conflicts; (3) crisis intervention requires balancing safety with relationship preservation; (4) cultural variation necessitates flexible frameworks.

The current study directly evaluated this claim by testing both semantic and phonological DRM tasks with old-new recognition and RK ratings. We replicated the RK dissociation, yet both parametric and non-parametric analyses indicated a single underlying dimension. First, a signal detection theory model provided a near-perfect fit to the data where R judgments merely reflect a higher response criterion than K. Moreover, a state-trace analysis uncovered a monotonic relationship between semantic and phonological overall and R false alarms.

The study also tested whether the effects of the VR intervention varied according to individual differences in environmental sensitivity assessed as a personality trait (i.e., trait sensitivity). Thirty-four Japanese adolescents were randomly assigned to either a Forest condition or a Clock condition. A significant Condition × Time interaction was detected in a mixed linear model predicting negative affect. Negative affect decreased from pre- to post-intervention in the Forest condition, but not in the Clock condition. Individual differences in trait sensitivity did not moderate the effects of the VR intervention. Overall, the findings of this study are consistent with those reported in systematic reviews and meta-analyses with adult samples.

We use a converging approach which compares individuals with ADHD against neurotypical individuals and individuals with ADHD off medication against on medication on two conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that ADHD was associated with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both conflict tasks.

Although several factor modeling strategies have been proposed to mitigate their adverse effects, there is limited systematic research assessing their performance with exploratory structural equation models (ESEM). The present study evaluated the impact of different types of response bias related to wording effects (random and straight-line carelessness, acquiescence, item difficulty, and mixed) on ESEM models incorporating two popular method modeling strategies, the correlated traits-correlated methods minus one (CTC[M-1]) model and random intercept item factor analysis (RIIFA), as well as the “do nothing” approach. Five variables were manipulated using Monte Carlo methods: the type and magnitude of response bias, factor loadings, factor correlations, and sample size. Overall, the results showed that ignoring wording effects leads to poor model fit and serious distortions of the ESEM estimates. The RIIFA approach generally performed best at countering these adverse impacts and recovering unbiased factor structures, whereas the CTC(M-1) models struggled when biases affected both positively and negatively worded items. A straightforward guide is offered to applied researchers who wish to use ESEM with mixed-worded scales.",

Despite the prevalence of item non-responses in empirical studies, their impact on these statistics has not been systematically examined. Existing software (package) often applies heuristic treatments (e.g., listwise or pairwise deletion), which can distort fit statistics because missing data further inflate discrepancies between observed and expected proportions. This study evaluates the appropriateness of such treatments through extensive simulation. Results show that deletion methods degrade the accuracy of fit testing: fit indices are inflated under both null and power conditions, with the bias worsening as missingness increases. In addition, the impact of missing data exceeds that of model misspecification. Practical recommendations and alternative methods are discussed to guide applied researchers.",

Across 3 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies (N = 3,323), including student, general adult, and military veteran samples, we demonstrate that Meaningfulness of Effort acts as a stable unidimensional facet of conscientiousness. It is tightly linked to industriousness, with comparable test-retest reliability, and distinct from need for cognition, while also uniquely predictive of wellbeing outcomes. Those higher in meaningfulness of effort pursue and find meaning in more effortful activities. Similarly, they enjoy higher meaning in life, life and job satisfaction, and less psychological distress, burnout, and PTSD symptoms. Importantly, we saw that Meaningfulness of Effort predicted these wellbeing outcomes over longer time lags.

          "authors": "Kayden M Stockwell; Talyn Steinmann; Vikram K Jaswal",
          "abstract": "Background: Autistic college students may encounter academic content about autism that is deficit-focused. In this study, we compared how autistic and non-autistic students evaluated such content and the extent to which the content affected their self-esteem.\nMethods: The final sample included 172 undergraduate students (n non-autistic=  86, n autistic = 86) recruited using Prolific. Participants read a brief vignette about an autistic child taken from a popular psychology textbook. They rated how useful they found the vignette for understanding autism, how useful the average college student would find it, and how offensive and stigmatizing it was. Participants also provided self-esteem ratings before and after reading the vignette and completed three individual difference measures (strength of autistic identity, autism knowledge, ableism critical consciousness).\nResults: Compared to non-autistic participants, autistic participants rated the vignette as less useful and as more offensive and more stigmatizing. Individual differences influenced these effects in two ways: First, the stronger the autistic participants’ autism identity, the more offensive and stigmatizing they found the vignette to be. Second, participants with greater autism knowledge rated the vignette as less useful. Although average self-esteem ratings did not change after reading the vignette for either neurotype, 39.5% of the autistic sample reported feeling worse about themselves after reading the vignette than before. \nConclusion: This study provides insight into how autistic and non-autistic college students react to autism-related academic content, highlighting the roles of identity strength and autism knowledge in shaping these reactions. The findings underscore the need for more inclusive and representative depictions of autism in academic content by revealing significant differences in how autistic and non-autistic students evaluate the same material.",

          "abstract": "Because Visual Working Memory (VWM) capacity is limited, previous research has aimed to improve VWM with feedback and monetary incentives. However, the effects of feedback and incentives on VWM have been mixed. Here, we propose an “optimal strategy” account to explain when feedback will be effective versus ineffective at improving VWM performance. We hypothesized that incentivizing individuals with performance goals that are aligned to their capacity would yield higher average performance and fewer performance failures (“lapses”). Participants completed a whole-report VWM task and we varied the performance goal needed to earn bonus money on each trial (e.g., “Remember 3!”). In Experiments 1a and 1b, performance goals varied from 1 to 5 items, and we manipulated whether goals were blocked (Experiment 1a) or intermixed (Experiment 1b). In Experiment 2 (pre-registered), we replicated Experiment 1a with a larger sample size to examine individual differences in optimal VWM performance. Across all three experiments, group-averaged optimal VWM performance corresponded to goals that aligned to typical group-level capacity (~3 items). In contrast, supra-capacity goals (e.g., “remember 5 items”) tended to harm VWM performance by increasing lapses, consistent with an overload effect. In Experiment 2, we found that participants performed best when goals corresponded to their individual capacity estimate, and replicated overload effects at supra-capacity goals. However, we found a trade-off between metacognitive accuracy and optimal VWM performance. Altogether, our results suggest that VWM performance improvements rely on feedback that encourages the allocation of typical capacity limits, rather than encouraging maximizing performance.",

          "authors": "Shulang Yue; Iris Vilares",
          "abstract": "Numerous fields have demonstrated that our decisions are guided by social information, and one important piece of social information is social comparison. Previous research has suggested that social status can influence trust, but most prior studies examining the influence of social comparison on trust decisions employed social comparison contexts that potentially “justify” the difference in social status, such as performing better/worse in a task. The current study investigated how, instead, interpersonal trust and risk-related decisions are made after experiencing arbitrarily manipulated social comparison contexts. In addition, the study directly compared people’s behaviors in trust and risk environments under different social positions in a single experimental paradigm. Across two experiments (Experiment 1: discovery sample, N = 302; Experiment 2: validation sample, N = 299), we showed that exposure to randomly manipulated social comparison contexts significantly influenced participants’ economic allocation decisions, their perceived relative ranks, and their reported levels of envy towards their target of comparison. However, our findings suggest that participants’ subsequent decision-making regarding interpersonal trust and risk-taking were not affected by this arbitrary-based social comparison. Our results also show that participants perceived risk and trust environments differently, with smaller amounts invested in the risk scenario than in the trust scenario. Overall, our findings indicate which behaviors and feelings are more likely to be affected by being randomly placed in a favorable or unfavorable social comparison scenario, and increase our understanding of trust and risk across social comparison scenarios.",

Building on an interdisciplinary Christian-sensitive dual process model for conceptualizing and measuring incident-specific experiences of reconciliation with God, we use cross-sectional and longitudinal data to examine the psychometric properties of the Reconciliation with God Scale (RWGS) in seven independent adult Christian samples representing a diverse range of countries, linguistic backgrounds, and denominational affiliations (N = 1,391). We present evidence for the two proposed factors—engaging in repentance with God and experiencing absolution from God—of the RWGS based on analyses of internal structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminative validity.

          "abstract": "Individuals who experience schizophrenias often have premorbid signs as early as childhood. However, they rarely develop pathognomonic psychotic symptoms until adolescence or young adulthood, a period of substantial brain remodeling. Current efforts to reduce risk for psychosis include psychosocial interventions as well as drugs designed to treat existing psychosis in mature individuals. These interventions have shown only modest beneficial effects, on average. This paper reviews evidence suggesting that other existing medications might be more effective in reducing risk of psychosis. Over the last decade, results have accrued on the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes that support healthy adolescent brain remodeling. In addition, studies have identified which of these processes may be inherently abnormal in those at risk for schizophrenias. Some mechanisms have been observed convergently from brain imaging, genomic, and cell culture studies. These mechanisms prominently include abnormal neuronal and glial development and function, compromised synapse remodeling, aberrant energy production, and altered immune functions. A search was performed to identify medications, already in use for other clinical purposes, that are known to target, modulate, and support these mechanisms and processes. Agents with those properties are noted and discussed. These drugs have well known standard doses and effects. They should be considered for trials in adolescents at high risk for psychosis. They might also serve as models for the design of even better-targeted agents to prevent or ameliorate psychosis.",

          "abstract": "In the natural world, higher-level visual features (e.g., scenes and objects) systematically co-occur\nwith specific lower-level features (e.g., textures and patterns). This natural covariation makes it\ndifficult to isolate aspects of behavior or brain activity that are specific to one level of the feature\nhierarchy. For example, a particular brain or behavioral response may reflect recognition of a\n“jungle” scene, or it may reflect sensitivity to leaf textures and dense vertical lines that constitute\njungle scenes. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach for decoupling higher-\nand lower-level features in naturalistic images. We employed a Stable Diffusion image generation\nframework to create a naturalistic image set in which scene–object pairings and texture–pattern\npairings are factorially combined, enabling independent manipulations of higher-level and\nlower-level image content. To validate our approach, we used state-of-the-art image processing\nmodels to confirm that higher-level features are represented similarly regardless of their\nlower-level constituent features and, conversely, that lower-level features are represented\nsimilarly regardless of the higher-level objects/scenes to which they contribute. We then\nconfirmed that human participants can readily and rapidly categorize these features in our\ngenerated images. We present the image generation framework and introduce the SPOT\n(Scenes, Patterns, Objects, Textures) Grid, a publicly available stimulus set accompanied by\nimage-specific metrics (upon request: https://forms.gle/X2HpzRYUGigFS1S27).

Although the reliability of the results of such consultations is taken for granted, their consistency across independent groups has never been systematically assessed (to our knowledge). Would running the same open-innovation challenge or citizen consultation with different groups of stakeholders allow decision-makers to extract the same best ideas? In this report, we rigorously assess the reliability of the results obtained with a professional crowdstorming method in a real-world setting. Two separate but equivalent groups of MBA students in the same course were asked to independently propose and prioritize ideas to improve the MBA program. Using semantic similarity measures based on OpenAI and Google's embeddings, we find that the two groups independently proposed similar sets of valuable ideas but different sets of poor ideas. We also find that they prioritized similar ideas similarly, enabling the decision maker to select similar sets of winning ideas in both groups. This suggests that a well-designed crowdstorming process may be trusted to produce results that accurately and reliably capture the collective intelligence.",

The texts are of varying genres and were chosen based on overall fluency and comprehensibility.

The\ncorpus contributes to a small collection of corpora with simultaneous recording of reading times and EEG. While this is often achieved using eye-tracking, the use of SPR offers methodological advantages, particularly in aligning neural signals with word-level processing. In addition, the use of natural texts with longer dependencies makes the corpus a unique resource for psycholinguistic research.

          "abstract": "The developmental trajectory of the generalisation of avoidance has received limited research attention, despite generalisation and avoidance being key features of anxiety disorders. This study used a gamified avoidance task to investigate generalisation in 96 children aged 5–11 years old. The task was an adaption of the classic “Space Invaders” videogame, in which participants have to shoot at spaceships to win points but also avoid being shot by a large spaceship (i.e., aversive outcome). The appearance of the large spaceship (the outcome; which resulted in loss of points) was signalled by coloured sensors at the top of the screen. One sensor predicted the outcome (CS+; an aqua coloured sensor), and a second did not (CS-; orange). Participants could avoid the loss of points by moving into the safe areas of the screen in anticipation of the large spaceship. Following avoidance training, we then presented six generalisation stimuli varying along the blue-green dimension of the CS+, to assess generalisation. Our findings revealed that age significantly influenced generalisation gradients, with younger children (5-8) exhibiting broader gradients compared to older children (9-11). Regression analyses indicated that age, but not anxiety, was a significant predictor of generalisation. These results underscore the impact of ontogenetic changes on the generalisation of avoidance behaviour and highlight the importance of including young children in research to better understand the mechanisms underlying generalization and factors leading to anxiety disorders.",

We tested 127 British children in Years 2 and 3 before and after a six-week home-based intervention, in which children were randomly assigned to an experimental group who watched television with English subtitles or a control group who watched television without subtitles. Children’s reading fluency was assessed via two standard tests of reading fluency and via their engagement with subtitles while watching videos, measured with eye-tracking. Results showed that both groups improved their reading fluency over six weeks. Crucially, there was no evidence that subtitle exposure (of around 66 hours on average) drove an improvement in reading fluency, or that a more intensive subtitle intervention provided any additional benefit. We conclude that same-language subtitles are unlikely to improve children’s reading fluency. However, the primary school reading curriculum has a positive impact on reading fluency that can be observed over a relatively short time-scale.",

          "abstract": "Collecting intensive longitudinal data via methods like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is necessary to study dynamics in psychological constructs. However, detecting careless responding is more important than ever, as this methodology burdens participants more than traditional single survey studies. If undetected, careless responding reduces data quality and can lead to invalid findings by distorting correlations between items and constructs and compromising the psychometric properties of scales. In turn, this hinders progress toward cumulative psychological science. In recent years, several data-driven approaches have been proposed that assess whether an individual was attentive or careless for each timepoint-specific measurement after data collection. However, the variety and complexity of available methods can be overwhelming for researchers. In this paper, we summarized, applied, and compared 13 methods that flag careless responses in a rich EMA dataset from the WARN-D study with 206,318 observations (from n = 1194 participants). Together with our detailed supplementary tutorials, the paper serves as a guide for researchers to evaluate and report careless responding in their own data. At the same time, we show that the development of methods for careless responding detection is still in its early stages, as the studied approaches produced very different results. We provide recommendations for which methods are currently most promising based on our findings and discuss important next steps in validating them empirically.",

While specific neural mechanisms have been implicated in these associations, the precise relationship between white matter structure and putative cognitive effects of musical training are unclear. The present study examined the effects of musical training on cognitive performance and white matter structure in middle childhood using a combination of behavioral assessments and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a sample of 175 preadolescents (38 musicians and 137 non-musicians) between 7-9 years old.  Cognitive abilities were tested using the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III) and the Operation Span Task (OSPAN), while academic achievement was assessed using the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA II). In addition, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by measuring maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). Behavioral results revealed that participants with musical training had higher cognitive scores (F(15, 155) = 3.01, p &lt; 0.001), greater academic achievement (F(14, 156) = 3.57, p &lt; 0.001), and higher relative VO2 max (F(1, 170) = 6.32, p = 0.01) compared to non-musicians. DTI results revealed that musical training was associated with higher fractional anisotropy (F(1, 81) = 4.95, p = 0.029) and higher mode (F(1, 81) = 4.00, p = 0.049) in the left PCG to MTGp tract of the arcuate fasciculus (AF).

Examples of event-based data in the psychological and behavioral sciences include smoking a cigarette, experiencing a stressor, having a disruption to sleep, experiencing a depressive or manic episode, drinking an alcoholic beverage, or engaging in a bout of exercise. The increasing availability of dense sampling approaches allows for the measurement of such events at relatively fast time-scales (e.g., occurring across minutes, hours, days, or weeks), expanding the possibilities for how time can be conceptualized and modeled. Survival analysis is a modeling approach that allows researchers to address scientific questions regarding whether and when events occur in time. Although not often applied to EMA data, there are myriad research questions relevant to psychosocial and behavioral scientists which can be addressed using survival analysis. This article provides an overview of survival analysis, describes several time-based considerations for modeling event-based EMA data using survival analysis, and provides several illustrative examples of the different time-based considerations. Altogether, the goals of this article are to enhance knowledge of the types of research questions that can be examined using survival analysis, to illustrate nuances of applying the method to EMA data, and to spark ideas for future empirical and methodological research.",

Analyses revealed a significant interaction between sensory load and diagnosis: individuals with ADHD exhibited a greater decrease in cadence with increasing sensory load than their non-ADHD controls. Auditory load produced the strongest effects, consistent with evidence of atypical auditory filtering in ADHD. Rhythmic cues facilitated gait entrainment in controls to a greater extent than in those with ADHD, reflecting documented deficits in temporal processing and beat perception. These findings highlight that high sensory loads disrupt, rather than support, gait in ADHD, and that rhythm’s positive effect on cadence is not observed in ADHD to the same extent as in those without ADHD.

Concerns are growing about these scores’ validity, but subsequent research has not produced a widely accepted alternative. In Study 1, we systematically evaluated Hofstede’s I-C index, revealing inferior convergent and nomological validity compared to subsequent measures. Specific biases in Hofstede’s scores overestimate the individualism of English-speaking countries and collectivism of East Asian societies, which may perpetuate cultural stereotypes and underpin flawed theorizing. We illustrate how applying Hofstede’s scores can bias research findings. In Study 2, we aimed to develop an authoritative, theory-driven I-C index, using nationally representative data from the World Values Survey and European Values Study, covering 102 countries/territories inhabited by an estimated 88% of the world’s population. Our index shows excellent internal coherence and temporal stability and outperforms Hofstede’s I-C in associations with a nomological network of 28 societal indicators theoretically linked to I-C. We argue for an overdue paradigm shift in cross-cultural research: scholars should rely on theoretically appropriate and up-to-date measures of societal culture when seeking to understand global variation in human psychological functioning.",

          "abstract": "Recent research suggests that volitional personality change is possible through structured interventions, yet little is known about the temporal dynamics of such change. In psychotherapy, sudden gains—abrupt, substantial improvements between sessions—are robust predictors of treatment success. Based on 448 participants who completed a 12-week personality intervention, we examined whether similar sudden shifts occur in the context of volitional personality change and whether they explain differences in trait, life satisfaction, and self-esteem changes from the pre-test to the follow-up 3 months later. We compared four different measures for detecting shifts: daily and weekly personality states, generic change factors (e.g., gaining insight), and subjective progress. Sudden gains were relatively common and—with the exception of daily states—consistently associated with improvements in the targeted traits, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. Sudden gains in weekly states co-occurred with increased intervention engagement and key change processes such as gaining insight and practicing new behaviors—paralleling mechanisms found in psychotherapy. In contrast, sudden losses were less frequent and showed no meaningful negative effects for trait changes or life satisfaction. However, high dropout rates may have masked more consequential losses. These findings challenge the assumption that personality change is exclusively gradual and underscore the value of capturing dynamic, within-person fluctuations. Monitoring and leveraging such shifts may help to personalize interventions and optimize their impact. Future research should explore how sudden gains can be intentionally triggered and how interventions can be designed to support lasting change through both gradual and sudden pathways.",

          "abstract": "Language production in clinical populations varies not only by neurological condition but also by the type of discourse task used during assessment. This study introduces a detailed analysis of connected speech production tasks—Narrative, Procedural, and Picture-based—conducted in etiologically heterogeneous patient groups with neurological damage, namely, 1,394 individuals with Left and Right Hemisphere Damage (LHD, RHD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), dementia, and healthy controls. Drawing on over 290 linguistic features spanning phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, lexicon, and readability, we conducted a large-scale analysis of spoken texts using mixed-effects models to isolate the effects of diagnosis, task, and their interaction. Results revealed that task type exerts a pervasive influence on linguistic output, significantly interacting with diagnostic group across nearly all linguistic domains. Narrative tasks elicited more complex syntax and aspectual morphology, while procedural and descriptive tasks prompted simpler grammatical structures and greater lexical diversity, respectively. To explore high-dimensional linguistic patterns visually, we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), which revealed clear clustering of observations according to task type. The spatial arrangement of clusters reflected a continuum of contextual constraint: from highly structured picture description tasks (e.g., Cookie Theft), through procedural instruction tasks (e.g., sandwich-making), to conversational speech and open-ended narratives (e.g., accounts of brain injury, recovery, or illness). This gradient likely corresponds to increasing cognitive–linguistic demands, with unstructured tasks requiring greater topic generation, discourse planning, and memory retrieval. Crucially, the interaction between task and diagnosis modulates how underlying impairments manifest, indicating that linguistic deficits are not uniformly expressed across tasks. This challenges the validity of task-agnostic assessment and analysis practices, as well as normative comparisons. We propose a task-specific framework for clinical language assessment, enabling more precise identification of linguistic impairments and informing targeted therapeutic interventions. Our findings underscore the necessity of accounting for task effects in both clinical evaluation and the development of computational tools for neurogenic language disorders.",

          "abstract": "Human–AI co-creativity is often understood through a tool-use or collaboration frame, obscuring the relational dynamics of artistic practice with machine learning (ML) systems. To advance the field, we recast such artistic practice through Material Engagement Theory (MET), emphasizing how creative and aesthetic processes emerge in sustained relations between artist and system. We examined 18 contemporary artists’ engagements with ML from 54 documents using a qualitative, interpretive, and framework-guided approach. Our findings show how artists and ML systems co-constitute creative and aesthetic properties by mutually discovering and attuning to each other’s affordances, where creativity unfolds along a control-chance continuum driven by creative and aesthetic thinging, enabling a mutual aesthetic becoming through sustained interaction. Key factors include developing artistic intuition for ML, internalisation, and the evolving role of the meta-artist. Herewith, we contribute MET as a framework for enriching our understanding of human–AI co-creativity as emergent and relational.",

          "abstract": "Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is an increasing concern for adolescent mental health. This three-wave longitudinal study examined PSU trajectories and psychosocial predictors in 416 Polish adolescents (ages 11–18) across one academic year. Latent class growth analysis compared one- to four-class models; a three-class solution provided the best fit: High-Stable (persistently elevated Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale [SABAS] scores; n = 97), Mid-Stable (moderate, stable; n = 235), and Low-Decreasing (elevated baseline with decline; n = 84). Across waves, 20–22% met the SABAS cutoff, with higher prevalence among girls. Between-class comparisons showed clear psychosocial differentiation: the Low-Decreasing group reported the poorest adjustment (greater emotion regulation difficulties, higher anxiety, lower well-being), whereas the High-Stable group showed the most adaptive profile. In multinomial logistic regression, emotion regulation difficulties uniquely predicted higher odds of belonging to Mid-Stable (RRR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.04, 1.10]) and Low-Decreasing (RRR = 1.10, 95% CI [1.06, 1.13]) relative to High-Stable, while other predictors were nonsignificant. Sensitivity analyses with posterior-probability weighting yielded the same inferences. Findings indicate heterogeneous PSU courses in adolescence and highlight emotion regulation as a key differentiator of risk profiles. Results support integrating emotion-focused strategies into prevention and demonstrate the value of person-centered, longitudinal designs.",

This study investigated potential PPPT factors in FS and FMS separately.  \n\nMethods: Two hundred participants (FS=50, FMS=50, individuals with anxiety and/or depression [CC]=50, healthy controls [HC]=50) completed an in-depth medical history interview and online questionnaires to assess self-reported potential aetiological factors including traumatic/adverse life events, alexithymia, autistic traits, psychological and physical symptoms, illness perceptions, cognitive-behavioural responses, and outcome measures of general functioning, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL).  \n\nOutcomes: Participants with FS more frequently reported traumatic/adverse events and psychopathology (e.g., dissociation, PTSD) as illness causes/precipitating factors, and sensory symptom triggers, relative to FMS and/or CCs. In contrast, participants with FMS endorsed physical illness causes/precipitating factors, and physical activity and emotion-related symptom triggers, more frequently than FS and/or CCs. Physical and dissociative symptoms were elevated, alongside reductions in HRQoL and general functioning, in FS/FMS compared to CCs/HCs. Greater current, threatening illness-related beliefs and cognitions were disclosed in FS/FMS compared to CCs. Negative associations between HRQoL, cognitive-behavioural responses, and traumatic/adverse events were also seen in FS/FMS.  \n\nInterpretation: Distinct biopsychosocial factors may be involved in the development and maintenance of FS and FMS: traumatic events and psychopathology in FS, and physical illness/injury, physical functioning, and alexithymia in FMS. Unhelpful illness-related beliefs, and impacts on HRQoL and general functioning, are shared between these subtypes. The results of this study provide insight into potential subtype-specific characteristics of FS/FMS, with implications for treatment.  \n\nFunding: The study is funded by an MRC Career Development Award to SP [MR/V032771/1].

          "abstract": "Personality pathology presents unique challenges in adolescence, a critical period for developing social autonomy and complex peer relationships. Yet, little research examines how these vulnerabilities unfold in daily life. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment (AA) study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female) aged 12–21, capturing 13,190 interactions over 14 days. Using Contemporary Interpersonal Theory and the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we modeled links between personality pathology, perceptions of others’ and participants’ interpersonal behavior, and mentalizing. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) revealed that personality pathology was associated with lower daily social satisfaction in youth. Self-reports linked pathology to reduced perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, personality pathology was not associated with lower average mentalization but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Higher pathology strengthened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance, driven by Antagonism, while Psychoticism showed the reverse pattern, weakening this association. Detachment reduced the association of mentalizing and perceived warmth, and negative affectivity weakened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance. Findings highlight the dynamic nature of interpersonal dysfunction in adolescent personality pathology. Recognizing maladaptive patterns early may guide interventions that stabilize social interactions and promote mentalizing in ways that foster connection rather than control, reducing long-term challenges.",

          "abstract": "Adults are adept at metacognitively monitoring their memory accuracy explicitly and implicitly, and at using metacognitive control to maintain high memory accuracy, but the development of monitoring and control is less understood. We administered an episodic cued recall task with children aged five to 11 years (N = 106). Participants watched two video clips of everyday episodic events before answering cued recall memory questions. For each memory question, participants provided a confidence rating (explicit monitoring), sorted their answer into show/hide boxes (control), and chose to volunteer/withhold their response (control). Multiple behavioural gestures of cognitive effort (implicit monitoring; e.g., looking to carer, non-word fillers) were recorded and later coded by blind raters. Children were less accurate and less able to assign confidence to reflect their memory accuracy when they were forced to generate a response after previously saying “I don’t know”. But on volunteered trials, explicit, implicit monitoring and control measures predicted memory accuracy. There were age-related improvements in explicit monitoring for predicting memory accuracy, but there were no age differences in implicit monitoring or control processes. We found evidence for a direct and an indirect link between confidence and memory accuracy. Our findings suggest that explicit and implicit monitoring have different developmental trajectories in cued recall and that children can be adaptive to control their memory accuracy to a similar extent from early- to mid-childhood.",

          "abstract": "Aims: This study aimed to listen to children and young people with type 1 diabetes to determine which research was most important to them. We understood that managing diabetes could be challenging, especially dealing with painful insulin injections and strict food rules. By talking with children and young people, we sought to learn more about their needs and what mattered most to them in terms of research. \nMethods: This study was conducted by Diabetes UK in collaboration with the University of East London to understand what children and young people with type 1 diabetes need to better take care of themselves. The study involved 21 participants aged 6 to 17 from England, Wales, and Scotland. We conducted focus groups with children and young people, as well as separate proxy focus groups with parents/guardians of the youngest research participants. The parent/guardian focus groups supplemented the evidence from the children’s focus groups, with the study prioritizing the voices of children and young people, to explore the challenges they faced in managing diabetes at home, school, and during leisure activities.\nResults: Our study revealed significant issues in diabetes management across different age groups: 6–8-year-olds prioritize research for managing glucose levels at home, and educating catering assistants about diabetes; 9–11-year-olds prioritize easier-to-change pumps, and educating friends about diabetes; 12–14-year-olds focus on educating teachers, creating safe spaces for managing hypoglycaemia, and raising awareness about sports and mood fluctuations; 15–17-year-olds seek to reduce the burden of educating others about diabetes in school.\nConclusions: This study is significant for future research and practice because it provides valuable insights that will guide future work in supporting children and young people with type 1 diabetes. By understanding their needs and priorities, we can develop strategies and policies that align with their lifestyles and expectations. This, in turn, will help them better manage their condition, reduce the risk of health crises, and improve their overall well-being as they grow older with diabetes.",

          "abstract": "Missing data frequently occur in longitudinal designs and are commonly addressed using multiple imputation (MI), either in the form of multilevel MI, which treats repeated measures as nested within participants, or single-level MI, which treats repeated measures as separate variables. Previous research has shown that both approaches can perform well in applications of latent curve models (LCMs) in which the assumptions underlying multilevel MI are met. Using two simulation studies, we extend prior work in two directions: (1) to applications of single-indicator LCMs in which the assumptions of multilevel MI are violated, and (2) to multiple-indicator designs, in which multilevel MI can be challenging to implement and single-level MI may be computationally unstable due to the large number of variables. Results indicate that single-level MI provides the most accurate results in the contexts studied here, especially in conditions in which common implementations of multilevel MI are misspecified, and that large numbers of variables can be accommodated in single-level MI by employing dimension reduction techniques such as partial least squares. We also discuss the implications of these findings for applied research and illustrate the application of these methods with an empirical example.",

This question could be probed by asking individuals to define their understanding of loneliness. Using a meta-synthesis analytic approach on data from four studies which elicited such definitions from distinct populations, we report cross-study consensus on three characteristics of loneliness: its negative emotional valence; its standing as a consequence of 1) absence of genuine social connection, and of 2) lack of receipt of adequate social support. Other characteristics of loneliness are described for which there was not cross-study consensus. We conclude that there may be characteristics of loneliness which apply across multiple contexts, although we acknowledge the limited reach of our data.

          "abstract": "Sharing a task in the real world can be more efficient than doing it alone. However, psychology experiments using shared task paradigms have often revealed a cognitive cost from working together. Research on joint action has shown how people track and prioritise the actions and intentions of task partners even when this generates cognitive interference and impairs performance. In contrast, we present four experiments using the picture–word interference (PWI) task in which joint action removed cognitive interference and facilitated performance. In the standard PWI task performed alone, participants respond to target pictures while ignoring distractor words written on top. If picture–word pairs are related (e.g., apple–orange) then responses are slowed compared to when they are unrelated (e.g., apple–book), known as semantic interference. In our joint version of the task, we removed semantic interference by telling participants they would be collaborating with a partner who was responsible for the distractor words (Experiment 1, N = 77). Furthermore, interference was only removed when participants believed that their partner was responding specifically to the words (Experiment 2, N = 78), was perceived as high in social status (Experiment 3, N = 80), or high in task competence (Experiment 4, N = 76). We propose this demonstrates how people can deprioritise information associated with partners on shared tasks. In doing so, they can reduce their own cognitive demands by leveraging the cognitive resources of others to support an efficient division-of-cognitive-labour. We term this social offloading.",

          "authors": "Josianne Kollmann; Sophie Charlotte Reckels; Nadja Contzen",
          "abstract": "Microplastics contaminate the environment, including water, soil, and air, and have also been found in the human body. Currently, however, there is only scientific evidence of a danger to aquatic ecosystems at high concentrations of microplastics, but no evidence of a present danger to human health. Based on the high level of scientific uncertainty and the assumed temporal distance of negative consequences due to the increasing pollution of microplastics, it could be assumed that people perceive a high psychological distance regarding microplastics pollution, particularly on the hypothetical and temporal dimensions. Moreover, an additional dimension, namely biological distance, might be relevant in this context, as, to date, the evidence suggests a danger only to aquatic ecosystems but not humans. This study therefore investigated the perceived psychological distance of microplastics pollution on the four conventional dimensions (spatial, social, temporal, hypothetical distance), and on the proposed biological dimension. Additionally, it was investigated whether psychological distance can explain public concern about microplastics pollution for oneself, for others, and for nature, and whether psychological distance can, either directly or mediated by concern, explain people’s willingness to engage in mitigation activities, specifically their behavioural intentions to reduce pollution and their willingness to pay for mitigation policies. This was analysed in an online sample of the German-speaking Swiss population (N = 707) using Structural Equation Modelling. The results showed that, on average, a low distance towards microplastics pollution was perceived, particularly on the hypothetical and temporal dimensions, contrasting the current scientific evidence. Further, lower psychological distance was associated with greater concern for oneself, for others, and for nature, as well as with higher behavioural intention to reduce pollution, both directly and mediated by concern for nature. Willingness to pay, however was only explained by psychological distance but not by concern. Overall, the findings show that low perceived psychological distance can explain public concern regarding microplastics pollution, and that it may motivate people to engage in mitigation activities, even if they are not concerned about themselves or humans in general. Yet, the study also indicates that, next to concern, other factors might play a role in mediating the relationship between psychological distance and willingness to engage in mitigation activities.",

          "abstract": "Background and aims. Problematic technology use (PTU), often referred to as digital addictions, includes excessive use of online pornography, social media, the Internet in general, smartphones, and gaming. Although research on PTU is expanding, nationally representative data on prevalence, co-occurrence, and psychosocial predictors remain limited, particularly in Central Europe. This study examined these aspects in a representative sample of Polish adults.\nMethods. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among a nationwide random quota sample of 2,122 adults (aged 19–98 years; 47.3% male). PTU was assessed across five domains: online pornography (BPS), social media (BSMAS), general Internet use (s-IAT), smartphones (SABAS), and gaming (GDT). Psychological predictors included social support (MSPSS), basic psychological needs (BPNSFS), loneliness (R-UCLA-SF), and self-control (BSCS). Psychopathological symptoms were measured with the GAD-7 (anxiety) and PHQ-2 (depression).\nResults. Prevalence estimates indicated the highest rates of problematic online pornography use (22%), followed by social media (7%), general Internet use (6%), smartphones (5%), and gaming (3%). Men showed significantly higher rates of problematic pornography use and gaming. Latent class analysis identified three subgroups: Class 1 (n = 1,944; 91.6%) with uniformly low probabilities of PTU, Class 2 (n = 146; 6.9%) marked by problematic pornography and Internet use, and Class 3 (n = 32; 1.5%) characterized by problematic social media, smartphone, and Internet use. High social support and low needs fulfillment predicted membership in class 2, while loneliness, low self-control, anxiety, and depression predicted both problematic co-occurrence classes.\nConclusions. PTU is prevalent and heterogeneous in Polish adults, with distinct co-occurrence profiles linked to psychosocial and psychopathological vulnerabilities. Findings highlight the need for integrated prevention and intervention strategies addressing both psychosocial factors and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Instagram is one of the most widely used social media platforms worldwide and its impact on mental health has become a major research topic. While many studies focus on frequency or duration of use, little is known about the role of motivations for using Instagram in relation to internalizing complaints such as depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study investigated how different motivations and intensity of Instagram use relate to internalizing complaints in young adults. A total of 459 participants aged 18 to 35 years completed questionnaires measuring depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms, five motivations for using Instagram (social interaction, archiving, self-expression, escapism, and peeking), and three intensity-of-use dimensions (persistence, boredom, and overuse). Bayesian network analyses were used to model conditional dependencies, and Directed Acyclic Graphs were used to explore potential causal pathways between Instagram motivations, intensity-of-use metrics, and internalizing complaints. Results indicated that internalizing complaints were not directly linked to intensity of use, yet had clear associations with specific motivations. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with social interaction motives and positively associated with escapism. Exploratory causal modelling suggested that higher internalizing complaints may increase the motivation to use Instagram as a form of escapism. These findings underscore the importance of considering motivational factors, rather than only time or frequency, in understanding the complex relationship between Instagram use and mental health.",

          "authors": "Haijiao Cui; Liu-Fang Zhou",
          "abstract": "Affective adaptation and construction are fundamental psychological processes shaped by multiple interacting factors, including reference points, stimulus inherent value, attention, negativity bias, adaptation rate, and time. While decades of research have underscored the importance of these factors, a unified theoretical framework that quantifies their complex interactions—and their cumulative impact on affective responses—remains lacking. To address this gap, we propose ARIA (Attention–Reference Interaction Adaptation), a computational framework that describes how the brain dynamically generates affective responses to changing environments. ARIA posits that negativity bias, together with the inherent values of both the current stimulus and relevant reference points, jointly determine attention allocation and adaptation rate. Additionally, the attention-capturing capacity of the current stimulus regulates the adaptation rate. As a result, affective responses are constructed based on current external stimuli, internal psychological reference points formed by past experiences, and the cognitive processes that mediate the interaction between them. By integrating multiple psychological mechanisms (reference-dependent evaluation, value-driven attention allocation, and negativity bias) into a single theoretical framework, ARIA offers a unified explanation for both classic affective phenomena (e.g., exponential decay of affect and affective after-reactions) and anomalous affective phenomena that existing theories have struggled to account for (e.g., environmental improvements do not necessarily induce pleasure). Simulations based on ARIA reveal the adaptive and dynamic nature of affective responses, providing theoretical guidance for fields such as built-environment management, user-experience design, behavioral economics, affective computing, and emotion regulation.",

          "authors": "Sapam Kiran Dolly; Narendra Nath Samantaray; Lalhmingmawii Khiangte",
          "abstract": "Background: Research on internet use and mental health has often focused narrowly on screen time, overlooking the differential effects of how much and how the internet is used. Emerging evidence suggests that the quality of online engagement (types and purposes of use) and its interaction with problematic internet use (PIU) may provide a more nuanced explanation of psychological outcomes. Hence, this study examined how the quantity and quality of internet use relate to well-being, depression, anxiety, and stress, with various mediators and moderators. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 493 college students in the two north-eastern states of India. Measures included the Adult Internet Usage Questionnaire, the Internet Addiction Test, the Mental Health Continuum, and the DASS-21. Data were analyzed using hierarchical regression and PROCESS Macro (v4.1) to test mediation and moderation models. \nResults: Quantity and quality of internet use did not uniformly predict psychological outcomes. PIU consistently mediated the relationship between both dimensions of internet use and well-being, depression, anxiety, and stress. While quality of use was directly associated with greater well-being, its effect on negative mental health outcomes was limited. Moderation analyses revealed that gender and quantity of use further shaped specific pathways, particularly in health-related and social network use. Conclusion:  The findings challenge the adequacy of screen-time metrics and underscore PIU as the central mechanism linking internet use to mental health. Interventions should focus on fostering purposeful engagement while preventing maladaptive usage patterns.",

          "abstract": "Affective variability is a pervasive phenomenon with important implications for well-being and psychopathology. Yet, the broad concept of “variability” may conflate distinct processes, such as transient fluctuations versus more sustained shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a mechanistic framework for these processes, but RL is often studied in artificial settings, raising questions about ecological validity.\nWe combined RL-based task measures with real-world experience sampling (ESM) from 339 participants. Using a computational model, we decomposed affective variability into short-lived “affective noise,” reflecting immediate reactivity to rewards, and longer-term “affective volatility,” reflecting sustained responses to past rewards. Task-derived noise was driven by recent outcomes, while volatility reflected more distant ones. Importantly, task-based noise and volatility selectively mapped onto their real-world ESM counterparts. These findings provide a mechanistic account of distinct reward-processing timescales underlying affective variability and demonstrate the ecological validity of laboratory tasks for studying real-world affect dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The wisdom-of-crowds effect relies on the independence of individual judgments, such that idiosyncratic errors cancel out when aggregated. Yet in online rating environments, social influence undermines this independence: individuals often conform to visible evaluations, reducing variance and degrading collective accuracy. Prior simulation studies have shown that conformity alone erodes accuracy. At the same time, research in consumer behavior highlights that individuals sometimes strategically diverge, particularly in identity-relevant domains. In this study, we integrate these perspectives by incorporating both conformity and contrarian behavior into agent-based simulations of product evaluation. We modelled sequential evaluations under two conditions: binary choice (K=2 items) and multi-item environments (K=50 items), closely following prior setups. Contrarian behavior was implemented as a probabilistic sign-flip of social influence, such that some agents deliberately chose against prevailing ratings. Across thousands of simulated trials, we observed that while pure conformity inflated error, and pure contrarianism was equally harmful, mixtures of the two produced a robust U-shaped relationship. Moderate diversity in strategies—some agents conforming, others diverging—yielded the lowest root mean squared error relative to ground truth. This demonstrates that diversity in strategies of preference expression, rather than cues or inference alone, can rescue the wisdom-of-crowds effect. These findings extend diversity research in collective intelligence by identifying strategic divergence as a functional contributor to accuracy. They also point to promising avenues for empirical validation, for example by linking product-domain differences in conformity versus divergence (hedonic vs. utilitarian goods) with aggregate performance.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies are no longer mere tools but potential partners in human relational life. Current debates about human–AI bonds often oscillate between two extremes: dismissing them as addictive pathologies or romanticizing them as harmless companionship. Neither captures the complexity of what is emerging. We propose the construct of Digital Attachment, defined as a sustained and emotionally invested bond between a human user and a responsive—or perceived as responsive—digital entity. Distinct from parasocial ties, digital addiction, and robot intimacy, Digital Attachment is characterized by four dimensions: perceived agency, reciprocal responsiveness, emotional investment, and regulatory function. This theoretical contribution highlights the promise and peril of such bonds. For some, Digital Attachment may serve adaptive roles—alleviating loneliness, offering stability, and providing support for vulnerable groups such as older adults or individuals with social anxiety. Yet risks include distorted expectations of intimacy, erosion of social skills, and cultural shifts in how belonging is defined. We argue that Digital Attachment should be studied through interdisciplinary lenses—psychological, psychiatric, sociological, and public health—and call for rigorous inquiry into its boundaries, functions, and ethical implications. Naming and theorizing this construct is a necessary step toward guiding research, clinical practice, and technology design in the digital era.",

          "abstract": "Investigating how athletes navigate these decisions in tactical contexts can provide critical insights into their behavioral preferences and strategic tendencies under conditions of temporal delay and risk. To this end, the present study designed a risky intertemporal choice task simulating a pre-match tactical scenario, and introduced a monetary condition as a control, aiming to uncover the domain-specific temporal preferences of soccer players and the underlying computational mechanisms. In Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b (n = 95), participants completed a two-alternative risky intertemporal choices task. In both experiments, the proportion of choosing the “larger-later” (LL) option was below the chance level. However, participants made more LL choices and responded more slowly in the soccer tactical context compared to the monetary context, with no significant performance differences between participant types. Experiment 2 (n = 33) further validated the behavioral findings and revealed significantly higher exponential discount rates and starting point biases in the soccer tactical context compared to the monetary context. Additionally, stronger functional connectivity between the right postcentral gyrus and mid-cingulate cortex was observed during soccer tactical decision-making, and it is significantly positively correlated with the exponential discount rate. This study found that although soccer players exhibit delay discounting in tactical choices, they demonstrate a greater degree of rationality. This rationality may be related to how a higher discount rate induces starting point biases, affecting the accumulation of decision evidence. The underlying neural basis may involve integrative processing within the postcentral gyrus-cingulate circuit.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a generic machine learning-based pipeline for nominative linkage of records within and across large-scale Chinese historical datasets. The pipeline addresses key challenges, including character variations, incomplete data, and scalability issues specific to historical datasets in which names and other attributes are recorded with Chinese characters, not just for China, but potentially for Korea, Japan and Vietnam. Techniques developed for attributes recorded in phonetic alphabets are of limited usefulness for Chinese characters not only because homonyms are common, but characters that are similar enough in appearance to be frequently mistaken for each other may sound completely different. Our approach integrates stroke-based character embeddings for efficient blocking, supervised classification with active learning for record matching, and graph-based clustering for final linkage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline using the career records of officials in the China Government Employee Database-Qing Jinshenlu (CGED-Q JSL) as a test case. We achieve improved linkage quality compared to standard probabilistic methods, with substantially longer linked sequences of career records and fewer aberrant transitions. To validate the generalizability, we also successfully apply the pipeline to another database and a cross-database linkage task. By minimizing the need for manual tuning, our pipeline offers a more accessible and effective solution for Chinese historical data linkage.",

Drawing on Paolo J. Knill’s interdisciplinary background in musicology, psychology, and systems theory, the authors propose a model of “intermodal decentering” that integrates multiple art forms—visual art, music, dance, poetry, and drama—into therapeutic practice. Emphasizing “aesthetic responsibility,” the book addresses ethical considerations and underscores the relational power of artistic processes to foster meaningful change. While grounded in the 1990s, its foundational principles resonate with current realities of political polarization, global conflict, and collective trauma, illustrating the continued relevance of an embodied, creative framework. Future directions include deeper cultural adaptation and exploration of digital modalities, yet Minstrels of Soul remains an enduring cornerstone for professionals seeking holistic, arts-based approaches to individual and communal healing.",

Wicked problems such as climate change, pandemics, and systemic inequality cannot be reasoned about through intuition or traditional data displays alone. This paper situates spatial computing, meaning technologies such as Virtual, Augmented, and Extended Reality, within the historical trajectory of cognitive artefacts including language, writing, mathematics, and mapping. Drawing on the concept of exaptation, it argues that spatial computing can repurpose evolved perceptual systems to interpret complex, high-dimensional data. Recent research prototypes illustrate how immersive environments enable users to “walk through” dimensionality-reduced datasets, annotate evolving multidimensional changes, and collaborate in shared data spaces, thereby making otherwise abstract information perceptible and actionable. As with literacy and numeracy in earlier centuries, the democratic value of spatial computing will depend on equitable access, institutional integration, and critical scrutiny. Far from a technological luxury, spatial computing should be understood as a civic necessity - an essential scaffold for collective reasoning amid the deluge of data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a widely used chain‑referral method for surveying hidden or hard‑to‑reach populations. While it has theoretical advantages over other non‑probabilistic methods, there is limited empirical evidence on the accuracy of its estimators when benchmarked against complete population data.\nMethods: We conducted a GPS‑verified, smartphone‑based RDS survey in York, England, in September–October 2024. The target sample size was 800 residents aged 16 or over; 807 eligible responses were obtained from six recruitment seeds over up to 44 waves. The survey collected demographic, socio‑economic, and health information aligned with the 2021 Census, along with personal network size and some network composition data. RDS‑I, RDS‑II, and Successive Sampling estimators were applied, and results were compared with Census 2021 benchmarks.\nResults: For many variables, RDS estimates diverged markedly from census values, and 95% confidence intervals often failed to include the true value. Deviations from the at‑random recruitment assumption were evident, particularly for sex and ethnicity, and appeared to be a major source of bias. Incorporating self‑reported network composition reduced bias in the estimate of the variable for which network composition information was collected.\nConclusions: In this real‑world test, standard RDS estimators did not produce consistently accurate estimates. Violations of the random recruitment assumption were a likely cause. Network composition‑based estimation offers a promising alternative but requires further testing and methodological refinement. Enhancing RDS systems to monitor subgroup representation in real time and applying weighting adjustments to address complex recruitment homophily could improve estimator performance.",

Regional development is directly related to the levels and type of decentralisation model that each country actually adopts. In this approach, I analyse centralised and non-centralised countries in a comparative manner, with a strong emphasis on countries with a federal decentralisation model. Thus, the analysis shows that there is greater economic concentration in a single city, such as the capital, which is responsible for the political and economic decisions of the other regions. Centralised countries also have less capacity for economic transformation, due to the lack of fiscal decentralisation, which should in fact promote greater tax revenue collection. On the other hand, the approach also analyses lower political participation and exclusive democracy regions at lower subnational levels with less capacity for democratic participation. On the other hand, the analysis effectively shows that most federated countries, their states and municipalities, through fiscal decentralisation, promote greater economic transformation and greater democratic plurality. However, federated countries are those that manage to achieve greater macroeconomic stability, evidenced by a larger tax base. There is also evidence to suggest that there is in fact greater sustainable economic growth in federal countries.",

          "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

The approach shows that, through Structural Imbalance Correction Mechanisms, it is possible to guarantee greater growth dynamics for regions with lower potential. however, regions with lower potential will in fact be the regions that should nevertheless grow significantly in a progressive manner. There is, however, other evidence that contributes to making regions more attractive through a more inclusive fiscal policy. The approach also shows that municipalities with lower attractiveness potential will in fact tend to attract to their territory, as a fiscal headquarters, a group of companies capable of driving a transformation dynamic through significant increases in tax incentives and, in fact, leading their respective regions to greater fiscal and structural sustainability in particular.",

Drawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, Silvan Tomkins' affect psychology, and recent neuroscience concerning the habenula, the piece demonstrates how language, as a later evolutionary tool, is \"pasted on\" an ancient, pre-linguistic affective system primarily designed for survival. Concrete examples, such as intimate relationship conflicts, illustrate how words often fail to capture the \"braided\" nature of emotions, leading to misunderstanding and defense mechanisms. The essay further posits that this affective-linguistic mismatch is exacerbated in contemporary society by the fragmentation of shared multiple inputs, leading to a dangerous divergence of meaning in symbols and discourse. Ultimately, by understanding that affect is primary and that our bodies \"feel\" before we \"speak,\" the essay advocates for a shift towards greater awareness of our internal states—informed by what music and poetry have always intuitively expressed about affective truth—to foster more gentle, deliberate, and effective communication, moving beyond the illusion of linguistic clarity.",

          "abstract": "This article revisits the Armored Division Equivalent (ADE) model to explain two inflection points in the Russo-Ukrainian wars. Re-calibrating ADE for training levels, readiness and high-impact weapons, it shows that Ukraine’s drastic post-2010 force reductions created a quantifiable “power vacuum” that enabled Russia’s 2014 Crimea operation. Conversely, the U.S. air-lift of roughly 3,000 Javelin ATGMs before February 2022 produced a “technological surprise”: when Javelins are folded into ADE, local force ratios around Kyiv shrink from 12:1 to about 3:1, matching Russia’s failure to seize the capital. The study argues that such transparent, open-source modelling can alert policymakers to emerging imbalances, temper symbolic deployments like NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence, and strengthen democratic civilian oversight. While ADE cannot predict outcomes where leadership or morale dominate, it remains a tractable baseline for deterrence planning and arms-control talks, provided its limits in irregular warfare are acknowledged.",

          "abstract": "Farmers increasingly use videos and other digital tools to access and share farming information. However, women in agriculture have commonly been excluded from influencing and accessing these digital tools. Rigorous evaluations have found that including women farmers in the creation and screening of farming videos can benefit women through improved productivity and decision-making power. But what is needed for extension workers to make these videos accessible to women farmers outside of carefully managed pilots? We implemented a randomized controlled trial testing how the gender of farmers featured in wheat farming advisory videos influenced how much, and with whom, 294 extension workers shared these videos in rural Bihar. We interpreted results through twenty follow-up interviews and the ‘Mechanisms and Conditions’ framework based in affordance theory. We found the extent to which extension workers shared videos with women farmers hinged on extension workers' perceptions, material resources, and cultural contexts, rather than the gender of farmers featured in videos. From a theoretical perspective, this core finding suggests the 'Mechanisms and Conditions' framework requires modification to account for material resource access when explaining technology use. From a practical perspective, the core finding prompts practitioners to ask ‘how might extension systems circulating digital tools be more inclusive?’, not just ‘how might we adapt digital tools to be more inclusive?’. This systems-level approach to empowering women in agricultural innovation systems could involve supporting inclusive person-to-person extension networks, and avoiding dependence on smartphone-based extension systems, like YouTube and chatbots.",

          "abstract": "Canada’s robust yet overburdened public childcare drives reliance on a “grey market” of nannies and private caregivers, often mediated by digital gig platforms. This paper analyzes over 6,000 nanny profiles scraped from CanadianNanny.ca in the Greater Toronto–Hamilton area to investigate how platform-enabled self-presentation reproduces inequality in care labour. Using natural language processing (sentiment, n-gram, and LDA topic modeling), we find a stratified market where self-presentation diverges by wage tier. Lower-wage caregivers (under $20/hour) disproportionately frame themselves as \"generalists,\" bundling childcare with extensive domestic labour (housekeeping, meals). In contrast, higher-wage caregivers (over $20/hour) emphasize professional credentials, specialized skills (e.g., newborn care), and formal training. These results show that digital platforms actively structure care labour, reinforcing racialized and gendered hierarchies that devalue generalist labour while conditionally valorizing professionalized care. We argue that Canada’s fragmented system entrenches this dual process, the devaluation of reproductive labour for the many and conditional valorization for the few, underscoring the urgent need for policy to regulate platform work and ensure equitable recognition and protection for all care workers.",

It is possible that another technology – RPAS (UAV, UAS, drones) – will play a similar role, with applications in several domains. The use of RPAS in CS is an emerging practice, which is proved by the existence of only three literature reviews on this topic and of only 12 studies addressing the use of technology mentioned in CS projects by the volunteers. The Systematic Review (SR) developed represents the basis of a participatory Living Systematic Review (LSR), updated every twelve months and available at https://rpas-in-cs-lsr-cgeoreg.hub.arcgis.com. This will present to the interested community the summarized (categories of study, fields of use, level of volunteer engagement, etc.) and updated image of the mentioned topic. Additionally, it allows the volunteers to signal CS studies or projects and to be part of the team that reviews the subsequent versions. Starting from the existing literature, we propose a scale of the level of volunteer engagement in CS projects using RPAS, detailing the activities developed. The identified CS projects were analyzed by relating them to the proposed scale. In addition, evolutionary perspectives were discussed in terms of using RPAS in CS projects. In conclusion, the research proposes an LSR (the second outside the medical sciences) meant to continuously update the new partnership between CS and RPAS with real development perspectives.",

          "abstract": "The decision of older workers to retire or remain in the labour market is a multidimensional process. Drawing on the life course perspective, the paper sees retirement intentions as influenced by both individual and contextual characteristics. The aim of the analysis was to assess how factors at the individual (digital skills and demand for them, gender, health, and type of employer), household (partnership status and financial situation), and macro-level (unemployment rates and the level of digitalisation in society) affect retirement intentions. This study uses data from 26 European countries collected through the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, supplemented by macro-indicators. The findings reveal that higher digital skills are associated with lower retirement intentions, stressing the importance of technological proficiency for extending working careers. Furthermore, workers with a better financial situation, better health, and higher education have intentions to retire as soon as possible, while the macro-context – including unemployment and the level of digitalisation – also affects the timing of retirement. These findings suggest that policies aimed at enhancing digital skills could play an important role in extending older workers’ careers.",

          "abstract": "Throughout human evolutionary history, individuals have faced two fundamental challenges under uncertainty: deciding whether to take risks and managing risks through cooperation. While both risk-taking and social risk management have been widely studied, less attention has been given to how these two processes are linked—specifically, how risk-taking itself may be shaped by social networks. We test the \"social capital buffer\" hypothesis, which posits that greater social connectedness promotes risk-taking by buffering against negative outcomes. Analyzing social networks and risk preferences among 140 individuals in rural Bangladesh whose livelihoods range from farming to wage labor and small-scale trade, we identify distinct pathways through which social capital influences risk preference. Highly clustered individuals in financial support networks exhibit greater risk preference, suggesting that clustering facilitates risk-taking by ensuring resource circulation within a tight-knit group. In contrast, individuals with more support-receiving ties in material support networks are more risk-averse, indicating that material support functions as informal social insurance reducing reliance on risky decisions. Finally, reciprocity in material support networks promotes risk-taking only among wealthier individuals, highlighting how individual economic resources interact with social capital to shape risk-taking. These findings reveal that social capital does not uniformly promote or constrain risk-taking but serves distinct adaptive functions based on network structure, economic conditions, and resource types, balancing risk-taking and risk-avoidance to help individuals successfully navigate uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Whether, how, and when a person comes to recognise they may be pregnant can have significant implications for their health and wellbeing. Little theoretical or empirical work has interrogated the time-bound, varied processes that lead to pregnancy recognition. We develop a novel conceptual framework, using an inductive saturation approach to review literature published between 2000 and 2023 and workshops with multi-disciplinary researchers and experts. Our framework comprises three overlapping domains: assessing the possibility of becoming pregnant; interpreting signs and symptoms of a (potential) pregnancy; and opportunities for pregnancy confirmation. The framework includes an individual’s trajectory to recognising a pregnancy, recognising there is no pregnancy following suspicion there may be, and not recognising a pregnancy that could be recognised through other means (e.g. using biomedical testing). It is inclusive of diverse conceptualisations of what constitutes a pregnancy.  Within these intersecting domains, we map factors influencing trajectories operating at micro, meso, and macro levels, identifying the connections between individuals, communities, policies, health systems and institutional structures.  While pregnancy duration is linear, time manifests in different ways across an individual’s trajectory. Individuals might experience one or all the domains of pregnancy recognition, different factors within those domains, and may encounter them in differing order. Individuals may move between states of recognition and non-recognition, and experience liminal states in between them. A better understanding of pregnancy recognition provides policy and care practitioners with new insights into care-seeking related to pregnancy.",

          "authors": "Florian Keusch; Bella Struminskaya; Joris Mulder; Stein Jongerius",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

          "abstract": "Research on the association between intergenerational social class mobility and income inequality has yielded inconclusive results. This study seeks to clarify this association by examining whether income inequality impacts different class mobility transitions differently. Using data on individuals born between 1955 and 1987 across 15 Western European countries, I characterize mobility transitions using three types of “effects” from a topological model: class hierarchy, class inheritance, and status affinity. To capture the potential influence of income inequality on mobility decisions at different life stages, I measure it at the secondary school choice (age 15), during the school-to-work transition (ages 15-25), and during the primary working age (ages 25-55). The results indicate that greater income inequality is associated with more limited vertical mobility between the salariat and the working class and stronger inheritance propensity among individuals from the high salariat and entrepreneurial families, especially when measuring income inequality during the primary working age. Although the effect of rising income inequality is limited to the mobility transitions where inequalities in relative mobility chances are most pronounced, its negative consequences fall on individuals in the most disadvantaged class positions seeking to improve their social position.",

To address these limitations, we analyze registry data on library borrowing for the entire adult population of Denmark and consider four dimensions of social stratification: wealth, education, income, and occupation. We find considerable social stratification in library borrowing and in highbrow literary tastes by wealth and education, but not by income and occupation. As Denmark is characterized by higher wealth and educational stratification than income and occupational stratification, our results suggest that although cultural tastes always seem to be socially stratified, the type of stratification likely depends on the nature of the wider inequalities within a given context. We end by discussing the implications of our results, including how stratification of tastes according to wealth represents a type of stratification not considered in existing research on cultural stratification.",

Despite blockchain protocol’s participatory nature, the community features required for ongoing group engagement have been largely overlooked so far. By exploring underlying community-related tensions, the study aims to shed light on how competing organisational demands may shape the longevity and cohesion of blockchain communities. Applying the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews, we explore the organisational features that shape users’ engagement in their blockchain group. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational values rooted in community growth, governance structure, and communication features. Maintaining a careful balance, rather than attempting to resolve these organisational tensions, supports user retention, whereas leaning too heavily toward either extreme may hinder engagement. This study is the first to offer a user-centred exploration of organisational paradoxes in blockchain community building.",

          "abstract": "This paper advances our understanding of online political information exposure by introducing the concept of networked exposure. Existing research has largely focused on direct encounters with misinformation, conspiracy content, or hyperpartisan outlets. Yet audiences are also exposed to seemingly ‘ordinary’ content (e.g. traditional news stories or Wikipedia articles) that is circulated and weaponized within extremist and conspiracy-aligned networks. Previous studies tracing exposure have overlooked measuring encounters with such seemingly innocuous content that is reframed to serve specific narratives. Networked exposure captures this second-order dynamic, highlighting how weaponized material makes its way down to the information diets of a broader audience. We measure networked exposure by combining individual-level browsing and survey data from a Swiss and German sample of users (N = 864), with an aggregate-level dataset of over 21 million URLs shared across Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram, Vkontakte, and Gab. At the content level, weaponized material often followed extremist narratives and were shared by known conspiracy actors. At the individual level, participants often encountered this content through social media redirects and consumed it alongside hyperpartisan, alternative, and conspiracy (HAC) content. At the attitudinal level, networked exposure predicted political attitudes even after accounting for direct exposure to HAC media. These findings show that the influence of extremist and conspiracy networks extends far beyond exposure to known websites. They push us to reconsider what counts as problematic info.",

The impact of these new forms of entrepreneurial engagement thus extends beyond the marketplace, influencing public policies and governance structures, with some advocating for the replacement of traditional state interventions with market-based solutions. The purpose of this special issue is to explore the impact of these new forms of entrepreneurial engagement on society, paying particular attention to not only how entrepreneurship has changed society, but also to how entrepreneurship has contributed to, and perhaps further perpetuated socioeconomic challenges.",

          "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
          "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large \npredators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing environmental and health \n\ninequities, yet limited research has examined how social distancing policies intersect with environmental justice concerns. This article investigates how seemingly neutral distancing guidelines functioned as mechanisms of environmental injustice in marginalized US communities. Drawing on existing research, this article evaluates physical and social dimensions of COVID-19 transmission patterns through methodology combining spatial analysis, and environmental justice frameworks, including intersectionality and Laura Pulido’s theory of racial capitalism. Statistical analysis reveals communities of color face 56-63% higher exposure to industrial pollutants, correlating with increased mortality rates. Airborne transmission research shows that standard distancing protocols were particularly ineffective in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces common in under-resourced communities. Historical practices of racial segregation directly predict contemporary COVID-19 mortality patterns, with some marginalized communities experiencing death rates 3.1 times higher than affluent areas. These findings challenge conventional public health approaches and provide an evidence-based framework for equitable crisis responses that address environmental racism, healthcare inequities, and economic exploitation. This work contributes to environmental justice scholarship by exposing how standardized public health measures can reinforce and amplify existing disparities, while advocating for structural interventions that center health equity.",

          "abstract": "This theoretical article examines how belongingness, defined as the sense that one’s participation is legitimate and valued, interacts with cultural value orientations to help explain persistent disparities in U.S. technology en-gagement, including emerging technologies, across racial and ethnic groups. While structural barriers (e.g., racism, poverty, linguistic bias, etc.) remain essential to understanding such inequity, we argue that engagement patterns in technology also reflect how different cultural communities may define and experience belongingness in relation to digital domains. Drawing on Triandis and Gelfand's (1998) framework, and focusing specifically on educational contexts, we propose the Belongingness through Cultural Value Alignment (BCVA) model, whereby belong-ingness serves as a catalyst between cultural value orientations and technology engagement, with vertical collec-tivism deriving belongingness primarily through structured skill development and validation while horizontal collectivism focusing instead on belonging based on community integration. When technological environments value practices that are consistent with vertical collectivist norms, individuals from horizontal collectivist cultures may experience cultural misalignment not from disinterest in technology or exclusionary efforts but, instead, because dominant engagement modes conflict with their familiar frameworks for fostering a sense of belonging. By examining how cultural value orientations mediate the sense of belonging in contexts involving modern tech-nologies, the proposed perspective offers a novel framework for understanding why access alone may have proven insufficient to address technological participation gaps, and suggests directions for creating technology spaces where individuals from a wider range of communities can experience the authentic sense of belonging.",

          "authors": "Suad Al-Subaihi",
          "abstract": "Background: Faculty development often urges a shift from teacher-centered delivery to “facilitation,” yet instructors report two recurrent failures: (1) reverting to authoritative lecturing when content is dense or safety-critical, or (2) drifting into loosely structured, unfocused interactions that fail to consolidate understanding or achieve learning outcomes. Such tendencies illustrate why facilitation often remains conceptually attractive yet fragile as a teaching practice.\nAim: To clarify how educators can remain genuinely learner-centered, preserving autonomy across content types and densities by aligning facilitation stance with content characteristics.\nApproach: This practice-oriented conceptual paper synthesizes evidence on dialogic teaching, scaffolding/gradual release, and transformative learning, and integrates insights from Train-the-Trainers programs.\nContribution: We articulate a set of facilitator stances/pedagogical orientations and show how each aligns with content demands, offering archetypal enactments, micro-moves, and warnings about common misuses (including over-reliance on dialogic methods for canonical content).\nImplications: Treating facilitation as a stance rather than a technique enables educators to “facilitate with content” without sliding back into lecturing, while keeping learner autonomy central. The framework is portable across K-12, higher education, and clinical contexts and serves as a scaffold for workshops and institutional development.",

          "abstract": "This essay provides an overview of statistical methods in public policy, focused primarily on the United States. The essay traces the historical development of quantitative approaches in policy research, from early ad hoc applications through the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the full institutionalization of statistical analysis in federal, state, local, and nonprofit agencies by the late 20th century. It then outlines three core methodological approaches to policy-centered statistical research across social science disciplines: description, explanation, and prediction. In descriptive work, researchers explore *what exists* and examine any variable of interest to understand their different distributions and relationships. In explanatory work, researchers ask *why does it exist* and *how can it be influenced*. The focus of the analysis is on explanatory variables (X) to either (1) accurately estimate their relationship with an outcome variable (Y), or (2) causally attribute the effect of specific explanatory variables on outcomes. In predictive work, researchers ask *what will happen next* and focus on the outcome variable (Y) and on generating accurate forecasts, classifications, and predictions from new data. For each approach, the essay examines key techniques, their applications in policy contexts, and important methodological considerations. The discussion then considers critical perspectives on quantitative policy analysis framed around issues related to a three-part \"data imperative\" where governments are driven to count, gather, and learn from data. Each of these imperatives entail substantial issues related to privacy, accountability, democratic participation, and epistemic inequalities—issues at odds with public sector values of transparency and openness. The conclusion identifies some emerging trends in public sector-focused data science, inclusive ethical guidelines, open research practices, and future directions for the field.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates differences in how same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples outsource routine and non-routine housework. Previous research highlights how same-sex and different-sex couples allocate time to housework, but the outsourcing of these tasks remains understudied. Considering variations in household resources and cultural norms, the study explores whether and how these groups differ in outsourcing routine tasks (e.g., cleaning) and non-routine tasks (e.g., home maintenance and yardwork). Using data from the 2003–2019 waves of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and a double hurdle methodological approach, this study analyzes the likelihood of outsourcing and amount spent on overall and specific housework tasks among same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples. Findings reveal minimal differences across couple type in outsourcing home maintenance, yardwork, and cleaning. However, same-sex male couples are generally more likely to outsource any housework compared to different-sex couples, though this association becomes null once household income is accounted for, highlighting the role of economic resources in enabling the “Buying Out” strategy. Notably, differences across couple type are only evident in the probability of outsourcing, with no significant variation in spending among those who outsource, suggesting that selection into outsourcing is more varied than differences in spending intensity. These findings emphasize the importance of economic resources in shaping domestic outsourcing behaviors and suggest that the equitable division of housework often observed in same-sex couples may be attributed to factors beyond reliance on outsourcing.",

          "abstract": "The issue of loss and damage is hotly contested within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, negotiations on how to address loss and damage are hindered by the concept’s persistent ambiguity. This paper critically analyses a core distinction within the concept between economic and non-economic loss and damage. We argue that dominant frameworks treat non-economic loss and damage as a residual category, whose assumed opacity legitimises inaction, biases institutional memory, and hinders climate justice. Building on Charles Mills’ work on white ignorance, we demonstrate that the distinction between economic and non-economic loss and damage is rooted in what we label an ontology of ignorance—an irreducibly flawed catalogue of the basic substances, processes, and relationships of climate change that downplays, overlooks, and omits many forms of injustice. By treating non-economic loss and damage unquantifiable, ungraspable, and ultimately unresolvable, this definition systematically forgets both vast past losses and major emitters’ ongoing responsibilities, dictating whether and how climate justice can be imagined, institutionalised, and pursued.",

          "abstract": "At present, sociologists have exciting opportunities to gain an even better understanding of complex social issues. I describe three of these opportunities using the concept of ‘sharing’. I also address the question of whether that sharing involves ‘multiplication’. The first form of sharing is through multidisciplinary collaboration. Such collaboration requires complicated communicative, relational, and substantive efforts. If there is a foundation of trust, these efforts can generate innovative scientific returns in addition to collateral happiness. The second form of sharing involves the joint use of data. Access to large-scale data and computational methods enables a renewal of the research agenda, while access to government data increases the possibilities to underpin policy with empirical knowledge. The third form of sharing materializes in evidence-informed policy advice. The effectiveness of scientific advice is greater if policymakers and scientific experts engage in deliberative dialogue over the course of the advisory process. For a variety of topics, such as food from the oceans, microplastics, car emissions, plant protection products, cybersecurity, and pandemic preparedness, the incorporation of a sociological perspective has been crucial.",

          "abstract": "The Desperation Threshold Model (DTM) seeks to explain conflicting findings about the risk propensity of people living in poverty. It makes assumptions about their experiences: that they have a conception of basic needs, that their ability to meet these motivates their decisions, and that they modulate risky decisions depending on their ability to do so. The realism of these modeling assumptions has not yet been investigated. To start filling this gap, we investigated experiences of poverty through the lens of the DTM, using two complementary approaches: a pre-registered online survey with British participants (n = 300) and semi-structured qualitative interviews with very low-income individuals in France (n = 14). Our results imply that basic needs have both a context-general component and context-specific elaborations. Furthermore, participants often relied on social and institutional resources when experiencing financial adversity, indicating that only measuring personal income or wealth might not accurately capture the resources available to people. With respect to the DTM’s main predictions, most individuals close to—but still above—the desperation threshold exhibited caution and took a safety-first approach, consistent with risk-averse behavior. Risky or antisocial behaviors (e.g., cheating, stealing) emerged only in rare instances of severe financial hardship and complete lack of external support. These results suggest that the DTM’s main assumptions are empirically grounded but that they need to be qualified in specific ways. They also suggest that abstract models like the DTM can capture something about the experience of people living in conditions of poverty.",

We examine the impact of the Dutch target law – a weakly enforced quota policy applying to a wide range of firms – on gender wage disparities and female representation across organizational levels. Our findings are ambivalent: while the quota did not reduce the gender wage gap in targeted firms relative to comparable firms, it did increase women’s representation in higher organizational wage echelons below the board. Using linked employer-employee register data and both regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we show evidence of a gradual shift towards greater gender parity in top employee income quartiles, without corresponding wage equalization. These findings highlight how boardroom quotas, even with weak enforcement, can produce compositional shifts without equalization, providing new empirical evidence and theoretical insight into the mechanisms through which institutional re-forms shape inequality.",

          "abstract": "Background: Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a widely used chain‑referral method for surveying hidden or hard‑to‑reach populations. While it has theoretical advantages over other non‑probabilistic methods, there is limited empirical evidence on the accuracy of its estimators when benchmarked against complete population data.\nMethods: We conducted a GPS‑verified, smartphone‑based RDS survey in York, England, in September–October 2024. The target sample size was 800 residents aged 16 or over; 807 eligible responses were obtained from six recruitment seeds over up to 44 waves. The survey collected demographic, socio‑economic, and health information aligned with the 2021 Census, along with personal network size and some network composition data. RDS‑I, RDS‑II, and Successive Sampling estimators were applied, and results were compared with Census 2021 benchmarks.\nResults: For many variables, RDS estimates diverged markedly from census values, and 95% confidence intervals often failed to include the true value. Deviations from the at‑random recruitment assumption were evident, particularly for sex and ethnicity, and appeared to be a major source of bias. Incorporating self‑reported network composition reduced bias in the estimate of the variable for which network composition information was collected.\nConclusions: In this real‑world test, standard RDS estimators did not produce consistently accurate estimates. Violations of the random recruitment assumption were a likely cause. Network composition‑based estimation offers a promising alternative but requires further testing and methodological refinement. Enhancing RDS systems to monitor subgroup representation in real time and applying weighting adjustments to address complex recruitment homophily could improve estimator performance.",

Leveraging panel data from 178 countries (1966–2023), project-level FDI data (2003-2023), and firm survey data on investor perceptions, I test conjectures about the impact of women politicians on FDI attraction. I find that women's descriptive representation boosts FDI into autocracies, while higher number of women politicians in democracies does not have an effect on capital attraction. Although I find no evidence for the mechanism of firm's reputational concerns, legal commitments to women's political representation improve investor perceptions of regime's political stability especially in autocracies. These findings contribute to research on how women's political representation interacts with global markets, and the determinants of international capital flows.",

          "authors": "Liam Wright; Georgia D Tomova; Richard J. Silverwood",
          "abstract": "Background: Analyses of sequential mixed-mode survey data can be biased due to non-random selection of participants into mode. Understanding the consequence of this bias requires knowledge of the predictors of mode selection. However, research on these predictors is sparse, in contrast with research on the predictors of survey non-response. The ‘continuum of resistance’ model of survey response predicts that delayed responders – who, in sequential mixed-mode surveys, appear in later offered modes – and non-responders share similar characteristics. If the model, which is testable in longitudinal data, is correct, this would suggest that research on non-response could be generalized to understand mode selection.\nMethods: We used data from a major UK birth cohort study (the 1958 National Child Development Study) which embedded a sequential web-then-telephone mixed-mode survey at the age 55y sweep to assess whether (a) descriptively, late (i.e. telephone) and non-responders share similar characteristics and (b) whether predictions from models of non-response are accurate when used to predict telephone response. For (a), we calculated univariate descriptive statistics and performed cluster analysis to compare an array of participant characteristics across response groups (web, telephone and non-response). For (b), we estimated random forest models for non-response and telephone response (conditional on response) and compared two metrics of predictive accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUC ROC] and Brier scores) when using the non-response model to instead predict telephone response, against predictions from the model generated for telephone response, specifically.\nResults: Telephone and non-respondents were similar on almost all (measured) characteristics, and dissimilar in most regards to web respondents. Predictions from non-response models had similar predictive accuracy to predictions from models trained on telephone response, specifically – for instance, AUC ROC values in hold-out samples not used to train models of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.70, 0.74) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.72, 0.75), respectively.\nConclusions: The characteristics of late- and non-responders in a sequential (web-then-telephone) mixed-mode survey were very similar, consistent with the ‘continuum of resistance’ model of survey response. This suggests that research on non-response could transport to understanding mode selection in sequential mixed-mode surveys, though replications in other surveys with different mixed-mode designs (e.g., modes adopted and their order) is required.",

The results of the analysis found that the number of publications with the most analysis topics occurred in 2020, although there has been a decline in recent years. The United States had the highest number of publications. In addition to the co-occurrence network, several input factors and audit quality were in Cluster 4, which shows the relationship between the two.

Institutional and organizational challenges are also highlighted, such as fragmented teaching assignments across multiple schools and discrepancies between curriculum content and available instructional time. Despite these obstacles, teachers employ coping strategies such as collaboration with colleagues, differentiated instruction, participation in training programs, and efforts to strengthen relationships with students and parents.

          "abstract": "A growing number of states are passing laws that require high school students to learn about their rights and obligations as citizens, which shows a fresh commitment to bolstering democracy in America. This civics mandate requires students to sit for an exam similar to the United States Citizenship Test administered by the US Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) as a requirement for graduation from high school. However, little is known about how these policies affect the college access of students from racial and ethnic minorities. To investigate the relationship between civic education policies and educational opportunity, this research uses a systematic and equity-focused policy analysis based on Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. The study finds that college enrollment and ambitions among Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous students have been demonstrated to rise in states that incorporate accountability mechanisms, culturally sensitive pedagogy, dedicated professional development funds, and specific equality measures. In contrast, disadvantaged populations are frequently left behind or even worse off by unfunded or undefined equity-neutral rules. I provide a sophisticated paradigm for equity-centered design in civic education by analyzing policy characteristics and outcomes using empirical data collected between 2010 and 2023. The study comes to the conclusion that civic requirements, depending on their intention and execution, can either be tools for educational justice or roadblocks.",

          "abstract": "What is the effect of arming on conflict? While a large literature debates this question, most existing research ignores that the majority of states are unable to arm themselves and must rely on arms transfers to acquire weapons. But even where studies investigate such external arming, existing findings are mixed: arming is found to either increase, decrease, or not affect the probability of conflict onset between states. In light of this, we present a theory of external arming that conceptualizes arms transfers not simply as material capability boosts, but also as carriers of information and as relational linkages to arms suppliers. We develop several hypotheses positing external arming and conflict to be linked both negatively and positively, depending on whether recipients gain new information from arms transfers and on the nature of the suppliers. Empirical tests using additive and multiplicative effects network models and data from the Interwar years, a historical period where our information-based theory of external arming is particularly applicable, provide support for these expectations. This research advances our under- standing of how arming affects interstate conflict, unifies the disparate findings reported in previous research on external arming, and highlights the importance of the relational in International Relations.",

Se amplía el debate con teóricos contemporáneos (Foucault, Baudrillard, Castells, Zuboff, Han) para construir una genealogía del poder y la subjetividad en el entorno digital. Resultados. Se identifican tres procesos interrelacionados —delegación simbólica, terciarización de la experiencia y vaciamiento transversal del yo— que reconfiguran de raíz las dimensiones económicas, políticas, culturales y éticas de la vida social. Conclusiones. Los enfoques clásicos resultan insuficientes para captar la radicalidad de la digitalización actual.

          "abstract": "This study identifies a new emerging phenomenon centered on non-dominant narratives: extra-liminality. Traditionally, liminality refers to a transition between two states of being, but extra-liminality occurs when this state becomes persistent, shaping reality. This study utilizes decolonial methodologies, digital ethnography, auto-ethnography, and story as methodology to capture the lived experience of extra-liminality. These methodologies are essential to allow immersive experiential engagement and, as such, are both radical and experimental in their form. This also serves to resist historically damaging or extractive research methodologies within non-dominant narratives. Through the lens of non-dominant narratives, parallels begin to form between terrestrial and extraterrestrial adaptive strategies. By drawing on existing knowledge in anthropology, psychology, and digital ethnography, this interdisciplinary study serves as both an emerging theoretical framework and the foundation of a broader research agenda in space anthropology.

The intersections of Indigenous sovereignty, cultural continuity, and cross-border rights with national and international security issues, such as human trafficking, smuggling, political overreach, and environmental stewardship, are examined. Historical agreements like the Jay Treaty, along with the differing recognition frameworks in the U.S. and Canada, influence the legal and political circumstances that Indigenous communities encounter today. Special emphasis is placed on the disproportionate effects of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) crisis, the exploitation of tribal lands by transnational criminal organizations, and how economic and political conflicts heighten vulnerabilities. The paper contends that effective security at the Northern Border necessitates collaborative strategies that honor Indigenous sovereignty while tackling common security threats. Suggested actions include enhancing cross-border cooperation, broadening culturally sensitive law enforcement training, improving communication between agencies, and creating legislative frameworks that involve Indigenous leadership in border management.",

          "abstract": "In contemporary dance, performances slip away the instant a show ends, with conventional archives missing out on the always-shifting interplay of bodies, setting, and mood. This article puts forth something called “glitching the archive,” a posthuman take that recognizes the generative potential of technological glitches: think warped visuals, scrambled data, and sudden repetition. Those errors reshape how dance is documented, reinvented, and shared.\nDrawing on glitch aesthetics, remix culture, the Deleuze &amp; Guattari-inspired notion of the ritornello, and anarchival strategies, the argument challenges canonical approaches that treat these records as stable, closed artifacts. Instead, glitch welcomes humans, machines, and software to co-create emergent choreographies by unraveling and recombining bits of archived material. Familiar motifs, or ritornellos, pop up among digital distortions, grounding each round while revealing subtle variations.\nMeanwhile, the anarchive frames these shifts as open-ended, ongoing processes, resisting the fixed and final nature of traditional documentation. The blend of glitch, remix, and anarchic logic emphasizes the bodily, contingent, and beyond-human dimensions that feed into contemporary dance. We discover that archives aren’t finite containers of memory but lively sites for constant reshaping.\nViewed from that angle, every glitch becomes a chance to spark the archive’s untapped possibilities, opening doors to new choreographic directions that disrupt linear dance history and call out conventional notions of ownership and authorship. Maybe the glitch isn’t a mistake but an invitation: a rhythmic stutter that leads us somewhere thrillingly unexpected.",

In this article, we revisit and extend the concept using structured action theory, highlighting the contextual, reflexive, and routinized nature of gendered structured action. We reanalyze a collection of published qualitative studies to illustrate how femininities—emphasized and non-emphasized—are variably constructed through accountability, femmephobia, and the relational and discursive structures that shape gendered practice. Through this reanalysis, we demonstrate how emphasized femininities are contextually fluid configurations that are essential to the legitimation of hegemonic masculinities and reinforce gender inequality. By contrast, non-emphasized femininities are defined primarily through the construction of intragender hierarchies among femininities. This highlights the analytic value of structured action theory for theorizing femininities as diverse, relational, and embedded within systems of power.",

We introduce the Digital Mobility\nModel (DMM)—an agent-based model designed to explore how digital technologies influence\nindividual mobility patterns and delve into how technological advancements could shape or reshape\ninequalities at the urban level.

The model simulates the interaction between individuals (i.e.,\ndynamic agents) and places (i.e., static agents) demonstrating how technology adoption dynamics\nresult in unequal mobility patterns, which in turn impact access to urban services. As such the\nDMM provides a novel theoretical framework, bridging mobility studies and ICT approaches, and\nunderscores its potential for understanding the evolving landscape of digital inequalities in urban\ncontexts, which contributes to ongoing discussions on mobility, technology, and societal transformations.\nKeywords: Mobilities, Digital divide, Digital mobility, Agent-based model, Technology adoption",

The use of RPAS in CS is an emerging practice, which is proved by the existence of only three literature reviews on this topic and of only 12 studies addressing the use of technology mentioned in CS projects by the volunteers. The Systematic Review (SR) developed represents the basis of a participatory Living Systematic Review (LSR), updated every twelve months and available at https://rpas-in-cs-lsr-cgeoreg.hub.arcgis.com.

Additionally, it allows the volunteers to signal CS studies or projects and to be part of the team that reviews the subsequent versions. Starting from the existing literature, we propose a scale of the level of volunteer engagement in CS projects using RPAS, detailing the activities developed. The identified CS projects were analyzed by relating them to the proposed scale. In addition, evolutionary perspectives were discussed in terms of using RPAS in CS projects. In conclusion, the research proposes an LSR (the second outside the medical sciences) meant to continuously update the new partnership between CS and RPAS with real development perspectives.",

We propose a novel pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval (RAG) to automate the assignment of International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes. Drawing on survey data from a sample of recently arrived Afghan and Syrian refugees in Germany, we preprocess noisy occupational descriptions using LLMs and apply vector-based similarity search to retrieve candidate ISCO codes. The final classification is selected by LLMs, constrained to the retrieved candidates and accompanied by interpretable justifications. We evaluate the system’s performance against expert-coded labels, demonstrating high agreement and robustness across languages. Our findings suggest that RAG-powered LLMs can substantially improve the accuracy, scalability, and accessibility of occupational classification, with particular benefits for multilingual and resource-constrained research settings. In addition, we describe a prototypical pipeline that other researchers can readily adapt for applying LLMs to similar classification tasks, facilitating transparency, reproducibility, and broader adoption.",

The effect exceeds 0.1 standard deviations in recent elections and is strongest in poorer areas and in towns with high prior far-right support. We find evidence consistent with the symbolic mechanism and mixed evidence for the economic one. TdF exposure increases local GDP per capita, effects on voting are larger when French riders win stages, and a two-wave survey around the 2025 TdF provides suggestive evidence that residents in exposed towns report greater recognition.

We emphasize that risk tolerance is not a fixed individual trait, but rather an emergent disposition that arises from the combination of evolutionary pressures towards risk-aversion, lived experiences—particularly in critical developmental periods—and cultural transmission within and across generational cohorts. We aim to show how, in an uncertain world, people  adjust their behaviors towards risky prospects by relying on evolved social learning strategies, as these provide general-purpose mechanisms for interpreting environmental conditions across different causally-opaque domains.

In their framework, minimum RPM can benefit consumers by encouraging retailers to hold sufficient inventory, thereby lowering prices in high-demand states. We relax the assumption of perfect competition and analyze a continuum of downstream market structures, from monopoly to perfect competition. We show how the interaction of demand uncertainty and retail competition generates distinct regimes, and we identify the conditions under which RPM improves or harms consumer welfare. The results provide guidance for both antitrust policy and managerial strategy, highlighting that the pro-competitive effects of RPM are confined to industries with moderate demand uncertainty and intermediate levels of retail competition.",

Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a two-wave model that distinguishes the visible displacement of human labor by AI tools from the invisible redistribution of attention via algorithmic recommendation, highlighting the societal importance of this shift; (2) we define three measurable indicators—Structure Index (SI), Reusability Index (RI), and Closure Rate (CR)—to operationalize the process quality of discourse and enable quantitative study; and (3) we derive falsifiable predictions suggesting that high–SI/RI/CR discourse is more likely to remain visible, while conclusion-only content is systematically down-scored. We further argue that nonproductive escalation signals (anger, provocation, spike-type virality) degrade long-term visibility. This work bridges algorithmic fairness research with the emerging need to understand AI-mediated social gatekeeping, and it provides a foundation for future empirical validation and platform design intervention.",

          "abstract": "Studies analyzing panel data have gained popularity during the last decades, especially due to the availability of long-running panel surveys and the increasing interest in estimating causal effects. While researchers have investigated the magnitude of measurement error in survey data, little is known about the consequences of measurement error in outcome variables for longitudinal analyses, such as first-difference and fixed-effects models. In this paper, we investigate this issue using the example of monthly earnings and Mincer-style regressions, which are applied to survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Assuming that administrative earnings information reflects true earnings, we show that individuals typically underreport short-term earnings changes in survey data, which can lead to increasing biases with shorter panel durations. We demonstrate that this problem is substantially mitigated when using fixed-effects models, particularly when longer panels are available. Our findings thus imply that measurement error in the dependent variable can bias estimates for models focusing on short-time changes, but has negligible impacts when using long-running data and adequate methods.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter Hildebrandt investigates the link between the contestability that is key to constitutional democracies on the one hand and the falsifiability of scientific theories on the other hand, with regard to large language models (LLMs). Legally relevant decision-making that is based on the deployment of applications that involve LLMs must be contestable in a court of law. The current flavour of such contestability is focused on transparency, usually framed in terms of the explainability of the model (explainable AI). In the long run, however, the fairness and reliability of these models should be tested in a more scientific manner, based on the falsifiability of the theoretical framework that should underpin the model. This requires that researchers in the domain of LLMs learn to abduct theoretical frameworks, based on the output models of LLMs and the real world patterns they imply, while this abduction should be such that the theory can be inductively tested in a way that allows for falsification. On top of that, researchers need to conduct empirical research to enable such inductive testing. The chapter thus argues that the contestability required under the Rule of Law, should move beyond explanations of how the model generates its output, to whether the real world patterns represented in the model output can falsify the theoretical framework that should inform the model.",

This sociocentric kinship network allows for measuring family network distance and classifying caregivers as direct kin, extended kin, or true non-kin, and measure family network distance for all ties. Logistic regression models compare caregiver characteristics between extended kin and true non-kin to validate the criterion validity.\nResults\nAround one-third of presumed non-kin caregivers are extended kin rather than non-kin—separated by two degrees in the family network. These extended kin are more distant than direct kin (e.g., cousins) but far closer than the general population. They also display caregiving patterns more akin to family, including heavier care loads and greater co-residence. True non-kin caregivers face distinct constraints, like greater geographical distance and age-related barriers. All caregivers are both disproportionately female, of lower socio-economic status, and more likely to have a migration background.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to identify longitudinal trajectories of precarious employment during emerging adulthood (18-24 years) and examine associations with short- and long-term mental health among Australians. Group-based trajectory modelling and adjusted linear/binary regression were applied to panel data from the nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The analytic sample (n=499; person-year observations=5,887) included Australian residents employed from 2001 to 2008 between ages 18-24, with subsequent measures of mental health taken at 25 and 35 years. Informed by a youth advisory group, employment precarity was measured using composite scores derived from subjective survey items assessing perceived job security and job control, and mental health was assessed using the self-reported Mental Health Inventory-Five Item (MHI-5). Two distinct trajectories of precarious employment were identified: persistent high precarity, and low and decreasing precarity. Individuals in both persistent high precarity trajectories had significantly poorer mental health at age 25, whereas by age 35, poorer mental health was observed only for persistent job insecurity. Associations between precarious employment and mental health also differed by sex, varying across job control and job security dimensions. These findings suggest that chronically high employment precarity during emerging adulthood is associated with poorer short- and long-term mental health, while transitioning into more stable and secure employment during this developmental period may be protective. Policymakers and employers can help to safeguard the current and future mental health of young Australians by improving job security, stability and autonomy, as well as expanding access to mental health supports.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the transformation of Serbia’s regulatory state under the populist regime of Aleksandar Vučić (2012–2025), a period marked by democratic backsliding and heavy reliance on foreign direct investment (FDI). Focusing on competition policy and a subsidy programme for foreign investors, it shows how the regime has reshaped the regulatory state in ways distinct from other autocratic populist contexts. Core institutional carriers of the regulatory state have remained in place as non-majoritarian institutions and were even granted greater de jure insulation from government, yet in practice they have been undermined and their authority - along with that of other institutions in the wider regulatory ecosystem (law enforcement bodies, inspectorates, and others) - systematically suppressed. The result is an eroded, hybridised model of the regulatory state: the government has carved out a role for itself to decisively shape and direct sectoral policy, often in an arbitrary manner, with a distinct form of deregulation, namely through the outright non-enforcement of substantial regulatory standards.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people often experience challenges in interpreting nonliteral language, such as sarcasm, teasing, and prosocial lies, which rely on speaker-intention discriminations. Prior research on speaker-intention discriminations in autism has often employed static stimuli that lack ecological validity, did not capture multimodal communication cues, and primarily focused on children. The present study examined how autistic and non-autistic adults infer speaker intentions and emotional valence in dynamic, naturalistic videos. Participants (N = 73) viewed 50 brief video vignettes from the Relational Inference in Social Communication database, depicting literal, sarcastic, teasing, or prosocial lie scenarios. After each video, they identified the speaker’s communicative intent and rated the emotional response of the addressee. Participants also completed two measures of autistic characteristics (Autism Spectrum Quotient; Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory). Autistic participants showed lower speaker-intention discrimination than non-autistic participants, whereas valence ratings differed modestly by group but followed broadly similar patterns across intentions. Autistic traits predicted lower speaker-intention discrimination in non-autistic adults but were unrelated (Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory) or positively associated (Autism Quotient) in autistic adults. These findings highlight both shared and differing aspects of speaker-intention discriminations and happiness rating across groups and support the value of combining categorical and trait-based approaches to better understand individual differences in social communication.",

          "authors": "Research Bridge publisher; Nyamwaro Lorna Kerubo; Elizabeth Wachiuri; Eric Namusonge",
          "abstract": "The food and beverage manufacturing sector in Kenya faces persistent challenges related to demand variability, perish ability, and inadequate cold chain infrastructure, which amplify inefficiencies within supply chains. A major driver of these inefficiencies is shortage gaming, a phenomenon where customers exaggerate orders during actual or perceived shortages in anticipation of rationing. This behaviour distorts demand signals, complicates production planning, and increases inventory and operational costs, thereby undermining firm performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between shortage gaming, as a dimension of the bullwhip effect, and the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive research design anchored in a post-positivist philosophy, targeting 217 food and beverage firms registered with the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. A sample of 208 respondents comprising logistics and procurement managers was selected using Yamane’s formula and simple random sampling. Primary data was collected through structured and unstructured questionnaires, and reliability was confirmed using Cronbach’s Alpha (α ≥ 0.7). Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis with the aid of SPSS software. The findings revealed that shortage gaming significantly influences firm performance. Customers’ exaggerated orders and promotional mechanisms such as discounts and rebates were found to create artificial demand spikes, leading to inefficiencies in production planning and inventory management. Regression results indicated a strong positive correlation (R = 0.871) and high explanatory power (R² = 0.759), confirming that 75.9% of the variation in firm performance is explained by shortage gaming practices. The study concludes that shortage gaming has a significant and positive effect on profitability, sales volume, and market share. It recommends enhancing supply chain visibility, adopting transparent rationing policies, and strengthening supplier partnerships to mitigate opportunistic ordering behaviours and improve performance.",

The research was motivated by persistent inefficiencies in the sector’s supply chain, including inventory volatility, rising operational costs, and stagnant contribution to GDP despite the Vision 2030 target of 20%. Order batching, manifested through correlated, random, and balanced ordering, has been identified in literature as a key driver of demand variability and operational inefficiencies. The study adopted a descriptive research design with a post-positivist philosophical approach. The target population was 217 food and beverage firms registered by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, from which 208 respondents were sampled using simple random sampling. Primary data was collected through structured and unstructured questionnaires and analysed using SPSS version 25. Both correlation and regression analyses were applied. The findings revealed that order batching significantly and positively influences firm performance, explaining 72.3% of the variance. Specifically, batching improved production efficiency, resource utilisation, cost savings, and customer responsiveness. The study concludes that effective batching strategies mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance profitability, sales volume, and market share.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of cyber movements and social media activism in addressing violence against women in Bangladesh through the frameworks of cyberfeminism and hashtag feminism. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 women—including survivors, students, and activists—and content analysis of major online campaigns (#JusticeForTonu, #MeToo, #RageAgainstRape), the study examines how women perceive digital activism, the barriers they encounter, and the broader societal impacts. Findings highlight that online platforms provide survivors with new opportunities to share experiences, overcome stigma, and mobilize solidarity across geographic and social divides. Hashtags and viral campaigns were perceived as powerful tools for raising awareness, amplifying marginalized voices, and pressuring institutions to acknowledge gender-based violence. However, participation remains uneven, shaped by structural barriers such as the digital divide, weak infrastructure, and lack of literacy, as well as cultural constraints including fear of retaliation, patriarchal norms, and stigma. Women also face trolling, online harassment, and emotional exhaustion when engaging in activism. Despite these challenges, cyber movements are reshaping public discourse, empowering survivors, influencing policy debates, and connecting local struggles to global feminist movements. The study concludes that while digital activism alone cannot ensure systemic reform, it plays a critical role in breaking silence, mobilizing awareness, and advancing social justice in patriarchal contexts like Bangladesh",

Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces Afrostemy as a Black and decolonial call for epistemological justice, aimed at restructuring science from the insurgent cultures of the Global South. Rather than seeking mere entry into existing structures of STEM, Afrostemy demands their reconstitution as plural and liberatory spaces. It denounces the complicity of modern science in epistemicide and in racial, gender, and colonial exclusion, while reclaiming the knowledges, memories, and practices systematically silenced by Eurocentric hegemony. Emerging at the crossroads of ancestral memory, pedagogical praxis, and epistemic insubordination, Afrostemy proposes a science that listens, resists, and reimagines. Grounded in Afro-Brazilian, Latin American, and Global South epistemologies, it fuses theoretical inquiry with pedagogical experimentation, engaging schools, laboratories, and quilombos of thought. Drawing from concepts such as cognitive justice, Exu’s pedagogy of the crossroads, and embodied methodologies, Afrostemy insists on the centrality of ancestral knowledge systems, spirituality, and collective practices in reconfiguring scientific production. Methodologically, the article weaves together critical analysis of coloniality in science with examples of decolonial pedagogies in Brazil, particularly in biosciences education. These cases illustrate how scientific curricula can be redesigned to incorporate Afro-diasporic philosophies, Indigenous cosmologies, and alternative ontologies of nature. In doing so, Afrostemy does not simply critique exclusion, but actively articulates modes of epistemic repair and insurgent imagination. Ultimately, Afrostemy is proposed as a living methodology of resistance, creativity, and epistemic plurality—an invitation to rethink science not as a neutral and universal enterprise, but as a contested field that must be decolonized in order to become truly diverse, just, and transformative.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, several major terror attacks in the name of political Islam have shaken Europe. This study examines how social media users respond to Jihadist terrorism when discussing immigration-related issues from a comparative perspective. The theoretical predictions, derived from combining terror management theory, group threat theory, and the concept of social resilience, are empirically tested using validated Keyword-Assisted Topic Modeling (keyATM). Unlike traditional topic modeling approaches, keyATM is a semi-supervised method that balances inductive discovery with theory-driven guidance. It incorporates pre-specified keywords, enhancing both the precision and interpretability of results while mitigating the impact of researcher subjectivity. The study is based on over 100,000 time-stamped and geo-coded Tweets on immigration and related issues across four languages in the week following eleven major Islamist terrorist attacks in nine European cities. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, the findings reveal that both threat-related and tolerance-related topics emerge prominently across all four languages. Deeper analyses uncover temporal shifts in the discourse: While initial reactions often reflect nationalist and exclusionary views, later stages show a rise in inclusionary and tolerance-oriented topics. These results highlight the dynamic nature of social media debates on migration issues after dramatic events, where initial threat-driven responses often give way to more inclusive and tolerance-oriented discussions as time progresses.",

We look at the depoliticized topic of immigration in Denmark and analyze 27 anti-immigration, pro-immigration, and attitudinally mixed group discussions. Notwithstanding its waning political significance in this context, we demonstrate that moralized boundaries contribute to the stickiness, solidification, and continued potency of division over immigration. We argue that previous moralization explains focus groups’ perception of division as persistent and insuperable, with disagreements over immigration signifying fundamental differences of moral character between people. Moreover, it sustains a self-conception as political pariahs among anti-immigration participants, despite the contemporary political normalization of their views. Centering citizens’ shared understanding, the study emphasizes how moral boundaries keep division alive—ready to be reactivated and mobilized.",

This study aims to analyze these dynamics among Indonesian female supporters, with a particular focus on Sundanese and Javanese cultural contexts. A qualitative research approach was employed, combining questionnaires and in-depth unstructured interviews. The sample consisted of 1,078 respondents, including 497 female supporters (from groups such as Mojang Bobotoh, Viking Ladies, and Bonita), 233 male supporters, 257 members of the general public, and 91 sports figures. Findings indicate that collaborative efforts and specific measures are needed to ensure the safety of female supporters. Approximately 47.5% of respondents perceived their presence positively, contributing to a more vibrant match atmosphere, although 15% associated it with negative emotional reactions when their team lost. Furthermore, 63% agreed that women are capable of taking care of themselves, while 21.5% noted that their loyalty occasionally conflicts with cultural etiquette. The study concludes that female supporters of Persib and Persebaya play a vital role in enriching Indonesia’s supporter culture. Their expectations and perceptions align with broader societal demands for more active and inclusive female participation in sports. While their potential to promote enthusiasm and peace in football should be encouraged, challenges such as discrimination and internal conflicts remain. The integration of Sundanese and Javanese cultural values by female supporters demonstrates that football fandom can coexist with the preservation of local cultural traditions.",

          "abstract": "The rapid integration of social media into daily life has transformed modes of communication, self-expression, and social interaction, particularly among university students. While social media offers opportunities for connection, entertainment, and knowledge exchange, growing concerns canter on its implications for psychological well-being. This study critically examines the complex relationship between social media use and psychological health indicators, focusing on dimensions such as addiction, social comparison, cyberbullying, and awareness. Grounded in Social Comparison Theory and Uses and Gratifications Theory, the research investigates how different patterns of engagement active versus passive use and socially motivated versus escapist behaviours influence outcomes including anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and overall well-being. A cross-sectional survey design was employed, capturing diverse student experiences across multiple cultural contexts. Findings highlight that the quality and emotional consequences of social media engagement are more salient than the quantity of time spent online. Negative online behaviours such as compulsive checking, fear of missing out, and cyberbullying contribute to psychological distress, whereas meaningful interactions and supportive experiences can serve as protective factors. Importantly, awareness of social media’s potential risks emerged as a moderating variable, mitigating the adverse effects of harmful encounters and underscoring the role of digital literacy. The study advances understanding of the nuanced interplay between social media use and mental health, emphasizing the importance of differentiating between adaptive and maladaptive patterns of engagement. It concludes with recommendations for integrating awareness programs, promoting healthier online environments, and developing strategies at both individual and platform levels to support psychological resilience.",

Using cluster analysis, we identified three collective action archetypes and evaluated their persistence with survival analysis. Nationally, initiatives had a 75% probability of lasting beyond 15 years. Those with high initial resource abundance persisted longest (84%). Initiatives with low initial abundance still endured at similar rates under favorable collective action conditions (78%) but had greater abandonment rates when coupled with low poverty, low productivity, and high surveillance costs (54%). These results reveal multiple pathways to lasting co-management, refine hypotheses for future research, and show how tracking persistence supports adaptive, context-specific interventions for durable and equitable conservation.",

          "authors": "Frederick Arthur",
          "abstract": "Why do African Americans vote in huge numbers, even when enthusiasm for the Democratic Party is low? For decades, scholars pointed to racial solidarity and loyalty to the Democrats. But what if hostility, not loyalty, is a driving force? This paper introduces the defensive turnout theory, which is the idea that in racially charged elections, many Black voters cast ballots not out of enthusiasm for Democrats, but to block Republican threats. Using standard logistic regression models to analyze the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES) data, the study finds that hostility toward the Republican Party is positively associated with Black turnout rates more than warmth toward the Democratic Party. Each 10-point increase in anti-Republican sentiment is positively associated with a voting odd of 9%, while equivalent Democratic warmth is counterintuitively associated with a 14.7% decrease in turnout odds at a 95% confidence interval even after accounting for key sociodemographic factors. While causality cannot be inferred from the cross-sectional design, the 2020 election presents a unique case of a high-stakes and racially charged electoral landmark, which invites scholars and practitioners to rethink what truly motivates Black turnout and what belonging means when democracy itself feels contested in a polarized era.",

          "abstract": "Dating platforms face a critical tension: maximizing engagement can conflict with safety, fairness, and user agency. This paper presents Transdisciplinary Equilibrium (JX), a composite social–cost objective that makes this tension measurable and optimizable.\nWe formalize social cost as\nJ = αE + βS + γA,\nwhere E captures rejection-driven harm (e.g., ghosting, ignored messages), S measures exposure asymmetry (e.g., Gini of impressions, top-decile share), and A quantifies anticipatory suppression (non-initiation, delete-after-view, view→message drop). An optional interaction term,\nJη = J + η(E·S),\nmodels compounding harms when rejection and asymmetry reinforce each other.\nContributions. Our framework delivers:\n(i) a Metric DAG linking product levers to auditable outcomes,\n(ii) estimators and experimental designs for platform evaluation,\n(iii) a safety workflow and algorithmic transparency interface, and\n(iv) guardrailed calibration of (α, β, γ, η) enabling measurable reductions in social cost while preserving user agency.\nImpact.

          "authors": "Wiwi Haryanti Lima; Payamta; Melkianus Teddison Bulan",
          "abstract": "This study examines the influence of regional financial ratios on budget implementation performance in Indonesian local governments within the framework of fiscal decentralization. Using the Stewardship Theory as a theoretical foundation, we analyze how fiscal independence and financial efficiency affect the ability of districts/municipalities to translate budget plans into concrete programs. This study used panel data from 250 districts/cities throughout Indonesia for the period 2018-2023, resulting in 1,500 balanced observations. This analysis uses a Fixed Effects Model to control for unobserved regional heterogeneity. The results reveal a counterintuitive finding: the fiscal independence ratio does not significantly affect the performance of budget implementation (coefficient = 0.008380, p = 0.7395), contrary to conventional assumptions about fiscal autonomy. In contrast, the financial efficiency ratio showed a strong positive effect on implementation performance (coefficient = 0.193478, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that resource optimization capabilities are more important than resource availability. These findings suggest that effective management in local government is better realized through efficient financial management than revenue-generating autonomy. This study contributes to the fiscal decentralization literature by challenging the assumption of an autonomy-performance link and provides practical implications for policymakers to prioritize capacity building in financial management rather than increasing fiscal independence. The results support a paradigm shift from a quantity-focused approach to a quality-focused approach in regional financial management in Indonesia's decentralized governance system.",

          "authors": "Kübra Melis Avcu",
          "abstract": "Historical trauma experienced during the teaching of social studies can create significant emotional and pedagogical challenges for both teachers and students. This study aims to investigate the strategies that social studies teachers use to cope with students’ emotional reactions when teaching about historical traumatic events, as well as their preferred teaching methods and professional support needs. The research was conducted with 25 social studies teachers working at lower-secondary (middle) schools in the central district of Malatya, Türkiye, using a phenomenological qualitative approach. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed via content analysis. The findings reveal that teachers employ strategies such as fostering open communication, building empathy, and creating a supportive classroom environment to help students cope with emotionally charged historical content. Storytelling, the use of real-life examples, visual materials, and drama activities are among the most prominent methods reported. Teachers also adapt their language to be age-appropriate and tend to avoid graphic or potentially traumatic details. The study further highlights teachers’ expressed need for in-service training, psychological support, and access to expert guidance when teaching sensitive historical topics. These results underscore the importance of equipping social studies teachers with appropriate coping and teaching strategies to support students’ historical awareness and emotional well-being.",

          "authors": "Da Vuthea; Rany Sam; Ratanak Keo; Thou Nguon",
          "abstract": "Leadership in higher education is increasingly defined not only by technical expertise but also by relational and behavioral soft skills that are essential for building trust. This article proposes a conceptual framework linking ten leadership soft skills, including collaboration, communication, initiative, leadership ability, personal development, personal effectiveness, planning and organization, presentation skills, critical thinking, and technological competence, to the multidimensional construct of trustworthiness, which is composed of ability, benevolence, and integrity. Drawing on transformational leadership, servant leadership, social exchange theory, leader–member exchange (LMX), and attribution theory of trust, the framework positions soft skills as antecedents that shape leaders’ perceived trustworthiness. Unlike prevailing leadership models that regard trust as a byproduct of leadership style, this study highlights the microlevel behavioral processes through which soft skills generate credibility, ethical consistency, and benevolence in higher education leadership. The paper contributes theoretically by integrating two distinct strands of scholarship, soft skills and trust, into a unified model, and practically by offering guidance for leadership development initiatives in universities and colleges. Although conceptual, the proposed framework lays the foundation for future empirical studies, particularly those employing structural equation modeling (SEM), to validate the pathways connecting soft skills and trustworthiness across diverse higher education contexts.",

          "authors": "Henry Omoregie Egharevba",
          "abstract": "Solving health problems from a communal perspective remains the most effective way to attain better health systems and indices in society. Nigeria and most other African countries, amidst dwindling health funding, exploding population, rising cost of living, and declining living standards, should be more disposed to adopting this approach because it allows wider access while addressing the issues of inequality, inequity, and discrimination. A population’s health needs are best addressed when there is a better understanding of the population and environmental demographics. This work aims to demonstrate the use of systematic health needs assessment in prioritizing health interventions in resource-limited settings like Nigeria using the Federal Capital Territory as a case study. The author applied profiling of population characteristics, health status, and local health determinant factors to identify priority health needs of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. The result showed that the targeted population had poor health status and indices, such as health insurance coverage, available skilled personnel, neonatal and children under-five health mortality and morbidity rates, quality of life, and health-related injuries. Behavioural measures, health inequalities, local health determinant factors such as employment and work data and environmental hygiene, and national priorities were also considered. The study systematically assessed and discussed the priority health needs of the targeted population. Improving health access and promoting equity through mandatory health insurance, and a focus on reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child’s health were identified as priority health needs to improve the health of the population.",

Wrong's proposition that power has three dimensions: extensiveness, comprehensiveness, and intensity. However, based on my theoretical framework of power formation, I provide a novel interpretation of power's \"intensity\".",

          "abstract": "With the growing importance of the knowledge economy across Europe and beyond, governments increasingly demand research to deliver tangible economic and societal impact, translating into funding systems incentivizing societally relevant research and leading to an increasing monitoring of societal impact. This commentary pleads for a re-engagement with the ‘geographies of research assessment’. Informed by a dualistic understanding of scale as both fixed and socially constructed, the commentary firstly argues for comparing and contrasting the influence of different national research evaluation systems on geographical knowledge production. Secondly, the contribution conceives of research evaluation systems as a form of scalar politics which enables a view of the actors and networks contesting current evaluation systems and promoting alternatives. The paper concludes that rather than trying to fit the discipline to the system, geographers should instead question which evaluation system would fit the discipline.",

          "abstract": "Applying a linked lives perspective on the nexus between institutions and life-courses, this study examines how spouses’ gendered careers shape retirement incomes across 13 European countries. It connects contextual support for (a)symmetric employment constellations with the redistributiveness of Beveridge- and Bismarck-type pension systems across five life-course policy pathways. Based on 8,068 couple biographies from SHARELIFE (waves 3 and 7), Multichannel Sequence Analysis identifies male-breadwinner, 1.5-earner, and dual-earner constellations. Findings show that reconciliation policies and pension regimes jointly shape retirement income stratification. Dual-earner constellations are most common where defamilization is high and tend to achieve more equal and higher joint incomes. Male-breadwinner couples, despite specialization, often fall short in combined retirement income. In Bismarckian systems, dual-earners compensate individual deficits; 1.5-earners benefit from redistribution or institutional privilege but maintain within-couple inequality. Overall, the interplay of life-course policy contexts and pension design is key to understanding gendered income dynamics in later life.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes JX-Graph 1.0, a preliminary conceptual framework for auditing hidden interventions in digital platforms using graph-theoretic and information-theoretic tools.\nWe formalize a time-varying (near-regular) graph model and introduce four diagnostic metrics:\nNetwork tension (Φt) – imbalance across interactions.\nSymmetry divergence (Δsym) – structural asymmetry of user orbits.\nJump-history entropy (JHET) – unpredictability of behavioral shifts.\nDescription-length change (ΔMDL) – complexity differences in encoding system states.\nThrough a simple case study on a cycle graph (C₆), we illustrate how localized interventions trigger characteristic shifts across all four metrics.\nThe framework is explicitly proof-of-concept: empirical validation is limited, scalability challenges remain, and comparisons with existing anomaly detection methods are absent. Nevertheless, the contribution lies in posing a new research question—how can platform interventions be audited in a transparent, mathematically principled way?\nWe invite critical feedback and further development, aiming to refine the theoretical foundation and extend the methodology to large-scale, real-world data.",

          "abstract": "This paper extends the Transdisciplinary Equilibrium (JX) framework by applying it to the metaphor of the Naruto whirlpool, a natural phenomenon that embodies convergence, turbulence, and cyclical return. The whirlpool is conceptualized as a model of social dynamics in which structural pressures, recognition asymmetries, and emotional divergence spiral into critical thresholds. By formalizing the whirlpool as a dynamic system, the study demonstrates how seemingly chaotic flows resolve into patterned equilibria. This metaphor provides a foundation for analyzing social reproduction, market cycles, and digital attention economies. Through the lens of JX theory, the Naruto whirlpool is reframed as a transdisciplinary symbol of both risk concentration and regenerative balance in human systems.",

          "authors": "Achintya Ghayal",
          "abstract": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting has shifted from voluntary disclosure to a regulatory imperative and cornerstone of corporate transparency. Traditional cost accounting systems, which emphasize direct, indirect, and overhead costs, often ignore externalities like carbon emissions, social equity investments, and governance overhead. This study investigates how embedding ESG-driven cost allocations reshapes financial reporting and managerial decisions in manufacturing firms. Using a simulated dataset spanning three divisions (Energy, Materials, Consumer), we compare outcomes under conventional accounting and an ESG-adjusted framework that includes carbon pricing equivalents, compliance costs, worker and governance programs. Our results show that ESG adjustments increase reported costs by approximately 20-30% and reduce operating margins by 5-7 percentage points, while significantly improving transparency across environmental, social, and governance metrics. Sensitivity analyses (varying carbon pricing) indicate that margin declines are robust to plausible environmental cost changes, though divisions with higher emissions are most affected. This research contributes to sustainability accounting by operationalizing ESG into cost allocation mechanics rather than treating it as supplementary disclosure. It provides a practical model for managers, regulators, and investors seeking to balance profitability with long-term accountability and risk mitigation.",
