          "abstract": "This is a short presentation delivered at the \"Thinking 'Umwelten' in the Age of AI: Planetary Design in Chile and Germany\" working group of the Chile-Germany Academic Forum, which took place at the Technical University of Berlin between June 16 and 18, 2025. This presentation traces and begins to problematize the participation of the Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana in the 1987 \"Materialities of Communication\" symposium in Dubrovnik – which was published the following year in a proceedings volume by Suhrkamp – and the contribution of Francisco Varela to the English version of that book, published in 1994 by Stanford University Press. The presentation closes with a conversation between the author and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht – one of the organizers of that symposium and one of the editors of the books that comprise the series – about the behind-the-scenes aspects of both the Dubrovnik symposium and the books in question.",

          "authors": "Chelly Maes; Laura Vandenbosch",
          "abstract": "The current paper proposes an integrative theoretical model, starting from the notion that the current television landscape is characterized by heterogeneous content reflecting and reproducing our changing and conflicting societal discourses. Assumptions of prior entertainment television theories, such as those of Cultivation Theory, might fall short when it comes to disentangling the outcomes of heterogeneous content in diverse audiences. Thus, theory building is needed. This article therefore proposes the Heterogeneous Content Process model, integrating research on transportation into narratives and self-referencing. The model aims to induce an imperative shift in television effects research by urging researchers to step away from a so-called homogeneity approach and introducing a heterogeneity perspective. This way, a more nuanced understanding of television effects can be reached.",

          "authors": "Kyle Conway; Julie Alice Gramaccia; Nikita Scholz; Téana Averbeck",
          "abstract": "Since the University of Warwick’s news translation project in the mid-2000s, it has been a truism that journalists rarely translate whole articles but instead compose stories using texts in other languages as one source among others. However, the development of AI-based machine translation has brought about a shift in journalistic practices. Increasingly, multilingual news agencies are using these tools to produce similar stories in multiple languages. One consequence has been that researchers can now compile parallel corpora of translated stories. This article proposes a method to characterize such corpora by measuring the distance between source and target texts, a method it applies to stories published in English and French on the website SwissInfo.ch. It describes the mechanics of corpus-building, article vectorization, and the creation of a lexical substitution list that makes measurement possible. It then proposes three measures – Euclidean, Jaccard, and cosine – which have complementary strengths and weaknesses. The value of these measurement tools is heuristic: they make it possible to identify patterns that can be investigated using other methods more familiar to news translation researchers, such as interviews or direct observation.",

          "authors": "Daniel Courtney; Ana-Maria Bliuc; Yuki Kamide",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms are gamified to promote opinion sharing on any topic, irrespective of users’ subject knowledge. Potential effects of uninformed opinion-sharing have yet to be fully explored. We propose that one such effect is an opinion-overconfidence effect: an increase in topic-specific confidence after posting an opinion on that topic. Here, we present the first empirical evidence for the opinion-overconfidence, in the form of three pre-registered studies. Our findings support the existence of an effect, driven by the act of writing one’s opinion rather than of posting one’s opinion publicly. However, we do find linguistic differences between opinions written privately and those for a public audience, which could be interpreted as evidence for a message-release component to the effect. As overconfidence is predictive of extremist political ideologies and conspiracy theory belief, a population-wide increase in overconfidence due to social media use could have devastating effects on democratic societies.",

          "abstract": "Migrant domestic workers (MDWs) in Türkiye work in highly demanding conditions, often without legal protection and face significant physical and mental health challenges. This study explores MDWs’ mental health challenges and help-seeking behaviours from the perspectives of stakeholders. Six stakeholders were interviewed between May and June 2023. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic and interpretative phenomenological analyses. Findings revealed that MDWs face mental health stressors related to exploitative working conditions, cultural and language barriers, and family separation. However, access to mental health services is limited due to systemic barriers, including a lack of legal work permits, limited services, and unsupportive employer and agency attitudes. MDWs’ help-seeking behaviours are limited, so they often cope with these challenges through individual resilience and community solidarity, albeit with the use of maladaptive coping strategies. It is recommended that comprehensive labour law protections and institutionalized support services are needed to promote the MDWs’ mental well-being.",

          "authors": "Dimitrios Saredakis; Rhianna Sharman; Hannah AD Keage; Stephanie Wong; Ashleigh E Smith; Tobias Loetscher",
          "abstract": "Loneliness and social isolation are major public health concerns for older adults. While emerging social virtual reality (VR) platforms offer a promising tool to foster connection, little is known about the experiences of older adults who voluntarily adopt and sustain engagement with this technology. This exploratory study addresses this gap by providing an empirical portrait of 35 long-term users (median age 60) of Thrive Pavilion, a social VR platform designed for older adults. Through an online survey, we investigated their usage patterns, loneliness, and perceived benefits. Findings reveal a user base of technologically comfortable early adopters who reported a high prevalence of loneliness (66%). Notably, most users were not physically limited, indicating VR was chosen for its unique social affordances, not merely as a substitute for in-person options. Engagement was high, and users reported substantial benefits, with a majority agreeing the platform increased social connections (90%), reduced loneliness (72%), and improved overall well-being (87%). Importantly, these benefits showed evidence of real-world transfer, with over a third of users reporting benefits such as reduced anxiety and increased confidence face-to-face interactions. The platform was rated as significantly superior to other communication tools for providing social presence and enjoyment and was perceived as a safe environment. Ultimately, this research demonstrates that age-specific social VR can be a deeply meaningful social venue for its users. These results highlight the technology's potential to combat loneliness. By examining this cohort of successful early adopters, the findings provide a proof of concept for social VR's benefits, demonstrating the technology's realized potential for those who sustain engagement, leaving open the question of its suitability and appeal for the broader older adult population.",

          "authors": "Karen Konkoly; Daniel Morris; Kaitlyn Hurka; Kristin Sanders; Ken A. Paller",
          "abstract": "Dreams have been a source of inspiration and creativity for millennia. Yet, demonstrating that REM-sleep dreaming promotes creative thinking has been challenging. Existing evidence does not provide strong support for this link; dream manipulations were generally confounded by waking activities that influenced dream content, such that any boost in creativity could be attributable to waking rather than sleep cognition. Correlational evidence cannot directly establish that dreams cause insights. Some studies indicate that memory reactivation during deep sleep or sleep-onset dreams can increase related creativity, but direct experimental manipulations of REM sleep dreams are still limited. Here, we aimed to engineer dreams by reactivating memories in people who frequently lucid-dream (i.e., realize they’re dreaming while still asleep). Participants slept after failing to solve several puzzles that had unique soundtracks, half of which were replayed during REM sleep (during lucid dreams when possible). Participants were instructed to continue working on a puzzle if they heard its sound in a dream. Sound cues during sleep increased the proportion of dreams related to associated puzzles, particularly in dreams containing lucidity signals. Cues also boosted later puzzle-solving, but only for participants who showed an increase in cue-related dreaming. Whereas it is well-known that sounds can be incorporated into dreams and change dream content, our experimental procedure promoted dreams pertaining to specific pre-sleep objectives. Results provide strong support for the conclusion that the specific content of REM-sleep lucid dreams can boost creativity that aids problem-solving.",

          "authors": "Ariel Fuchs; Hila Fuchs",
          "abstract": "Contemporary global challenges necessitate a fundamental reconceptualization of human intelligence and capability development. This paper presents Transformative Intelligence Theory (TIT), an integrative framework synthesizing the Multi-Dimensional Functional Model (Fuchs, 2024) and Fluid Reality Theory (Fuchs, 2025a; Fuchs, 2025b) to address critical limitations in traditional intelligence paradigms. Unlike existing models that conceptualize Intelligence as a fixed cognitive capacity, TIT defines Intelligence as a meta-systemic, dynamic process of boundary negotiation between perception and functioning within complex adaptive environments. Transformative Intelligence is operationally defined as the meta-systemic capacity to identify, understand, and modify the dynamic interactions between the perception of Reality and functioning within it, enabling adaptive and generative responses to complex, changing environments. This definition fundamentally differs from traditional intelligence theories by emphasizing transformation over adaptation, process over product, and integration over domain specificity. The framework operationalizes through four core components that emerge from the integration of both foundational models: perceptual flexibility, which means meta-cognitive awareness enabling perspective shifts across meaning-making systems; adaptive functional capability, including contextual modulation of responses across six functional domains; ecological engagement regarding systems-level understanding and influence capacity, and transformative creativity defined as novel solution generation that transforms constraints into opportunities. These components function through recursive feedback loops mathematically formalized as R = I × E × C, or as the Conciseness Equation (Fuchs et al., 2025) ∂C/∂t=k*(I*E - a*C), where the Reality emerges in our Conciseness from the dynamic interaction of Imagination, Environment, and Connection quality.",

          "authors": "Daniel Morris; Blaise Elliott; S.Gabriela Torres-Platas; Justin Wall; Ema Demšar; Karen R Konkoly; Emily Rosman; Marcia Grabowecky; David Glowacki; Ken A. Paller",
          "abstract": "The immersive environments of virtual reality (VR) have potential to engender a vast range of experiences. Although participants recognize these experiences as artificial, the consequences can still be profound. Compared to VR, lucid dreams — characterized by awareness that one is dreaming — potentially allow for even more expansive explorations of immersive multisensory experience. Furthermore, lucid dreaming could conceivably enhance the impact of a prior VR experience, producing more profound effects than the VR experience alone. As an initial step along those lines, we attempted to induce lucid dreams about a VR experience called Ripple, with the goal of documenting the impact of the combination. In prior research, Ripple by itself was shown to reduce self-other boundaries and enhance interconnectedness. We recruited four frequent lucid dreamers to experience Ripple on two occasions, followed by an overnight session with sounds from Ripple presented quietly during polysomnographically verified REM sleep. Three participants experienced lucid dreams about Ripple that night, and all four reported dreams containing elements of Ripple. The lucid dreams were validated in real time by physiological signals from the dreamers to indicate their concurrent experience of lucidity in the dream, followed by signals of dreaming about the VR experience. On this basis, we can confirm that it was possible in these circumstances for people to have lucid dreams recapitulating elements of the prior VR experience. Our findings also showcase how the synergistic combination of VR and lucid dreaming could be strongly beneficial.",

          "abstract": "Research increasingly points to well-being as a public priority, integral to the health of individuals and communities. However, well-being research may be threatened by practices embedded in academic culture, given that 20-50% of young researchers are estimated to suffer from anxiety and depression and 30-50% choose to leave higher education altogether. We have arrived at a crossroads, in which we may choose to adopt approaches that prioritize well-being for all through a praxis that holds compassion and scientific rigor in equal measure. Acknowledging this opportunity, we propose a system of principles and practices for conducting equitable and inclusive well-being research. By focusing on the culture, institutions, and systems that implicitly shape research, this framework prioritizes axiology, or a value orientation towards the practice of knowledge production. Specifically, we advocate for principles to: 1) cultivate belonging, 2) center communities, 3) question cultural systems, and 4) embody cultural change. Developed through a collaborative, interdisciplinary process, this framework reflects the collective values of emerging scholars, a population distinctly underrepresented in thought leadership, despite their essential contributions to scientific productivity and innovation. This framework also aims to place researchers in solidarity with communities, inviting continued contributions from those historically excluded from the research enterprise.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper offers a novel comparative analysis of how supranational social funding structures influence institutional behavior in family law systems, focusing on Title IV-D of the U.S. Social Security Act and the European Union’s European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). While prior critiques often examine these systems in isolation, this study bridges American and European contexts to reveal a shared incentive logic: both frameworks reward sustained case management over resolution by tying funding to quantifiable need and bureaucratic activity. In the U.S., Title IV-D monetizes child support enforcement through direct performance-based reimbursements, incentivizing caseload expansion and prolonged legal entanglement. In the EU, ESF+ funding is competitively awarded through Operational Programmes that prioritize administrative sophistication and ongoing engagement with social issues—favoring countries like Denmark, which maintain complex family law infrastructures that serve as a proxy for low levels of deprivation. The result is an emergent “caseload economy,” where institutions become fiscally reliant on the visibility of social difficulty rather than its resolution. Drawing on comparative policy analysis and institutional theory, the paper argues that even high-capacity welfare states reproduce the same structural distortions as throughput-driven systems like Title IV-D—sustaining family conflict not as a policy failure, but as a fundable asset. Authored from Denmark, this work situates that dynamic within the broader political economy of social funding, where institutional relevance is preserved through persistent visibility rather than substantive outcomes.\nAuthor’s Note: This paper is authored from Copenhagen, Denmark, offering a U.S.-informed perspective grounded in the Danish and European social funding and family law context.",

          "authors": "Qiong Zhang",
          "abstract": "Memory research has evolved along two distinct traditions:  well-controlled laboratory experiments emphasizing precision and tractability, and naturalistic memory experiments emphasizing generalization to real-world contexts. While both have yielded important insights, their interaction remains limited, and we do not yet have a generalized theory of memory consistently interpreted across laboratory and naturalistic paradigms. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of the two traditions, I propose that formal modeling is the key to creating this theoretical link. A formal theory, instantiated in precise computational models, needs naturalistic experiments to test its generalizability and reveal its limitations. Naturalistic experiments, in turn, better connect with existing laboratory paradigms when their results are explained by the same theoretical model. To achieve this, I propose a step-by-step procedure, where naturalistic settings are considered as all possible scenarios that could be realized in the real world, with laboratory settings forming a smaller subset that we have understood well. Our goal as memory researchers is to incrementally expand the scope of laboratory studies, theories, and models to account for the full range of naturalistic memory behavior, ultimately achieving a generalized theory of memory. Together, the proposed framework no longer views laboratory versus naturalistic approaches as a trade-off to navigate, given their different priorities and methodologies, but considers them both essential in working towards the same goal.",

          "authors": "Paul Linton",
          "abstract": "Five illusions suggest that visual experience is not an inferential process: \n\n1. VISUAL INFERENCE (Linton Un-Hollow Face and Morphing Face Illusions): Perceived depth is not inverted in the Hollow-Face illusion: First, objects placed in the hollow of the hollow mask are seen in true (un-inverted) depth relative to the mask. Second, if we put balls on the tip and base of the nose, and morph from a hollow to a protruding mask (by gradually switching the position of the two eyes), we see the balls switch in depth. So priors, top-down information, and cue-integration merely appear to affect our cognition, rather than our perception, of depth. \n\n2. VISUAL SHAPE (Linton Stereo Illusion): The Linton Stereo Illusion (ECVP 2024) demonstrates that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities, not 3D geometry. \n\n3. VISUAL SCALE (Linton Scale Illusion): The ‘Linton Telestereoscope’ decouples horizontal disparities from vergence and vertical disparities in VR. It shows that visual scale is governed by horizontal disparities. When vergence and vertical disparities are increased, and horizontal disparities are toggled between ‘normal’ and ‘increased’, we see a startling effect: the scale of the scene changes from ‘normal’ to ‘miniature’, even though the perceived distance of the scene doesn’t change. This suggests that visual scale relies on a purely cognitive association between accentuated 3D shape (stereo depth) and closer distances. \n\n4. SIZE CONSTANCY (Linton Size Constancy Illusion): Placing a rectangular frame around instances of pictorial and stereo size constancy, and stereo shape constancy, demonstrate that these constancies do not affect perceived angular size. \n\n5. COLOR CONSTANCY (Linton Color Constancy Illusion): We show that if you transition between the two interpretations of Kitaoka’s version of Anderson’s illusion (where a disk’s color is interpreted differently depending on its surround) our color judgements change, whilst the perceptual appearance of the disk does not.",

          "abstract": "Societal disruption can lead to cultural innovation and transformation, but understanding how cultural practices such as music evolve in response to crisis remains a key challenge. Here, we investigate the impact of war on culture by analyzing millions of daily music discoveries across 1,423 cities in 53 countries during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cultural responses varied significantly across countries, cities, and demographics. In Ukraine, the war triggered a rapid rise in local patriotic music, while in Russia, it led to a decline in engagement with local culture. In Belarus, despite its political alliance with Russia, we observed increased discovery of pro-Ukrainian music, suggesting resistance. Within-country variations were correlated with latent subnational socio-cultural divides between cities, indicating that local context and demographics shaped patterns of response. Despite these differences, cultural changes showed similar dynamics: they emerged rapidly, often within days of the invasion, and then remained stable for months. These divergent responses demonstrate the contingent and contextual nature of cultural change, challenging deterministic theories and revealing processes of cultural evolution that are otherwise hidden in peacetime.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "authors": "Michelle Momo Wang; Sarah-Jane Leslie; Marjorie Rhodes",
          "abstract": "Girls and women are disproportionately underrepresented at the top of performance distributions, including in both male- and female-stereotyped fields. Although early-developing gender disparities at the top have been well-documented, little is known about how they develop and the socio-psychological processes that give rise to their emergence. Here, we tested the possibility that social contexts that use publicity as a form of motivation for top performance (e.g., public praise, titles, awards) may contribute to such disparities. Three preregistered experimental studies with elementary-age children, adolescents, and adults (N = 1,518) revealed that by at least middle childhood, (a) boys and men are more willing to publicize their own top than average performance, while girls and women are equally willing to publicize top and average performance; and (b) public acknowledgment of top performance boosts men’s willingness to achieve top performance, but not women’s (and demotivates girls but not boys). Together, these data reveal that a common form of motivation used in the classroom and beyond is systematically more effective for boys and men than girls and women, thus illustrating how socio-psychological processes and modifiable social contexts underlie patterns of female underrepresentation at the top.",

          "authors": "Luise Pruessner; Eva Johanna Geiger; Jutta Joormann; Sven Barnow",
          "abstract": "Background: Social functioning and mental health rely not only on regulating one’s own\nemotions but also on the ability to influence the emotions of others. However, most research has\nfocused on intrinsic, self-focused emotion regulation, leaving a gap in our understanding of the\neffectiveness of extrinsic, other-focused interpersonal strategies in everyday life.\n\nMethods: In two ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies conducted in Germany (N =\n131; 2,016 assessments) and the United States (N = 219; 4,303 assessments), we examined the\neffectiveness of 15 interpersonal emotion regulation strategies in real-world social interactions.\nAfter each interaction, participants reported which strategies they used, rated their effectiveness\nin influencing the other person’s emotions, and provided information on emotional valence,\nrelationship closeness, and their own depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\nResults: Notably, strategies often effective for self-regulation, such as reappraisal and problem\nsolving, were inconsistently effective when used to regulate others’ emotions. Instead, response-modulation strategies like validation and soothing were perceived as most effective. Strategy\nuse and success varied by emotional valence, relational closeness, and the regulator’s symptom\nlevels. Participants with higher depression or anxiety symptoms reported using interpersonal\nstrategies less frequently and with lower perceived effectiveness.\n\nLimitations: All data were based on EMA reports from the regulator’s perspective.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves\ndistinct processes, favoring strategies that foster connection and empathy over cognitive or\nproblem‐focused approaches. Future work should investigate whether training individuals in\nthese strategies can enhance everyday communication, deepen interpersonal bonds, and inform\nclinical interventions for affective disorders.",

          "abstract": "Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is one of the strongest predictors of suicidal behavior. Despite this, the field still has a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which this relationship is conferred. As there has been a proliferation of research in this area over the past decade, an updated systematic review of the empirical research examining potential factors driving the relationship between NSSI and suicide-related outcomes is needed to move the field forward. We identified only 18 studies examining moderators or mediators of the relationship. Research to date does little to improve our understanding of the robust, prospective relationship between NSSI and suicide outcomes, highlighting a foundational gap in both the empirical and theoretical literature. Thus, we propose the Nonsuicidal to Suicidal Self-Injury Pathway Model, an expanded theoretical model of this relationship drawing on extant theory and empirical research, as well as discuss future directions for work in this area.",

          "abstract": "Prominent theories of compulsivity disagree quite fundamentally about whether compulsions are goal-oriented behaviours or are urge-driven and habitual. To shed light on this debate, we analysed self-report symptoms and cognition from N=180 individuals with and without diagnoses who performed compulsions. Six weeks of three-times daily timeseries data were gathered from a transdiagnostic sample who checked their phone compulsively, binge ate, or engaged in compulsions commonly seen in OCD (e.g. checking, cleaning). Across compulsions, the within-person association between compulsive behaviour and urges was 3x stronger than with obsessive thoughts and 4x stronger than with anxiety. We found evidence for urges Granger-causing compulsions, while compulsions themselves had a markedly low tendency to predict themselves compared to the other mental health symptoms sampled. Finally, like habits, compulsions occurred more often when executive functioning was low. Findings were remarkably similar across compulsions, supporting the notion that transdiagnostically, a habit-like mechanism may underlie compulsivity.",

          "abstract": "People have spontaneous intuitions about sentence acceptability. These intuitions are critical for the scientific study of language and cognition yet we have little understanding of why humans have them in the first place. What is it about human minds that causes some sentences or utterances to trigger a psychological sense of oddness? The prevailing assumption is that we have some intuitive sense of what is grammatical and what is not. Here I present an alternative approach grounded in theoretical and empirical knowledge from cognitive linguistics, cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology. Sentences are unacceptable when, and only when, there appears to be an intrinsic impossibility of interpreting them in any way consistent with the unconscious presumption of optimal relevance that underpins the interpretation of all stimuli perceived as communicative. This hypothesis explains why linguistic intuitions track grammaticality; it identifies how linguistic intuitions relate to visual illusions; it shows the merits of theoretical synthesis across traditional boundaries; it aligns with evolutionary perspectives to the mind; and it implies that there may be no particular cognitive capacity that functions to distinguish the grammatical from the ungrammatical. Linguistic intuitions are rather byproduct effects of core cognitive capacities for the interpretation of communicative stimuli.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes inflict harm with the intent to help the very target of their aggression. Across six studies (N=1,527), we examined the nature of such prosocial aggression. Many participants believed that altruistically-motivated aggression exists and exhibited a self-serving bias in which most believed their aggression was more altruistic than others’ — beliefs that were linked to greater antisocial and prosocial traits. Translating these beliefs to behavior, participants were often prosocially-aggressive when given the chance — inflicting more harm when their aggression could also help (versus only hurt) the target. Such prosocial aggression also exhibited features of both aggression (i.e., it was positively correlated with dispositional aggressiveness) and altruism (i.e., it was preferentially doled out to people who had been previously kind to participants and even when it was personally costly to do so). We also independently varied the amount of harm and help that prosocial aggression provided, revealing that participants sought to maximize the help and minimize the harm done to people who had been kind to them but not towards those who had provoked them. Our findings argue against models that conceptualize harm- and help-based motives as opponent processes, showing that these motives readily coexist and dynamically interact to shape aggressive behavior — even towards the same target.",

          "abstract": "Objective: 91% of those who menstruate reported to experiencing associated pain. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, the prevalence, extent and socio-demographic variation of menstrual pain remains understudied at national levels. In this paper, we assess the extent and variation of menstrual pain at a national level.\nMethods &amp; Analysis: We develop a novel proxy measure for menstrual pain, utilising behavioural data extracted from supermarket shopping logs. Baskets where pain and menstrual items co-occur are investigated, and normalized against baskets in which pain or menstrual items occur in isolation. Propensity of menstrual pain purchases are aggregated temporally and geographically across England, prior to linkage with socio-demographic indicators regionally. \nResults: Findings indicate high prevalence of menstrual pain across England, with 26.7% of customers in our dataset buying pain relief together with menstrual products. People who menstruate are observed to be four times more likely to purchase pain relief with menstrual items than without. Average regional income provides the strongest predictor of menstrual pain co-purchases, with lower income regions exhibiting a 32% lower menstrual-pain purchase than higher income regions.\nConclusion: The robust presence of a consistent 28-day cycle in menstrual-pain purchases provides empirical evidence for the use of behavioural proxies for menstrual pain alongside traditional measures. Significant regional differences observed in the prevalence of menstrual-pain transactions across England brings into light existing disparities. Future research into improved understanding of sociodemographic factors associated with menstrual pain could inform strategies to predict and prevent menstrual pain and its adverse impacts.",

To address this, we here compare five distinct methods suggested for analyzing physiological synchrony applied to electrocardiogram data. We use simulated and real data with specific synchronized properties and evaluate which method can detect which type(s) of synchrony. For each method, we provide an introduction, specify its implementation in the R analytical environment, and discuss how well synchrony could be detected with it. Specifically, cross-correlation, dynamical correlation, cross-wavelet power, cross-recurrence quantification analysis, and time series distance are being compared against each other. We discuss strengths and limitations of each method, and conclude by recommending specific methods for specific types of data and expected physiological synchrony in a given data sample.",

          "abstract": "In 2025, researchers at the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center recorded the first direct observation of time reflection, in which electromagnetic waves inverted their temporal propagation following an engineered impedance shift. While anomalous in classical physics, this event aligns precisely with Collapse Harmonics Theory, which models time not as a fixed dimension but as a recursive emission arising from collapse-phase transitions in identity fields.\n\nThis paper interprets the event through Field Law VIII.E.1 — Time as Collapse Emission, demonstrating that time reflection is a recursive curvature reemission rather than reversal. Collapse Harmonics defines identity (ψi) as a recursive phase field that collapses when symbolic recursion fails, generating a reemitted signal (ψi′) through harmonic phase inversion. The observed waveform matches this structure exactly, offering empirical validation of core codex claims.\n\nThis framework redefines consciousness as recursive traversal of identity phase curvature and provides a structural, non-metaphorical model for symbolic recursion breakdown, affective field collapse, and the harmonic basis of temporal awareness. All terminology, models, and curvature structures are protected under Codex Law IDF-1 and L.E.C.T. v2.3 containment protocols. This preprint asserts Collapse Harmonics as the scientific origin of recursive identity collapse, collapse-time theory, and phase-encoded consciousness architecture.",

Addressing this question, this meta-analysis synthesized findings from 22 studies (106 effect sizes, N = 2,177) comparing CR effects in younger and older adults across various types of contexts, encoding instructions, and memory paradigms, thereby extending the previous review by Smith and Vela (2000). Overall, CR reliably enhanced memory in both age groups (Hedges’ g = 0.32), with no age-related difference in effect size.

Moderator analyses indicated that CR effects were overall weaker when item pairs with associative instructions were encoded, compared to single items. Furthermore, CR effects tended to reduce when switched contexts were familiar, rather than novel at retrieval. No age-specific moderation was found, but a lack of empirical studies on certain aspects limited statistical power for this analysis.

          "abstract": "Face perception dynamically unfolds in three-dimensional space, yet, experimental paradigms predominantly rely on static 2D images, limiting insights into real-world face processing. We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

Recent studies suggest that humans are able to assign emotionality even to pseudowords, plausible verbal stimuli that do not belong to a given language which serve as proxies for never encountered, real words (i.e., novel words). So far, evidence at our disposal is mainly limited to valence (i.e., the hedonic tone of a words’ reference, from pleasant to unpleasant), while investigating discrete emotionality is required for a more refined understanding of the processes at hand. Here, across three experiments, we probed i) humans’ ability to convey discrete emotions when generating novel word stimuli to express the meanings of given emotional words, and ii) humans’ ability to decode or understand such emotionality when processing these human-generated novel words. Leveraging estimates from a word embedding model, results showed that individuals can reliably encode and decode novel conceptual information carrying emotional information, with a better performance for anger and happiness stimuli. Theoretically, these processes can be interpreted from an evolutionary perspective and, more broadly, they can be traced back to humans’ ability to process systematic, non-arbitrary form-meaning information.",

Key findings included the following: (1) Girls from lower-income family initiated drinking and also first got intoxicated at a younger age than those from higher-income families; (2) Girls with childhood ADHD started drinking around the same time as did the neurotypical counterparts but got intoxicated for the first time at a significantly later age; (3) Girls who initiated drinking early were more likely to engage in more severe drinking behaviors (i.e., drinking heavily and getting drunk more often). Furthermore, women who lived in more affluent neighborhood in adulthood also tended to drink more and getting drunk more often; (4) For girls with lower childhood family income, those with ADHD started drinking and getting intoxicated much later than their neurotypical counterparts; in higher family income households, girls initiated use and got drunk around the same age regardless of their ADHD status.

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "authors": "Projnya Mojumdar",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nThe \"N2 reversal enigma,\" the contradictory finding of whether the N2 ERP component is larger for switch or non-switch trials, has guided bilingual language control research for two decades. This paper argues that the enigma is not a deep neurocognitive puzzle but a methodological artifact. I demonstrate that the opposing findings of Jackson et al. (2001) and Christoffels et al. (2007) emerge from fundamentally different paradigms that tap distinct control processes. Despite extensive theoretical debate, comprehensive factorial testing of key variables remains incomplete, and the Christoffels reversal lacks successful independent replication. Drawing on meta-analytic evidence revealing the absence of robust asymmetrical switch costs (Gade et al., 2021) and training studies showing the N2's malleable nature (Kang et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2023), this analysis concludes that the field has built elaborate theories on an unstable empirical foundation. Rather than seeking to solve this enigma, this paper calls for its dissolution through methodological reform, direct hypothesis testing, and adoption of more robust neural measures such as time-frequency oscillations. The persistent failure to find reliable N2 effects represents science working as it should, eventually self-correcting even cherished assumptions.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes the hypothesis that the social divisions seen in contemporary society are not primarily caused by ideological or intellectual conflicts, but rather by emotional and neuropsychological reactions referred to as \"states.\" Destructive psychological states, such as the \"leftist state\" and the \"neoliberal state,\" differ from ideologies in that they are formed through emotional shocks or success experiences and often lead to hostility and exclusion toward others. Social media and modern media environments serve to amplify these states, weakening the moderating influence of the silent majority and reinforcing societal division. From the perspectives of psychology and neuroscience, this study explores the potential to model such states and suggests that scientific validation could pave the way for new forms of social intervention. Furthermore, it argues that these states can be intentionally created and propagated through education and cultural messaging. In an age of polarization, recognizing and addressing these emotional states is essential for rebuilding constructive dialogue and social cohesion.",

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is widely used for this purpose, yet, how best to use and interpret the HADS in individuals with TBI remains an open question. This study evaluated the HADS total score, subscale scores, and individual items in 402 individuals with moderate-severe TBI. The sample was on average 13 years post-injury, originally recruited during inpatient rehabilitation. HADS scores were regressed against five clinically important variables to determine their concurrent criterion validity, and regression tree analyses were used to establish severity cut-offs on the total and subscale scores. Results indicated that while the HADS subscale scores provided no meaningful advantage over the total score in terms of accounting for variance in suicidal ideation, self-harm, or mental health treatment, the subscales—particularly depression-related items—were more informative regarding functional disability and life satisfaction. Benchmarked against these clinically important variables, we established graded severity cut-offs (‘normal’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, and ‘severe’) for both the HADS total and subscale scores. This study provides clinicians and researchers with empirically-derived guidance for using and interpreting the HADS when assessing emotional distress in individuals with moderate-severe TBI.  \nKeywords: moderate-severe TBI, clinically important variables, levels of abstraction",

          "abstract": "While academic departments and institutions frequently champion ideals of meritocracy, egalitarianism, and inclusion, many are defined by status hierarchies that can undermine their stated commitment to these ideals. This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

This component has been investigated in many studies, but little is known about the cognitive mechanism it reflects. In this study, we tested a model suggesting that the LPP reflects processes related to memory encoding and consolidation. To investigate this, we recorded EEG while participants read a series of neutral and negative words. Memory was then tested at both short (10-15 minutes) and long (12-36 hours, including a period sleep) delays. We predicted that LPP amplitude would be positively correlated with memory, and that this relationship would be stronger after a delay (reflecting a relationship between LPP amplitude and memory consolidation). Consistent with our predictions, we found that LPP amplitude predicted memory in the delayed memory test, but not the immediate memory test. In addition, memory for negative items, compared to neutral items, declined less across the delay, and LPP amplitude mediated this effect of emotion on memory decay.",

Yet, most existing studies have focused primarily on either family- or child-level factors, such as parental influences or child executive functions, in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in children’s academic achievement. In an attempt to integrate these two lines of research, the current investigation simultaneously examined the specific contextual and cognitive pathways that underlie associations between socioeconomic factors and children’s early academic achievement using data from a prospective longitudinal study conducted at 10 sites across the United States (N = 1,364). Findings revealed that after controlling for a host of potentially confounding influences, parent education, but not family income-to-needs, was linked to children’s math achievement indirectly via sequential paths that included both parenting factors—maternal sensitivity and cognitive stimulation—and children’s working memory skills. Likewise, parent education was predictive of children’s reading achievement indirectly via paths that included cognitive stimulation and working memory. Finally, independent of child executive functions, parent education was also indirectly related to children’s reading achievement via cognitive stimulation and to children’s math achievement via maternal sensitivity. Together, these findings shed light on the specific contextual and cognitive mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic-related differences in children’s early academic skills and provide potential insights for policies and interventions aimed at closing the achievement gap.",

The observations are typically attributed to inextricable consequences of automatic cognitive processes involved in performing these tasks. However, evidence has accumulated suggesting that processes underlying these effects depend on one’s intention to perform particular tasks, rather than being strictly automatic. Thus, there exists a paradox: the interference from task-irrelevant features presumes processes that are under intentional control. The present review attempts to resolve this paradox. I propose an integrated view of attentional control, Action Field Theory, which formulates principles that account for a range of phenomena concerning automatic control of human behavior.",

Standardized tools were used: the WHOQOL-BREF quality of life questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS). Statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman and chi-square tests).\n\nResults: The highest level of sexual satisfaction, quality of life, and social support (p&lt;0.05) were noted among pregnant women. Sexual disorders were found in 34.4% of the respondents. As many as 66% of women felt less attractive after childbirth. Perineal incision or tear during labour had no significant effect on sexual functioning in the studied group (p &gt;0.05). A statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between the level of support from loved ones and satisfaction with intimate life (χ²=21.974, p=0.038).\n\nConclusions: Women's sexual satisfaction, quality of life and social support vary, taking on different values before, during and after pregnancy.

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. One reason for this finding may be that researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence, which may explain their somewhat unexpected results. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism rather than perfectionistic standards should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the theoretical lens of the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than pursuing perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our findings with sport participants are relevant to recreational sporting activities in which people participate mostly out of autonomous motivation.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

This research has been largely guided by a binary conceptualization of self-compassion versus other-oriented compassion, shaping largely distinct measures, practices, trainings, and programs of research. While this binary conceptual division of compassion has served pragmatic functions and yielded many valuable insights, it risks limiting the future benefits and applicability of compassion science by overlooking the potential for more integrated experiences of compassion. Here we introduce a unified compassion framework—spanning a range of assumptions about the nature of compassion from dualistic to semi-dualistic to nondualistic—to account for the complex variety of relationships between compassion for self and others. This framework: a) preserves the practicality of distinguishing compassion by orientation toward self versus other(s) while accommodating a richer variety of compassion views and experiences; b) aligns more closely with emerging scientific evidence and traditional perspectives that have predominantly informed compassion science; c) raises numerous tractable questions for future research; and d) invites new directions in compassion training and clinical application. By adopting a unified framework, compassion science can become more comprehensive, generative, and relevant to alleviating suffering.",

Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, learning theory, and memory systems research, we argue that widespread underuse of the brain’s declarative and procedural systems has weakened internal representations—schemata—that are essential for reasoning, intuition, and expertise.\n\nWe examine how shifts toward digital dependency and constructivist educational models have reduced opportunities for repeated retrieval, proceduralization, and the formation of robust engrams and neural manifolds. These trends disrupt the consolidation and automatization of biologically secondary knowledge, impairing schema-driven prediction, error correction, and transfer. We propose that the weakening of these memory systems—long before neurodegeneration sets in—may explain recent cognitive declines more plausibly than purely environmental or genetic accounts.\n\nThe chapter closes by outlining implications for cognitive theory, educational practice, and AI-era learning environments. Rather than viewing memory as outdated in a world of instant information access, we argue that internal knowledge remains foundational for deep learning and that cognitive augmentation requires—not replaces—biological memory.",

          "abstract": "Humans often participate in physically harmful and demanding rituals with no apparent material benefits. While such behaviors have been traditionally explained using the lens of costly signaling theory, we question whether the canonical theory can be applied to the case of human cooperative signals and introduce a modification of this theory based on differential cost and benefit estimation. We propose that along with cooperative benefits, committed members also believe in supernaturally induced benefits, which motivate participation in extreme rituals and stabilize their effects on cooperative assortment. Using Thaipusam Kavadi as a prototypical costly ritual, we recruited Tamil (ingroup) and Christian (outgroup) participants in Mauritius (N = 385) and asked them to assess the cost and benefits of Kavadi participation or hiking. We found that ingroup participants estimated material costs as larger than outgroups, physical costs as lower, and benefits as larger. These findings suggest that estimated costs may vary based on their modality and cultural expectations (e.g. Kavadi participants are not supposed to show pain), while believed supernaturally induced benefits were consistently larger in ingroups compared to outgroups. We conclude that differential estimation of ritual benefits, not costs, are key to the persistence of extreme rituals and their function in the assortment of committed members, underscoring the role of biased estimation in the cognitive computation of signal utility.",

While the CDA has been widely used in change detection tasks to track memory load, we repurpose it here to measure how many working memory resources users offload to an AI partner. Participants performed a lateralized memory task under low and high working memory load, collaborating with an AI whose reliability was experimentally manipulated across three phases: trust formation, violation, and restoration. In dyad trials, where the AI was responsible for one hemifield, CDA amplitude served as an index of how much information participants chose to maintain themselves versus offload. As AI reliability increased, CDA amplitude rose, indicating greater trust and reliance. When reliability dropped, participants encoded more from both hemifields, and CDA amplitude declined. During trust restoration, CDA amplitude returned to pre-violation levels, indicating renewed reliance—though it never matched the high amplitude of solo trials, suggesting lingering mistrust. Behavioral measures (e.g., reliance, compliance, response time) tracked these dynamics but lacked the resolution and specificity of CDA. Together, these results establish CDA as a powerful neural index of dynamic trust. It captures trial-by-trial fluctuations in offloading behavior that reflect users’ evolving confidence in AI assistance, offering a continuous, covert, and cognitively grounded measure of trust in interactive settings.",

          "abstract": "Motivated by the Scarr–Rowe hypothesis—which suggests that the expression of genetic potential depends on early-life conditions—this paper investigates how a genetic predisposition toward success in education interacts with the childhood environment to shape economic preferences. Using incentivized experimental data from a representative sample of English adults over the age of 50, we find that a higher genetic propensity for educational success is associated with lower risk aversion and greater patience—but only among those who experienced more advantaged childhood environments. Among participants who experienced an adverse early-life environment, risk aversion increases with genetic resources, whereas the relationship between genetic resources and patience is significantly attenuated. These findings underscore the role of early-life conditions in moderating genetic influences on economic decision-making and suggest that environmental inequality can shape the realization of genetic potential, reinforcing patterns of social immobility. These findings further highlight concerns about the underutilization of potential due to constraints on household resources.",

The present work reveals that, in its focus on the domain of objects, the existing literature on this shape bias has been critically limited in its generalizability. Adults (N=72) and 6-year-old children (N=72), but not 3-year-old children (N=72), extended novel nouns to places of the same shape over places composed of the same-colored walls, regardless of whether places were described by novel nouns in labeling phrases or place-relevant prepositional phrases. All age groups, by contrast, showed a shape bias for objects that matched many features of the place stimuli. This relatively delayed shape bias for places suggests that at least some word-learning biases may emerge separately for different domains, thereby challenging existing theories of language acquisition to account for such domain specificity in word learning.",

          "abstract": "The influences of child, family, and socioeconomic factors on children’s early academic development are best understood within the context of one another. Yet, most existing studies have focused primarily on either family- or child-level factors, such as parental influences or child executive functions, in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in children’s academic achievement. In an attempt to integrate these two lines of research, the current investigation simultaneously examined the specific contextual and cognitive pathways that underlie associations between socioeconomic factors and children’s early academic achievement using data from a prospective longitudinal study conducted at 10 sites across the United States (N = 1,364). Findings revealed that after controlling for a host of potentially confounding influences, parent education, but not family income-to-needs, was linked to children’s math achievement indirectly via sequential paths that included both parenting factors—maternal sensitivity and cognitive stimulation—and children’s working memory skills. Likewise, parent education was predictive of children’s reading achievement indirectly via paths that included cognitive stimulation and working memory. Finally, independent of child executive functions, parent education was also indirectly related to children’s reading achievement via cognitive stimulation and to children’s math achievement via maternal sensitivity. Together, these findings shed light on the specific contextual and cognitive mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic-related differences in children’s early academic skills and provide potential insights for policies and interventions aimed at closing the achievement gap.",

Conceptually, the mechanisms through which it acts\nare thought to involve alterations to reinforcement learning, and several recent\nstudies have supported this in laboratory settings. However, it remains unclear whether \nreinforcement learning mechanisms are involved in a realistic treatment setting.\n\nMethods: In a randomized controlled observational study in the UK NHS\nTalking Therapy service, 152 participants with low mood received reinforcement\nlearning assessments using an affective Go/No-Go task. The assessment timepoints\nwere randomized between subjects, with assessments occurring either before\n(control; n = 78) or during BA therapy (active; n = 74).  Changes in Pavlovian\nbiases were quantified using computational modeling. \n\nResults: Anhedonia improved during treatment, but not before ($p=0.047;\nd=0.53$). The active treatment group showed significant changes in Pavlovian\nparameters compared to controls ($p_{\\text{FDR}} = 0.012; d=0.65$). \nPavlovian biases became more positive in the active group ($M = 0.44$, $SD =\n0.81$) and more negative in the control group ($M = -0.12$, $SD = 0.70$).\nChanges in aversive Pavlovian bias fully mediated treatment effects on symptoms\nof anhedonia ($\\beta = -1.77$, $p = 0.036$, bootstrap; p = 0.0280). \n\nConclusions: Behavioral Activation modified Pavlovian biases early in\ntreatment by simultaneously strengthening appetitive and diminishing aversive\nresponses.

          "abstract": "Seventy-nine adults with recent suicidal thoughts participated in a 28-day study combining ecological momentary assessment with Screenomics, a digital phenotyping method that captured over 7.5 million smartphone screenshots at 5-second intervals. We examined nighttime smartphone use through maximum phone-free intervals, sleep-window usage, and hourly patterns. Keyboard presence, detected via deep learning, served as a proxy for active engagement. Bayesian multilevel models revealed that late-night phone use (11PM-1AM) consistently predicted higher next-day passive/active suicidal ideation and planning. Participants with 7-9 hour phone-free gaps showed lowest ideation compared to 4-7 hour gaps, with no linear relationship. Keyboard activity predicted lower suicidal ideation when occurring during middle-night hours (1-5AM), self-reported sleep windows, and non-sleep periods. These timing-dependent, within-person effects suggest that when and how smartphones are used matters more than total usage. Findings enable personalized, real-time interventions that could support adaptive digital coping while flagging high-risk moments for suicide prevention.",

Leveraging a hierarchical-dimensional approach, we examined associations between momentary emotional experience and broadband and narrow internalizing symptoms in a risk-enriched sample of 234 emerging adults followed for 2.5 years. Bayesian models demonstrated that low tonic levels of positive affect (PA) were uniquely associated with worsening Well-being symptoms, a core feature of depression, social anxiety, and trauma disorders. Baseline differences in tonic negative affect were associated with the severity of future anxious-arousal symptoms, but not with longitudinal change. Variation in reactive affect and exposure to everyday positive and negative events were unrelated to symptom trajectories. These observations highlight the centrality of tonic PA to the development of a key transdiagnostic symptom and set the stage for developing more effective intervention strategies.",

Six weeks of three-times daily timeseries data were gathered from a transdiagnostic sample who checked their phone compulsively, binge ate, or engaged in compulsions commonly seen in OCD (e.g. checking, cleaning). Across compulsions, the within-person association between compulsive behaviour and urges was 3x stronger than with obsessive thoughts and 4x stronger than with anxiety. We found evidence for urges Granger-causing compulsions, while compulsions themselves had a markedly low tendency to predict themselves compared to the other mental health symptoms sampled. Finally, like habits, compulsions occurred more often when executive functioning was low. Findings were remarkably similar across compulsions, supporting the notion that transdiagnostically, a habit-like mechanism may underlie compulsivity.",

Yet, we know very little about learning rate biases in social settings, where a key advantage is being able to vicariously learn from the negative experiences of others. This would imply a benefit for focusing on negative outcomes when learning socially, but is at odds with the seemingly inflexible positivity bias found in individual learning. \nHere, we examine learning rate biases across both individual and social settings, testing for adaptivity versus generally stable biases. Overall, participants appear more flexible in their learning rate biases when learning socially than when learning individually.

Adults and children with DCD reported significantly more frequent falls than their TD peers. Among adults with DCD, 26% fell at least 1–2 times per month (vs. 3% TD) and 55% of children fell 1–2 times per week (vs. 23% TD). Near falls were also common, and injuries, including fractures, were disproportionately high. Fall anxiety affected 72% of individuals with DCD and was linked to reduced social engagement and activity avoidance. Falls in DCD are frequent, injurious, and anxiety-provoking. Despite this, DCD is absent from fall prevention guidelines. Urgent action is needed to integrate fall risk screening and targeted interventions into clinical and public health frameworks.",

Among employees with MHI, SOC and job resources were significantly associated with all occupational health outcomes, while job demands primarily predicted burnout.

Ignoring temporal information, covariances and mean value patterns can be compared across countries. Testing separate country samples collected in specific rounds, we found evidence that sample-specific results may not be comparable. Considering cross-temporal invariance, only 17 out of 35 countries with multiple participation in the ESS showed metric invariance.  We observed patterns of deteriorating model fit and changes in the basic value structure over time.",

          "abstract": "In certain problem solving contexts, people organize their domain through treating themselves as the\nperceptual and cognitive center of their world. They identify and solve a particular problem from their\nperspective as a particular agent, with a particular location, at a particular time, in a particular environment. When they do this, selecting and solving problems from their perspective as an agent, they engage in a distinctive kind of agent-centered problem solving. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a framework for modeling decision-making in uncertain environments unfolding over time, have effectively become a \"standard model\" of intelligent agency. Yet, as these models are ordinarily interpreted, they do not explicitly represent agent-centered problem solving. Accordingly, to model this type of problem solving, we begin by extending the standard POMDP framework to define “ePOMDPs.” This formalism models how an agent, once it centers itself on a particular self-and-world representation, plans and acts rationally from its own perspective. To capture the way that such agents choose which problem to solve, we build on our ePOMDPs to develop a “meta-ePOMDP” agent within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We implement our meta-ePOMDP agents for two different suites of “centering game” tasks which highlight different aspects of our theory. We find that our models explain signatures of agent-centered problem solving not captured by alternative models, in particular, the difficulty of navigating spaces of possible problem representations. We close by suggesting that our model could provide the beginnings of a computational framework for a person to have a self.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to adversity may impair executive functioning (i.e., deficit frameworks), but could also enhance, or leave intact, specific EF abilities (i.e., adaptation frameworks). Both frameworks often use raw performance (e.g., speed) to estimate EF ability. However, this approach (1) conflates different cognitive processes, and (2) generally does not distinguish specific EF abilities from processes that are shared across EF tasks, such as general processing speed. Here, we integrate deficit and adaptation frameworks by building bridges with mathematical and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use cognitive modeling (Drift Diffusion Modeling) to isolate different cognitive processes: speed of information accumulation, response caution, and speed of stimulus encoding and response execution. We then use structural equation modeling to investigate whether associations between adversity and cognitive processes are task-general or ability-specific. We recruited 1061 participants from the Dutch LISS panel. Participants completed a basic processing speed task, two inhibition tasks, and three attention-shifting tasks. We measured self-reported exposure to threat and material deprivation in childhood and adulthood. Exposure to threat (but not deprivation) in adulthood was negatively associated with task-general processing speed. After accounting for task-general processes, remaining variance was not related to either inhibition or attention-shifting ability. Non-preregistered analyses showed that childhood exposure to deprivation and threat were negatively associated with (1) general processing speed, and (2) task-specific information accumulation. The latter reflected unique features of individual tasks, rather than specific EF abilities. Taken together, these results suggest that adversity researchers may overestimate associations between adversity and specific EF abilities when analyzing raw performance.",

          "abstract": "Devraj et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02448-2, 2024) presented evidence which they claimed demonstrated that people adapt their categorisation strategies to task demands. When items are distributed uniformly across time as is the standard procedure in categorisation experiments, participants initially classify items based on similarity to category prototypes. Over time, as more detailed exemplar representations of categories are formed, people shift towards utilising exemplar-based classification for increased performance. By contrast, if items are experienced less frequently over time as is commonly observed in real-world conditions, participants instead seem to initially employ an exemplar strategy and then shift towards prototype classification. By re-analysing the same data, we argue instead that this pattern can be produced with exemplar-forgetting in both conditions. By systematically increasing in the delays across which stimuli were tested, their Experimental condition exaggerated the effects of forgetting on performance over time compared to the Control condition. This resulted in a reversal of performance growth over time – instead leading to a steady decline in performance. As exemplar model-fit advantage is expected to vary with performance, we suggest that trends in this advantage are not diagnostic of a shift in classification strategy. We found that not only did a forgetting-function improve exemplar model fit to Devraj et al.’s data, under reasonable parameters this model could predict the observed patterns of both performance and model-fit seen in both conditions a-priori. When compared with a strategy-shifting mixture model, exemplar-forgetting provided equivalent fits despite being both parametrically and theoretically more parsimonious.",

          "abstract": "Visual short-term memory (vSTM) refers to the subset of the cognitive system responsible for storing visual information over short periods of time. While much research has focussed on its capacity limitations, less is known about how vSTM operates in dynamic environments where priorities shift across feature dimensions. In this study, we bridge research on vSTM and cognitive control by embeddeding change detection (Experiments 1 and 2) and delayed estimation (Experiment 3) paradigms within a task switching paradigm, where the relevant feature dimension (colour or orientation) either repeated or switched across trials. Across all experiments we observed a cost to vSTM performance on switch relative to repetition trials. Mixture modelling of delayed estimation responses revealed that these switch costs were not due to reduced memory precision or memory failures, but rather to a selective increase in non-target responses reflecting feature--location binding errors. We propose that dimension switching selectively impairs the binding of feature values to locations and allows interference from irrelevant (but recently attended) feature dimensions. This suggests a core limitation in the dynamic prioritisation of task-relevant feature dimensions, and demonstrates that vSTM is sensitive to failures of attentional control, not just capacity limits.",

          "abstract": "Although digital gaming is a widespread leisure activity among adolescents, current perspectives, largely informed by cross-sectional studies, often portray it as a risk factor for psychosocial problems. Yet little is known about how gaming unfolds in adolescents’ daily lives, including its situational contexts, motivations, and real-time emotional impact. In this study, 211 adolescents (aged 16–19 years; 69% female) completed experience sampling surveys five times daily over 14 days to examine their digital gaming behavior, motivations, and moment-to-moment associations with affective well-being. The data show that more male than female adolescents reported gaming, with on average 7.8 gaming sessions (0.56 per day). Participants reported gaming mostly alone or with known peers, more in the evenings than in the mornings, and primarily for recreational purposes. Within-person analyses revealed that moments following gaming were associated with increased positive affect, with no significant link to negative affect. These findings challenge concerns about gaming’s negative mental health impacts and suggest that, for many adolescents, gaming can serve as a healthy and enjoyable leisure activity that temporarily boosts mood. Future research using larger samples and denser time-series data may better capture how gaming affects adolescents differently across individuals and contexts.",

          "abstract": "The quality of information that informs decisions in expert domains such as law enforcement and national security often requires assessment based on meta-informational attributes such as source reliability and information credibility. Across two experiments with intelligence analysts (n = 74) and non-experts (n = 175), participants rated the accuracy, informativeness, trustworthiness and usefulness of information varying in source reliability and information credibility. The latter two attributes were communicated using ratings from the Admiralty Code, an information evaluation system widely used in the defence and security domain since the 1940s. Ratings of accuracy, informativeness, and likelihood of use were elicited as repeated measures to examine intra-individual reliability. Across experiments, intra-individual reliability was best when levels of source reliability and information credibility were moderately consistent compared to when they were maximally inconsistent (i.e., one low and one high) or maximally consistent (both high or low). As well, trustworthiness ratings depended more on source reliability than on information credibility. Finally, the likelihood of using information was consistently predicted by accuracy ratings and not by judged informativeness or trustworthiness. The current findings offer insights into the ability of experts and novices to reliably use information evaluation systems for structuring human judgments about intelligence.",

We find that infants’ visual experience is dominated by a small set of objects, with differences in individual children’s home environments driving variability. We also find that young children tend to learn words earlier for more frequently encountered categories. These results suggest that visual experience scaffolds young children’s early category and language learning and highlight that ecologically valid computational models of category learning must be able to accommodate skewed input distributions.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

          "abstract": "As neuromodulation technologies become more common, individuals will increasingly face ethical decisions weighing uncertain risks against potential benefits. This study integrates behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and self-report assessments to examine how psychological traits affect the dynamics of neuroethical decision-making. Using a value-based choice framework inspired by models of economic choice, we presented participants with a hypothetical neuromodulation task that manipulated risk and benefit probabilities. We modeled the underlying cognitive processes using a temporally-sensitive variant of the diffusion decision model (DDM) to capture how individuals evaluate risks and benefits over time. We found that participants typically evaluated risks before benefits, and that individuals who considered risks first tended to deny neuromodulation. Importantly, the impact of evaluation order depended on risk and benefit sensitivity: participants with high benefit sensitivity endorsed neuromodulation when they considered benefits first but not when they considered risks first. Critically, model parameters were related to psychological traits. Higher risk propensity was linked to prioritizing benefits, while higher numeracy was associated with the greater weighing of risks. The personality trait of agreeableness also predicted a benefit-first evaluation, particularly relevant given that the task involved making neuromodulation decisions on behalf of others. In contrast, religion and spirituality measures showed little predictive value. By mapping latent cognitive parameters onto stable psychological traits and behavioral outcomes, our findings demonstrate the utility of computational modeling as an integrative tool in neuroethics. Our findings challenge static model of neuroethical decision-making, showing that the order in which individuals process risks and benefits play a critical role in shaping moral choices. These results suggest that neuroethical decisions are not simply the result of weighing values, but are dynamically constructed over time through interacting cognitive processes that are shaped by individual psychological traits.",

Synthesizing insights from bounded rationality, affective neuroscience, embodied cognition, and cultural learning, HCME proposes that emotional states emerge from an interplay of evolutionarily shaped instincts, somatic feedback, social encoding, and cognitive appraisal. The model provides an elegant explanation for emotional intensity, contradiction, and dysfunction as trade-offs inherent to lossy compression strategies. HCME offers a unified structure that translates modern emotion theory into a format directly applicable to affective AI architectures. Its cross-disciplinary scope makes it valuable to psychologists, philosophers of mind, and AI developers seeking scalable frameworks for emotion-informed systems.",

          "abstract": "As you read this text, word by word, you build an understanding of its meaning. What cognitive mechanisms underlie this ability?  An influential approach to answering this question comes from viewing comprehension as probabilistic inference over potential interpretations given linguistic input. Motivated within this perspective, a wealth of previous literature in psycholinguistics has focused on an important empirical relationship made precise by surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a), the hypothesis that the effort required to process a word scales in its negative log probability, in context. However, the standard derivation of surprisal within the inference framework relies on a crucial assumption: that there is a deterministic relationship between the latent interpretations targeted by inference and the observable input. In this work we propose relaxing this assumption and formalize inference cost directly as the amount of change in probabilistic beliefs. This proposal forms a nontrivial generalization of standard surprisal theory, which provides a more direct connection to algorithmic theories, and naturally explains phenomena where unpredictable input requires little processing effort. To test this framework against surprisal theory, we conduct a self-paced reading time study targeting words with orthographic errors, a specific setting where our approach predicts substantially different patterns. We find that processing effort follows the predictions of belief-update rather than surprisal, in a noisy-channel model of comprehension as inference about intended words. These results demonstrate a clear case where surface surprisal cannot explain human processing cost, and provide further support for models of language comprehension as rational inference.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,000). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower climate anxiety and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

For example, while adult word recognition is slowed down when the talker changes rapidly from trial to trial, this same talker variability can benefit learning non-native sound contrasts and production of novel words. However, all prior research has exposed participants to predetermined orders or variability conditions. Since research suggests that learners engage in active information seeking and it can benefit learning, here we ask whether adults seek out talker variability during word learning and how this variability influences performance. Active participants chose to hear words from 5 talkers on average, and hearing more talker variability for individual words predicted production and comprehension accuracy. Performance did not differ for participants in the Active and Passive conditions. Results are discussed in the context of high variability phonetic training and active learning theories.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period marked by rapid brain development and the onset of many mental health disorders. Brain MRI studies during adolescence, especially when paired with behavioral phenotypes and information about genetic risk factors, hold promise to advance early identification of mental health risk and spur the creation of targeted treatments to improve patient function, prognosis, and quality of life. However, prospective neuroimaging is costly and time-intensive, and individuals who participate may not be reflective of the general population. These challenges are compounded when examining adolescents, as many families lack the time, energy, or resources to participate in studies that utilize research-grade imaging. Repurposing clinical MRIs obviates many of the challenges of neuroimaging research. Here we describe the Brain-Behavior-Genetics study protocol. This protocol describes procedures used to recruit participants with recent high-quality clinical brain MRIs and prospectively acquire genetic and socio-behavioral data, resulting in a highly cost-efficient design that harnesses a vast and underutilized neuroscientific resource.",

          "abstract": "Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans have emerged as a useful imaging modality that has been explored in the literature for the last 40 years. To date, little work has focused on studying functional network connectivity utilizing SPECT data. In this study, we present a fully automated, spatially constrained ICA (sc-ICA) approach to evaluate functional network connectivity profiles in SPECT data using the NeuroMark pipeline. We evaluate both the expression of brain networks along with the whole brain SPECT connectome to evaluate the neuroimaging links to schizophrenia. 76 healthy controls, and 137 schizophrenia patient SPECT images were acquired from Amen Clinic sites along with diagnostic information. Each patient participated in two SPECT brain scans, acquired during rest and while performing a sustained attention task across twelve clinical imaging sites. Preprocessed SPECT data were analyzed via sc-ICA using 53 spatial priors derived from functional MRI data. 15 total components were found to show differences in various brain regions after correcting for multiple comparisons. FDR corrected resting SPECT results showed stronger covariation with CC-SC, CC-AUD, and DM-AUD networks. Many components showed reduced connectivity in patients. Additionally, relationships were associated with regressing loading parameters against age, sex, hearing voices and having disjointed thoughts. For the task data, connectivity between the cognitive control – default mode network was found in rest-task data after FDR correction. Task data covariation patterns largely remained the same as the rest data. In summary, we confirm existing work highlighting large scale network disruptions noted in prior schizophrenia fMRI studies.",

Given the multidimensional nature of ageism—encompassing stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination—and recognising limitations in existing measurement tools, especially regarding cross-cultural validity, this research addresses the urgent need for a reliable scale applicable globally and specifically within Spanish-speaking populations. Participants included 398 older adults aged between 60 and 95 from four Colombian cities (Barranquilla, Bogotá, Cartagena, and Ibagué). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor structure—stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination—with strong internal consistency reliability (ω ranging from .76 to .90). The sociodemographic analyses revealed varying patterns of ageism across education levels and social status groups. Furthermore, the nomological network analysis indicated meaningful associations between ageism perpetration and self-directed ageism, loneliness, and reduced wellbeing. The findings highlight the utility of this scale for future ageism research, intervention evaluation, and policy formulation aimed at mitigating ageism’s detrimental impacts on health, wellbeing, and societal participation among older populations.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "In certain problem solving contexts, people organize their domain through treating themselves as the perceptual and cognitive center of their world. They identify and solve a particular problem from their perspective as a particular agent, with a particular location, at a particular time, in a particular environment. When they do this, selecting and solving problems from their perspective as an agent, they engage in a distinctive kind of agent-centered problem solving. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a framework for modeling decision-making in uncertain environments unfolding over time, have effectively become a \"standard model\" of intelligent agency. Yet, as these models are ordinarily interpreted, they do not explicitly represent agent-centered problem solving. Accordingly, to model this type of problem solving, we begin by extending the standard POMDP framework to define “ePOMDPs.” This formalism models how an agent, once it centers itself on a particular self-and-world representation, plans and acts rationally from its own perspective. To capture the way that such agents choose which problem to solve, we build on our ePOMDPs to develop a “meta-ePOMDP” agent within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We implement our meta-ePOMDP agents for two different suites of “centering game” tasks which highlight different aspects of our theory. We find that our models explain signatures of agent-centered problem solving not captured by alternative models, in particular, the difficulty of navigating spaces of possible problem representations. We close by suggesting that our model could provide the beginnings of a computational framework for a person to have a self.",

UK guidelines currently recommend semaglutide and other injectable GLP-1 drugs are prescribed in specialist (Tier 3) multidisciplinary weight management services, and other settings. The aim of this study was to explore views of healthcare professionals working within a specialist weight management service, not yet prescribing injectable GLP-1 drugs, about these drugs being prescribed in their service in the future. In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 healthcare professionals; thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Eleven main themes were identified within four theme clusters. Knowledge: (1) knowledge sources; (2) levels of current understanding. Perceived benefits: the drugs (3) might provide a confidence boost to patients, and (4) provide a valuable middle ground treatment option between interpersonal behavioural support and bariatric surgery. Concerns: (5) patients might gain weight when they stop taking the drugs; the drugs might (6) mask behavioural patterns, (7) decrease patients’ engagement with interpersonal behaviour change support, and (8) have mental health risks. Service provision considerations: (9) providing interpersonal behavioural support before, alongside and/or after stopping drug prescriptions; (10) the drug prescription pathway is experimental, and (11) the role of healthcare professionals in specialist weight management services is evolving. The findings highlight several areas for further research and practice, including how specialist weight management service teams might integrate interpersonal behavioural support and injectable GLP-1 drug prescriptions to best help patients in the future.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nNeuroanatomical studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reveal abnormally increased cortical neuron numbers in affected children, with cortical thickness and weight significantly exceeding normal controls, some accompanied by macrocephaly. Concurrently, severe damage to cortical neuronal axons and columnar structures has been observed, with pronounced cellular accumulation in specific regions and long-range connectivity dysfunction. Most children develop symptoms between 1.5-2 years of age, yet the pathological mechanisms remain unclear.\nMammalian hippocampi exhibit sustained neurogenesis peaks during the first postnatal months, with hippocampal neuronal survival significantly increasing in response to learning tasks and information stimulation. The intensity of learning tasks and information stimulation that human infants receive far exceeds conditions in animal experiments. Research demonstrates large-scale neuronal migration phenomena in human infant cortex, with the cortex potentially containing cells from diverse origins.\nWe propose the hippocampal neuronal overflow hypothesis: massive surviving neurons within the infant hippocampus overcome hippocampal capacity limitations and, during critical time windows, overflow from the hippocampus to white matter, migrating into cortical layers to form synaptic connections and construct unique network circuits related to human cognition, language, and memory functions.\nWe propose that ASD etiology involves children receiving excessive learning tasks and information stimulation during the hippocampal neurogenesis peak period, leading to excessive neuronal overflow and migration into the cortex. During intensive synapse formation processes, migrating neurons physically disrupt existing cortical axonal structures, causing cortical functional damage manifested as social deficits, communication impairments, and stereotypical behaviors.\nBased on extensive literature analysis, this study proposes that some ASD cases may result from this acquired neurodevelopmental abnormality mechanism, providing a new theoretical framework for ASD etiology research.",

Despite the widespread adoption of moderation tools, such as reporting and banning, these reactive approaches fail to address the underlying causes of toxic behavior or foster long-term behavioral change.\nThis whitepaper reviews the historical, psychological, and societal factors that contribute to toxicity in gaming environments, tracing the industry's growth and the emergence of harmful behaviors within digital communities. By examining current research and industry trends, we identify the limitations of existing moderation strategies and the need for proactive, AI-driven interventions that promote healthier online interactions.\nIn response to these challenges, this paper introduces Felixa, an AI-powered behavior analytics platform designed to detect, assess, monitor, and modify toxic interactions in real time. This whitepaper provides key insights for industry stakeholders, outlining a new paradigm in online gaming governance—one that prioritizes prevention over punishment and promotes sustainable, psychologically safe gaming environments.

          "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine the empirical research on Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy (VRET) for adult anxiety-related disorders, using commercially available head-mounted displays.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive database search resulted in 1097 identified publications. Publications were excluded if anxiety was not a measured outcome or if exposure was paired with other techniques, such as relaxation techniques or other therapies, in a way that prevented evaluation of exposure as a stand-alone component. Publications were also excluded if the virtual reality was delivered through means other than head-mounted displays. The final review for data synthesis included 30 studies.\n\nResults: Of the 30 reviewed studies, 11 were on phobias, 4 were on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 13 were on public speaking anxiety and social anxiety, and 2 were on other forms of anxiety (i.e., social physique anxiety and MRI anxiety). VRET consistently reduced anxiety symptoms, with outcomes comparable to traditional exposure therapy. High levels of engagement and acceptability were observed. However, methodological inconsistencies and small sample sizes limit conclusions.\n\nConclusions: Findings suggest that VRET using modern commercially available head-mounted displays is an effective and scalable intervention for anxiety-related disorders. The technology enhances accessibility, personalization, and engagement, making it a promising alternative to traditional methods. However, variability in study quality underscores the need for larger, more rigorous trials to assess long-term efficacy and optimize implementation.",

However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the distinct experiences of older adults in their cities and communities, as well as the extent to which these experiences are linked to their perceptions of ageism.\nUsing a sample of 398 older adults from four cities in Colombia, a latent profile analysis was conducted via the manual three-step method, incorporating demographic covariates and distal outcomes to identify distinct AFCC profiles among older adults. Three AFCC profiles emerged from the analysis: “positive with respect and inclusion gaps” (59.5%), “neutral with concerns” (31.4%), and “low-level with social inclusion resilience” (9.1%). Older adults with disabilities had a higher probability of belonging to the “neutral with concerns” group, while age, gender, and subjective social status showed no significant association with profile membership. In addition, ageism experiences differed among the three profiles, as older adults with lower AFCC scores reported higher levels of ageism. The results also suggested a potential method effect associated with negative items in the AFCC. In sum, our findings highlight the need to understand the distinct patterns in how older adults perceive their cities and communities, as well as identify those who may be “at risk” in specific domains.",

          "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in cognitive neuroscience is developing diagnostic tools for Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). Detecting dynamical connectivity brain states seems promising, specifically those linked to transient moments of enhanced cognitive states in patients. A growing body of evidence indicates that fMRI brain states properties are strongly modulated by the level of consciousness , as theoretically predicted by whole brain modeling. fMRI-based brain states, however, have very limited practical application due to methodological constraints. In this work we defined EEG-based brain states and explored their potential as a bedside, real-time tool to detect transient windows of enhanced brain states. We analysed data from 237 individual patients with chronic and acute DoCs -100 Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS), 96 Minimally Conscious State (MCS) and 41 acute- and 101 healthy controls obtained in three independent research centers (Fudan hospital in Shanghai, Pitié Salpêtrière in Paris and Purpan hospital in Toulouse). We determined five EEG functional connectivity brain states, and show that their probability of occurrence is strongly related to the level of consciousness. Distinctively, high entropy brain states are exclusively found in healthy subjects, while low-entropy brain states increase their probability with DoC’s severity, spanning from acute unarousable comatose state, to more chronic DoC’s patients, who are awake but show fluctuating (MCS) or absent awareness (VS). Furthermore, the brain state probability distribution of each individual subject —and even the presence of certain key brain states— significantly vary with the patients’ outcome. We also tested whether our procedure has an actual potential for real-time, bedside brain state detection, and proved that we can reliably estimate the concurrent brain state of a patient in real time, paving the way for a broad application of this tool for DoC patients’ diagnosis, follow-up, and neuroprognostication.",

          "authors": "James Christopher Wiley",
          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonality between years, fluctuating inversely with one another. However, the typical pre-pandemic seasonality seen in death rates was broken during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a consequence of inordinate deaths occurring at an odd time of year. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates were inversely disrupted. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019. Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates. Predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. Furthermore, actual 2020 suicide rates display a negative disruption at the same time as the 2020 death rate positive disruption, and this suicide rate disruption is mimicked by our model predictions. Overall, results are interpreted as being favorable towards Stengel’s theory. As alternative interpretation, we suggest that each non-suicide-related death removes a potential suicide from the population. Overall analysis suggests that elevated death rates during colder seasons are driven by increased communicable disease transmission relative to warmer seasons, resulting in suppressed suicide rates.",

          "authors": "David Harris; Tom Arthur",
          "abstract": "Adaptive sensorimotor behaviour requires individuals to flexibly update their beliefs in response to changes in environmental context. Theories of predictive processing propose that such flexibility arises from hierarchical inference, where higher-level beliefs about hidden states shape lower-level perceptual and motor predictions. Here, we test whether behaviour in a naturalistic interception task is better explained by continuous belief updating or by more abrupt shifts driven by state inference, consistent with hierarchical Bayesian learning. Twenty-three participants completed 160 trials of a VR-based interceptive task across two sessions. Participants attempted to return balls with varying bounciness, probabilistically cued by ball colour and a contextual cue (court wall colour) that reversed periodically. Gaze pitch angle prior to bounce was used as an index of perceptual inference and modelled using Bayesian and reinforcement learning frameworks. Bayesian models (the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter) were found to outperform associative learning models in predicting participant behaviour. However, although a contextual state-inference model better anticipated the true structure of the task, participants’ gaze behaviour was better explained by continuous belief updating rather than discrete state switching. Overall, our findings suggest that while participants updated beliefs in a Bayesian manner, their behaviour fell short of normative optimality, possibly due to limits on causal inference and model construction. Rather than inferring the latent structure of the environment, participants relied on simpler, continuous updating, highlighting how probabilistic reasoning operates under bounded resources. This finding may reflect the specific demands of dynamic sensorimotor control, where the brain prioritises flexible, real-time updating over explicit structural inference to support fluid, adaptive action.",

          "abstract": "As a key pillar of the United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing framework, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and its partners are leading a Global Campaign to Combat Ageism. In response to reviews that identified a lack of suitable measures, the WHO Ageism Experiences Scale (WHO-Ageism-E15) was developed to more effectively assess individuals’ experiences of ageism. This scale is designed to capture the major dimensions of ageism recognised within contemporary theory (i.e., stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination) and to be suitable for individuals of ranging from adolescence up and from diverse cultural backgrounds. However, thus far the scale has primarily been used only in European contexts, leaving a need to assess its performance in more diverse country contexts. This study provides the first translation of the WHO-Ageism-E15 into Spanish using gold standard methods and assesses the validity and reliability of its scores in older populations in four Colombian cities. Overall, the WHO-Ageism-E15 demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties in the Colombian context. Older adults in Colombia reported experiencing moderate levels of ageism, with institutional-directed ageism being the most prominent. Furthermore, we found that self-directed and interpersonal-directed ageism were associated with poorer health and psychosocial wellbeing outcomes (i.e., overall ageism experiences were linked to higher levels of loneliness, lower well-being, and poorer physical and psychological health). The results also suggested that income and education levels were linked to experiences of self-directed and interpersonal-directed ageism.",

          "abstract": "While ageism experiences are widespread among older adults, there is no existing instrument that can effectively capture all three dimensions (i.e., stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminations) of ageism. The primary objective of this study was to validate the WHO Ageism Experiences Scale, a newly developed scale designed to comprehensively assess ageism experiences, in both locals and Ukrainian refugees in the Republic of Moldova. We examined the factor structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, concurrent validity, of 15- and 5-item version of WHO Ageism Experiences Scale in older adults sampled from Moldova(N = 425, Mage = 69.13, 74.12% female, 49.88% refugees). Results suggested an acceptable reliability and validity of both 15- and 5-item versions among Moldova older adults. Participants who were older, perceived as older in their lifespan, had lower education levels, and were perceived to have lower social status, exhibited higher levels of experienced ageism. Further, refugees reported significantly higher levels of ageism compared to local Moldovans. Higher experienced ageism levels were associated with worse health outcomes. As part of the global effort to validate the WHO Ageism Experiences Scale, this study included the first translation of this scale in Romanian and Russian, verified its reliability and validity in Moldova and among refugees, and facilitated cross-national comparisons of ageism.",

In\nthis study, we disentangled different dimensions of turn-taking by investigating how the\ndynamics of child-adult interactions changed according to the activity (task-oriented versus\nfreer conversation) and the familiarity of the interlocutor (familiar versus unfamiliar).\nTwenty-eight autistic children (16 male; Mage = 10.8 years) and 20 age-matched typically\ndeveloping children (8 male; Mage = 9.6) participated in seven task-orientated face-to-face\nconversations with their caregivers (336 total conversations) and seven more telephone\nconversations alternately with their caregivers (144 total conversations, 60 with typical\ndevelopment group) and an experimenter (191 total conversations, 112 with autism\ngroup). By modelling inter-turn response latencies in multi-level Bayesian location-\nscale models to include long tails, we found good test-rest reliability across sessions and\ncontexts, and showed that context strongly shaped group differences in response latencies.\nAutistic children exhibited more overlaps, produced faster response latencies and shorter\npauses than than typically developing children – and these group differences were stronger\nwhen conversing with the unfamiliar experimenter. Unfamiliarity also made the relation\nbetween individual differences and latencies evident: only in conversations with the\nexperimenter were higher socio-cognitive skills, lower social motivation and lower social\nawareness associated with faster responses. Information flow and shared tempo were also\ninfluenced by familiarity: children adapted their response latencies to the predictability\nand tempo of their interlocutor’s turn, but only when interacting with their caregivers\nand not the experimenter. These results highlight the need to construe turn-taking as\na multicomponential construct that is shaped by individual differences, interpersonal\ndynamics, and the affordances of the context.",

          "abstract": "In two pre-registered experiments (exp.1: n=44; exp.2: n=46), we investigated whether emotional inner speech has an effect on heart rate. Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: positive inner speech, negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed.",

          "abstract": "Prior research shows that humans adjust their learning rate based on environmental volatility. This adaptation may be reduced in individuals with high levels of anxious-depression, but past studies have been cross-sectional, making it unclear whether this adaptation is responsive to treatment. In the Precision in Psychiatry study, we examined changes in learning rate adaptation following four weeks of treatment in two patient groups receiving either internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT; n=677) or antidepressants (n=95), compared to a group of healthy participants (n=95). All groups showed increased learning rates in volatile environments at baseline, but against our prediction, learning rate adaptation was not cross-sectionally associated with individual differences in anxious-depression. There was also no evidence that learning rate adaptation changed post-treatment, despite symptom improvements. However, in the antidepressant group, symptom reductions correlated with learning rate adaptation. This finding should be interpreted cautiously due to reliability concerns. Overall, our results suggest that associations between learning rate adaptation and anxious-depression are likely modest, may not be present in treatment-seeking adults, and do not improve following treatment.",

Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories. Our results shed new light on young infants’ sensitivities to foundational domains of everyday life prior to their capacity for self-guided exploration.",

Across three preregistered experimental studies (N = 1214) with pre-service and in-service teachers in France, we investigated whether students with SEN receiving reduced-exercise accommodations were systematically devalued in grades and competence judgments, and whether this devaluation—a backlash effect—was moderated by fairness perceptions. In Studies 1 and 2, students with SEN received lower grades and competence ratings than non-SEN peers, regardless of student gender or relative performance. Study 3 introduced a cross-gender comparison, testing whether female students with SEN faced heightened backlash compared to male non-SEN peers. A consistent backlash effect emerged across studies, unaffected by gender contrast. Notably, fairness perceptions consistently mitigated this bias. These findings highlight persistent SEN-related backlash and suggest that fairness-focused interventions may foster more inclusive evaluations.",

We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes. Using machine learning with SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identified distinct predictors for each process. Recognition was driven by emotional strength, especially for unpleasant odors, and the richness of verbal descriptions. Associative memory followed a U-shaped relationship with familiarity and was strongly influenced by semantic distinctiveness – how uniquely each odor was described. Together, these findings reveal that odor memorability depends not only on its emotional salience, but also on how specifically it is conceptualized and how familiar we are with it.",

Insofar, however, longitudinal studies from infancy into toddlerhood accounting for all temperament dimensions and covering preverbal communication in addition to emerging verbal skills are scarce. Existing findings are inconclusive.\nThe current study is an extension of our previous study (N = 91) on a large cohort sample (N = 1200 and 1039 depending on analysis). Temperament (positive emotionality, negative emotionality and emerging self-regulation) was assessed at 6 and 12 months of age and gesturing and receptive vocabulary at 14 months. As an extension to the previous study, expressive vocabulary and sentence complexity in toddlerhood, at 30 months, were also assessed. All assessments utilized parent reports.\nThe temperament traits of positive emotionality and self-regulation positively predicted all communicative skills except sentence complexity. Positive emotionality accounted for 10-11% of the variance in gesturing, 4-5% in receptive vocabulary and 1-3% in expressive vocabulary. Self-regulation accounted for 4-6% of the variance in gesturing, 2-3% in receptive vocabulary and 0-1% in expressive vocabulary.\nResults aligned with the findings of our prior study but also highlighted weak longitudinal positive associations between positive emotionality and self-regulation and gesturing and vocabulary. However, associations were notably stronger with gesturing compared to verbal skills, suggesting temperament and preverbal communication are intertwined on a higher level compared to verbal skills. Longitudinal weakening of associations suggests the role of infant temperament is replaced by other factors influencing language development moving into toddlerhood.",

Moreover, strangers that show little initial similarity might become more similar when experiencing similar situations (experiential effect), raising the question whether being in a relationship actually adds similarity (couple effect) on top of these experiential factors. Here we investigate the contribution of experiential versus couple effects in partner’s emotional similarity, while embracing the multidimensional nature of emotional experience by assessing momentary emotional profile similarity scores. In two independent datasets, we compared romantic partners to simulated strangers and detected which experiential factors predict momentary similarity scores using regression trees. Results reveal that romantic partners are indeed more emotionally similar than simulated strangers, even when accounting for the identified experiential factors, amongst others, valence and contact with partner.",

          "abstract": "Fear conditioning paradigms model fear acquisition and extinction in controlled experiments. Context conditioning induces anxiety to unpredictable threats rather than fear of specific stimuli and serves as a model for anxiety disorders. Importantly, contexts have been mostly studied in terms of spatial properties (e.g. a room), while social contexts seem most relevant for many anxiety disorders. Consequently, the present study investigated context conditioning in a social context using Virtual Reality. Overall 40 participants underwent habituation, acquisition, and extinctions phase in the same virtual room. Two contexts were operationalized as co-presence of particular virtual agents. An aversive US was only presented during one agent’ co-presence (CTX+) but not the other’s (CTX-). Ratings and physiological data showed increased anxious arousal during CTX+ relative to CTX- for acquisition. Concurrent measurement of neural oscillations via EEG allowed to investigate underlying processes. Power in the parietal alpha and frontal beta band was reduced during CTX+ compared to CTX- for acquisition suggesting increased attentional and sensory-motor processing. These findings show successful context conditioning in social contexts which is accompanied by an increase in attention and motor preparation. Social context conditioning can serve as an effective model to study mechanisms of anxiety and anxiety disorders in humans.",

          "authors": "Nidhi V Banavar; Kirk Bansak",
          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments are extensively used across multiple disciplines to make inferences about preferences over multi-attribute alternatives. Much previous research has analyzed the importance of attributes at the aggregate level. Here, we focus on understanding individual-level behavior and, specifically, on strategy use. We present a novel Bayesian cognitive model that infers individuals' strategy use by performing attribute weight inference (how important an attribute is), attribute level inference (which value of the attribute is favored), and latent-mixture inference to classify strategy use. We then validate and apply our model to two conjoint experiments (total N = 3762) focusing on three political domains (attitudes towards immigrants, political candidates, and climate policy). From a substantive standpoint, we find that the majority of subjects use heuristic strategies in all conditions and that approximately 60% of subjects use different strategies depending on the political domain. Our model additionally highlights how aggregate-level inference on the weight of an attribute can be meaningfully decomposed by individual differences in strategy use and preferences over attributes. Specifically, we demonstrate clear multimodality in the distribution of attribute weights across individuals for all political domains and conditions, raising questions about how to appropriately contextualize information that is aggregated at the population level. In addition, our experiments include a set of experimental design manipulations that increase different dimensions of complexity in the conjoint experiments and show their impact on strategy use. This work has important implications for understanding how to interpret and generalize results from conjoint experiments, in addition to contributing to the strategy modeling literature. Further, we highlight how researchers can apply our model to their own conjoint experiments for both applied and methodological research aims.",

          "authors": "Björn Meder; Charley M Wu; Felix G. Rebitschek",
          "abstract": "Any medical innovation must first prove its benefits with reliable evidence from clinical trials. Evidence is commonly expressed using two metrics, summarizing treatment benefits based on either absolute risk reductions (ARRs) or relative risk reductions (RRRs). Both metrics are derived from the same data, but they implement conceptually distinct ideas. Here, we analyze these risk reductions measures from a causal modeling perspective. First, we show that ARR is equivalent to ΔP, while RRR is equivalent to causal power, thus clarifying the implicit causal assumptions. Second, we show how this formal equivalence establishes a relationship with causal Bayes nets theory, offering a basis for incorporating risk reduction metrics into a computational modeling framework. Leveraging these analyses, we demonstrate that under dynamically varying baseline risks, ARRs and RRRs lead to strongly diverging predictions. Specifically, the inherent assumption of a linear parameterization of the underlying causal graph can lead to incorrect conclusions when generalizing treatment benefits (e.g, predicting the effect of a vaccine in new populations with different baseline risks). Our analyses highlight the shared principles underlying risk reduction metrics and measures of causal strength, emphasizing the potential for explicating causal structure and inference in medical research.",

The methods and therapies employed in this case study have empirical validation in other populations. The M4 model was developed to support an Olympian artistic gymnast to improve sleeplessness and anxiety prior to an international competition. It was informed by the author’s autoethnographical account. These interventions were administered in two sessions of 45 minutes and 30 minutes on the same day at a gap of four hours, due to limited time availability. An integrated approach was adopted to induce sleep and relaxation. Its efficacy was evaluated based on the coach’s and athlete’s reported improvements in sleep quality, sleep duration, relaxation, and quality performance during practice session the following day. Further validation and cross cultural applications are suggested.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "abstract": "Dynamic time warping (DTW) is increasingly used to detect facial mimicry, yet the reliability of distance measures as indicators of mimicry remains uncertain. This study evaluated. DTW’s ability to infer mimicry by presenting participants with both live model performances and prerecorded videos of dynamic facial expressions. Simultaneous dyadic frontal facial videos of participants and models were acquired, and action unit (AU) time series were analyzed using Py-Feat, with DTW applied to estimate dyadic temporal pattern similarity. A principal component analysis of the models’ raw AU time series identified the highest-weighted AUs. For AU12 (lip corner puller) and AU06 (cheek raiser), temporal pattern distances were smaller in the positive-live condition than in the positive-video condition, while AU15 (lip corner depressor) exhibited a trend toward smaller distances in the negative-live than in the negative-video condition. These findings suggested that live interactions, within matching emotional conditions, enhanced dyadic behavioral alignment. However, all three AUs exhibited smaller distances when the corresponding emotion was inactive, raising the concern that reduced DTW distances could result from either mimicry or mutual inaction. Researchers should carefully consider design and theoretical frameworks when applying DTW in mimicry studies.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) explain and predict human choices and response times (RTs). Their parameters can be estimated based on observed choice-RT distributions. Contrasting accumulation-model parameters across experimental design cells can be a powerful way to test theories of the latent cognitive processes underlying choice and RT. For example, the prospective memory (PM) decision control model instantiated a novel cognitive-control theory of PM decisions and quantitatively compared it to existing theories. This tutorial demonstrates how to embed such psychological theories in EAM parameters using the R package EMC2, which simplifies model programming and increases computational efficiency beyond previous approaches. We first show how a broad class of cognitive models can be expressed by mapping EAM parameters to experimental conditions using an augmented linear model language. We then walk through two examples of how to specify, fit and evaluate such models.  The first is a standard application of the PM decision control model. The second showcases how the model can be extended to address a more complex paradigm where an automated decision aid provides advice about choices. We conclude by discussing how this approach can be applied more broadly.",

          "abstract": "This study extends the Retrieving Effectively from Memory model, a prominent computational model of episodic memory, to the domain of categorization. Our modeling approach begins with the assumption that same-category items share common features representing defining characteristics of their category, and that they are encoded in the same category list context. We then assumed that category judgments occur based on the comparison of an item’s averaged similarity to the exemplars from each category. We use this model to explore how the learning modes of observation and classification might influence category learning and consider several strategies that may emerge during the classification mode. Model simulation results indicate that different strategies which people might adopt during classification can either confer an advantage or pose a disadvantage in category learning. These findings suggest potential avenues for future research, particularly in exploring diverse strategies employed during learning.\n\nThis paper was submitted to the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society and appears in the conference proceedings.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization—antipathy towards members of one’s political outgroup—may pose challenges to social cohesion and personal well-being. Prior studies have suggested that one’s affective polarization may cause intrapersonal harm as well as interpersonal harm. It has been associated with reduced social support, increased stress, and worse physical health. This pre-registered study investigated the intrapersonal harm of affective polarization using a six-wave longitudinal survey (N = 470). Affective polarization, social support, perceived stress, and self-rated health were measured fortnightly for three months preceding the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were employed to investigate the within-person effects of affective polarization on these indictors of wellbeing. Contrary to hypotheses, none of the hypothesised cross-lagged effects were significant, suggesting that changes in affective polarization did not predict changes in social support, stress, or health. However, cross-sectional analyses did reflect past findings, showing that higher levels of affective polarization were associated with lower social support, greater stress, and worse health. We additionally found evidence for perceived stress causing moderate increases in affective polarization. Stable differences by political orientation were also observed in our sample, with liberals reporting higher affective polarization and stress, lower social support, and worse health. Despite the lack of significant effects, potentially due to limitations such as sample size and measurement constraints, our findings underscore the importance of further investigations with appropriate robust designs to clarify the relationship between affective polarization and well-being. These results challenge the assumption that affective polarization directly drives declines in well-being.",

Don’t just start at the beginning of an academic article/book and try to read straight to the end! Instead, I recommend starting by reading the title(s)/author(s) and abstract(s), then the figures, reading the Discussion section, and skimming/spot-checking the references, peer reviews, and data (e.g., spreadsheets, audiovisual stimuli, surveys), if available. Only once you have done this and evaluated whether it seems worth your time do I recommend deciding whether to read every word of some/all sections/chapters (and any accompanying supplementary material) or digging deeper into reanalysing/replicating the data. I recommend writing accordingly so that most of your key information will be conveyed even if your reader only gets through your title, abstract, and figures. I discuss various strategies to improve your own academic reading/writing and the broader culture of academia, from practical (e.g., formatting and tracking references and citations using Zotero and Google Scholar, asking constructive questions rather than self-promoting comments, publishing using Peer Community In Registered Reports, using the “sandwich thesis” model for PhD dissertations) to philosophical (e.g., ethical issues in authorship, citation, AI, publishing, and funding). I explain the intended goals of academic research (to create and distribute valuable new knowledge) and perverse incentives that lead us astray from these goals (e.g., chasing prestige and funding).

Three studies involving 16–30 months old monolinguals and bilinguals (total N = 1294), examine how climate conditions affect word learning using parent-reported vocabulary checklists. Children in cold-weather regions (Wisconsin, Montreal) produced significantly more winter-related words compared to peers in milder climates (Texas, Florida), while seasonal analyses showed that within populations, winter word acquisition and knowledge peaked in the coldest months and declined during the warmest months. This pattern was most pronounced in older children, and in bilinguals with greater language exposure.

          "abstract": "The neural mechanisms of consciousness remain elusive. Previous studies on both human and\nnon-human animals, through manipulation of level of conscious arousal, have reported that\nspecific time-series features correlate with level of consciousness, such as spectral power in\ncertain frequency bands. However, such features often lack principled, theoretical\njustifications as to why they should be related with level of consciousness. This raises two\nsignificant issues: firstly, many other types of times-series features which could also reflect\nconscious level have been ignored due to researcher biases towards specific analyses; and\nsecondly, it is unclear how to interpret identified features to understand the neural activity\nunderlying consciousness, especially when they are identified from recordings which\nsummate activity across large areas such as electroencephalographic recordings. To address\nthe first concern, here we propose a new approach: in the absence of any theoretical priors,\nwe should be maximally agnostic and treat as many known features as feasible as equally\npromising candidates. To apply this approach we use highly comparative time-series analysis\n(hctsa), a toolbox which provides over 7,700 different univariate time-series features\noriginating from different research fields. To address the second issue, we employ hctsa to\nhigh-quality neural recordings from a relatively simple brain, the fly brain (Drosophila\nmelanogaster), extracting features from local field potentials during wakefulness, general\nanesthesia and sleep. At Stage 1 of this registered report, we constructed a classifier for each\nfeature, for discriminating wakefulness and anesthesia in a discovery group of flies (N = 13).\nAt Stage 2, we assessed their performances on four independent groups of evaluation flies,\nfrom which recordings were made during anesthesia and sleep, and which were originally\nblinded to the data analysis team (N = 49). We found only 47 time-series features, applied to\nrecordings obtained from the center of the fly brain, to also significantly classify wake from\nanesthesia or sleep in all 4 of these evaluation datasets. Most of these were related to\nautocorrelation, and they indicated that signals during wakefulness remained correlated to\ntheir past for a longer timescale than during anesthesia and sleep. Meanwhile, time-series\nfeatures related to well-known potential markers of consciousness, such as those related to\ncomplexity or spectral power, failed to generalize across all the flies. However, many of these\ncomplexity and spectral features have a consistent direction of effect due to anesthesia or\nsleep across flies, suggesting that even slight variations in experiment setup can reduce\ngeneralizability of classifiers. These results caution the current state of frequent discoveries\nof new potential consciousness markers, which may not generalize across datasets, and point\nto autocorrelation as a class of dynamical properties which does.",

There is debate about whether ideological favoritism is stronger among conservatives, progressives, or neither, and research has yet to explore ideological asymmetry in in-group favoritism. Across five studies (Ntotal = 6,631), we confirmed a double dissociation: ideological favoritism was stronger among U.S. progressives, whereas in-group favoritism was stronger among U.S. conservatives. This pattern was robust across different samples of perceivers and groups and across various measures of aligned ideological beliefs, shared group membership, and attitudes toward the groups (i.e., judgments and feelings). We discuss potential explanations for the double dissociation. Certain psychological differences between conservatives and progressives (e.g., community orientation and cosmopolitanism) may direct their attention to different markers of allegiance.",

          "abstract": "Non-Ordinary experiences (NOEs), such as feelings of unity with God, hearing voices, and sensing the presence of deceased persons, are prevalent in the general population. They may be life-transforming but are also associated with pathological conditions such as psychosis and dissociation. However, little is known about how cultural appraisals and religious practices shape their phenomenology and psychological impact in non-clinical populations. For the most part, their socio-cognitive and emotional features remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was threefold. Firstly, to investigate the phenomenological characteristics and types of NOEs reported by self-defined spirit mediums from a spiritualist home circle in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Secondly, to explore the role of social context in interpreting and shaping NOEs. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the phenomenological similarities and distinctions of experiences reported in spiritualist contexts with psychopathological constructs such as dissociative and psychotic symptoms. The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining ethnographic observations of spiritualist séances, thematic content analysis of reports of séance-related NOEs, and standardized scales assessing dissociation, absorption, psychotic symptoms, symptoms of common mental disorders, and satisfaction with life. We analyzed a total of 151 independent reports of NOEs provided by a group of mediumship practitioners participating in regular séances over a period of one year and five months. The reports tapped a variety of experiences including intense emotional states (e.g., happiness, gratitude), alterations in consciousness (e.g., feelings of spacing out), spontaneous mental imagery (e.g., visions of the spiritual world), sensory-perceptual experiences (e.g., hearing voices or other unusual sounds), somatic manifestations (e.g., body tremors), and unusual experiences involving the séance table (e.g., vibrations). The experiences reported were episodic, controllable, and restricted to the séances. Overall, they were described as pleasant or innocuous. Mediums generally reported perceiving their lives as satisfying and meaningful and scored similarly to the general population on items indicative of common mental disorders. Given their cultural impact and predominantly positive effects, these experiences bear implications for differential diagnosis, and the role of cultural and religious factors in mental health, wellbeing, and cognition. The spiritualist séance provide a natural environment for observational and experimental studies of intentionally induced non-ordinary states of consciousness.\nKeywords: non-ordinary experiences, dissociative experiences, psychotic experiences, psychosis continuum, spirit mediumship, religious rituals, spirituality",

          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

          "authors": "Paul Kelber; Rolf Ulrich; Ian Grant Mackenzie; Martin Georg Jeschke; Victor Mittelstädt",
          "abstract": "Conflict tasks often yield smaller mean congruency effects when relevant (target) and irrelevant (distractor) information is mostly incongruent rather than mostly congruent. While this proportion congruency effect may reflect proactive control adaptation, only a few previous studies have provided convincing evidence for proactive control adaptation when ruling out contingency learning and reactive (item-specific) control adaptation. In this study, we present further evidence for proactive control adaptation (as reflected in proportion congruency effects and asymmetrical list-shifting effects in contingency-free transfer items) across three experiments (each N = 100 participants) using manual counting Stroop tasks (Experiment 1: number words as distractors; Experiment 2: Arabic numerals as distractors; Experiment 3: number words and Arabic numerals as inducer and transfer items, or vice versa). To better understand the processes underlying proactive control adaptation, we conducted fine-grained distributional analyses (delta functions) and model-based analyses (diffusion model for conflict tasks). These analyses suggest that proactive control adaptation in manual counting Stroop tasks mainly reflects adjustments in the strength of distractor suppression rather than in the timing of distractor suppression, the strength of target amplification, or response caution. Additional distributional and diffusion model re-analyses of the data by Spinelli and Lupker (2023, Experiments 1–3) revealed a similar pattern in vocal color Stroop tasks. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence for proactive control adaptation in manual counting Stroop tasks, and indicates that proactive control adaptation mainly reflects adjustments in the strength of distractor suppression in both manual and vocal Stroop tasks.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conformity to traditional masculinity ideologies (TMIs) has consistently been linked to increased psychopathology. However, little is known about the association with formal psychiatric diagnoses.\nMethod: Cross-sectional data from a randomized controlled trial were analyzed. A total of 317 men (mean age = 31.8, SD = 7.2) completed an online questionnaire assessing conformity to TMIs and underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) in person. Participants had been pre-screened for depressive symptoms as part of the larger trial. Inclusion criteria were male sex and gender, age between 25 and 50 years, sufficient German-language skills, and no current or past psychopharmacological or psychological treatment.\nResults: Overall, 200 participants (64.7%) met the criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses revealed that higher conformity to TMIs was associated with increased odds of receiving any psychiatric diagnosis (OR=1.04, 95% CI [1.02, 1.05]), particularly depressive disorders (OR=1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04]) and substance-related and addictive disorders (OR=1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.05]). No significant associations were found for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or anxiety disorders. Exploratory analyses suggested a significant association between conformity to TMIs and personality disorders, and an initially significant association with sleep-wake disorders that did not survive correction for multiple testing.\nConclusion: Higher conformity to TMIs is associated with an increased risk of fulfilling the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, especially depressive and substance-related disorders. As such, the study highlights the clinical relevance of including TMIs in the assessment and treatment of men suffering from mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "Traditional random utility models assume stable preferences in preferential decision-making. However, behavioural decision theory suggests that preferences can be dynamic. Here, we investigated preference change using extended Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE). This research examines the impact of emphasis instructions on preference shifts in multi-attribute decision-making. In Study 1, participants were instructed to emphasise a single attribute when choosing between two toothpaste options. As expected, emphasis instructions increases utility for emphasised attributes and decreases utility for unemphasised attributes. Study 2 extended this finding by investigating whether participants could emphasise two attributes simultaneously. The results showed that participants were able to prioritise two attributes at once, with similar shifts in utility observed for emphasised and unemphasised attributes as Study 1. These findings suggest that preference changes can be systematically influenced by task demands, challenging static models of preferential decision-making. These studies contribute to our understanding of how preferences shift dynamically, highlighting the importance of considering context and task demands when developing models of decision-making. The results also have implications for interventions in fields such as healthcare and consumer behavior, where influencing preferences may be crucial.",

This component has been investigated in many studies, but little is known about the cognitive mechanism it reflects. In this study, we tested a model suggesting that the LPP reflects processes related to memory encoding and consolidation. To investigate this, we recorded EEG while participants read a series of neutral and negative words. Memory was then tested at both short (10-15 minutes) and long (12+ hours, including a period sleep) delays. We predicted that LPP amplitude would be positively correlated with memory, and that this relationship would be stronger after a delay (reflecting a relationship between LPP amplitude and memory consolidation). Consistent with our predictions, we found that LPP amplitude predicted memory in the delayed memory test, but not the immediate memory test. In addition, memory for negative items, compared to neutral items, declined less across the delay, and LPP amplitude mediated this effect of emotion on memory decay.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization in the United States is an ongoing and pervasive problem eroding cooperation and productive debate related to partisan and nonpartisan topics. Such findings signal an inherent mistrust of opposing partisans that is likely related to the extent of threat people believe opposing partisans pose to them. Whereas past work has examined the mistrust and threat characteristic of affective polarization in complex social environments as well as in initial social perception, no work to date has examined their effects in the context of simple everyday decisions. The current work filled this gap in the literature by examining effects of political partisanship and perceived partisan threat on trust behavior indexed by an economic trust game widely used in decision making research. Across two studies using college-aged adults (Study 1) and adults across the lifespan (Study 2), participant and target partisanship interacted to affect trust. Across studies, more liberal participants exhibited lower trust toward Republicans than Democrats. However, more conservative participants’ trust either remained stable across party lines (Study 1) or erred toward lower trust toward Democrats than Republicans (Study 2). In Study 1, these patterns were paralleled when substituting perceived partisan threat toward Republicans and Democrats for political ideology, with threat potentially linking the relation between participants’ ideology and their trust behavior. Study 2 manipulated partisan threat to show larger participant-based partisan differences in trust when partisan trustees were more versus less threatening. These findings in part support threat-related affective polarization in initial trust decisions and that have implications for intergroup interactions along partisan lines in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between economic growth and emotional well-being remains poorly understood relative to life satisfaction, largely due to methodological limitations. Using psychometrically robust measures we examined how national income relates to emotional well-being. Analyzing 178,948 participants across 33 European countries in four European Social Survey waves (2006, 2012, 2014, 2023), we constructed a reliable emotional well-being measure and compared it with single-item life satisfaction. Both showed strong positive cross-sectional correlations with GDP per capita. Linear mixed-effects models revealed economic growth significantly predicts within-country increases in both emotional well-being and life satisfaction. These findings demonstrate that economic development improves both cognitive and affective dimensions of subjective well-being, contradicting previous research suggesting a weak association with emotional experiences. Economic growth thus remains important for improving citizens' daily emotional experiences, not merely their life evaluations, highlighting the continued relevance of economic development for well-being.",

When children and adults judged one independent emotionally hurtful lie (Study 1), they evaluated it negatively regardless of whether the liar was lying to a friend, a classmate, or an enemy. However, when comparatively evaluating two people who told the same emotionally hurtful lie (at the same time), participants judged a friend’s lie more negatively than a classmate’s lie (Study 2). Interestingly, relationship impacted evaluations of emotionally hurtful lies to a similar extent as evaluations of failures to help. Taken together, people’s evaluations of emotionally hurtful lies take social relationships into account in comparative but not independent contexts. More broadly, school-aged children and adults appear to understand that close relationships entail certain obligations, and breaking these obligations is more condemnable than engaging in the same antisocial interaction with a more distant social partner.",

However, children must also build a cognitive and neural system that can support efficient use of this information for real-time language processing.  To address this gap, the present study aimed to identify neural systems supporting real-time word recognition in school-age children (2nd to 4th graders). We investigated the relationships between real-time word recognition and brain structure (cortical thickness and area), focusing on how these links are influenced by age and language ability. Our analysis revealed two key dimensions of word recognition: Activation Rate, the speed at which lexical candidates accrue evidence, and Competition Resolution, the ability to suppress irrelevant candidates. Cortical thickness emerged as a crucial factor, with thinner regions supporting more efficient processing and no relations were found to cortical area Cortical thickness of the ventral brain regions were primarily associated with Activation Rate, while cortical thickness of the dorsal regions were linked to Competition Resolution, with stronger involvement in younger and less skilled children. Individual variability in brain structure was robustly linked to real-time language processing, even after accounting for age and language ability. These findings underscore the importance of cortical thickness in efficient lexical processing and highlight the need for refined behavioral indices in neurocognitive research.",

The theory is validated across three collapse domains: symbolic identity reentry (ICT), biological regeneration, and quantum decoherence. UZPT affirms that recursion is neither emergent nor computational—it is collapse-governed and structurally bounded. It includes a formal ignition equation, τᵢ = ∂H / ∂t evaluated at ZPI, and is protected under Collapse Harmonics Codex (Codex Laws T-Ø, IDF-1, VIII.E.3, and L.E.C.T. v2.3).

Outcomes varied by likelihood (high vs. low) and actuality (hit vs. miss), resulting in a 2×2×2 design: intention (present/absent) × outcome (hit/miss) × expectedness (expected/unexpected). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude was larger when participants intended to hit objects, while the P3 potential increased for unexpected outcomes. However, neither signal exclusively reflected intention or foresight; the FRN also indexed expectedness, and the P3 reflected intention. To address this overlap, we used effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering, which identified a widespread brain activity pattern that may better dissociate intention from foresight. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural processes underlying complex decision-making, with potential applications in ethical and legal frameworks.",

          "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, has revolutionized how we access information. These LLMs can answer a wide array of questions on nearly any topic. When humans answer questions, especially difficult or uncertain questions, they often accompany their responses with metacognitive confidence judgments indicating their belief in their accuracy. LLMs are certainly capable of providing confidence judgments, but it is currently unclear how accurate these confidence judgments are. To fill this gap in the literature, the present studies investigate the capability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty through confidence judgments. We compare the absolute and relative accuracy of confidence judgments made by four LLMs (ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, Sonnet, Haiku) and human participants in both domains of aleatory uncertainty - NFL predictions (Study 1; n = 502), and Oscar predictions (Study 2; n = 109) – and domains of epistemic uncertainty - Pictionary performance (Study 3; n = 164), Trivia questions (Study 4; n = 110), and questions about life at a university (Study 5; n = 110). We find several commonalities between LLMs and humans, such as achieving similar levels of absolute and relative metacognitive accuracy (although LLMs tend to be slightly more accurate on both dimensions). Like humans, we also find that LLMs tend to be overconfident. However, we find that, unlike humans, LLMs – especially ChatGPT and Gemini –  often fail to adjust their confidence judgments based on past performance, highlighting a key metacognitive limitation.",

Clusters were sequentially graduated from usual care to a digitally-enhanced model incorporating Recovery Connect, which provided real-time monitoring, psychoeducational and skill based learning content, and messaging between patients and clinicians. The primary outcome was 30-day retention in treatment following either exposure (implementation of the app into the clinic), linkage (connecting the patient app with the clinician’s app), or engagement (levels of usage of the app). Secondary outcomes included treatment continuance and # daily doses within the first 3, 7 and 30 days. Cluster-controlled discrete-time survival analyses were used, adjusting for patient- and clinic-level covariates.\nResults\nPatients admitted to clinics which had implemented the app saw increased retention (74.8%) compared to those that had not (69.5%; p=.047). Patients who linked with a clinician on Recovery Connect had a 81.3% likelihood of retention, compared to 72.0% (p&lt;.001) among those not linked.  Linkage also significantly predicted higher continuance and number of daily doses taken in the first 7 and 30 days.

          "abstract": "Visual art appreciation often involves inferring the mental states of others, whether the artist’s intentions or the emotions of depicted characters. This ability, known as mentalizing, is central to social cognition in shaping interactions and predicting behaviours. However, little is known about the ways in which mentalizing affects aesthetic judgments and gaze behaviour. This question is essential for understanding how mentalizing shapes where we focus our gaze, what we value, and how we feel about different art forms. Given this limited knowledge, the current pre-registered study investigated whether adopting another’s perspective impacts aesthetic judgments and gaze behaviour when viewing Impressionist paintings. Eye movements of 52 participants were recorded while they evaluated paintings on liking, understanding, and emotional evocativeness from self- vs. other-perspective. Multi-level Bayesian regression modelling revealed that adopting other-perspective (i.e., the general public) rather than self-perspective enhanced aesthetic judgments, especially for liking and emotional evocativeness. This effect was more pronounced for landscapes than for artworks portraying people. The eye-tracking results showed that dwell time and fixation count remained similar across both self- versus other-perspectives. However, artworks depicting people attracted a greater number of fixations than landscapes, highlighting the social salience of human figures in visual art. Overall, our findings emphasise that adopting another’s perspective shapes how we feel and evaluate visual art, without changing overall gaze behaviour. Our study provides novel insights into the interplay between social cognition and visual aesthetics, with broader implications for how imagining the collective public’s perspective guides our experience with art.",

          "abstract": "A majority of memory research examines a single or a few factors that influence memory, but a broader perspective is needed to form a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of memory. Broadly, prior work has largely focused on observer effects (e.g., individual differences, internal states) and environmental effects (e.g., task, context), with only more recent work focusing on item effects (e.g., the typicality or memorability of stimuli). Here, I analyze 6,223,953 memory decisions made by 13,946 participants on a continuous recognition task for 26,107 naturalistic object images to test how these different factors influence long-term episodic memory. The individual subject and the memorability of the stimulus emerge as the most important factors for predicting successful hits, with surprisingly little influence of the experimental context. In contrast, while less variance is captured by these factors for false alarms, a wider variety of factors are important, including image factors, observer factors, and experimental context. These results suggest that much of what drives our memory is shared and predictable, and demonstrate the need for more research that focuses on multiple factors simultaneously in more representative and naturalistic tasks.",

          "authors": "Chris Patrick Pflanz; Sarah Bauermeister; John D Gallacher",
          "abstract": "Background. Gender differences in neuroticism are well known, with females consistently scoring higher than males across various scales, including the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Neuroticism (EPQ-RN) scale. However, it remains unclear whether these differences are genuine or result from gender bias in psychometric instruments. Additionally, the implications of a potential bias for the predictive validity of neuroticism are not well understood. Given the role of neuroticism in predicting cognitive performance, this study aimed to investigate gender-based differential item functioning (DIF) in the EPQ-RN and its effects on the association between neuroticism and cognition.\nMethods. Using data from 13,573 participants in the UK Biobank study, we conducted logistic regression DIF analyses on the EPQ-RN scale to identify gender-related item bias. Items were grouped into three constructs: bias-free, female-endorsed, and male-endorsed neuroticism. Cross-sectional linear regression and longitudinal structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to evaluate the association between neuroticism constructs and cognition, adjusting for age, gender, education, and depression.\nResults. Significant DIF was identified in 10 of 12 EPQ-RN items, with six preferentially endorsed by females. However, females also scored higher on bias-free neuroticism, indicating actual gender differences. In cross-sectional analyses, bias-free and female neuroticism were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance at baseline, whereas the effect of male neuroticism was conditional on the covariates in the model. Longitudinal SEMs did not reveal significant cross-lagged effects, suggesting neuroticism at baseline did not predict cognitive performance at follow-up, irrespective of the type of neuroticism subscale: bias-free, female, or male. \nConclusion. Findings reveal substantial gender-based DIF in the EPQ-RN scale, likely overestimating neuroticism scores in females. Yet, even after removing biased items, females still exhibited higher bias-free neuroticism, supporting the notion of genuine gender differences. Importantly, the validity of the neuroticism construct as a predictor of cognition did not depend on DIF, with similar findings for bias-free and gender-specific scales.  These findings have implications for interpreting gender differences in cognitive ageing, particularly when using widely adopted personality scales such as the EPQ-RN.",

          "abstract": "Repeated assessments in everyday life allow for ecologically valid data on dynamic, within-person stress processes. However, typical designs offer little information the immediate shape of affective responses following daily stressors, including the influence of situational and person-level variables. In a combined clinical and community sample (N=248; recruited between 2016 and 2018), we employed a high-density intensive-longitudinal protocol (observations N=1442) to capture the temporal dynamics of affect in response to daily stressful events using a microburst design. Specifically, we implemented an adaptive signal-contingent schedule, where an initial stressor report triggered an intense burst of prompts in 15-minute increments over the course of one hour inquiring about momentary affect. To model affective microtrajectories, we used multilevel structural equation modeling. A piecewise linear model consistently showed the best fit across all indices for both negative and positive affect. Affective responses to momentarily experienced stressors were best captured by a model that allowed for changes in affect trajectories over time (an initial steep decline/increase followed by gradual change), with more stressful situations amplifying these trajectories. Moreover, Extraversion significantly influenced the initial rise in positive affect, leading to more pronounced early changes in those with higher levels of Extraversion. In contrast, Neuroticism had an opposite effect on positive affect, dampening these early changes. Results offer a detailed understanding of daily stress dynamics by providing insights into the immediate and evolving nature of affective responses to stress, with implications for personalized stress management strategies.",

          "authors": "Maria Spychalska",
          "abstract": "Conjunctive sentences in the past tense are often interpreted as describing a sequence of events occurring in order. In pragmatics, this phenomenon is known as temporal implicature. In three ERP experiments, we track the time course of how temporal implicatures are derived in conjunctions that report unrelated events. We also examine whether the contextual relevance of temporal order influences the processing of temporal order.\n\nParticipants observed game events, such as turning two cards face-up in sequence, and read conjunctive sentences describing these events in either the correct or reversed order. The relevance of event order was manipulated by varying the game pay-off: in Experiment 1, the sequence affected the pay-off, while in Experiment 2, it did not. Experiment 3 further enhanced the salience of order by introducing temporal connectives (\"before\" and \"after\") as alternatives to simple conjunctions.\n\nThe processing dynamics of temporal order depended on both the global experimental context and the connective used. Reversed-order sentences triggered increased P600 amplitudes at the first noun where the order violation became detectable, regardless of pay-off relevance. This effect is argued to reflect effortful combinatorial processing that is due to the violation of the expected discourse organization. In contrast, the N400 was modulated by order only in Experiments 1 and 3, where it was explicitly relevant—either through task demands or the presence of temporal connectives. This supports the hypothesis that temporal implicatures can be processed incrementally as part of enriched meaning representation when sufficiently supported by context.\n\n\nAdditionally, an early negativity (N100-P200 time-window) was observed at the connective \"and\" in reversed-order sentences, suggesting increased attentiveness to connectives used in order-incongruent sentences. For \"before\" in reversed-order conditions, \na prolonged negativity effect around the N400 time-window is observed, indicating that order incongruence with 'before' was processed as a meaning-related prediction error. In contrast, for \"after\" the effect is diminished, arguably due to conflict between semantic requirements for order reversal and the discourse-based expectations for iconic order. Finally, \na late positivity emerged at the second noun, in reversed-order \"and\" sentences, indicating the involvement of late inferential processing. This effect was present in experiments 2 and 3, where the task did not explicitly emphasize the order.\n\nThese findings provide new insights into the time course of temporal implicatures and the interplay between discourse structure, contextual relevance, and linguistic cues during real-time processing.",

          "abstract": "We model pragmatic mechanisms of referential communication and categorization in a multi-agent framework of emergent communication. Pragmatic theories and experimental work predict that speakers consider the context in their choice of referring expressions. In addition to this context-based reasoning, utility-based pragmatic reasoning about the listener's likely interpretation of an utterance influences the speaker's production choices. We aim to investigate these two factors and their role in referring expression generation and categorization in a computational model of language emergence and language use. We model communication in interaction and consider an efficiency tradeoff between speaker and listener utilities. Our results show that an emerging language becomes more effective, ambiguous, and efficient when speakers and listeners communicate in a shared context. This is achieved by an efficient tradeoff between production and comprehension where languages can afford to be simpler in production when they are sufficiently informative in context, placing more burden on the listener's side. We further demonstrate that incorporating utility-based pragmatics, as modeled with the Rational Speech Acts framework, improves the linguistic efficiency of language use only in languages that emerged with a shared context between interlocutors, but not in languages that emerged without such contextual information during training. We conclude that context-based pragmatics plays a role in referential communication and categorization by shaping an emerging language. Efficient reference in a communicative situation can benefit especially from utility-based pragmatics if the language that is being used has emerged in context. This might suggest that utility-based pragmatics hinges on mechanisms that naturally emerge when context is available during the evolution of a language. In summary, we show that human-like language and category systems emerge as an optimized tradeoff between speaker and listener needs in interaction, i.e. under efficiency considerations of simplicity and informativeness.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript is accepted for publication in the Journal of Traumatic Stress (2023/04/20). Abstract: Cognitive models suggest that trauma engenders distrust and interpersonal threat sensitivity, which is supported by previous evidence on individuals affected by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childhood maltreatment (CM). We tested whether CM is associated with distrust and interpersonal threat sensitivity in daily life, and whether momentary negative affect (NA) provides a context that strengthens this association. Hypotheses were based on cognitive models of trauma and the feelings-as-information theory. In a seven-day ambulatory assessment study with six semi-random daily prompts (2,295 total), we measured self-reported momentary NA, and assessed behavioral trust as well as interpersonal threat sensitivity via facial emotion ratings with two novel experimental paradigms in 61 individuals with varying levels of CM (45,900 trials total). As hypothesized, NA was associated with increased momentary distrust (ß = 0.03, p = .002) and interpersonal threat sensitivity (ß = -0.01, p = .021). Higher levels of CM were associated with more negative emotion ratings, independent of affective context (ß = -0.07, p = .003). Momentary behavioral distrust was associated with CM at high levels of momentary NA (ß = 0.02, p = .027). Findings for both tasks support the feeling-as-information theory and suggest that cognitive alterations surrounding distrust and interpersonal threat, which were originally proposed for PTSD, likely also affect those with CM.",

          "abstract": "Studies have linked personality dispositions to important social evaluations, such as how\nmuch power individuals are granted, or how much they are liked. Yet, these links are not\nalways consistent and seem to depend on the social context. We zeroed in on this issue,\ntesting two mutually non-exclusive hypotheses on how the context might moderate the effects\nof personality dispositions on perceptions of power and likability in newly formed groups.\nThe behavior contingency hypothesis posits that the context moderates the extent to which a\ndisposition is expressed in behavior. The valuation contingency hypothesis posits that the\ncontext moderates the extent to which disposition-specific behavior is valued. In a roundrobin\nstudy, we found support for both hypotheses with regard to perceptions of power (but\nnot with regard to likability). The findings reveal the importance of behavior expression and\nvaluation in the processes underlying personality-situation interactions in power hierarchies.",

          "abstract": "Accurate assessment of societal change relies on robust metrics, yet the reliability of commonly used indicators is uncertain. We conducted an expert-elicitation-guided (n = 24) comprehensive audit of 99 indicators—including 37 pre-selected and 62 expert-nominated markers—across key domains such as climate, economy, public health, and peace/war. Each indicator was evaluated based on definability, quantifiability, data availability, global representativeness, transparency, and temporal resolution. Our audit revealed that only 29.7% of pre-selected indicators and 32.3% of expert-suggested indicators met all quality criteria. Furthermore, the perceived importance of a domain was inversely related to the quality of its available indicators. Moreover, direct measures tended to score higher in quality than composite indices. These findings highlight significant gaps in the metrics used to track societal change, raising concerns about the data informing policy and public understanding. We underscore the need to develop more precise, transparent, globally representative, temporally precise indicators to effectively assess human progress.",

          "authors": "Louisa J Rinaldi; Julia Simner",
          "abstract": "Special populations with sensory differences demonstrate the remarkable diversity of the human mind. Sensory differences take many forms, from misophonia (a sound sensitivity disorder), to ASMR (relaxing sensory pleasure from sounds like tapping), to synaesthesia (a type of ‘merging of the senses’), to sensory hyposensitivity (sensory underwhelm or under-responsiveness), as well as a range of other atypical sensory experiences, involving sounds, colours, textures, odours, tastes, and so on. This paper presents the first far-reaching model of sensory differences, by treating them not as mysterious lone conditions, but within a coherent over-arching framework with testable predictions. Our model has three dimensions to predict the range and diversity of sensory variation: valence describes whether the sensory difference is an aversion or predilection, trigger describes whether differences relate to the intensity or identity of a stimulus, and sense domain includes, minimally, vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, touch, proprioception, interoception, and the vestibular sense. We supplement our proposal with a literature review to map out known manifestations of sensory differences falling within our model’s multi-dimensional search-space. These initial steps serve to predict, in a Mendeleevian fashion, where novel types of sensory differences might be found in the future (i.e., by revealing gaps in the definable search-space, which represent sensory differences that are predicted but as-yet-unknown). Finally, we test our model by identifying one such gap and showing that the novel sensory difference it predicts does indeed exist. In sum, we present the first unified model of sensory differences, offering predictive capabilities to tackle fundamental questions about the sensory structure of the human mind.",

          "abstract": "Latent variable modeling is a core aspect of research in the social sciences.  Frequently, researchers are interested in comparing the fit of multiple models to a set of data in an effort to select the one that seems most plausible statistically.  Together with theory, such statistical investigations can help researchers to gain insights into phenomena in a variety of areas such as psychology, education, sociology, and the health sciences.  Latent variable model comparisons have traditionally been made using the likelihood ratio test for nested models and information indices for nonnested models.  While effective in some circumstances, these techniques each have weaknesses that can limit their utility in practice.  Recent work has been done in developing various approaches for comparing nested and nonnested models in a more effective and accurate manner.  The purpose of this paper is to describe these methods and to present their use in a tutorial designed for researchers from a wide array of disciplines and experience.

          "abstract": "Surveys are regularly used to estimate the prevalence of belief in conspiracy theories and test hypotheses about causes and consequences of these beliefs. In such research, it is typically assumed that belief reports are sincere. However, evidence for sincerity is rarely provided. In the present study we examine the issue of participant sincerity in a sample of 1,044 Australians demographically matched to the voting population. We ﬁnd endorsement of six preexisting conspiracy theories to be widespread, with 33.4% of participants (n = 349) endorsing at least one and 5.0% (n = 52) endorsing all of them. However, we identified evidence that not all participants who endorsed these conspiracy theories sincerely believe them. Strikingly, we found that of the 19.6% of participants (n = 205) who failed at least one of two sincerity checks, 63.9% endorsed at least one conspiracy theory (n = 131) and 26.0% (n = 51) endorsed all six, while of the 80.4% of participants (n = 839) who passed both sincerity checks, only 26.0% endorsed at least one conspiracy theory (n = 218) and only 0.1% endorsed all six (n = 1). Overall, our results suggest that a substantial minority of participants answering surveys endorse conspiracy theories that they do not sincerely believe.",

Zastosowano narzędzia do pomiaru komponentów miłości oraz poziomu otwartości. Wyniki analizy korelacji nie wykazały istotnych statystycznie związków pomiędzy otwartością na doświadczenia, a intymnością, namiętnością czy zaangażowaniem. \n\nUzyskane dane mogą sugerować, że otwartość, mimo swej teoretycznej roli w relacjach interpersonalnych, nie jest bezpośrednio powiązana z deklarowanymi poziomami miłości w romantycznych relacjach.

          "abstract": "Alexithymia, a personality trait marked by difficulties identifying and describing feelings and an externally oriented thinking style, is frequently linked to interpersonal problems and psychopathology. Drawing on the extended process model of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER), we conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in Germany (N = 128) and in the United States (N = 220) to examine how alexithymia shapes processes of responding to others’ emotions, a potential mechanism underlying social difficulties. Across 5,552 reported social interactions, alexithymia and its dimensions were associated with less emotionally attuned and more emotionally distant IER goals and strategies. Notably, cultural and sample differences emerged, suggesting context may modulate observed associations. In Study 1 (Germany), higher overall alexithymia and externally oriented thinking were linked to disengagement from others’ emotions. In Study 2 (U.S.), alexithymia predicted greater use of counter-hedonic goals and problem-focused strategies along with reduced use of relationship-oriented strategies such as validation and soothing. Disengagement and engagement tendencies varied across alexithymia dimensions and cultural contexts, but both studies indicated a consistent pattern of reduced emotional attunement in IER. These findings extend existing research by showing that alexithymia not only affects self-regulation but also significantly shapes how individuals respond to others’ emotions. IER difficulties may represent a key mechanism linking alexithymia to interpersonal problems and psychopathology. Interventions may benefit from explicitly targeting IER skills, particularly by promoting hedonic regulation goals and relationship-oriented strategies.",

This study aimed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of two breathing techniques—the Wim Hof method and physiological\nsighing—in regulating psychophysiological arousal during penalty kicks. The technique\ninvolved a sample of young soccer players aged 16 to 19, whose arousal levels were\nmeasured using the CSAI-2 questionnaire. Participants were categorised according to their\ninitial arousal profile and then underwent a three-phase protocol consisting of a baseline\nassessment, an appropriate breathing intervention, and longitudinal follow-up. The results\nshowed that the Wim Hof technique did not lead to a significant improvement in penalty kick\nperformance, despite a slight decrease in psychological arousal; no significant correlation was\nfound between arousal variation and performance.\nIn conclusion, although these breathing techniques may moderate players' arousal levels, no\nimprovement in penalty kick success was found. Coaches are therefore encouraged to\napproach these interventions with caution. Furthermore, the limitations of the protocol\n(notably the absence of high arousal profiles in the sample) call for future research\nincorporating complementary physiological measures to refine our understanding of the link\nbetween arousal regulation and performance.",

          "abstract": "Our decisions do not occur in a social vacuum. Instead, we often have to decide whether to help, harm, or learn from the consequences of our actions when they affect other people. Neuroeconomists have long highlighted how social preferences for fairness, trust and altruism fundamentally shape how we interact with others (Fehr &amp; Camerer, 2007). These preferences are exhibited when people make choices that result in a conflict between self and other preferences. More recently, researchers have extended these concepts to situations that are not financially costly for oneself to probe altruistic behaviours where they are perhaps purely other-regarding (Lockwood, Apps &amp; Chang, 2020). This section considers several factors that influence social preferences and social decision-making in humans and in other animals. It considers helping or prosocial behaviours before revealing some of the influence and neural circuitry that underpins when we need to interact with another person strategically. The section then probes how other people’s choices may, in fact, influence our own, before ending with an overview of how frameworks from ethology can provide new approaches to integrate findings from human and non-human animal research.",

          "abstract": "Children’s early conceptual development appears marked by robust preferences for both literal interpretations and realistic outcomes. Traditionally studied separately, these preferences clash in metaphor comprehension as literal interpretations can often be unrealistic. We explored how 4- to 8-year-old children navigated these competing preferences in a metaphor comprehension task. By doing this, we also aimed to challenge the fantastical thinking account, which suggests that children’s literalist interpretations of metaphorical statements stem from a tolerance for fantastical outcomes. In Experiment 1, we found that children, like adults, are sensitive to the reality status of literal versus metaphorical referents. In Experiment 2, children successfully derived metaphorical meanings when no competing literal options were present. However, the presence of literal interpretations significantly impacted performance. Although these interpretations violated the real-world context, only adults fully disregarded the fantastical literal options in favor of the realistic metaphorical ones. These findings suggest that children’s literalist responses result more from the influence of literal meanings than from an inability to derive metaphorical interpretations from prior context or a lack of sensitivity to real-world plausibility.",

The current study addressed this gap, by examining parental exhaustion and its contributing factors in parents with ADHD. \n\nMethod: Participants (n=118, 91.5% female) were parents who had been diagnosed (50%) or self-identified (50%) as having ADHD. Parents completed an online survey including measures of emotional exhaustion in the parental role and emotional distancing from one’s child. Demographic characteristics and measures of sensory sensitivity and perceived social and healthcare support were examined as potential contributing factors using linear regression models. \n\nResults: We observed four key findings. First, parents with ADHD reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, and to a lesser extent, emotional distancing. Second, emotional exhaustion and distancing showed few significant differences by demographic, diagnostic and family characteristics. Third, sensory sensitivity predicted both greater emotional exhaustion and distancing from one’s child. Fourth, parents’ feelings of isolation were associated with greater parental exhaustion, while reporting a strong support network and positive interactions with healthcare providers were protective. \n\nConclusion: Experiences of parental exhaustion are common among parents with ADHD, particularly among parents who experience heightened sensory sensitivity and low social support. The findings suggest a greater need for neurodiversity-informed approaches to support for parents with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "An important aspect of psychometric model application is the choice of a suitable algorithm for parameter estimation. Particularly in the case of large datasets and high dimensional models, conventional algorithms may be inapplicable or relatively slow. Therefore, in a recent publication, Urban and Bauer (Psychometrika 86:1-29, 2021) proposed an estimation algorithm from the field of deep learning which is suitable for binary or ordered categorical data. In practice however, researchers may be interested in adding continuous response times to the model. As it has yet not been studied whether the resulting model for responses and response times is viable, in this article, we investigate the accuracy of this estimation method for a multidimensional variation of the joint model for responses and response times proposed by Van der Linden (Psychometrika 72: 287-308, 2007). Our evaluation focuses on comparing the effects of different sets of hyperparameters on the accuracy of the estimation method. Our results indicate that the deep learning algorithm can be used for accurate item parameter estimation of these models even in relatively small datasets. In addition it is computationally fast in large datasets, but it's accuracy depends on the number of importance-weighted samples and Monte Carlo samples. We applied the method to an empirical dataset from PISA 2018 related to mathematics and reading.",

Therefore, this study investigated between-person differences and within-person changes in ICT literacy over approximately nine years in a sample of N = 2,266 adults from Germany. The result showed that younger adults exhibited higher ICT literacy than older adults, but within-person changes did not differ by age. On average, ICT literacy declined over time (Cohen’s d = -0.30). Men consistently demonstrated higher ICT literacy than women (Cohen’s d = 0.39), though gender did not influence changes in ICT literacy. Socioeconomic status did not robustly moderate these effects. No gender differences were found in the variance of ICT literacy. These findings suggest that ICT literacy tends to decline across adulthood, while preexisting gender differences, likely rooted in earlier socialization processes, persist without substantial change.",

While significant associations have been found between FFR parameters and SIN performance, inconsistent results across studies raise questions about the exact relationship between FFR and SIN perception. To clarify these relationships, we recorded the neural signals of 116 young healthy adults in response to a two-vowel /oa/ syllable, with a rising pitch ending, in two different background conditions: in quiet and in noise. In addition, the behavioral performance in a SIN perception task was assessed. Results showed that noise significantly impacts the FFR, enhancing responses to the fundamental frequency and improving pitch contour tracking, while simultaneously degrading responses to formants and harmonics and increasing neural transmission delay. Among the FFR measures, only the response to the first formant of /a/ showed some partial association with performance in the SIN perception task. Our results point to the FFR as a reliable biomarker of SIN auditory processing, but limited support as a relevant biomarker of SIN perception, at least among healthy young adults. These results underscore the need for further research to clarify the specific neural mechanisms underlying SIN perception.",

          "abstract": "As people age, declines in social cognition and more specifically Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, have been frequently reported. More than a decade ago, Henry et al. (2013) conducted a foundational meta-analysis on age-related ToM differences, reporting consistent declines in older adults regardless of task features. Since then, the literature has expanded substantially, extending their conclusions while also revealing inconsistencies that highlight the complexity of age-related ToM differences. Considering this, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to reassess these differences and examine whether task-related characteristics moderate the effects, directly building on the work of Henry et al. The analysis included 69 studies and tested various (and novel) moderators such as task domain (cognitive, affective, mixed), modality (verbal, visual-static, visual-dynamic), task type (e.g., False Belief, Eyes Task, Faux Pas), ecological validity, and respondent perspective (first-, second-, third-person). Results confirmed and extended previous findings, highlighting persistent age-related ToM deficits. However, none of the examined moderators significantly influenced this effect, suggesting that the decline reflects a general difficulty with ToM in older adults rather than one driven by specific task characteristics. Notably, most tasks relied on third-person perspectives and lacked ecological validity, highlighting the need for more ecologically valid, interactive, and second-person paradigms. Such approaches may help clarify whether tasks that are more engaging, socially meaningful, and reflective of real-world interactions could positively affect older adults’ ToM performance.",

          "abstract": "How do children learn to count? Acquisition of number words and their representation of quantity (Cardinality Principle; CP) is commonly assessed with Wynn’s (1990; 1992) give-a-number (Give-N) task. However, results and methods are inconsistent across studies with this task, contributing to theoretical debates about how children acquire number knowledge. The primary aim of this project was to review these debates, and to evaluate systematically a graphical knower-level model of number word acquisition (Lee &amp; Sarnecka, 2010), by analysing both the model fit and predictive error across seven Give-N datasets. Data were sourced from studies with French-, Hungarian-, and English-speaking children (N = 823) aged 24-86 months (M = 49.7). The model described most children’s number word acquisition with a high degree of confidence, and reported 29.6% of participants had applied the CP to their entire counting list (CP-knowers). Fits to data appeared to be reasonably good, but analyses revealed systematic error between model predictions and data. Most notably, predictions for children who had only applied the CP to a subset of their counting list (subset-knowers/N-knowers) were significantly higher than performance in trials for N + 1 and N + 2 (where N is the capacity of this subset). Additionally, performance error was reviewed for each knower-level individually. Ultimately, our results suggested that Lee and Sarnecka’s model did not accurately account for children’s behaviour on the Give-N task. Moreover, this highlights that the knower-level account of children’s number word acquisition may not effectively describe this process.",

However, speakers from different language communities cannot rely on these shared conventions.

In a pre-registered experiment, we presented Italian speakers with words and instructed them to come up with corresponding German translations. The resulting German-like pseudowords were then shown to German speakers, who were asked to guess the original words. Supporting our hypotheses, results showed that the German participants' guesses were semantically closer to the original words than to randomly selected control words.

Traditional cognitive models often overlook the narrative and phenomenological dimensions of patient experience, particularly how autobiographical narration and emotionally charged worldviews mediate lived experience.\nObjectives:\nThis study aims to explore (i) how worldviews are shaped by emotion and memory in psychiatric illness, and (ii) how narrative forms provide existential coherence in psychopathology. The research adopts a multidisciplinary approach integrating psychiatric, phenomenological, linguistic, narratological, and hermeneutic perspectives, through an in-depth case study.\nMethods:\nA single-case study design was employed, focusing on \"Benjamin,\" a 60-year-old male with a lifelong history of bipolar disorder type I and suspected Asperger’s syndrome. Data sources included clinical interviews, autobiographical writings (five book-length texts), and clinical observation. Analyses were conducted using phenomenological, narratological, and linguistic frameworks to trace the evolution from self-narration to worldview construction.\nResults:\nBenjamin’s case illustrates a transition from immediate self-description to the development of a coherent, philosophy-like worldview. His autobiographical narratives reveal the interplay between minimal and narrative self, with mood episodes influencing both self-experience and identity coherence. Emotional memories—regardless of factual accuracy—serve as organizing phenomena, providing existential structure and meaning. The study highlights the limitations of cognitive schema theory and underscores the importance of narrative scaffolding and affect-logic in shaping worldviews.\nConclusions:\nThe findings demonstrate that in comorbid bipolar disorder and Asperger’s syndrome, autobiographical narration and emotionally charged worldviews play a crucial role in mediating lived experience and existential coherence. Integrating phenomenological and narratological approaches yields a deeper understanding of selfhood and meaning-making in psychopathology, with implications for clinical assessment and intervention.\nKeywords:\nBipolar disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, phenomenological psychopathology, narrative self, worldview, autobiographical memory, affect-logic, case study",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "authors": "Guangyu Zhu; Li Qian Tay",
          "abstract": "In complex social systems, efforts to optimize proxies that supposedly reflect system goals can paradoxically lead to outcomes that undermine those very goals. This phenomenon is known as proxy failure. Proxy failure stems from the fact that certain  shortcuts can enable the optimization of proxies without truly advancing the system's goals. Building  on recent attempts to provide a unifying framework for proxy failures across domains, the current study investigates a central question: Why do shortcuts that undermine system goals repeatedly emerge and spread in complex social systems? \nUsing an agent-based model with reinforcement learning agents, this study simulates 7 experiments to investigate the individual, social, and network-level factors that contribute to the discovery and diffusion of shortcuts. Results revealed that, (1) at the individual level, agents with weaker prior knowledge, higher exploration tendencies, and greater planning depth were more likely to discover shortcuts; (2) at the social level, frequency-biased learners tended to abandon shortcuts when surrounded by many neighbors, and the early success (or failure) of a pioneer  agent (those who discovered shortcuts in early stages) had cascading effects on shortcut adoption across layers of agents; and (3) at the network level, shortcuts diffused more readily in dense and highly modular networks, while clustering showed no significant impact. Crucially, when hub nodes acted as pioneers, shortcut adoption was both faster and more persistent. \nThese results together suggest that proxy failure is not solely a consequence of flawed proxy design, but also a product of the cognitive, social, and structural dynamics. The findings, along with the computational framework developed, offer a foundation for the design of more robust and resilient social systems against proxy failure.",

          "abstract": "The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is widely used in developmental research to assess core dimensions of psychopathology and has been used as the main such measure in the landmark Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which comprises over 11,000 individuals receiving comprehensive, longitudinal assessments during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Despite rapid and widespread use of the CBCL in this sample, the hierarchical structure, subscale validity, item-level measurement properties, and measurement precision of the instrument in this sample remain unclear. Here, we use a multi- method framework integrating confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Bayesian CFA (B-CFA), factor mixture modelling (FMM), item response theory (IRT), and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) in an analysis of baseline ABCD data (N=11,861; 6,188 male; age range 8–11 years) to identify fundamental psychometric limitations of the CBCL. Specifically, we show that neither bifactor nor unidimensional models adequately capture the CBCL’s structure, as indexed by measures of poor global and local model fit and substandard amounts of explained variance. Subscale-level analyses further reveal insufficient construct validity for seven of eight subscales. IRT revealed poor measurement precision across the latent trait continuum, particularly at lower severity levels; a failure of item response options to discriminate between different levels of the latent traits; and a high item overlap in differentiating individual differences in the latent traits. IRT-based refinement of subscale item content failed to resolve these issues. Exploratory methods yielded unstable factors with weak discriminant validity. These findings challenge the CBCL’s utility as a dimensional measure of psychopathology in the ABCD study. We caution against uncritical use of CBCL sum scores or latent constructs within this dataset and advocate for measures explicitly validated for the assessment of dimensional psychopathology in population-scale research.",

This paradox may appear to be in direct conflict with the very definition of the Bayes factor and therefore must be addressed.

One foundational context for emotion prediction is goal-directed action: people often feel positive emotions when goals are achieved and negative emotions when goals fail. Across four experiments (N = 160), we examined whether 16- to 18-month-old infants and 3-year-old children expect different emotional responses following completed versus failed goals. Using looking-time and forced-choice methods, we found that infants showed emerging, though variable, expectations for happiness following successful goal completion (Experiments 1-3), and children reliably predicted happiness in these contexts (Experiment 4). In contrast, infants did not consistently expect a negative emotion to follow failure. Still, 3-year-olds did not reliably predict sadness in response to failure. These findings suggest that emotion-outcome reasoning is asymmetrical early in development: while success-happiness mappings emerge early and strengthen over time, failure-sadness predictions may require more contextual support and develop more gradually.",

An increase in cannabis use among parents could be important because cannabis has been linked to parenting quality in cross-sectional studies.\nMethod: Analyzed 2012-2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual representative survey of U.S. residents aged ≥12. We estimated the prevalence of cannabis use outcomes in parents vs. non-parents and tested whether trends in cannabis use outcomes among parents vs. non-parents differed.\nResults: In 2023, 7.8% of parents used cannabis on the majority of days, 4.9% of parents used cannabis daily, and 5.7% of parents met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Since 2012, daily cannabis use has increased a nearly identical amount in parents vs. non-parents. Four times as many parents used cannabis daily in 2023 vs. 2012, and the rate of CUD among parents has increased 1.3x since 2020 (when first measured). Significant increases have occurred in parents across sociodemographic groups, but are largest in parents who are younger, unmarried, lower income, and have less than a BA.\nConclusions: Daily cannabis use among parents went from quite rare in 2012 (1 in 80 parents) to fairly common in 2023 (1 in 20 parents). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest ≥5.7 million children in the U.S. now live with a parent who uses cannabis on the majority of days.

          "abstract": "One fundamental characteristic of humans is that we have both “exteriors” (i.e., behavior) and “interiors” (i.e., mental states). This distinction between the mind and behavior is critical for our understanding of human nature, bearing consequences for moral deliberation, societal functioning, and social lives in general. Culture influences the extent to which people attend to mental states and behaviors. In this review, we propose that the mind carries greater significance in Western White cultural contexts (i.e., a mind focus) and behavior carries greater significance in East Asian contexts (i.e., a behavior focus). Focusing specifically on East Asian societies, we first examine local cultural models of the mind-versus-behavior focus in Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. We then draw on three established culture-level constructs—self- construal, relational mobility, and cultural tightness-looseness—to examine their potential role in mind-versus-behavior foci. Synthesizing these theoretical models, we propose a novel historical- evolutionary theoretical framework to explain cultural differences in the mind-versus-behavior focus beyond an East-West comparison. Rooted in the notion of cultural evolution of theory of mind, our theoretical framework links cultural tendencies to foster a mind or behavior focus to social ecologies that place varying demands on the mind in facilitating human sociality. Finally, we review empirical evidence of cross-cultural differences in the mind-versus-behavior focus, drawing from three fields—theory of mind, parenting, and alexithymia. This review not only provides preliminary evidence supporting different cultural emphases on mind versus behavior in Western White and East Asian societies, but also presents a theoretical framework for investigating similar phenomena across other societies.",

          "abstract": "Why do we exercise? To date, the most popular justification for movement has centered around physical health, typically operationalized through biomechanical outcomes such as muscular strength or cardiovascular capacity. This reductionist view produces narrow adaptations that leave individuals vulnerable to complexity in the real world, and ignores the embodied nature of our minds.\n\nWe present an alternative framework, drawing on insights from enactive cognitive science and the Active Inference Framework. Combining notions of the human as nested agents across scales, we recast health as competent problem solving across scales (from cellular to whole-organism) and spaces (anatomical, physiological, conceptual). Using an approach to movement informed by enactivism and active inference, we provide two examples of such an approach in practice. This reframing should allow for increased adaptability and expression across the human lifespan, and has implications in all domains of movement development.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

Naukowcy mówią o różnych możliwych czynnikach powodujących zazdrość oraz prezentują różne sposoby, na które wykazują ją odmienne płcie. Mężczyźni mierzą się z niepewnością ojcostwa i martwią się o seksualną zdradę ze strony partnerki, kobiety zaś wiedzą, że to one urodziły, jednak martwią się zdradą emocjonalną ze strony partnera. Moje badanie odniosło się do tego, czy posiadanie dzieci z partnerem zmniejsza zazdrość o niego. Według uzyskanych przeze mnie wyników, tak właśnie jest. Osoby, które mają dziecko ze swoim partnerem, są mniej o niego zazdrosne. Dziać się tak może z racji na wiele czynników wyjaśnionych w tejże pracy.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy-supportive parenting is essential for positive developmental outcomes for youth whereas psychological control can have detrimental effects. When parents’ psychological needs are met, they are more likely to show autonomy-supportive parenting; and when parents report greater psychological need frustration, they are more likely to parent with psychological control. We tested how parental psychological needs can predict adolescent internalizing mood through parenting practices in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries for 14 days to rate parental psychological needs, parenting practices, and adolescent internalizing mood. We conducted multilevel mediation analyses (i.e., 1-1-1 and 2-2-2 design) to examine the effect of parental psychological needs on adolescent internalizing mood through parent parenting practices. When parents’ daily psychological needs were met, they practiced more supportive parenting practices in daily life, which in turn was associated with better adolescent mood. Most of these mediation effects were not found when examining long-term characteristics. Our findings point towards the importance of disentangling day-to-day fluctuations in behaviors and experiences than to long-term associations between them in families’ daily lives to better understand family dynamics and adolescent well-being.",

We examined moment-to-moment emotion dynamics in mother-adolescent conflicts and their concurrent and longitudinal associations with depressive and anxious symptoms. At Time 1 (2018), dyads were recorded during a 4-minute conflict discussion, and their emotional expressions were coded. At Time 1 and Time 2 (2019), participants reported internalizing problems. Time 1 data included 198 parent-adolescent dyads while Time 2 data included 177 parents and 176 adolescents. We used grid sequence analysis, a data-driven method in which common multi-step sequences of dyadic emotions can be identified, to examine different interaction patterns between mother-adolescent dyads. We used structural equation modeling to test the associations between these patterns and internalizing symptoms. We found two sequence patterns. Mother and adolescent anxious symptoms were not related to interaction sequences; however, the pattern of mutual high positive emotion up-regulation was related to adolescent depressive symptoms concurrently and negatively, and the pattern of mothers’ regulation of adolescents’ externalizing negative emotion was related to maternal depressive symptoms concurrently and negatively. Thus, internalizing problems are associated with the momentary interaction patterns during mother-adolescent conflicts.",

Overall, the Short TriPM had many strengths, including strong support for the three-factor structure, good internal consistency, strong item fit, and essentially no gender-based differential item functioning.

FL emotionality is examined by employing a validated emotion measure PANAS-X; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, (Horne et. al, 2016) prior to (Pre-test Emotion Measure) and following moral judgements (Post-Test Emotion Measure). 106 participants (NL; Greek, FL; English) were presented with moral dilemmas where after reading each one of them they had to rate how likely it would be to commit the hypothetical action stated in the dilemma. Participants’ current emotional states and moral decisions were collected in each language in a within-subjects design using an induced-language context paradigm. Results revealed a clear FLE, with reduced emotionality scores of Negative Affect and Hostility in the FL compared to the NL. Hence, we provide conclusive evidence in support of the reduced emotionality hypothesis, suggesting that making decisions in an FL lead to more rational outputs by reducing emotional biases.",

          "abstract": "Social interaction is often formed according to the way a person stands or moves; that is, it has a great influence on our perception of emotions, our opinion about other people, and the conversation between people. Although it is a huge factor in our everyday lives, most of the interpretations are merely generalizations and some basic body language tips. This article is aimed at discussing the scientific ways in which our brain participates in nonverbal communication, incorporating the latest discoveries in the fields of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary theory.\nConsidering the triune brain concept developed by Paul D. MacLean, this paper will examine how the distinct yet functioning together parts of the reptilian brain (survival), the limbic system (affect), and the neocortex (refined thinking and social interaction) contribute to the comprehension of nonverbal language. The amygdala is featured in the quick identification of meaningful emotions, the mirror neurons are linked with reflecting and empathy of emotions of other people, and the prefrontal cortex is involved in suppressing intense emotions. This discussion demonstrates, with the help of the results of neuroimaging and lesions, and various tests, how the participating brain areas interact to correctly perceive and interpret body movements and gestures.\nThis article attempts to give a better understanding of the fact that nonverbal communication is biologically and evolutionarily grounded by integrating empirics and theoretical approaches. By taking this measure, it also expects to enhance scholarly literature as well as distinguish itself among veneer-thin explanations by demonstrating, in detail, how the brain processes body language signals.",

          "abstract": "Demand characteristics are a fundamental methodological concern in experimental psychology. Yet, little is known about the direction, magnitude, and consistency of their effects. We conducted a three-level meta-analysis of 252 effect sizes from 52 studies that manipulated explicit demand characteristics (EDCs). On average, EDC’s led to small overall increases in hypothesis-consistent responding (g = 0.21, 95% CI [0.12, 0.31]). However, the effects were heterogeneous (between-study τ = 0.28; within-study σ = 0.18), with the prediction interval ranging from g = 0.89 (a large increase in hypothesis-consistent responding) to g = -0.46 (a moderate decrease in hypothesis-consistent responding). Consistent with previous theorizing, the observed and estimated distribution of these effects suggest that demand characteristics can create false positives, false negatives, upward bias, and downward bias.

          "abstract": "Explanatory virtues like simplicity are often used to evaluate explanations’ probabilities. The current work aimed to better understand how and why this occurs, by testing two questions: 1) whether simplicity is used as an alternative to computing with probabilities, or in combination with probabilities, and 2), whether simplicity is used for the goal of increasing the accuracy, or efficiency, of explanation evaluations. To test this, the current studies asked participants to compare simple (one-cause) and complex (two-cause explanations), while reporting their reliance on simplicity and probability information, and while inducing a goal to be either accurate or efficient in one’s explanation evaluations. Results showed that simplicity was typically used in combination with probability information, and that the use of simplicity increased when participants had an accuracy goal, suggesting it was used to try increase accuracy, rather than efficiency. This work provides greater insight into how simplicity is used to navigate the cognitive and informational limitations people face when comparing the probability of different explanations in everyday life.",

Previously used methods do not provide clear evidence whether associations between IGT performance and psychopathology are general across multiple forms of psychopathology or are specific to individual disorders. In this study, we examined IGT performance across anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior: reward and punishment learning rates, win-frequency sensitivity, and response bias. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and diagnostic history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is often deemed a “wicked problem” due to complex interactions between many variables and the resulting uncertainty for decision-making. This complexity can be a barrier to sustainable action. But how can individual perceptions of complexity in sustainability be operationalized, and how are these perceptions related to support for climate policy and sustainable behavioral intentions? Drawing on a theoretical framework of complex decision-making, we constructed and validated a scale to measure the perceived complexity of sustainability (PCS) across three studies in the UK (total N = 1,176). Exploratory (Studies 1 and 2) and confirmatory (Study 3) factor analyses supported a three-factor scale structure, comprising effectiveness uncertainty, trade-offs between different environmental actions, and conflicts between sustainability and other goals. We found the 12-item PCS scale to be a reliable and valid measure that correlates positively with climate change skepticism and negatively with support for climate policy and sustainable behavioral intentions. Understanding the perceived complexity of sustainability can help in developing guidelines for scientists and governments to communicate about climate change responses to the public.",

          "abstract": "Being a parent significantly impacts workplace experiences, with diverse and intersecting identities, including gender, sexual orientation, marital status, and family structure, playing a crucial role in shaping these experiences. However, work-family literature has largely concentrated on mothers in heterosexual, married couples, and the growing diversity of parent identities remains understudied. To map current knowledge and highlight gaps to inform more inclusive research and workplace policy, this systematic review addresses four questions: (1) How are parents with different genders and family characteristics represented in the workplace literature? (2) What are the key foci and findings regarding intersecting social identities? (3) What challenges and biases do diverse working parents face based on their gender and career stage? (4) What strengths associated with parenthood have been explored? Our analysis of 181 journal articles from Industrial/Organizational Psychology, Organizational Behavior, and related fields reveals limited attention to diverse family structures, intersecting social identities, and later career stages of working parents, as well as a lack of strength-based approaches. We identify critical avenues for future research aimed at addressing current gaps and broadening theoretical understanding.\nKeywords: Parenthood, motherhood, fatherhood, intersectionality, strength",

Such digital interactions  – containing limited physical cues – may yield distinct effects on interaction quality and post-interaction emotional states compared to face-to-face exchanges. In this study, we examine four preregistered hypotheses on the within-person interplay between interaction mode (i.e., digital vs. face-to-face interactions), interaction quality, and momentary well-being. We use data from two samples (N1 = 216, N2 = 21) with  T1 = 5116 and T2 = 1348 Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) of interaction mode, interaction quality, and different momentary well-being measures (i.e., affect valence, loneliness, positive affect, negative affect). Estimating multilevel mediation Structural Equation Models, we find no within-person differences in interaction quality between digital and face-to-face interactions in Sample I. Contrary to our expectations, the quality of interaction in Sample II was rated higher during digital interactions than face-to-face interactions. Interaction quality was positively associated with momentary well-being measures in both samples. Momentary well-being was higher after face-to-face interactions than digital interactions in Sample I, but not in Sample II. Interaction quality did not mediate the relationship between interaction mode and momentary well-being – rather, it moderated the relationship in Sample I. As we do not observe evidence for a mediating effect, it remains an open empirical question through which pathways digital social interactions differ from face-to-face interactions in their effect on momentary well-being.",

          "abstract": "This case study examines a persistent cognitive-emotional cycle in which vivid, positively charged mental imagery—initially intended to motivate performance—paradoxically becomes associated with task failure and occupational frustration. The subject, through prolonged self-observation, reports a recurring pattern wherein imagined success precedes underperformance, gradually forming an internal belief that hopeful anticipation leads to disappointment. This maladaptive association appears to stem from a mismatch between idealized internal simulations and real-world outcomes, fostering emotional fatigue, behavioral hesitation, and diminished self-efficacy. By integrating insights from cognitive psychology and affective neuroscience, this study highlights the counterproductive effects of excessively idealized mental imagery, challenging the assumption that positive visualization is uniformly beneficial. The findings underscore the need to differentiate between adaptive and maladaptive forms of cognitive anticipation in both clinical and everyday contexts.",

Our results showed that only the ACTION PLAN candidate component had a significant effect on depressive symptoms at 2-week (d=−0.18) and 8-week (d=−0.12) follow-ups. Additionally, user’s perceptions of the intervention’s credibility and their expectations of improvement were significantly associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms at both time points.

          "abstract": "Functional specialization within high-level vision is reflected in the topographic organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC). The presence and consistent locations of small areas responding selectively to particular visual categories – such as faces and scenes – has led to proposals of innate domain-specific modules. However, such proposals do not easily explain other aspects of an apparently multi-scale topographic organization of high-level visual features in VTC. Computational models have recently accounted for the presence of domain-selective areas and other facets of topographic organization from a basic optimization process with local topographic pressures, such as locally constrained connectivity, but fail to account for the consistent location of category-selectivity. In the current work, we extend a recent computational model to demonstrate how this consistency may emerge from wiring constraints external to VTC, focusing on the role of retinotopically organized early visual representations. After training several random initializations of the model, we find consistent global topographic organization, with face- and scene-selectivity emerging on opposite ends of a medial-lateral gradient corresponding to eccentricity bias, similar to human VTC. As in human VTC, the eccentricity-biased topography persists across viewing sizes under sufficiently broad viewing bias distributions, suggesting that it is a learned bias for efficiently organizing representations proximal to the most useful inputs, rather than merely an explicit retinotopic code. Abolishing the retinotopic constraint abolishes topographic consistency, but not topographic organization. Our work suggests that the organization of high-level visual cortex may emerge from domain-relevant interactions between viewing biases and task demands with an innate retinotopic scaffold. More generally, we suggest that both local and global connectivity constraints interact with representation learning to produce mature cortical organization: local constraints pressure the system towards smooth organization, whereas long-range constraints encourage a consistent global layout.",

          "abstract": "Managing our natural resources often involves learning about the dynamics of the resource while society simultaneously harvests from the resource. However, little is known about how society’s actions affect our ability to learn about a vulnerable resource. Here, we investigate how experience managing a shared resource impacts one’s ability to learn about the underlying dynamics of a resource. We hypothesised that participants' capacity to learn from experience would depend on the behaviour of other group members. 320 participants played a four-player resource management game with computer partners who acted sustainably, unsustainably, or conditionally cooperatively. Participants’ ability to learn the underlying resource dynamics was then assessed in a subsequent single-player resource management game, where the social dynamics were removed and the participants’ understanding of the resource could be evaluated in isolation. Compared to controls with no prior experience, performance on the single-player game improved after experience with sustainable and unsustainable partners, but not after experience with conditionally cooperative partners. However, experience with a single-player game (rather than a group game) outperformed all other experimental conditions; thus individual experience improved performance more than experience in any group dynamic tested. These findings suggest that the presence of others generally hinders learning in resource management contexts, though how much this learning is hindered depends on the behaviour of others.",

Quantitative systematic reviews offer researchers a method to synthesise large bodies of literature, helping to clarify inconsistent findings, identify research gaps, and refine theoretical models. However, existing tutorials often assume prior knowledge and/or experience, often overlooking foundational concepts. To address this gap, a comprehensive walkthrough of the systematic review process is presented, covering pre-registration, literature search and retrieval, screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction following the PRISMA framework. We then present detailed guidance on how to conduct both traditional and multilevel meta-analyses in R. Specifically, the tutorial explains how to estimate overall meta-analytic effect sizes when effect sizes are independent (traditional meta-analysis) and when effect sizes are nested within labs (multilevel meta-analysis). Procedures for assessing heterogeneity, testing for publication bias, and conducting moderation analyses are also covered. To accompany this tutorial, we supplement annotated R scripts and R notebooks to support transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility for researchers of all levels of experience.",

It is designed to measure habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. We evaluated the psychometric performance of the ERQ-S in a clinical sample. Methods: 531 individuals with various mental health diagnoses completed the ERQ-S and other psychometric measures of clinically-relevant constructs. Results: The ERQ-S demonstrated a theoretically congruent two-factor structure, good internal consistency, and expected patterns of associations with other constructs, supporting its validity. Conclusions: Our data suggest the ERQ-S exhibits strong psychometric properties in clinical populations.

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence indicates that perception is shaped not only by external stimuli but also by rhythmic signals originating from the heart, lungs, and stomach. These ongoing internal bodily rhythms can modulate sensory processing, influencing both low-level detection and higher-order functions such as emotion recognition and social decision-making. The first part of this review outlines the physiology of each organ–brain axis and synthesizes current findings on how cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms modulate perceptual experience. Altogether, current findings highlight the role of interoceptive rhythms in shaping moment-to-moment perceptual outcomes. Although these effects can differ based on specific task demands, a pattern emerges in the literature: in certain instances, perception may vary based on the dynamic distribution of signal processing resources between internal bodily states and external environmental stimuli. Acknowledging the limitations of existing experimental paradigms, the second part of this review seeks to build on these empirical findings by proposing strategies to improve the ecological validity and generalizability of interoception-perception research. Our analysis of participant demographics across the reviewed studies highlights the necessity for more diverse demographic representation. We also propose the integration of multimodal physiological recordings and wearable technologies, alongside the creation of more dynamic paradigms that can capture behaviors in real-world contexts. These recommendations are intended to enhance both the representativeness and ecological validity of interoception-perception research. By linking traditional laboratory paradigms with more naturalistic settings, this review and framework may pave the way for a deeper understanding of how interoceptive signals influence perception in everyday life. Last, we briefly explore emerging theoretical models that, when integrated with ecologically relevant designs, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of embodied cognition.",

          "abstract": "Dissociative experiences are prevalent in young people, where they are associated with greater clinical severity of co-occurring difficulties and increased risk of self-harm and suicide. Recent research suggests transdiagnostic dissociation plays a role in the development and maintenance of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and psychosis, and may therefore constitute a novel early intervention target. The current study builds on our previous work developing an explanatory theoretical model of transdiagnostic dissociation by piloting therapeutic techniques that target implicated mechanisms. Our aim was to establish proof of concept, such that successful techniques could be incorporated into future treatment development. We recruited 9 NHS patients (ages 16 to 23) to a series of three multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED) studies. Every participant received four sessions of individual CBT, with each SCED addressing a different mechanism implicated in the theoretical model: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Results across all studies were limited by low phase stability of the target measures, but indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success in targeting perseverative thinking and affect intolerance. Where cognitive appraisals improved, results suggested distress about dissociation also improved. There was negligible evidence of this for perseverative thinking, but a weak positive signal for affect intolerance. Qualitative feedback from participants illustrated the need to combine therapeutic strategies into a more comprehensive intervention with more sessions. These findings inform treatment development for transdiagnostic dissociation in youth and advance understanding of its causal aetiology, supporting future research.",

This section explores myriad mechanisms through which choice is influenced by affect, feedback from others, and interpersonal relationship dynamics.  By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics and computational modeling, the chapters here consider the complex ways in which emotion and social context influence how we value choice options, exert and desire agency, and develop preferences.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) capacity may influence students’ math performance together with their affective experiences, such as math anxiety (MA) and math interest. It has also been suggested that the influence of affect on performance might go through WM. The negative relationship between MA and math performance is well-established, and some studies have found WM to mediate this association. However, little is known, first, about the relationship between WM and math interest, and second, about the potential mediating effect of WM between interest and math performance. This study examined the direct and mediated effects of MA and interest through WM on fourth graders’ (N = 332) performance in arithmetic fluency, while controlling for generalized anxiety. Findings from structural equation modeling showed MA to predict performance negatively, while the effects of WM and interest were positive. There was a negative indirect effect from MA through WM on performance indicating partial mediation, while a corresponding, but positive, effect was not found for interest. Our results suggest that while both negative and positive affective experiences are related to math performance, the role of WM in explaining this link may be more pronounced regarding MA than interest.",

          "abstract": "A seminal study by Triplett provided initial evidence for the social facilitation effect, and over the last century, research has demonstrated this effect across a range of settings. However, despite the importance attributed to Triplett’s study, no research has replicated the original study paradigm. Furthermore, in the context of research advances and methodological rigour, some elements of the original study weaken the validity of the observed findings. We address these critical limitations and replicate the original study, employing a standardized study protocol to minimise potential confounds, such as practice effects. This research reports on 445 school-aged children (Mage = 10.8, SD = 1.3) who completed the study. As pre-registered in our Stage 1 submission, using a purpose-built apparatus, participants turned a crank to move a marker along a string course between two pulleys. Pairs of participants completed this task four times, twice alone and twice together. Trial order was standardized and balanced to control for possible order/practice effects. In line with Triplett’s original study, we show that participants completed the task faster in the together condition than in the alone condition. We also show interesting variability depending on age and gender, as well as demonstrating “carry-over” effects. Thus, we replicate and extend this classic finding, adding to the literature on social facilitation/competitive coaction. In addition, the materials and methods developed here provide a template for future studies to further examine this phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "Learning and decision-making are deeply embedded in our social world. Our choices occur in the presence of others, are shaped by social expectations and can have significant impacts on both our and others’ welfare. While these topics have been of interest to psychology and cognitive neuroscience for many years, recent efforts have incorporated model-based approaches to formalize the mechanisms through which our choices are influenced by social input. Combined with fMRI, our understanding of the role of neural circuits involved in reward related behavior and social cognition in supporting such mechanisms has grown exponentially. In this chapter, we will first discuss the utility of incorporating computational approaches into studies of social learning and decision-making. Next, we will review recent evidence regarding how social outcomes can impact our choices and social learning. We will then discuss how social rejection can impact our desire for agency and social contact. We also discuss the importance of social sharing in real-time interactions and social media environments and how this phenomenon fits into a framework of value-based choice that can shape social connection. Last, we will review recent work regarding how the value of social relationships shapes computational mechanisms underlying decisions to trust and take risks. We will conclude with future directions for the field, including merging computational approaches with individual differences, cutting-edge methodologies, and naturalistic paradigms to provide a more comprehensive picture of how the social world modulates choice and neural function.",

          "abstract": "An important aspect of psychometric model application is the choice of a suitable algorithm for parameter estimation. Particularly in the case of large datasets and high dimensional models, conventional algorithms may be inapplicable or relatively slow. Therefore, in a recent publication, Urban and Bauer (Psychometrika 86:1-29, 2021) proposed an estimation algorithm from the field of deep learning which is suitable for binary or ordered categorical data. In practice however, researchers may be interested in adding continuous response times to the model. As it has yet not been studied whether the resulting model for responses and response times is viable, in this article, we investigate the accuracy of this estimation method for a multidimensional variation of the joint model for responses and response times proposed by Van der Linden (Psychometrika 72: 287-308, 2007). Our evaluation focuses on comparing the effects of different sets of hyperparameters on the accuracy of the estimation method. Our results indicate that the deep learning algorithm can be used for accurate item parameter estimation of these models even in relatively small datasets. In addition it is computationally fast in large datasets, but it's accuracy depends on the number of importance-weighted samples and Monte Carlo samples. We applied the method to an empirical dataset from PISA 2018 related to mathematics and reading.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive aging is characterized by a deterioration of episodic memory functions. Since episodic memory requires retrieval of context, it has been proposed that older adults suffer from a specific deficit in terms of remembering context associated with to-be-remembered information. At the same time, however, it has been argued that providing context information at the time of retrieval can ameliorate age-related memory deficits. These positions can be reconciled if older adults show a deficit in encoding specific item-context associations but demonstrate a preserved ability to retrieve item-context associations when both items and contexts are provided as cues. In two experiments, we demonstrate such a pattern of deficits and preserved functions by asking younger and older adults to encode pairs of words embedded in contexts, then varying whether these contexts are reinstated when the same pairs of words are restudied. We then examine how this manipulation affects – via spontaneous retrieval of item-context manipulations – metacognitive monitoring of the effectiveness of restudy in the form of judgments of learning (JOLs). Experiment 1, using semantically unrelated contexts, showed context reinstatement effect in JOLs only for younger adults. Experiment 2, promoting encoding of context for older adults by using semantically related contexts, showed greater context reinstatement effect for older than younger adults. Together, these result show how older adults fail to encode specific contextual associations, but if they do encode them, they experience no deficit in spontaneous retrieval of these associations from complete cues.",

Special attention is given to Chapters 27–38, including her iconic vision of pure inner light and the Transverberation experience. We argue that Teresa’s imaginative and intellectual visions display a striking resemblance to structured forms of endogenous light perception, particularly in the advanced phases of phosphene progression. To contextualise these findings, we compare her descriptions with those of Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) and Tibetan yogis such as Milarepa (c. 1052–c. 1135) and Longchenpa (1308–1364), revealing a cross-cultural phenomenological consistency. This analysis supports the hypothesis that experiences of mystical luminosity represent a shared neurophenomenological substrate underlying diverse contemplative traditions across time and culture.",

W swojej ankiecie wzorowałam się trójczynnikową teorią miłości Sternberga, w skład której wchodzi : intymność, namiętność i zaangażowanie oraz Kwestionariuszem SWLS. Zgodnie z moimi założeniami wyniki sugerują, że miłość ma większy wpływ na satysfakcje niż liczba dzieci.  Poczucie spełnienia i namiętności w relacji odgrywa ważną rolę w poczuciu jakości własnego życia, co także może wpływać na liczbę i chęć posiadania dzieci. Każdy z trzech komponentów miłości miał istotną korelację z komponentem satysfakcji. Najwyższy z nich był pomiędzy komponentem zaangażowania a satysfakcją. Liczba dzieci nie miała znaczącego wpływu na satysfakcję z życia. Oznacza to, że im bardziej pary są zakochane i spełnione w związku, tym większe mają poczucie jakości własnego życia.",

We investigated these issues in a large, population-based cohort in Stockholm County, Sweden, linked to prospectively-collected ratings of neighbourhood-level social capital.\n\nMethods: All Swedish-born people living in Stockholm County between 2002-2016, aged 14-64 years, were followed from cohort entry until first diagnosis of ICD-10 severe mental illness (non-affective psychotic disorder, affective psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder without psychosis), out-migration from Stockholm County, 65th birthday, death, or 31 December 2016, whichever was sooner. We derived three neighbourhood-level social capital exposures (political trust, welfare trust, personal trust) for 813 neighbourhoods, averaged from individual scores from 23,510 independent, randomly-selected respondents to the 2002 Stockholm County Public Health survey; most respondents were Swedish-born to two Swedish-born parents (72.2%). We used multilevel proportional hazards models of each outcome-exposure association, adjusted for extensive confounder sets informed by directed acyclic graphs. We tested a priori interactions between social capital exposures and parental region-of-origin, and inspected the sensitivity of our models to various scenarios, including endogeneity of our social capital measures. \n\nResults: Our cohort included 1,467,128 participants, of whom 17,760 (1·2%) received a first diagnosis of severe mental illness during follow-up. Greater neighbourhood-level personal trust was associated with reduced incidence of non-affective psychotic disorder, but only amongst those of Swedish (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] associated with a one standard deviation increase in trust: 0·91; 95%CI: 0·84-0·98) or European (aHR: 0·80; 95%CI: 0·69-0·92) heritage (interaction p-value: &lt;0·0001). Conversely, greater neighbourhood-level personal trust increased these rates for those of North African and Middle-Eastern (aHR: 1·46; 95%CI: 1·08-1·96) or Sub-Saharan African (aHR: 1.76; 1.00-3.08; p=0·049) heritage. We observed similar effect modification for bipolar disorder without psychosis (p&lt;0·0001), but not affective psychotic disorders (p&lt;0·79). Political and welfare trust showed few associations with any outcome. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including two instrumental variable approaches. \n\nInterpretation: Social capital had longitudinal effects on several mental health outcomes, but could be protective or harmful depending parental region-of-origin, a potential indicator of outgroup position.",

On the individual level, maintenance goals are essential to both mental and physical wellbeing, while on the societal level, they are vital for pro-social and pro-environmental behavior. Nevertheless, to date, there is no integrative framework for understanding peoples’ efforts to maintain the current state of affairs. To shed light on this crucial psychological construct, we dive into predominant theories on approach-avoidance goals and promotion-prevention regulatory focus, and return with an integrative theoretical framework of basic goal types. We propose a mechanistic model with three broad goal categories, distinguishing the pursuit of maintenance goals from both progress and protection goals. We contrast our account with alternative accounts wherein maintenance is sorted under progress goals or under protection goals, we detail ways to empirically test our propositions on the nature of maintenance, and we discuss broad implications of our theoretical framework for theory and empirical research in diverse fields of psychological science.",

          "abstract": "Non-alcoholic beer (NAB) is often presented as a healthier alternative to alcoholic drinks - one that offers a similar sensory and social experience, but does not come with the health risks of alcohol. Despite NAB sales rising, many people are still unfamiliar with non-alcoholic beer; others are aware of its existence, but not willing to try it. Based on previous research showing that external features can influence the perception of food and drinks, we predicted that the text included on NAB labels would affect its attractiveness and desire ratings. In two pre-registered online studies (Study 1: n=212 women 18-25 years old; Study 2: n=188 women over 55 years old), we presented participants with labels of fictitious NAB brands. There were five categories of label text: (1) brand-only (passive control), (2) origin-production (active control), (3) sensory-hedonic, (4) social, (5) health. We assessed the perceived attractiveness of NAB and anticipated desire for it, depending on the label presented. Among younger women, sensory-hedonic and health labels increased the attractiveness of and desire for NAB, compared to both control labels. Social labels did not increase desire, compared to origin-production labels. Among older women, sensory-hedonic and health labels also increased the attractiveness of and desire for NAB, compared to control labels. There was no significant effect of social labels on attractiveness or desire, compared to the origin-production labels. Our findings suggest that labels can be a powerful tool for increasing the attractiveness of NAB, and labels emphasising health and sensory-hedonic features are particularly impactful.",

          "abstract": "Background: Quantitative instruments are essential in psychology and social sciences, yet persistent validation deficiencies may compromise research integrity and evidence-based practice.\n\nObjective: To systematically quantify validation compliance rates across psychological and social science research, identifying systematic deficiencies in measurement practices.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA 2020 and COSMIN 2024 guidelines, the author searched four major databases for empirical validation studies (January 1, 2020–May 31, 2025). Random-effects meta-analyses employed restricted maximum likelihood estimation with a logit transformation; three-level models were used to address dependencies. Heterogeneity was assessed via I², τ², and 95% prediction intervals; publication bias was examined using PET-PEESE regression and selection models.\n\nResults: 248 studies (34,567 validation procedures; 52 countries) were included. Measurement invariance compliance declined by level: configural 68.4% [48.1–84.7], metric 41.7% [22.8–63.4], scalar 23.8% [11.2–44.7], strict 12.3% [5.1–27.4]. Sample size adequacy was achieved in 47.2% [24.1–71.8]. Open science practices showed low adoption rates: preregistration (19.7% [9.1–37.4%]), open data (31.4% [14.2–55.8%]), and code availability (15.8% [7.2–31.1%]). Geographic and disciplinary disparities emerged, with cross-domain instruments exhibiting lower validation quality. Publication bias adjustment reduced scalar invariance compliance to 18.3%.\n\nConclusions: Validation deficiencies are prevalent, posing a significant threat to the integrity of research. Fewer than 25% verify scalar invariance, under 50% meet sample size criteria, and transparency practices remain underutilized. Coordinated interventions, including training, editorial policies, and funding support, are crucial for strengthening validation standards.",

          "abstract": "The reinforcement learning framework provides a computational and behavioral foundation for understanding how agents learn to maximize rewards and minimize punishments through interaction with their environment. This framework has been widely applied across disciplines, including artificial intelligence, animal psychology, and economics. Over the last decade, a growing body of research has shown that human reinforcement learning often deviates from normative, objective standards, exhibiting systematic biases. The first aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework and taxonomy for evaluating computational biases within reinforcement learning. We specifically propose a distinction between praxic biases, characterized by a mismatch between internal representations and selected actions, and epistemic biases, characterized by a mismatch between past experiences and internal representations. Building on this foundation, we characterize two primary types of epistemic biases at the computational level: relative valuation and biased update. We describe their behavioral signatures, discuss their potential adaptive roles, and explore their implications for applied research. Finally, we eleborate on how these findings may shape future developments in both theoretical and applied domains. Notably, despite being widely used in clinical and educational settings, reinforcement-based interventions have been comparatively neglected in the domains of public policy and decision-making, particularly when compared to more popular approaches such as nudges and boosts. In this review, we offer an explanation for this comparative neglect that we believe rooted in common historical and epistemological misconceptions, and advocate for a greater integration of reinforcement learning into the design of behavioral public policy.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on emotion regulation abilities has primarily focused on individual strategies and their association with (a lack of) well-being and psychopathology. Recent frameworks add emphasis to the importance of a context-sensitive and goal-dependent approach to emotion regulation, defining emotion regulation flexibility as the ability to adaptively adjust emotion regulation strategies based on contextual demands and personal goals. Despite growing evidence for its relevance in psychological well-being and psychopathology, a concise self-report measure capturing trait-level, strategy-independent ER flexibility has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed the Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER-Scale), designed to assess the context- and goal-dependent variability of emotion regulation strategies. The scale was derived from theoretical models of emotion regulation flexibility and validated using data from three independent samples (N = 857). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) examined the scale’s structure, and criterion validity was assessed via correlation with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The final 10-item FlexER-Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory item discrimination and high internal consistency (α = .85). EFA suggested a two-factor structure, differentiating the ability to upregulate negative and downregulate positive emotions as a separate factor. The FlexER-Scale correlated significantly with psychological well-being (r = −.244, p &lt; .001), supporting criterion validity. The FlexER-Scale provides a novel, psychometrically sound tool for assessing trait-level emotion regulation flexibility. It offers a concise alternative to existing assessments by capturing adaptive regulatory variability without restricting specific strategies. Future research should further examine its construct validity, as well as its longitudinal stability, predictive and ecological validity to further elucidate its role in psychological well-being and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Open Research takes on diverse forms, reflecting the unique challenges, practices, and opportunities within different disciplines. These variations underscore the importance of tailoring open research principles to the specific contexts of each field. The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) case studies provide a window into this diversity, highlighting how researchers from varied domains implement openness and transparency in their work.Openness and transparency are foundational to research integrity, as outlined in the UK Concordat to Support Research Integrity. They foster rigour, constructive scrutiny, accountability, and enable others to build on existing research. However, the practical application of these principles can vary significantly across disciplines, shaped by the methodologies, norms, and constraints of each field.\nThis series of case studies, from genuine researchers (some anonymised), shows how trailblazing researchers navigate and exemplify open research practices in their respective areas. By illustrating these individual approaches, the aim is to foster a deeper understanding of the shared values and distinct challenges of open research across disciplines. Additionally, these examples offer valuable insights for those supporting open research through training, policy development, or incentives.",

These are interventions aiming to increase uptake of or adherence to health protective behaviours. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics and effects of these interventions. Methods: For the review, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for studies on behavioural interventions. Out of 690 identified articles, 35 studies were considered relevant for this review. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) (Higgins et al., 2019). Results: The majority of studies researched the effects of interventions on social or physical distancing, handwashing, or face coverings. Many studies explored the effects of different types of messages, for example, promoting health protective behaviours. Message-based, online interventions were most common, but largely showed small to negligible effects. Some studies explored other intervention types such as coaching sessions and found moderate to large effects. Conclusion: While the results of these studies indicate that some interventions increase adherence, large heterogeneity in study and intervention design make it difficult to interpret and compare the effects of different interventions. Both an improvement of methodological rigour and standardisation efforts are needed to make behavioural research usable for policy design.",

          "abstract": "Many scientific theories imply equality and inequality constraints on the statistical model underlying the observed data. Incorporating such constraints into hypothesis testing increases the efficiency and precision of inference. However, existing tools of testing such hypotheses are computationally expensive and do not scale well to complex sets of constraints. Here, we introduce Sampling in Constrained Space (SICS), a highly general approach for performing Bayesian hypothesis testing on constrained models. Through a simple reparameterization, SICS allows the efficient sampling of the posterior distribution from those sections of the parameter space that fulfill all constraints. This, in turn, enables estimating the marginal likelihood under the constrained model, through established algorithms such as bridge sampling. We demonstrate the versatility of SICS by analyzing a learning task dataset using constrained reinforcement learning models, from both a single-level and hierarchical perspective. Our results show that SICS outperforms previous approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. By providing guidelines on its application, we hope to make SICS an integral part of scientists' inferential toolkit.",

          "abstract": "As economic and employment conditions become more unstable, many people worry about making ends meet and their overall financial situation. Against this backdrop, guided by Conservation of Resources Theory and insights from behavioral economics and cognitive psychology, this study aimed to estimate relationships between financial stress and several predictors, to include income (both annual and weekly), payment schedule, weekly expenses, weekly debt repayment complexity, and weekly overspending. We did so by analyzing data collected from 324 US-based workers across nine weekly occasions (totaling 2,916 weeks) using hierarchical generalized additive models. Results showed that income (both annual and weekly), weekly expenses, weekly debt repayment complexity, and weekly overspending predicted financial stress, but these relationships were, generally, complex and nonlinear. We also found some variability at the occasion level. These findings have key implications for the financial stress literature. First, as money comes and does, so does financial stress; that is, financial stress is an episodic and fluctuating construct for many workers and should be investigated as such. Second, financial predictors (including newer predictors, such as debt repayment complexity and overspending) and financial stress are not related in a linear fashion. Third and lastly, relatively small sums of money seem to have large effects on perceptions of financial stress.",

          "abstract": "Developmental aphantasia is characterised by an absence of visual mental imagery, with many \nresearchers concluding that it is not a disorder. However, impairments in facial identity \nprocessing and elevated cooccurrence with developmental prosopagnosia (i.e., lifelong troubles \nrecognising faces) are common in neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism and \ndevelopmental coordination disorder. If aphantasia were to exhibit similar characteristics, then \nit would support claims that it too may be a neurodevelopmental condition. Confirming this \nhypothesis, aphantasia was associated with a greatly increased cooccurrence of developmental \nprosopagnosia (i.e., 14-36%) in contrast to the general population (i.e., ~2-3%). As a group, \nthose with aphantasia exhibited objective problems in holistic perception, unfamiliar face \nmemory, and familiar face recognition. In a second study, we found qualitatively similar \npatterns of face processing issues between aphantasia and developmental coordination \ndisorder. We propose that these problems, coupled with an elevated prevalence of \nprosopagnosia, could be a transdiagnostic feature of some neurodevelopmental conditions, \nrather than a condition specific occurrence. In a final study, we tested whether aphantasia \nprevalence was elevated within developmental prosopagnosia; strikingly, 16% of these cases \nwere aphantasic, in contrast to the 4% reported in the general population. Aphantasia’s higher \ncooccurrence with developmental prosopagnosia, and comparable patterns of face processing \ndifficulties to developmental coordination disorder, confirm its status as a neurodevelopmental \ncondition should be reconsidered.",

These experiences of loneliness are linked to well-being and a wide range of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. However, our understanding of the aetiology and sequelae of youth loneliness, as well as the development of preventative measures and interventions, has been hampered by a lack of scales that can accurately capture the authentic experiences of young people.\n\nMethods: Here, we provide a protocol for developing and validating an age-sensitive loneliness scale for young people aged 10-24 years: the Youth Loneliness Scale (YLS). The scale will be designed to measure loneliness in the general population of young people in the United Kingdom. The scale development process will follow a multi-step approach, going from item generation to psychometric evaluation. Item generation will include a combination of verbal and non-verbal techniques to enable broad expression of what it means to be lonely as a young person. The scale has been and will be co-produced with young people from design to dissemination.\n\nDiscussion: The protocol provided here allows researchers to evaluate the final scale generated against the plans set out here. We also encourage the use and adaptation of the protocol to develop age-sensitive loneliness scales in other cultural contexts and for other populations.",

          "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop — in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) — the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.",

The framework synthesizes six interconnected components: individual foundations, adaptation processes, contextual factors, coaching mechanisms, growth outcomes, and sustainability elements. We present specific testable hypotheses, operationalization strategies, and methodological approaches for empirical validation.

          "abstract": "Many psychological phenomena can be understood as systems of causally connected components that evolve over time within an individual. In current empirical practice, researchers frequently study these systems by fitting statistical models to data collected at a single moment in time, that is, cross-sectional data. This poses a central question: Can cross-sectional data analysis ever yield causal insights into systems that evolve over time, and if so, under what conditions? In this paper, we address this question by introducing Equilibrium Causal Models (ECMs) to the psychological literature. ECMs are causal abstractions of an underlying dynamical system that allow for inferences about the long-term effects of interventions, permit cyclic causal relationships, and can in principle be estimated from cross-sectional data, as long as information about the resting state of the system is captured by those measurements. We explain the conditions under which ECM estimation is possible, show that they allow researchers to learn about within-person processes from cross-sectional data, and discuss how tools from both psychological measurement modeling and the causal discovery literature can inform the ways in which researchers collect and analyze their data.",

          "authors": "Evangeline Wandag",
          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

          "abstract": "Computational phenomenology has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating advanced meditation states and stages, and meditative development and endpoints. Various models have been proposed to mechanistically explain the diverse experiences associated with these practices, including enhanced well-being, attentional shifts, and defabrication, as well as minimal phenomenal experiences and meditative endpoints. However, these models have developed in disparate directions, and an integrative understanding of the underlying mechanisms of advanced meditation remains elusive. This review examines how computational models attempt to account for the phenomenology of advanced meditation, with a particular focus on Active Inference as a modeling framework. We find that a key point of convergence across models is the role of precision weighting as a driver of experiential shifts. Furthermore, we observe a marked difference between early models, which emphasize top-down attentional modulation toward interoception or specific focus objects, and later models which center on layer-specific precision re-weighting within the meditator’s hierarchical generative model. These differences arise from variations in the models' aims, scope, and definitions of contemplative practice. Few models address reported increases in cognitive flexibility and learning from meditation, fundamental mechanisms behind informal practice and affective processes, as well as processes underlying compassion traditions, remain underexplored. Addressing these gaps is crucial for refining computational models of advanced meditation and informing our understanding of its cognitive, affective, and experiential effects.",

This study examined the relationship between the cognitive and affective dimensions of alexithymia, the multidimensional facets of empathy, and their association with the risk of affective disorders. A total of 391 Japanese participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing alexithymia, empathy, emotion regulation, and symptoms related to affective disorders. The results revealed that cognitive alexithymia was associated with diminished cognitive empathy and heightened personal distress, which in turn predicted higher levels of affective disorders. In contrast, affective alexithymia was negatively associated with personal distress and affective symptoms, suggesting a potential adaptive role in reducing the risk of affective disorders symptoms. Furthermore, while reappraisal is generally regarded as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, its effectiveness depends on the level of alexithymia. These findings highlight the complex nature of alexithymia and its interactions with empathy and emotion regulation. Rather than providing a perspective on alexithymia as a maladaptive trait, our results suggest that it may have both adaptive and maladaptive aspects. These findings emphasize considering individual differences in emotional processing when examining mental health outcomes and developing interventions.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study aimed to account for heterotypic continuity of multiple dimensions of psychopathology by using developmental scaling to place ratings by multiple informants of children’s externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\n\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N = 231) development of three dimensions of psychopathology—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered psychopathology—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from different measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\n\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task. Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach.\n\nConclusion: Using (a) changing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link the scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying the development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Trauma is risk factor for multiple psychiatric diagnoses, but whether this transdiagnostic effect occurs because trauma influences levels of underlying maladaptive traits that give rise to clinical symptoms is unclear.  Moreover, whether the psychological effects of trauma are moderated by critical factors such as trauma type, dose, survivor sex, and age of trauma, has seldom been comprehensively explored. Here, we examined the effects of sexual and interpersonal violence trauma on five core dimensions of trait-level psychopathology derived empirically from a transdiagnostic battery acquired in 842 community-dwelling adults with diverse mental health histories (37.89% male; M Age=29.73, SD Age=7.77). We found that a single instance of sexual trauma was robustly associated with both Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy dimensions and was sufficient to attenuate pre-existing sex differences in the expression of these trait dimensions. Age of onset, nor cumulative exposure, influenced trait severity. In contrast, interpersonal physical violence exerted a dose-response effect on Antisocial Schizotypy, particularly in males. A single exposure to interpersonal physical violence was associated with elevated Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy when first experienced before ages 16 and 25, respectively. Females showed greater susceptibility to age of onset effects for Negative Affectivity than males. These findings indicate that trauma influences specific, transdiagnostic domains of psychopathology, potentially driving the emergence of diverse symptom profiles that meet criteria for different diagnoses. Critically, these effects vary by trauma type, sex, and age, underscoring the need for a personalized approach to trauma-informed research and care.",

          "abstract": "Cluster B personality disorders—narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial—are marked by emotional dysregulation, interpersonal dysfunction, and manipulative relational patterns. This paper explores the psychological architecture underlying these disorders, emphasizing how manipulation and control emerge as core adaptive strategies rooted in neurobiological, endocrinological, and developmental vulnerabilities. Drawing from neuroscience, pharmacology, and developmental psychology, this work proposes a biopsychosocial model that integrates genetic predispositions, hormonal dysregulation, trauma histories, and environmental influences. Clinical implications include a multi-tiered treatment framework combining targeted pharmacological interventions, psychotherapeutic modalities, and systemic relational support.

These models were followed with rigorous tests of construct validation (i.e., convergent, discriminant, and concurrent) on the latent factors using a Multitrait-Multimethod framework. Comparing across non-Hispanic white (n=7,166), Hispanic (n=2,411), and non-Hispanic Black (n=1,862) youths, the five-factor model comprising of Externalizing, Neurodevelopmental, Internalizing, Somatoform, and Detachment factors demonstrated configural, metric, scalar, and strict measurement invariance. While each of the five factors demonstrated good evidence of concurrent and convergent validity, evidence for their discriminant validity was not as robust. Establishing measurement invariance and construct validity of the HiTOP model has critical scientific and clinical implications, particularly if dimensions are to be used in addressing mental health disparities in minoritized populations.",

          "abstract": "The human visual system recruits adaptation mechanisms that enhance perceptual sensitivity over time. However, such mechanisms can also introduce substantial perceptual biases, disrupting stable perceptual experiences. Research on serial dependence has suggested that the visual system promotes stability by mechanisms that integrate new sensory inputs with inputs obtained in the recent past. Yet, it remains unclear when and how such mechanisms operate. The present study tested the hypothesis that adaptation produces a repulsive bias during earlier processing, which is later mitigated by post-perceptual decision processes at the time of report. In two orientation perception tasks, observers used a mouse to reproduce the orientation of a briefly presented target. We recorded the mouse trajectory to track the temporal dynamics of their reproduction responses. We found that the mouse reports began more slowly when the current stimulus was similar to the prior stimulus. In the mouse-tracking data, the initial phase of the response exhibited a strong repulsive bias away from the prior stimulus, but this bias diminished significantly as the response unfolded, ending with either weaker repulsion or small attraction depending on task contexts. These findings provide strong evidence that prior stimuli induce an early repulsive bias, which is then mitigated through post-perceptual decision processes during the response. This suggests that the visual system balances the competing demands of sensitivity and stability by reducing early repulsive biases through higher-order decision mechanisms, optimizing behavior in a given task context.",

This comprehensive examination explores the neurobiological and familial determinants that contribute to the development of NPD, with particular emphasis on the root pathological mechanisms that drive narcissistic behaviors and cognitions. Through an evidence-based lens, this manuscript investigates the fundamental wounds of unlovability and shame that form the core of narcissistic pathology, examining how these deep-seated psychological injuries manifest through idealization and devaluation cycles that serve as protective mechanisms against overwhelming emotional pain.\n\nThe research presented herein demonstrates that individuals with NPD employ sophisticated delusional frameworks to maintain psychological equilibrium, often remaining unconscious of the psychological burden these defenses impose until experiencing narcissistic collapse. This collapse represents a critical juncture where the individual must confront the reality of their condition and the underlying wounds that have driven their pathological behaviors. The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of the neurobiological substrates underlying NPD, including alterations in brain structure and function that contribute to the disorder's characteristic features.\n\nFurthermore, this work examines the familial and environmental factors that contribute to NPD development, focusing on early childhood experiences that create the foundational wounds of unlovability and shame. The paper presents evidence-based treatment approaches that address these root causes within the family system context, offering clinicians practical frameworks for intervention. The findings suggest that effective treatment must address both the neurobiological vulnerabilities and the deep-seated psychological wounds that maintain narcissistic pathology, requiring a comprehensive approach that integrates individual and family-based interventions.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,000). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower climate anxiety and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing global concern about climate change, current action remains insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Psychological research finds that publics often overestimate the effectiveness of low-impact individual climate actions (e.g., recycling) and underestimate high-impact behaviours (e.g., flying less). However, the prevalence of these misunderstandings among climate-concerned individuals and their connection to behaviour remain unclear. Developing this understanding is crucial, as such misperceptions could cause motivated individuals to prioritize low-impact climate actions over high-impact behaviours, limiting societal potential to mitigate climate change. Using one survey in the UK (N = 294) and two in the USA (N = 800 and N = 406), we find that even climate-concerned individuals systematically overestimate the impacts of low-impact actions and underestimate high-impact behaviours. We also find an association between perceived impact of climate actions and behavioural engagement, suggesting that such misperceptions hinder efforts to reduce climate change. We explore several explanations for these misperceptions. We find that most of the dominant causes proposed in the literature are not associated with participants’ perceptions of impact. We do, however, find some evidence suggesting that misinformation about specific behaviours, causal conflations, action familiarity, and the perception that behavioural engagement is driven by self-serving intentions are related to misperceptions of the impacts of climate actions, among those most concerned about climate change.",

In addition, the subjective appearances of mental qualities also bear a constitutive relation to perceptual role, since each subjective appearance consists in its subjectively appearing as it does when one perceives some specific type of object.  So quality spaces constructed from perceptual role can also be used to characterize those subjective appearances.  And since subjective appearance depends on perceptual role, the tie mental qualities have to perceptual role is more fundamental than that with subjective appearance.  Quality spaces are useful in the first instance for objectively representing discriminable stimuli, and derivatively for objectively representing the corresponding mental qualities in respect of both their perceptual roles and their subjective",

          "abstract": "Objective: Many of humanity’s biggest problems, such as managing our shared resources, are long-term collective action problems, where we must learn to cooperate with each other over time. However, research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of the cause of this is vital to inform policy advocating long-term cooperation. One hypothesis is that increasingly uncooperative behaviour is driven by a few uncooperative actors – if a few act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to act sustainably even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these hypotheses. Method: Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiments 1) and earned tickets to a raffle (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e. where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing the long-term gains of each player. Results: By the third game, only 9.12% of participants used the resource sustainably. We demonstrate that this failure is likely due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. Conclusions: These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

Prior research identifies question complexity as a key predictor of question creativity and problem-solving ability. However, little is known about how accurately individuals assess their own question complexity. Across three studies, participants generated questions and self-rated their complexity and creativity. We then compared their self-ratings to objective computational model scores. In Study 1 (N = 100), self-rated question complexity showed a weak correlation with model ratings (r = .151). Study 2 (N = 100) replicated and strengthened this relation (r = .206), revealing a stronger correlation for question creativity (r = .321). We also found bias effects for complexity: participants underestimated the complexity of their high-level questions and overestimated their low-level ones. In Study 3 (N = 101), participants read a training brief before rating, which significantly improved accuracy in self-assessing complexity (r = .453) and creativity (r = .487) and eliminated overestimation. Our study highlights the challenges in self-assessment of questions and prominent cognitive biases. Crucially, our study also shows that brief explanations of question complexity substantially improve self-assessment accuracy, highlighting practical implications for educational strategies aimed at enhancing metacognitive awareness of question-asking ability.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the ways in which large language models (LLMs) can be used for the purpose of experimental philosophy. LLMs can be used in different ways for different purposes in experimental philosophy (Section 2). Among others, we focus on what we call the “non-predictive” research, in which LLMs’ “intuitive” responses to thought experiment cases are not expected to be predictive of, or analogous to, human subjects’ intuitive responses to them (Section 3). In effect, the non-predictive research regards LLMs’ responses as superior to human subjects’ responses, at least for the purpose of experimental philosophy. We argue that the non-predictive use of LLMs in experimental philosophy is highly motivated. Firstly, human subjects’ intuitive responses tend to be vulnerable to irrelevant factors and conceptual misunderstandings, which raises a serious worry concerning the reliability of their responses. Secondly, it is possible in the near future that LLMs can overcome these problematic factors to which human subjects are subject. As a case study, we conducted an experimental study in which we examined LLM’s “intuitions” on free will and determinism (Section 4). Our mixed results suggest that while current LLMs outperform human participants in terms of comprehension—especially in understanding deterministic scenarios—they remain highly sensitive to irrelevant factors such as framing and question order. These findings indicate that although LLMs have promising potential, they are not yet reliable sources of stable and unbiased philosophical intuitions. We conclude that substantial technical improvements are required before artificial intuitions can serve as superior alternatives to human intuitions in philosophical research.",

Identifying individuals at risk of first-onset CMDs is crucial for screening and early prevention efforts. Because personality traits are stable and conceptually close to psychopathology, they may outperform existing established risk factors such as demographic, environmental, and biomarker screens. Using data from the Estonian Biobank (N ≈ 77,000) linked with medical registry records over a 20-year period, we tested whether Big Five domains and their single-item \"personality nuances\" predict first-onset depressive, anxiety, stress/adjustment, somatoform and non-organic sleep disorders. Elastic-net logistic regression compared models based on demography, domains, nuances, and their combinations, assessed by area-under-the-curve (AUC) and cross-disorder predictions. Nuances gave the highest discrimination (mean AUC = 0.71), outperforming demographics (0.59) and domains (0.66); performance peaked for recurrent depressive disorder (AUC = 0.78). Neuroticism dominated domain-level prediction, followed by conscientiousness, while key nuances reflected low fun-seeking, poor relaxation, and intense emotions. Similar accuracy across diagnoses indicated that personality captures a largely transdiagnostic risk signal rather than disorder-specific liability. Brief item-level personality screens could therefore provide a simple, quick, low-cost tool for flagging high-risk individuals. These screens could guide preventive mental health interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: A central challenge in affective and cognitive science is to explain how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (mu) dynamically shape subjective experience. Although both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms of their interaction—and their role in individual differences in mood and cognition—remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes the coupling between G and mu. Bifurcation analysis of a potential function V(Ms) yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–mu plane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and mu through hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\nResults: Canonical cusp (saddle-node) and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts that correspond to psychological phenomena ranging from stable belief convergence to cognitive (attitude) polarization (bistability) and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G = 1, mu = 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics (SGBD) extension represents person-specific traits with structural matrices, capturing unique “gain fingerprints” and mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics through its integrated treatment of gain–bias coupling and its governing bifurcations. This provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for longitudinal self-report, experience-sampling, and neurophysiological studies. It thus offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, psychiatry, and human-centric AI.",

In this essay, I argue that time, as experienced by conscious beings, is not a fundamental structure of the universe but a construct of the mind, built from reasoning, memory, and perception of change. We do not sense time directly; we react to difference and assemble temporal models to stabilize our experience.\n\nI propose that each individual builds a personal time model through pattern recognition and cognitive sequencing — and when reasoning ceases, time as we know it ceases for that individual. This approach reframes time not as an external entity but as a mental interface for organizing change, with profound implications for consciousness studies, memory, trauma, and even artificial intelligence.\n\nTime may not govern us — we may construct it moment by moment as a tool for tracking motion, meaning, and intent.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the cognitive biases underlying baccarat gambling behaviors through an analysis of 17,970,830 games played by 6,625 customers in a casino. Baccarat, a popular high-stakes game in East Asia, involves predicting the outcome of two hands, where the results are inherently unpredictable, similar to the structure of games such as roulette. In contrast to existing theories predicting the emergence of the gambler’s fallacy—or negative recency—when the outcome generation mechanism is clearly random, most baccarat gamblers exhibit the opposite bias, demonstrating a tendency toward positive recency. Specifically, customers increasingly placed bets on future outcomes to match past consecutive outcomes as streaks grew longer. This trend-following behavior diminished when streaks were interrupted, ruling out explanations based on the “hot outcome” fallacy, which is typically associated with adaptive behaviors such as resource foraging. Moreover, betting amounts increased slightly but reliably when gamblers followed trends. These findings provide new insights into cognitive biases in gambling, challenge established theories of positive and negative recency, and underscore the importance of considering the unique structural characteristics of specific games when studying gambling behavior. This perspective may also contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological and problem gambling.",

          "abstract": "Functional specialization within high-level vision is reflected in the topographic organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC). The presence and consistent locations of small areas responding selectively to particular visual categories – such as faces and scenes – has led to proposals of innate domain-specific modules. However, such proposals do not easily explain other aspects of an apparently multi-scale topographic organization of high-level visual features in VTC. Computational models have recently accounted for the presence of domain-selective areas and other facets of topographic organization from a basic optimization process with local topographic pressures, such as locally constrained connectivity, but fail to account for the consistent location of category-selectivity. In the current work, we extend a recent computational model to demonstrate how this consistency may emerge from wiring constraints external to VTC, focusing on the role of retinotopically organized early visual representations. After training several random initializations of the model, we find consistent global topographic organization, with face- and scene-selectivity emerging on opposite ends of a medial-lateral gradient corresponding to eccentricity bias, similar to human VTC. As in human VTC, the eccentricity-biased topography persists across viewing sizes under sufficiently broad viewing bias distributions, suggesting that it is a learned bias for efficiently organizing representations proximal to the most useful inputs, rather than merely an explicit retinotopic code. Abolishing the retinotopic constraint abolishes topographic consistency, but not topographic organization. Our work suggests that the organization of high-level visual cortex may emerge from domain-relevant interactions between viewing biases and task demands with an innate retinotopic scaffold. More generally, we suggest that both local and global connectivity constraints interact with representation learning to produce mature cortical organization: local constraints pressure the system towards smooth organization, whereas long-range constraints encourage a consistent global layout.",

          "authors": "Dorian Aur",
          "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, suicidal behavior is rarely impulsive. Research increasingly shows that it stems from dysfunction in specific areas of the brain that may include the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, and temporal lobes responsible for judgment, impulse control, and emotional regulation. When these regions are impaired, individuals may struggle to assess consequences, manage distress, or access hope. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, including EEG and SPECT, have identified abnormal activity patterns in these brain regions in individuals at high risk for suicide. This biological basis helps explain why some people develop persistent suicidal thoughts and why using precise targeted therapies like TMS will restore healthy brain function. Recognizing suicide as a brain-based medical issue shifts the conversation from blame and bridge barriers for suicide to reliable prevention and effective treatment. With barriers in place, without timely and effective mental health therapy, suicide risk and mental health problems will likely escalate from self-harm to potential harm to others. Viewing suicide as purely spontaneous has misdirected prevention strategies.",

While in ALS literal action-language impairment was negligible, in HSP-SPG4 it affected up to 50% of the patients with the expected disadvantage for lower-limb verbs.

          "abstract": "The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) has long served as a paradigm for understanding multisensory integration and body ownership. Traditional interpretations emphasize neural mechanisms and cognitive suggestibility, but they fall short of identifying the illusion’s fundamental cause. This paper proposes the Soul-Drift Hypothesis (SDH), a novel conceptual framework that attributes the RHI not to illusion but to the displacement of a non-neural perceptual medium—here hypothesized as the \"soul\"—from the physical body to the rubber hand. Drawing on observational data from individuals reportedly able to perceive soul displacement, we define a new metric, the Soul Displacement Score (SDS), and outline two experiments to empirically test the hypothesis. The first assesses participants’ ability to identify tactile stimuli after visual cues are removed, while the second predicts RHI strength based on prerecorded soul displacement indicators. By integrating interdisciplinary insights from perceptual psychology, consciousness studies, and nonconventional observation, this work challenges prevailing neurocognitive explanations and lays the groundwork for a new research direction into the nature of subjective perception. If supported, the Soul-Drift Hypothesis may reframe how body ownership, sensory integration, and even consciousness itself are conceptualized in both psychology and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the psychosocial and community risk factors associated with financial exploitation is essential in developing prevention strategies. Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

Cognitive Control Training (CCT) has shown promise in improving these impairments, but is typically delivered according to a fixed schedule, irrespective of individual symptom trajectories. This study examined whether delivering just-in-time CCT booster sessions, tailored to personal depressive symptom patterns, could enhance outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nIn a randomized controlled trial, 138 remitted depressed individuals first completed a 10-session fixed CCT schedule. Following this, participants were randomly assigned to either a booster group receiving just-in-time CCT booster sessions or a control group receiving no additional training. Outcome measures included depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) as the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes such as repetitive negative thinking, maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and cognitive control. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess changes over time and group differences.\n\nResults:\nThere were no significant clinical effects of adding just-in-time booster sessions compared to the control condition. \n\nConclusions: \nAlthough no significant clinical or cognitive effects were observed, this study offers an innovative framework for adapting cognitive training delivery based on personal depression trajectories. The findings may inform the development of future personalized prevention strategies in depression care.\n\nTrial registration:\nThis trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05557760).

          "abstract": "Sleep restriction, prevalent in modern society, impairs cognitive functions such as learning and inhibitory control. However, literature reveals inconsistencies in these effects, suggesting underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We hypothesized that these inconsistencies might stem from variations in how individuals perceive task demands, particularly expected or favored responses. To test this idea, we investigated the impact of sleep restriction (4h) on learning and inhibitory control in a predictable yet uncertain environment, focusing on the role of built-up expectations. Using a Go/NoGo task with varying probabilities of Go-stimuli (20%-50%-80%), we compared the performance of Sleep-Restricted (SR; N=32) and Well-Rested (WR; N=34) participants across two sessions. Participants were unaware of the changing probabilities. Both groups showed similar overall performance trends, with higher rates of commission errors and faster reaction times as the probability of Go increased. However, the WR group demonstrated a greater ability to adapt to changing probabilities. Remarkably, we found no group differences in inhibitory control. To further investigate these findings, we employed a computational model incorporating adaptive learning dynamics. Our model revealed that SR participants exhibited a diminished perception of environmental volatility, suggesting they may face challenges in detecting relevant changes in the task environment and consequently updating their beliefs. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that sleep restriction alters task perception and impairs belief updating. These findings, alongside previous research, highlight the crucial role of sleep in maintaining optimal cognitive function, particularly in dynamic environments.",

For example, this was observed in comparisons such as digital versus classroom learning, remote versus office work, digital versus traditional navigation, and online versus physical shopping. However, positive relationships were also found between attitudes toward digital services and human services, as well as between experiences using technology within the organization and similar experiences in other settings. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the service experience in public transportation using traditional means and the service experience using technological means.\nDiscussion\nThe findings indicate that the service experience remains largely unchanged whether delivered within a specific organization or at a fixed location, irrespective of whether the service is provided through technological or traditional means. In contrast, in separate locations, the service experience changes substantially when the service is delivered through technological means compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the experience of using technological means remains consistent across different environments, both inside and outside the organization.\nThe article emphasizes the importance of understanding the contexts in which technology is used and their impact on users' attitudes and overall experience.",

          "authors": "Jian-Sheng Kang",
          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

Although constructed independently, it was retroactively found to be in close alignment with the Turbulence model of cognition (Deco &amp; Kringelbach, 2017) by providing a biological constraint for signal propagation and synchronization, and by implicating the thalamus as the source of consciousness and cognition. \n\nA search for counterexamples led to the discovery of a significant gap in Neuroscience relating to split-brained patients, and attempts to develop experiments to quantify their intelligence rigorously resulted in the creation of a potentially clinically valid Full Spectrum Cognitive Battery—capable of diagnosing any arbitrary cognitive shortfall and characterizing individuals by their level of Integration Bandwidth.",

          "abstract": "Why are nouns often over-represented in children’s early words? Prior research has suggested a range of possible explanations for the observed bias in the syntactic category composition of early vocabularies, including cognitive, linguistic, and contextual factors. However, these factors are not mutually exclusive and can be difficult to disambiguate empirically. Across three analyses of the vocabularies of children acquiring two languages (N = 1997), we investigated the role of differ-\nent language combinations, different levels of language exposure, and different environmental contexts, finding some support for cross-linguistic modulation of syntactic category bias, as well as variation across countries. These results suggest that both linguistic and contextual factors contribute to syntactic category biases in young children’s vocabularies, and highlight the importance of understanding the broader background of the child when studying language acquisition.",

          "authors": "Rodrigo Alonso Reyes Cordova; peter achterberg",
          "abstract": "This study examines the political polarization of public trust in science across Europe, focusing on the roles of motivated reasoning and political partisanship. We distinguish between impact science, which often entails regulatory constraints on industrial activity, and production science, which supports technological and economic development. While prior research has largely centered on the U.S., European data reveal similar ideological patterns: left-leaning individuals exhibit greater trust in science overall, and particularly in impact science, while right-leaning individuals show greater trust in production science. These findings suggest that the politicization of science is domain-specific. We find evidence for both motivated reasoning and partisanship as drivers of science polarization. Education amplifies ideological differences in trust toward impact science, consistent with motivated reasoning, while closeness to a particular political party amplifies ideological differences in trust toward science in general and impact science, highlighting the role of partisanship. Exploratory path analysis indicates that partisanship exerts a greater influence than education. Our findings underscore that polarization is most pronounced in scientific disciplines and claims that challenge industrial interests and align with social welfare goals, and that partisanship plays a central role in shaping public trust in this scientific domain.",

          "title": "Root Cause of Persistent Systemic Failures of the Global Economic System that Resulted in Global Social Issues",
          "authors": "Daniel Run Han Ho",
          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

          "authors": "Elizaveta Gaufman; Martijn Schoonvelde; REGROUP project",
          "abstract": "Disinformation has become an increasing concern for European policymakers and the broader public, raising pressing questions about safeguarding political discourse and institutional trust in an evolving digital landscape. This focus paper begins by mapping the current landscape of disinformation policies within the European Union, including public and private regulatory approaches. While significant efforts have been made— particularly in targeting foreign information manipulation—we argue that existing policy frameworks overlook important aspects of how disinformation works. Above all, there is a lack of attention to the issue of credibility: how individuals determine whether information is trustworthy and what role identity cues play in their assessments.\n\nTo address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment to understand how young people evaluate the credibility of online content. The experiment involved 152 university students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Respondents were sorted into different groups based on their self-identified gender and country of origin at the beginning of the survey. They were then asked to assess the credibility of a series of social media posts covering a range of topics. Finally, respondents were invited to reflect in writing on the reasons behind their evaluations, allowing us to compare quantitative trust ratings with qualitative reasoning.\n\nOur findings confirm that content quality remains the strongest predictor of perceived credibility. However, they also reveal that subtle identity cues—such as a shared gender or national background between the respondent and the post’s author—exert a small but consistent influence on trust evaluations. These effects often occur below the level of conscious awareness, suggesting that social proximity and identity alignment can shape how people perceive truth, even when they believe they are evaluating content objectively. Notably, the results also challenge some common assumptions: posts from authors with Anglo-American names, often associated with epistemic authority, were not rated as more credible, and male-presenting sources were not favored over female-presenting ones.\n\nTaken together, our findings underline that perceived credibility of information is not a fixed quality but shaped by content, identity, and situational cues. Disinformation policies may therefore fall short if they do not account for these more subjective dynamics of trust.",

          "abstract": "While many studies of public opinion in authoritarian regimes rely on list experiments to overcome sensitivity bias, we show in this paper that a different technique, the crosswise variant of the randomized response design, has superior performance at measuring latent opposition to authoritarian regimes with fewer assumptions. To show the power of this design, we randomly assigned a panel of 924 Tunisian survey respondents to receive either a direct question about support for Tunisian President Kais Saied or a randomized response question. Our results reveal that between 10% to 30% of Tunisians oppose the president but would not report this opposition on a direct question. We further employed a Bayesian parameterization of the randomized response design to decompose the sensitivity bias and model latent opposition and bias as a function of survey covariates. We find that ideological and policy disagreement with the president strongly predicts latent opposition, but that these same measures are negatively related to sensitivity bias. As a result, we show that respondents who are ideologically closer to the president--that is, the moderate opposition--tend to be more afraid of reporting their resistance to the regime than the more radical opposition.",

          "authors": "Sourish Dutta",
          "abstract": "This paper outlines the construction of high-resolution, 7-digit product-level Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian economy, leveraging microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the period 2016-2022. We delineate a robust methodology encompassing the generation of detailed input and output flows, with a particular focus on the reconciliation of data from registered and unregistered manufacturing sectors through a meticulously developed NPCMS-NIC concordance. The critical transformation from the often-rectangular SUTs to square, symmetric product-by-product IOTs is explicated using the Industry Technology Assumption, a choice justified by its suitability for handling by-products prevalent in a diverse manufacturing landscape. The analytical prowess of this newly constructed high-resolution IOT framework is then demonstrated through its application to assess key economic impacts, specifically the Domestic Value Added (DVA) generated and the employment supported by production and export activities. A detailed case study of India’s rapidly evolving mobile phone manufacturing sector (NPCMS 4722200) for the 2016-2022 period reveals profound structural shifts: significant output growth coupled with notable import substitution, a remarkable surge in exports, and a dynamic evolution in the DVA versus Foreign Value Added (FVA) shares, particularly in export-oriented production. The analysis further uncovers substantial employment growth, albeit with an increasing reliance on contractual labour and a heartening rise in female participation in the workforce. These meticulously constructed tables represent a significant methodological advancement and provide an invaluable empirical resource for nuanced analysis of sectoral interdependencies, the efficacy of industrial policy, and the complex dynamics of India’s engagement with global value chains.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "We examine how people living in poverty attempt to escape indebtedness by converting various forms of capital in a Bourdieusian sense. Guided by Pierre Bourdieu’s framework, we treat debt as a form of negative economic capital and analyse qualitative interview data on individuals’ struggles with debt. Our research question is: Which capital conversion strategies do low-income individuals employ to manage or escape debt, and what symbolic or emotional barriers do they encounter? We draw on 216 in-depth interviews with residents in long-term poverty. Using a relational, field-based analytic frame, we identify four main conversion patterns: (1) social capital → economic capital (borrowing from kin or friends), (2) cultural capital → economic capital (using bureaucratic knowledge or skills to gain benefits), (3) economic capital → economic capital (using savings or assets to pay debts), and (4) social/cultural capital → institutional capital → economic capital (leveraging networks or knowledge to access formal debt relief). We find these strategies are often temporary and fraught with obstacles. Shame and stigma function as forms of symbolic violence that can block people from mobilising help, while bureaucratic complexity and resource scarcity limit the effectiveness of their efforts. Our findings deepen the understanding of how negative capital (debt) constrains agency under structural poverty and show that converting social or cultural capital into economic relief is rarely straightforward. This study contributes to Bourdieusian poverty scholarship by highlighting hysteresis effects and inter-field struggles that perpetuate indebtedness, and it suggests that anti-poverty interventions must recognise these complex conversion barriers.",

          "authors": "Jacob Edenhofer; Christian Flachsland",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Climate Politics Framework (CPF), a novel and comprehensive approach to analyzing climate policymaking. The CPF sets out four fundamental problems—pervasive collective action challenges, distributional dynamics, long-term policy, and deep uncertainty—that shape both elite and mass-level climate politics. These, in turn, influence the stringency and design of climate policy platforms, which consist of institutions, policy instruments as well as framing and rhetoric. These platforms can both cause emissions reductions—the main dependent variable of interest—and address strategic challenges in the climate policy process (e.g. agenda-setting, coordination, compensation, and commitment), thereby altering political dynamics over time. Applying the CPF to Germany, based on elite interviews and a literature review, we analyze key episodes and structural features of German climate policy over the past four decades. The CPF offers both an academic contribution—by synthesizing disparate strands of the climate politics literature—and, with a view to future applications, a practical tool for policymakers and stakeholders to diagnose political barriers and identify pathways for effective climate policymaking.",

          "abstract": "How do consumers react when their favorite product is removed? This paper sheds light on this question by studying consumer purchase behavior at vending machines located at Tokyo train stations, where most vending machines experienced some product changes during our sample period.\nBy applying synthetic difference-in-differences, we find evidence of consumers conducting both within- and between-vending machine substitutions. In particular, we observe an expansion of demand in their non-favorite machines, where the increase comes from not only their favorite product, but also other products. Most interestingly, we find evidence that consumers buy more products that are new to them and switch more often; such behavior is consistent with experimentation and learning. This suggests that, to some extent, consumers' persistent choice of the same product may be an outcome of habitual behavior, and the removal of their ``favorite'' product may break their habit and trigger them to experiment with new products. We also find that high variety-seeking consumers are more likely to choose a substitute at their favorite vending machine, whereas low variety-seeking consumers tend to seek their favorite product at another vending machine.  However, consumers' experimentation and learning behavior does not vary with variety-seeking tendency.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nAnalyses of population administrative data can often only be minimally adjusted due to a lack of control variables, potentially leading to bias due to residual confounding.\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to use linked cohort data to help address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data. One particular aim was to explore strategies for when linked cohort and population administrative data cannot be accessed together in the same environment (are “siloed”).  \n\nMethods\nWe propose a multiple imputation-based approach, introduced through application to simulated data in three different scenarios related to the structure of the datasets. We then apply this approach to a real-world example – examining the association between pupil mobility (changing schools at non-standard times) and Key Stage 2 (age 11) attainment using data from the UK National Pupil Database (NPD). The limited control variables available in the NPD are supplemented by multiple measures of socioeconomic deprivation captured in linked Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) data.\n\nResults\nIn our real-world example, we included 509,670 individuals in the population NPD data, of whom 7,768 (1.5%) were MCS cohort members. The unadjusted estimate of -1.86 (95% CI -1.92, -1.81) for the association between pupil mobility and Key Stage 2 attainment was attenuated to -0.92 (95% CI -0.97, -0.88) through adjustment for the NPD control variables, and further attenuated to -0.76 (95% CI -0.86, -0.67) through adjustment for the MCS control variables. \n\nConclusions\nLinked cohort data can be used to address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data, and our proposed approach performed well across a range of simulated and real-world scenarios. The underlying principles are widely applicable: any analysis of administrative data could potentially be strengthened by linking a subset of individuals into richer cohort data. More research is required to understand how these methods can be applied more broadly.",

In this article we report a novel approach to assessing quotation accuracy via an online survey in which 2,648 corresponding authors of articles evaluated a real-world citation of their work. Respondents were also asked to categorise the perceived purpose of the citation, and what action, if any, they take when encountering inaccurate citations of their work. We found a quotation error rate of 16.6%, with no significant difference across academic disciplines, suggesting that variation in previous studies may be a result of methodological differences. Only 11.3% of respondents indicated they had taken action after encountering an inaccurate citation of their work. This work reveals reasons contributing to inaccurate quotations and issues with citation practices, and offers suggestions of areas for future research.",

          "abstract": "In light of growing calls to demonstrate the societal value of academic work, this paper explores whether peer review is a reliable method to evaluate the societal relevance of humanities research. It also offers an estimate of how relevant published journal articles and books from five humanities fields are to society. By modeling two evaluation tasks involving many raters and documents, we estimate how various reviewer characteristics (such as their chauvinism and strictness) and document characteristics (such as their field and content) affect societal relevance ratings. We then compare the influence of both reviewer and document characteristics on these ratings and provide an estimate of the societal relevance of humanities research where the factors contributing to peer review unreliability are filtered out. Our results suggest that, even according to humanities scholars themselves, a substantial portion of published humanities research is not relevant to society at large. Furthermore, our results also suggest that when using peer review to decide whether a particular piece of research is societally relevant, the selection of reviewers plays a more significant role than the content of the research.",

          "abstract": "This article revisits the formation of capitalist subjectivity through a dialogue between Foucault’s genealogy of discipline and Benjamin’s critique of commodity fetishism, arguing that contemporary platform capitalism synthesizes these logics to produce a new subject: the interface subject. Where Foucault illuminates how institutions fabricate docile, productive bodies, Benjamin reveals how commodities enchant the collective imagination through aesthetic and libidinal appeal. Under digital capitalism, these mechanisms converge in algorithmic architectures that govern through both behavioral optimization and curated desire. Platforms like Uber or TikTok exemplify this hybrid regime, where gamified labor and algorithmic phantasmagoria collapse the factory and the arcade into a single dispositif. Against accounts that frame digital subjectivity as either entrepreneurial or exhausted, this paper theorizes the interface subject as suspended between coercion and euphoria—a figure shaped by the twin imperatives of metricized performance and affective investment.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the effect of product innovation practices on the financial performance of  small and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  the  Nyanza  Region  of  Kenya.  The investigation was motivated by the need to bridge the empirical gap surrounding the impact of    entrepreneurial    marketing    practices—specifically    product    innovation—on    SME performance in semi-urban and rural areas, where research has been limited. Anchored on Schumpeter’s  Theory  of  Innovation,  the  study  adopted  a  cross-sectional   design   and positivist  research  philosophy,  utilizing  a  sample  of  364  registered  SMEs  selected  through simple  random  sampling  from  Kisii,  Migori,  and  Nyamira  counties.  Primary  data  were collected  using  structured  questionnaires  and  analyzed  using  descriptive  and  inferential statistics  through  SPSS  version  29.  Regression  analysis  indicated  a  moderate  positive relationship between product innovation and financial performance (R = 0.65; R² = 0.423), suggesting  that  42.3%  of  the  variation  in  financial  outcomes  among  SMEs  could  be attributed to product innovation. The results revealed that SMEs engaging in new product development,  improving  existing  products,  and  diversifying  product  lines  experienced enhanced profitability, increased sales turnover, and expanded market share. However, the study  also  identified  key  barriers  to  innovation,  including  limited  access  to  technology (38%),  legal  constraints  (22%),  low  market  demand  (21%),  cultural  barriers  (10%),  and weak  intellectual  property  rights  (9%).  Despite  some  respondents  expressing  skepticism regarding   the   necessity   of   product   innovation,   the   majority   affirmed   its   significant contribution  to  business  performance.  The  study  concluded  that  product  innovation  is  a critical determinant of SME financial success and sustainability in Nyanza. It recommended that  SME  owners  prioritize  innovation  by  fostering  a  culture  of  creativity  and  investing  in research  and  development.  Additionally,  policy-makers  and  financial  institutions  were urged  to  establish  supportive  environments  through  innovation  incentives,  credit  access, and  enhanced  intellectual  property  frameworks.  The  study  suggested  further  research employing  longitudinal  designs  and  incorporating  other  marketing  dimensions  such  as pricing and promotion to gain a holistic understanding of SME growth drivers.",

          "authors": "Nikolaos Nikolakakis",
          "abstract": "This article reexamines the normative dimension of Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism, arguing that value theory, reification, and the logic of capital carry intrinsic ethical implications. Against interpretations that distance Marxism from questions of justice or morality, it draws on the method of immanent critique to show how concepts such as freedom, autonomy, and equality are not external ideals imposed upon capitalist society, but contradictions immanent to it. Through close engagement with Marx’s analyses of alienation, the value-form, and the autonomy of capital, the article demonstrates how capitalist social relations systematically obscure and invert human purposes. Value appears to act autonomously, while human agency is rendered derivative - a dynamic that constitutes the core of reification. By reconnecting these processes to Marx’s emancipatory vision, the paper reconstructs the normative core of his critique and its relevance for contemporary forms of domination, including platform labor, digital commodification, and ecological crisis. Rather than offering a moralizing perspective, Marx’s method grounds critique in the contradictions of capitalist modernity itself. In doing so, it provides not only a structural diagnosis of social domination, but a normative horizon oriented toward emancipation, grounded in the historical and material conditions that constrain and enable human freedom.",

This study uses the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study as a test case, comparing GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.1 variant Sonnar Large, and Mistral Large against human annotators, we find the two proprietary models outperform open-source alternatives, achieving 97% accuracy on straightforward questions and 88-91% on complex interpretive tasks. However, open-source models still perform relatively well, achieving 95-96% accuracy on relatively straightforward questions up to 87% on more complex ones. Performance analysis revealed response brevity, but not category brevity, as a strong determinant of successful classification with responses under 50 characters demonstrating 7-11% higher classification accuracy. While models effectively detected nuance in simpler tasks, they struggled with responses containing multiple reasons, narratives, and implicit meanings.\n\nThe findings imply that social science researchers who want to use LLMs should design questions to elicit concise responses (10-50 characters), implement human-in-the-loop review for complex tasks, and carefully select appropriate models based on task complexity. Minimal demographic variation in classification accuracy was observed, with Claude uniquely maintaining consistent performance across population segments. Methodologically concerning, some models sometimes produced different social narratives from open-ended classification despite high accuracy metrics.",

          "abstract": "This paper adopts a Research Through Design (RTD) approach to investigate the epistemic consequences of large language models (LLMs). We introduce the concept of Simulacral Drift to describe how recursive training on synthetic outputs displaces empirical reference, leading to a collapse in both model fidelity and user cognition. Rather than collecting empirical data, this work engages in conceptual design research to surface and structure the ethical implications of generative simulation. Through a reflexive inquiry grounded in media theory, STS, and design philosophy, we propose a normative framework of Reflexive Epistemic Ethics, comprising referential integrity, simulation auditability, and epistemic friction. We further integrate recent neurophysiological evidence from Kosmyna et al. (2025), which shows that LLM users exhibit reduced memory recall and neural engagement — validating our claim that epistemic collapse is embodied and co-produced. By treating simulation as a socio-technical condition and knowledge frameworks as designed epistemic artifacts, this paper contributes to the growing body of RTD scholarship that seeks to anticipate, intervene in, and reshape the cognitive infrastructures of AI.",

          "abstract": "This paper uses the staggered implementation of gender quota policy in India to understand whether women who won office due to quotas go on to win higher-level office.   Indian local government elections impose mandatory gender quotas, but  state elections do not. This provides a setting to assess if there is an increase in women's representation at higher levels of governance due to quotas at the local level. The identification strategy  allows me to ascribe an increase of three percentage points in the share of women at the state-level  to gender quotas in local government. Additionally, to establish upward political mobility of local-level leaders I tracked political biographies of over 1000 women legislators  across India's 15 major state assemblies. In doing so, I identify that political dynasties, and ground-level leadership  --- those who  entered politics due to mandatory gender quotas --- are the two primary channels that enable  entry of women into state-level politics. Further, I show that the effect of democratic entry of women into politics via quotas is pronounced in states with parties that are reliant on empowered rank and file members.  Overall, these results highlight the importance of gender quotas as a democratic state-building tool and provide evidence for career advancement of women in politics  whose democratic entry into politics was facilitated by the implementation of mandatory gender quotas.",

          "authors": "Shiv Gazi Yucel",
          "abstract": "Since the mass casualties of the 2003 European heatwaves, extreme heat has emerged as a pressing environmental and public health issue across Europe. The need for effective adaptation policy is growing as heatwaves increase in intensity, frequency, and duration, yet little is known about the social processes which shape heat exposure and limit people's capacities to adapt. Focusing on England as a Northwestern European case study, this study examines people's adaptations to summer heatwaves from 2007-2019 and the heat-related vulnerability factors shaping their responses. The analysis uses a multi-level modelling approach which links England's National Travel Survey with ERA5 climate re-analysis data to examine patterns of stay-home and medical-trip-making. Responses are examined according to heatwave intensity (moderate and extreme) and according to individual and household-level factors related to socio-demographics, health, employment, housing, and spatio-temporal context. The impacts of heatwaves on shelter-at-home and medical-trip making are found to vary with their intensity but are strongly mediated by the social characteristics of those exposed. People widely shelter at home during extreme heatwaves yet are slightly more active during moderate ones; adaptations which differ according to heat-vulnerability factors. Specifically, people working or having worked in manual/routine occupations are less likely to shelter-at-home during extreme heatwaves, older individuals remain more active during moderate heatwaves while those with mobility difficulties are more likely to withdraw into their homes, and medical services are sought more by people who rent their homes and less by non-white individuals. This study highlights how wide-ranging social factors mediate people's exposure and adaptive responses to summer heatwaves in a Northwestern European context.",

          "authors": "Michael Frith",
          "abstract": "Originally developed in criminology to examine criminal careers, trajectory modelling, and particularly group-based trajectory modelling, is now widely applied to analyse a variety of other phenomena, including spatial crime dynamics. However, despite its use in this area of research for over two decades, no systematic review has synthesized its application to spatial-temporal analyses of crime, including in terms of the typical model specifications and findings. This article addresses that gap through a comprehensive literature search that identified 1,397 non-duplicate publications, of which 28 were relevant and collectively reported on 47 distinct group-based trajectory modelling analyses. Most of the analyses identified between three and eight latent trajectories, generally corresponding to groups of places with stable levels of negligible, low-to-moderate, or chronic crime. While some analyses uncovered more unique longitudinal trends, increasing the number of groups often produced only relatively subtle variations of these broader patterns, raising issues about their substantive value. Methodologically, while the analyses often compared and ultimately selected in their final models particular numbers of groups, data distributions, trajectory shapes, and diagnostic metrics, there was considerable variation in how thoroughly the modelling process was conducted and reported. Additionally, unique issues relatively specific to this area of research were also identified, including in terms of the treatment of missing data and zero-crime units, and the diversity of spatial resolutions. Overall, the review highlights the need for more systematic modelling practices and clearer reporting standards. The article concludes with recommendations for future applications of group-based trajectory modelling to spatial crime dynamics in order to advance our substantive understanding of how crime at different places evolves over time.",

In this paper, we use the online genealogical database FamiLinx to investigate the dispersion of international families across countries and over time. We find a high degree of international geographical dispersion in historical family networks between 1700 and 1900 in Europe and the United States. The percentage of individuals with descendants living abroad was higher in Europe, while the percentage of individuals with ancestors living abroad was higher in the US. In most of the analyzed European countries, we observe an increasing likelihood of individuals having at least one relative living abroad that peaked at around 1850, with the proportion of children living abroad growing rapidly over time. Our findings provide valuable insights into how historical migrations shaped kinship structures, improving our understanding of the historical dispersion of kin across countries and informing debates on the potential of kin to influence migration behaviors.",

This study sought to determine whether similar associations can be observed in a large, population-representative sample of older adults with high levels of exposure to conflict amongst older adults in Northern Ireland (NI). Using data from the Northern Ireland COhort for the Longitudinal study of Ageing (NICOLA), we assessed whether the presence of PTSD was associated with poorer performance on tasks of global cognition, immediate and delayed verbal recall, executive function, verbal fluency and two tests of prospective memory. Participants were 2,142 community dwelling adults, resident in NI and aged 50 and over. The NI weighted prevalence of current PTSD was 4.74%, which is high relative to other international estimates. Nearly 60% of those with PTSD reported the NI Troubles as their self-reported worst traumatic exposure, despite the height of the conflict occurring decades before, suggesting long-term consequences of the civil conflict. Individuals with PTSD recalled approximately half a word less than those without on tests of verbal recall and scored lower on global cognitive assessments: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics. However, this effect was attenuated after further adjusting for health behaviours and current depression. The findings suggest an effect of trauma on cognitive function at a population level. Future research should explore the nature of this relationship over time.",

Building on and extending prior work, we adopt a nominal response model framework in item response theory and leverage standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In parallel, we demonstrate that sequential HO–DCMs can likewise be implemented within an MLE framework. Furthermore, we introduce a novel chunk-based approach for representing attribute hierarchies, wherein attributes are organized into cognitively coherent subgraphs (chunks) nested within a continuous general ability continuum. The performance of the models is validated through simulation studies evaluating parameter recovery, classification accuracy, and null rejection rates of goodness-of-fit measures. An empirical demonstration showcases how the proposed framework can be applied in practice, highlighting its advantages in model flexibility, interpretability, and the additional diagnostic insights it affords.",

Desde una lectura semiológica inspirada en Barthes, se propone entender la ciudad como un lenguaje, y al caminar como su forma más elemental de enunciación. A partir de allí, se reconstruye una genealogía crítica del caminar —de la deriva situacionista al flâneur moderno, del paseo estético a la marcha política— que culmina en la manifestación como práctica de escritura urbana. Se analizan sus recorridos, sus ritmos y sus tácticas como una gramática en acto, capaz de interrumpir, reinscribir y disputar el sentido del espacio. El análisis no solo sitúa al caminar como operación proyectual, sino que define a la manifestación como acto de enunciación que reconfigura temporalmente la ciudad y revela las tensiones estructurales de su orden urbano. \n\nThis text is based on the hypothesis that a political demonstration does not merely move through the city—it rewrites it. Drawing from a semiological reading inspired by Barthes, the city is understood as a language, and walking as its most basic form of enunciation. From this perspective, a critical genealogy of walking is reconstructed—from the Situationist dérive to the modern flâneur, from the aesthetic stroll to the political march—culminating in the protest as a practice of urban writing. Its routes, rhythms, and tactics are analyzed as a living grammar capable of interrupting, reinscribing, and disputing the meaning of space. The analysis not only frames walking as a projective operation, but also defines the demonstration as an act of enunciation that temporarily reconfigures the city and reveals the structural tensions of its urban order.",

          "abstract": "Wildfires are one of the most significant threats to California’s food and farming systems, endangering a state that produces diverse crops and livestock critical to national and global food security. This study examines the role of social fabric—mutual aid, cooperation, and collective action—in shaping wildfire adaptive capacities among California farmers and ranchers. Using survey data from 403 producers directly impacted by wildfires between 2017 and 2023, we conducted regression analyses to identify how social, operational, and demographic factors influence adaptive behaviors, including making changes, wildfire mitigation practices, knowledge acquisition, and farm continuity. \nKey findings reveal that farmers embedded in strong social networks exhibited greater adaptive capacities, leveraging mutual aid and collective action to facilitate resource sharing, knowledge dissemination, and motivation. Knowledge emerged as a central driver, with frequent wildfire exposure enhancing experiential learning and confidence in risk management. Ecological and diversified farming practices, alongside direct-to-consumer markets, were associated with higher rates of adaptation and stronger social networks. Financial and land ownership factors, including access to social safety nets and off-farm income, further supported long-term mitigation efforts. However, the cumulative burden of adaptive actions, compounded by social influences like peer decisions to quit farming, led some producers to consider exiting agriculture, exposing vulnerabilities within the food system.\nIn light of these findings, we recommend strengthening farmer networks through cooperative models, such as fire-safe councils and farmer-led preparedness groups, while incentivizing sustainable practices like agroecological and mosaic landscapes to buffer wildfire impacts and promote resilience. Agriculture, we propose, represents an underexplored but critical facet of broader wildfire resilience. This study contributes to the discourse on food system resilience by highlighting the interplay between social fabric, adaptive capacity, and sustainable agriculture in the face of climate-induced disasters.",

In this study, we ask if the influx of AI-made products changes the way human-made products are evaluated. Using an observational study and a pre-registered experiment, we test how exposure to AI-made art changes the evaluation of human-made art. We find that after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, evaluators on online discussions in Reddit art forums and critical reviews on Artnet see criteria not applicable to AI (versus criteria applicable to AI) as more important and valuable.

Gandhi realized that the basic education was an essential component to the structural and socio-economic imbalances that were badly affected. It was the treatment for all the ills and evils of the society in India. His idea on basic education not only changed the educational system of India but also led a social revolution. This paper aims to understand and review the principles of Gandhiji on basic education which are assessed from his several writings. Some important features of Gandhiji’s basic education are also described comparing present system of education.",

          "abstract": "In an era often described as post-truth politics, it is crucial to understand how politicians engage with evidence. We argue that politicians selectively engage with evidence consistent with their party’s priorities. We test this argument by presenting 1,822 candidates in the 2024 Austrian national election with contrasting pieces of high-quality evidence on the same salient migration policy reform. We find that candidates from ideologically extreme parties – particularly the far-right populist Freedom Party\nof Austria (FPÖ) – select evidence consistent with their party’s priorities. Analysis of public opinion data (N = 1,428) further shows that far-right supporters approve of this selective consideration of evidence. Our findings suggest that growing far-right electoral strength may amplify the reliance on supportive evidence, increasing the risk of ill-informed policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "Taking the contemporary expressionist oil painting entitled Taiwan as the core of the study, this article combines image structuralism, postmodern art theory and Marxist philosophy to analyse in depth how this work reconstructs the image narrative path of national unity in the era of information civilisation.Through an overall analysis of the composition, colour strokes and symbol system, the article points out that the work is not a visual reproduction of traditional geopolitics, nor is it a technological tribute under instrumental rationality, but rather a \"civilization neural circuit\" constructed by integrating a historical materialist view of consciousness and visual metaphysical logic.The figures in the work's upward-looking gestures, data cables, and \"Taiwan\"-style compositions together generate a spatial logic of upgrading from individual consciousness to national structure, creating a structural channel between technological symbols and national identity.The thesis asserts that Taiwan is not only a painting, but also a pictorial civilised political document, a philosophical upgrading of the discourse of national unity, and an archetypal narrative of \"structural self-healing return\" accomplished through artistic means under the tension between the logic of capital and cultural division.Its significance lies in the revelation that unification is no longer a victory of external orders, but a natural closure of the system's internal structure of consciousness in the tension of history, reflecting the cutting-edge role of contemporary art in the construction of national consciousness, cultural integration, and visual philosophical transformation.",

          "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events children experience before reaching 18 years old and are known to be passed on from generation to generation, which suggests that experiencing ACEs at an early age often leads to subsequent abuse and maltreatment perpetration in adulthood. However, identifying factors that facilitate ACE transmission has always been a challenge, given the issue's complexity. This study aimed to address this gap and identified two contextual factors (parental proximal stressors and negative parenting practices) and investigated their mediating and moderating effects on the continuity of ACEs from mothers (G2) to their children (G3). Data collected from 230 mothers in Cebu City, Philippines, were analyzed using second-stage moderated mediation (model 15) to determine the conditional indirect effect of G2 ACEs towards G3 ACEs via parental proximal stressors as a function of negative parenting practices. Overall results established a moderated mediation model (F(5,224) = 18.26, p&lt;.001, R²=.3075), suggesting that the interaction of parental proximal stressors and negative parenting practices increases the risk of continuity of ACEs from one generation to the next. Recommendations include preventive education of ACEs and adopting early intervention efforts to stop the cycle of abuse and neglect, preventing subsequent perpetration in adulthood.",

          "authors": "Alexander Martin Loewi",
          "abstract": "To improve human wellbeing, we must understand what drives it. Life satisfaction data have been collected internationally since 2005, but without a rigorous model of what drives these outcomes, it has remained difficult to draw policy lessons. We fill this gap by aggregating life satisfaction data with nation-level data on an unprecedented number of potential drivers (n=5,533). We use the Lasso, a computational method for variable selection, to construct a simple but highly accurate model with low risk of omitted variables or human selection bias. We show this model has higher prediction accuracy than the current world standard from the United Nations, and the variables it selects are more consistent with studies from political science, social psychology, and other fields. It also selects many variables the current world standard does not, including LGBTQ+ acceptance, gender equity, and accessible political power. Unlike the current standard, which suggests GDP determines 40% of a nation’s satisfaction, our model estimates GDP’s independent contribution at 1.5%. We also find few of the variables hypothesized by recent Nobel-awarded economics work. Finally, we show that our model is more consistent with theories of anti-authoritarian psychology than with “institutions” as a driver of national outcomes. These findings allow policy makers and advocates to prioritize higher-impact goals. It also reveals that current actions in countries across the world directly oppose predictors of satisfaction. In the face of severe global crises, including failure to keep global warming below the “red line” of 1.5C, and a rise in authoritarianism, we need far greater clarity about the future we desire as a society, and how to achieve it. As theories compete on the world stage, often violently, our model offers a simple, empirically driven message to cut through the fog: if we are to improve universal human wellbeing, there is no option but to empower individuals who truly desire that improvement.",

          "abstract": "Background\nConsideration of research in public policy formation and implementation is widely considered important for effective decisions. Previous research has noted a growing body of reviews of a diverse range of strategies designed to promote evidence use in public policy and practice. This review aims to identify recent reviews and develop a taxonomy of the various strategies available to evidence advocates.\n\nMethods\nThis review followed the JBI guidance for scoping reviews. Studies were sought via database searches, handsearching, forward citation tracing and searching organisational websites. Descriptive analysis was used to characterise the nature of the body of reviews. The review drew on best-fit framework synthesis to develop a taxonomy of intervention domains and strategies.\n\nResults\n11,047 potentially eligible records were identified via searches. After screening by a single reviewer, 74 studies were included in the review. The vast majority of reviews were conducted in the health sector (n = 65). While many focused on practitioners (n = 60), a significant proportion included policymakers (n = 27) and the public (n = 12). Reviews included studies of 34 distinct intervention strategies across six domains – access to research, capability improvement, influencing, interaction, prioritisation and systems improvement. Reviews most commonly included studies of interventions in the capability (n = 59), access (n = 31) and interaction (n = 31) domains.\n\nConclusions\nThere is a large body of reviews those promoting the use of evidence can draw on to better understand the strategies at their disposal.  Actors outside the health sector, however, may find the evidence base less useful – and there remain a number of common strategies for which reviews have yet to be published.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nAnalyses of population administrative data can often only be minimally adjusted due to a lack of control variables, potentially leading to bias due to residual confounding.\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to use linked cohort data to help address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data. One particular aim was to explore strategies for when linked cohort and population administrative data cannot be accessed together in the same environment (are “siloed”).  \n\nMethods\nWe propose a multiple imputation-based approach, introduced through application to simulated data in three different scenarios related to the structure of the datasets. We then apply this approach to a real-world example – examining the association between pupil mobility (changing schools at non-standard times) and Key Stage 2 (age 11) attainment using data from the UK National Pupil Database (NPD). The limited control variables available in the NPD are supplemented by multiple measures of socioeconomic deprivation captured in linked Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) data.\n\nResults\nIn our real-world example, we included 509,670 individuals in the population NPD data, of whom 7,768 (1.5%) were MCS cohort members. The unadjusted estimate of -1.86 (95% CI -1.92, -1.81) for the association between pupil mobility and Key Stage 2 attainment was attenuated to -0.92 (95% CI -0.97, -0.88) through adjustment for the NPD control variables, and further attenuated to -0.76 (95% CI -0.86, -0.67) through adjustment for the MCS control variables. \n\nConclusions\nLinked cohort data can be used to address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data, and our proposed approach performed well across a range of simulated and real-world scenarios. The underlying principles are widely applicable: any analysis of administrative data could potentially be strengthened by linking a subset of individuals into richer cohort data. More research is required to understand how these methods can be applied more broadly.",

The availability of a large database of homogeneous inequality measurements allows us to produce the most in-depth study of the factors affecting inequality at the local level available so far for any preindustrial society. Additionally, the occurrence of a major plague during 1629–30, an event that caused the death of 40% of the inhabitants of the area, allows us to contribute to the growing literature on the distributional consequences of epidemics. Across our dataset, of the three factors that recent literature has discussed as possibly able to explain overall inequality trends in the long run -- economic development, population and regressive taxation -- regressive taxation set by the central state had a relatively strong impact. We also find that locally, differences in inequality levels were determined by closeness to the capital city of Venice, altitude, and suitability of land to specific crops. Regarding the impact of the plague, we demonstrate that while the 1630 plague was different from the medieval Black Death as it did not lead to large-scale and enduring levelling, it did cause a structural break in the way in which some key variables affected inequality.

          "abstract": "Development can always be visualized in terms of contributions from all sections of the society. Marginalization deprives a large section of people across the globe from participating in the development. It is a serious issue, and there are many factors that cause marginalization. This serious issue needs to be addressed at the policy level everywhere across the globe. The development and the progress of the marginalized sections depend on proper education of individuals. Education sector is a critical determinant for development of the marginalized sections of the society. It is practically unrealistic to expect an adequate opportunity of education for all through traditional face-to-face structure. In order to meet the new and changing demands for education and training, Open and Distance Learning (ODL) is an appropriate substitute for the traditional face-to-face methods as it has the right potential to reach out to the large segment of the unreached, marginalized and the needy. In order to understand the Impact of ODL system on marginalized learners, an online survey using Google form was conducted among the marginalized learners of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). The data collected through questionnaires were put together in the form of tables and simple percentage method is used for the analysis. Their views are analyzed to know the effectiveness of ODL system of education on marginalized learners. It is very interesting to note that about 91% of the marginalized learners feel pleasant / satisfied with the ODL mode of education offered by IGNOU. But, it is very pathetic to note that about 94% of the marginalized learners are unable to get scholarship even though the Govt. of India has been offering many scholarship schemes to encourage the marginalized learners for education.",

Here we investigate the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) educators in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau—professionals uniquely positioned to benefit from and highlight barriers to GenAI integration. Using survey data, we assess four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support. Our findings highlight the critical need for targeted strategies that mitigate these emerging gaps in AI literacy, competency, and professional development.",

Although levels of engagement are known to be far from equal within countries, comprehensive data comparing the rates and profiles of engagement on a global scale are lacking.\n\nMethods. This study analysed cross-sectional data from Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (2017-2023), with 73,825 respondents from 51 countries. Using multilevel logistic regression, we tested whether a set of individual-level demographic and socio-economic factors and country-level socio-demographic and political factors were associated with arts, music, or educational organization membership rates. We additionally explored whether those individual-level factors differed across regions using single-level regression.\n\nFindings. Prevalence of arts organization membership varies substantially across countries, from fewer than 1 in 30 people living in Egypt to more than 1 in 2 people living in Kenya. Education, income and age are consistent identified individual-level factors contributing to membership disparities, alongside other region-specific individual-level factors such as gender and employment status. Membership is also positively influenced by country-level income inequality and net migration rate, and negatively influenced by life expectancy.\n\nInterpretation. We found a universal social gradient in membership, which suggests differential opportunities and potential barriers to access arts organizations across population subgroups. Given that participation in arts organizations has been shown to improve health outcomes, reducing disparities in access to and participation in the arts may have the potential to help reduce health inequalities, and should therefore be a priority in global health.",

There is archaeological evidence that such social organization emerged through innovations that facilitated exploitation of resources that naturally occur in dense and predictable patches, leading to social regionalization and potentially territorial behavior. However, another way humans can access high-density patches is through transformation of the environment via niche construction. Here, we use an agent-based model to investigate how low-cost niche construction behaviors - those that can be applied without intensifying into dependence on food production - can transform resource distributions over time. We then examine the resulting impact of this on human mobility and social organization. In all scenarios where the cost of disturbance is low, we see positive selection for disturbance behaviors, leading to creation of a locally heterogeneous resource landscape. This results in increased carrying capacity, higher population densities, reduced mobility, and smaller social networks - all factors implicated in the eventual transition to food production. We demonstrate that foragers using even low-cost niche constructing behaviors can produce legacy landscapes with resource distributions that support more local social interactions even without socially imposed boundaries or territory defense of dense and predictable resources.",

While acknowledging Zindler’s historical \ncontext and intellectual sincerity, this paper challenges the reductionist nature of his claims. It \nargues that religion cannot be adequately explained through neurochemical responses or group \nselection theory alone. Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence from neurotheology, \nanthropology, and philosophy of mind, the paper presents religion as a structured moral and \nmetaphysical system, not a cognitive glitch. It highlights the philosophical inconsistencies in \nequating evolutionary utility with truth, and critiques the ideological bias in scientific \nreductionism. The paper also emphasizes the civilizational role of religion in shaping ethics, \nscience, art, and human dignity across cultures. Ultimately, it calls for a deeper, fairer dialogue \nbetween religious traditions and secular critiques—one that respects the complexity of spiritual \nexperience and the quest for meaning. Religion is not merely survival-driven illusion; it is a \nhuman expression of transcendence, justice, and moral awakening. Zindler’s thesis raises \nvaluable questions—but fails to capture the full cognitive, ethical, and historical dimensions of \nreligious consciousness.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how individuals in persistent urban poverty attempt to access the labour market through capital conversion strategies, and how these efforts are shaped by the hysteresis effect. Drawing on Bourdieu’s field theory and relational sociology, the study analyses how people try to re-enter employment by converting social, cultural, and symbolic capital into labour market opportunities. Based on qualitative fieldwork in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the research highlights how mismatches between habitus and the structural logic of the labour market produce friction, failure, and exclusion. The hysteresis effect—where past experiences and expectations lag behind current field demands—helps explain why job-seeking efforts often misfire, despite high motivation or informal skill sets. Respondents struggle with institutionalised expectations of employability, bureaucratic eligibility criteria, and the erosion of informal networks that once facilitated access to work. These findings show that labour market exclusion is not only a matter of lacking resources, but also of symbolic disqualification and misrecognition. The article contributes to scholarship on poverty, labour markets, and agency by demonstrating how structural inequality is reproduced through field-specific logics, and how relational forms of agency both resist and reinforce these mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "La inteligencia artificial (IA) se ha expandido significativamente en los últimos años, impregnando diversos sectores de la economía y de la vida cotidiana. Sin embargo, esta rápida adopción exige un análisis de las contrapartidas asociadas a su funcionamiento, muchas veces desconocidas por el público. Con base en un análisis de datos extraídos de artículos académicos, informes técnicos, repositorios de datos y documentos gubernamentales, este artículo explora las dimensiones físicas, energéticas y geopolíticas subyacentes a la IA. Aunque a menudo se percibe como inmaterial, la IA depende de una vasta y compleja infraestructura física, sostenida por centros de datos que albergan miles de equipos fabricados a partir de una amplia gama de minerales y metales, muchos de ellos clasificados como críticos. Actualmente, existen alrededor de 12 mil centros de datos en operación a nivel mundial, incluidos 992 de hiperescala, que ocupan áreas de miles de metros cuadrados. El corto ciclo de vida de los equipos de estos centros, combinado con una eliminación inadecuada, excluye metales valiosos de la cadena de suministro, intensificando la extracción mineral y agravando los impactos socioambientales. Paralelamente, la disputa entre Estados Unidos y China por el control de minerales críticos y por el liderazgo en tecnologías de IA ha intensificado las tensiones geopolíticas, con restricciones mutuas a la exportación de tecnologías avanzadas y minerales esenciales. Otro aspecto relevante es el alto consumo energético de las aplicaciones de IA: en Estados Unidos, los centros de datos ya representan cerca del 4% del consumo nacional de electricidad, con una previsión de alcanzar el 9,1% para 2030. Aunque las grandes empresas tecnológicas invierten en fuentes renovables, como la solar y la eólica, para satisfacer esta creciente demanda, dichas fuentes también requieren volúmenes significativos de minerales críticos.

          "authors": "Connor Donegan",
          "abstract": "Like causality, probability is a critical concept in the conflict between contending philosophies of science. Unlike causality, a canonically `realist' view of probability appears elusive. This paper examines and strengthens the connections between realism and the epistemological theory of probability (EP), sometimes known as probability as logic or plausible reasoning. Following the likes of Keynes, Jeffreys, Pólya, and Jaynes, the EP tradition provides a framework for the study of non-demonstrative logic which hinges on an implicit concept of logical structure. EP advanced historically via critiques of positivism in physics and of the scepticism of Hume and Popper. EP also shares with realist philosophy a critique of a characteristic feature of empiricist philosophy—its explicit conflation of ontology and epistemology. To illustrate the normative value of this framework, I apply Pólya's theory of analogy to a portion of Galileo's classic argument that the earth is in motion.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how collaborative problem framing is accomplished at scale on Stack Overflow, a large-scale online community question answering platform for software developers. Drawing on the practice-based theoretical perspective, the study examines how users coordinate problem framing through interactions with one another and with the platform via asking, commenting on, and editing questions. Based on the sequential analysis of four Stack Overflow threads, the findings specify the role of dynamic jointly created profession specific objects in producing broadly intelligible and solvable problems. The study also unpacks how the technical features of the platform, more specifically the dynamics of the dual space of editing and commenting, enable problem framing and solving to unfold at scale. Finally, the findings unpack interactional strategies enacted by users to coordinate problem framing on the large-scale platform. The study suggests contributions to the fields of professional learning and design of online environments aimed to support problem solving and collaborative activities more broadly.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article presents a relational methodology for studying poverty, agency, and morality under structural constraint. It addresses the limitations of both individualistic and deterministic approaches by conceptualising agency as a situated capacity, shaped by capital, power relations, and moral boundaries across multiple social fields. Drawing on Bourdieu’s field theory, the methodology traces how disadvantaged individuals navigate complex environments such as welfare systems, labour markets, and informal economies. The proposed design integrates ethnographic observation, in-depth interviews, and abductive analysis. Core concepts include habitus, capital conversion, symbolic violence, and moral boundary-work. These help reveal how practical logics—routine, situated judgments—guide action under duress. A key contribution is the operationalisation of relational agency, using Emirbayer and Mische’s temporal framework to capture how people draw on past experiences and future aspirations. This method is especially suited for researchers exploring how poor individuals actively respond to constraint without reducing them to passive victims. It also supports methodological pluralism by combining theory-driven coding with inductive fieldwork. Overall, the article provides a robust and flexible toolkit for analysing agency and inequality through relational sociology.",

          "authors": "Arpish R. Solanki",
          "abstract": "This study presents an exploratory application of large language models (LLMs) for unsupervised media framing analysis, using zero-shot classification to infer narrative patterns in news coverage. The method is demonstrated through a case study on international reporting of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla incident of May 2, 2025. A dataset of 96 English-language news articles was processed using a multi-stage pipeline. At the article level, frames were predicted using a taxonomy of seven narrative themes, such as Conflict/Security, Legal/Human-Rights, and Human-Interest, followed by a secondary filtering step using a second LLM to reduce over-attribution. At the sentence level, named entities were paired with co-occurring frames using LLM inference, followed by a multi-step semantic filtering process to retain only high-confidence associations. Article-level predictions revealed frequent emphasis on Legal/Human-Rights, Responsibility/Attribution, and Conflict/Security frames across the corpus. Model predictions suggested frequent associations of entities like Gaza and Israel, with frames such as Human-Interest and Conflict/Security. These patterns are inferred from language-based signals and do not reflect verified facts, editorial motives, or normative judgments. All results are generated through automated model interpretation and should be viewed as indicative of how LLMs parse narrative structure in media coverage. Notably, the results indicate that LLMs may more reliably detect action-oriented or concretely expressed frames, and may struggle with abstract or implicitly framed concepts, which suggests the need for taxonomy designs aligned with model reasoning capabilities. The study demonstrates both the potential and limitations of LLMs for scalable, unsupervised media analysis.",

          "abstract": "Este texto aborda la manifestación política como el fenómeno urbano que mejor condensa las cualidades simultáneas e imprevisibles de lo urbano. A partir de una crítica sistemática a los paradigmas normativos de la ciudad —su legibilidad, su programabilidad, su organización estable— se propone una aproximación teórica al espacio urbano desde su condición caótica, estratificada y desbordante. El texto introduce seis marcos conceptuales contemporáneos, provenientes de distintas tradiciones del pensamiento complejo, capaces de pensar la multiplicidad de capas en conflicto que operan simultáneamente sobre un mismo territorio, así como las trayectorias inestables y los quiebres que redefinen lo urbano como acontecimiento. Estas teorías son traducidas a categorías de análisis espacial que permiten leer la manifestación como la forma más aguda de producción urbana: una coreografía incontrolable, un montaje de escenas simultáneas y un laboratorio proyectual para imaginar nuevas herramientas arquitectónicas capaces de registrar, intervenir o acompañar la vitalidad inestable de la ciudad en conflicto.\n\nThis text explores the urban protest as a phenomenon of maximum complexity, focusing on the simultaneity and unpredictability that define urban space. It begins by challenging traditional architectural paradigms that pursue legibility, order, and control, arguing instead that the urban emerges as a dense, unstable, and contradictory field. Through six theoretical frameworks —three addressing simultaneity (superimposed networks, layered meanings, living structures) and three addressing unpredictability (emergence, contingent trajectories, rupture)— the chapter constructs a conceptual foundation to understand the protest as the urban event par excellence. Each group is translated into a spatial category of analysis, enabling its graphic representation. Far from remaining in theoretical abstraction, the text offers an operative approach for reading the city through its excess and intensity, ultimately proposing a new grammar for architectural practice.",

A través de una lectura crítica del libro Masa y poder de Elias Canetti, se desarrollan cuatro aproximaciones que permiten pensar a la masa como agente arquitectónico. En primer lugar, se distingue que no toda masa es manifestación, lo cual delimita el campo de estudio. Luego, se la aborda como figura móvil y como usuario colectivo que desafía los marcos tradicionales del proyecto urbano. Finalmente, se estudia su capacidad de producir estructuras espaciales efímeras, reconociendo en la manifestación una forma de arquitectura no proyectada pero efectiva. La reflexión avanza así una crítica a las herramientas de la arquitectura contemporánea, proponiendo una nueva gramática proyectual que incorpore la inestabilidad, la multiplicidad y la intensidad como condiciones fundamentales. \n\nThis text approaches political manifestation from its constitutive substance: the mass. Through a critical reading of Crowds and Power by Elias Canetti, it develops four perspectives that allow us to think of the mass as an architectural agent. First, it distinguishes that not every mass is a manifestation, thereby delimiting the scope of study. It then examines the mass as a mobile figure and a collective user that challenges the traditional frameworks of urban design. Finally, it explores its capacity to produce ephemeral spatial structures, recognizing in the manifestation a form of architecture that is unplanned yet effective. The reflection thus advances a critique of contemporary architectural tools, proposing a new projective grammar that incorporates instability, multiplicity, and intensity as fundamental conditions.",

Frente a la retórica abstracta y normativa que acompaña esta categoría, se plantea la necesidad de sustituirla por una noción más operativa: la calle. A través de un recorrido teórico y etimológico, se desmontan las bases de la idea contemporánea del espacio público, revelando su carácter ideológico y su función como instrumento de control. En contraposición, la calle se presenta como un escenario de cotidianeidad y conflictividad, donde lo urbano se manifiesta en su forma más cruda.

In opposition, the street is presented as a scene of everyday life and conflict, where the urban reveals itself in its rawest form. Drawing on five conceptual categories derived from the five research hypotheses of this project, the text constructs an alternative perspective from which to think the city—not from the norm, but from the gesture—thus proposing a critical path forward for contemporary architecture and urbanism.",

          "abstract": "Este texto analiza los motivos por los cuales ciertas manifestaciones políticas eligen unos lugares específicos por sobre otros dentro del tejido urbano. Se parte del supuesto de que, a pesar de la pérdida progresiva de espontaneidad en las protestas contemporáneas, estas siguen operando como respuestas tácticas que inscriben conflicto en la ciudad. Se propone una teoría basada en tres tiempos —tradición, conversación y repercusión— que permite clasificar los modos de ocupación del espacio público no como compartimentos estancos, sino como intensidades combinadas. A través de ejemplos recientes de la ciudad de Barcelona, se muestra cómo las protestas retoman lógicas heredadas de rituales religiosos, celebraciones populares, guerras, actos teatrales y escenificaciones urbanas. Se evidencia así que, incluso en un contexto de control creciente, las manifestaciones reaparecen allí donde el orden presenta fisuras. Cada elección espacial es leída como síntesis compleja entre memoria, mensaje y proyección, y como acto político de inscripción en el territorio.\n\nThis text explores why certain political demonstrations choose specific locations within the urban fabric over others. It begins with the premise that, despite the progressive loss of spontaneity in contemporary protests, they continue to function as tactical responses that inscribe conflict into the city. A theoretical framework based on three temporalities—tradition, conversation, and repercussion—is proposed, allowing protest spaces to be classified not as fixed categories, but as overlapping intensities. Through recent examples from the city of Barcelona, the text reveals how demonstrations inherit logics from religious rituals, popular celebrations, wars, theatrical acts, and urban scenographies. It argues that, even within a context of increasing control, demonstrations reappear wherever the urban order shows fissures. Each spatial decision is read as a complex synthesis of memory, message, and projection, and as a political act of inscription in the territory.",

          "authors": "Charlotte Booth; Alissa Goodman; Emla Fitzsimons",
          "abstract": "Despite policy efforts, early childhood inequalities have remained relatively stable in England over recent decades. In this study, we aimed to understand the determinants of early childhood inequality and how these have changed in their composition and impact on early child development, using two nationally representative cohorts of pre-school children collected in 2004 (N = 8,990) and 2014 (N = 3,877). Child development was assessed in both cohorts at age three, using the British Ability Scales – Naming Vocabulary test, and developmental inequality was depicted by concentration indices across quintiles of the English Index of Multiple Deprivation. A between-sample test of the concentration index revealed there was no real change to developmental inequality over time. However, decomposition of the concentration index revealed there were some changes to the determinants of inequality. Most notably, higher rates of maternal education were associated with reduced inequality, while living in the most deprived areas was associated with increased inequality, helping to explain the overall net zero change over time. Other factors, such as attending early childhood education and care by age three, made little contribution to developmental inequality, despite much higher attendance in 2014. This study highlights the complexity of factors contributing to early childhood inequality and includes a discussion on where policy efforts may be useful going forward.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article develops Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of field through an in-depth analysis of persistent poverty in the Netherlands. Drawing on over 200 interviews and eight empirical studies, we reconstruct five interrelated social fields—formal labour market, informal economy, bureaucratic institutions, territorial neighbourhoods, and personal networks—and examine how they operate under conditions of structural constraint. Each field follows its own logic, forms of capital, and doxa, yet poor individuals must navigate them simultaneously, often facing friction, symbolic violence, and failed capital conversion. We show that poverty is not confined to economic deprivation but involves complex inter-field struggles, where dignity, legitimacy, and access are unevenly distributed. A central argument is that poverty deepens when individuals are unable to convert resources across fields—e.g., when symbolic capital in the neighbourhood field fails to yield recognition in the bureaucratic or labour market field. Our Bourdieusian perspective uncovers the moral, institutional and spatial grammars of exclusion and highlights how agency is structured relationally across field boundaries. By moving beyond mono-institutional analysis, this field-theoretical approach offers a powerful tool for understanding social reproduction under constraint. We conclude with implications for both relational sociology and poverty policy, arguing for more field-sensitive interventions that recognise cross-domain inequalities and symbolic barriers.",

          "authors": "Jia Liu; Kohei Kawaguchi; tao li",
          "abstract": "When managing multiple stores within the same marketplace, retailers must tailor product assortments to reflect the heterogeneous preferences of local communities. This paper introduces\na consumer-centric, data-driven framework for interpretable market structure discovery and supporting localized assortment planning. At the core of the framework is the dual Poisson Dynamic System with Multilayer Factorization (dPDS-MF), which integrates a probabilistic generative model with a tensor factorization architecture to estimate spatiotemporal supply and demand patterns across products and locations. Specifically, dPDS-MF can profile different consumer segments driven by store visiting preferences, measure relationships between store locations, and simultaneously estimate each segment’s product preferences. These model outputs are then used to formulate a choice process for the localized assortment optimization problem. We apply our proposed framework to the retail vending market in major train stations in Japan. We demonstrate the face validity of the model outputs for guiding the selections of products at each location. We also show that the localized assortments generated by our framework are more meaningful and practical than benchmark strategies in the literature. Beyond the core model, we introduce several methodological extensions, highlighting the flexibility of the framework in addressing real-world retail scenarios and laying a foundation for future research.",

Both religiosity types unexpectedly raise self- and other-oriented virtue signaling, which in turn impact green choices; revealing that even socially motivated religious individuals can support sustainability. These results suggest green marketing can successfully appeal to both moral convictions and social recognition, offering a new perspective on how faith-based and status-driven motivations together shape environmentally responsible consumption.",
