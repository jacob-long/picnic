          "abstract": "Several initiatives have been taken to promote the open availability of bibliographic metadata of scholarly publications in Crossref. We present an up-to-date overview of the availability of six metadata elements in Crossref: reference lists, abstracts, ORCIDs, author affiliations, funding information, and license information. Our analysis shows that the availability of these metadata elements has improved over time, at least for journal articles, the most common publication type in Crossref. However, the analysis also shows that many publishers need to make additional efforts to realize full openness of bibliographic metadata.",

          "authors": "James E Pustejovsky; Jingru Zhang; Elizabeth Tipton",
          "abstract": "In many fields of application, meta-analyses routinely involve dependent effect size estimates and hierarchical data structures. Statistical methods for analyzing dependent effect sizes are now well developed, but there has been less attention to the initial stages of data analysis, prior to formal modeling. We propose a generic workflow for preliminary, exploratory analyses of meta-analytic databases, which focuses on validating the integrity of the input data and informing decisions about subsequent statistical modeling. The workflow entails creating summaries and visualizations of features of the primary studies included in the meta-analysis in order to understand the structure and distribution of the data, especially with respect to between- and within-study variation. We illustrate the workflow using data from previously published meta-analyses and discuss connections between the preliminary analysis and subsequent statistical modeling strategies.",

          "abstract": "We present a comprehensive meta-analysis of prospect theory (PT) parameter estimates, synthesizing data from 166 papers that report 812 estimates based on the decisions of approximately 52,000 subjects across 69 countries. We develop and implement a novel approach that enables the joint meta-analysis of multiple PT parameters, explicitly modeling potential covariation among them. Our analysis reveals that the average utility curvature (measured via the coefficient of constant relative risk aversion) is 0.33 for gains (95% credible interval [0.31, 0.36]) and 0.29 for losses (CrI [0.25, 0.32]). The average likelihood sensitivity parameter is 0.68 (CrI [0.66, 0.70]), and the average elevation parameter is 0.98 (CrI [0.95, 1.02]). These values align with the stylized facts of PT: diminishing sensitivity to changes in wealth relative to a reference point, and to changes in probabilities moving away from the endpoints of the unit interval. Beyond these central tendencies, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in parameter estimates, limiting the precision of predictions about future parameters. Among the study-level characteristics examined, the measurement method emerges as the most significant predictor of parameter variation, highlighting potential violations of procedural invariance. Nonetheless, a large portion of the heterogeneity remains unexplained even after adjusting for a wide range of study features, suggesting that subtle design differences meaningfully influence behavior. Our results thus offer not only a synthesis of existing findings but also a roadmap for future research.",

          "authors": "Xuemei Chen",
          "abstract": "Many studies argued shared syntactic representations between languages. However, less is known whether cross-linguistic syntactic processing rely on cognitive resources (e.g., working memory).  We therefore conducted two structural priming experiments with a working memory task (i.e., a number series recall task between prime and target) for Mandarin-Cantonese-English multilinguals. When prime and target involved different actions (Experiment 1), cross-language priming was similar not only between different languages (Cantonese-to-Mandarin vs. English-to-Mandarin), but also between different working memory load conditions (high vs. low). When prime and target shared the same action (Experiment 2), cross-language priming was stronger in Cantonese-to-Mandarin condition and in low load condition. Importantly, such a translation-equivalent boost effect occurred in low load condition but not in high load condition. These findings suggest an automatic processing of abstract cross-linguistic structural priming and an important role of working memory on translation-equivalent boost effect, supporting learning-based models of shared syntax among multilinguals’ languages.",

          "abstract": "Regret is a common emotion that might either catalyze or impair decision-making. What determines whether regret will be helpful or harmful in a given situation? We test the hypothesis that regret is more likely to hinder decision-making during the early stages of learning, when information is limited, but help during later stages of learning, when the learner has a better understanding of the environment. We introduce a Bayesian model of learning from regret, in which the “counterfactual weight” parameter – reflecting how strongly individuals update their beliefs about foregone outcomes – predicts both learning outcomes and the intensity of subjective regret. We find that probing regret early in the learning phase leads to worse performance than probing regret later or not at all. This work has important implications for both cognitive and affective science, shedding light on the appraisal mechanisms by which regret influences decision-making.",

          "abstract": "To resolve moral dilemmas, people often rely on decision strategies such as cost-benefit reasoning (CBR) or following moral rules. Previous studies show that people learn to increasingly rely on whichever strategy led to better outcomes in the past. Do they learn this by constructing a mental model of what outcomes would result from using either strategy (i.e.,model-based learning) or by assigning value directly to each strategy (i.e., model-free learning)? To answer this question, we adapted the two-step task to a trolley-type dilemma between following moral rules (e.g., obeying authority) versus (e.g., saving a larger group). In each of the 125 trials, participants’ choices led to either a common or a rare transition, which probabilistically led to good versus bad outcomes. Computational modeling and pre-registered analysis of behavioral data provided converging evidence that participants apply both model-based and model-free learning.",

          "authors": "Yang Wang; Sarah Horan Kerns; Timothy F. Brady; Jeremy Bennet Wilmer",
          "abstract": "Data visualizations often display averages without raw data to simplify communication and enhance understanding, especially for lay audiences. However, the theory that such simplification improves understanding remains untested. Here, we test this theory’s most basic prediction—that at minimum, the average itself is conveyed better by plotted averages than by plotted raw data. Remarkably, we find the opposite: under a wide range of conditions, overall accuracy of average estimation is higher with raw data. This is due to frequent, severe misinterpretations of both bar and line graphs depicting averages. In contrast, raw data yields some variability but few outright errors; notably, the observed variability is comparable to the uncertainty captured by confidence intervals. We conclude that plotted raw data provides valuable context that helps prevent misunderstandings of the average. Our findings challenge the notion that plotted averages alone yield enhanced understanding and emphasize the value of raw data in communicating evidence.",

          "authors": "Stanislav Pererodin",
          "abstract": "This conceptual paper develops the neurocognitive foundations of the RAMSD model (Role-Aspect Modular Self Dynamics), which is part of the broader theoretical framework Psychology of Inner Worlds. The model introduces Autonomous Role-Aspects (ARAs) as self-contained psychobiological modules that enact distinct social roles through their own cognitive, emotional, and neurosensory architecture. Unlike metaphorical \"parts\" in Internal Family Systems (IFS), ARAs are strictly role-bound, neurally grounded, and empirically verifiable.\n\nThe paper explores how chronic rumination reflects a systemic dysfunction in ARA modulation. Drawing from recent findings in neuroscience (DMN, SN, ECN), the model positions rumination not merely as a symptom of anxiety or trauma, but as a failure of internal role-switching and modular coordination. Specific phenomena such as autobiographical memory loops, interoceptive disconnection, and neuroemotional blocks are analyzed as consequences of ARA fixation and stagnation.\n\nThe RAMSD framework reframes mental perseveration as a role-specific simulation loop, where cognitive activity persists in the absence of emotional resolution or embodied feedback. This neurocognitive perspective bridges personality theory, trauma dynamics, and clinical interventions, offering a new pathway for diagnosing and therapeutically addressing ruminative states. The model further provides conceptual links to structural dissociation theory while extending its applicability to non-pathological yet dysfunctional modular states of self.\n\nThis work advances a novel, testable framework for understanding subpersonality dynamics and their role in repetitive negative thinking, and it proposes a roadmap for restoring internal modular flexibility through ARA-based interventions.",

          "abstract": "Deceptive design patterns are user interface and user experience design strategies within digital systems that, regardless of the designer’s intention, subvert, impair, or distort the user’s ability to make informed and autonomous choices. Deceptive design patterns are manipulative in nature and are widely used in apps, websites, and games to influence user behavior. In this study, we observe that commercially available mental health apps use deceptive design patterns on screens designed to (1) ask users to subscribe to paid plans, and (2) prevent users from canceling subscriptions. In addition, we observe that for-profit mental health apps use a high number of deceptive design patterns. We contend that profit-driven motives may lead for-profit mental health apps to adopt design strategies that might be detrimental to the users they aim to serve. We recommend establishing guidelines for best practices to avoid the usage of deceptive design patterns in mental health apps.",

          "abstract": "Experiences of unpredictability can create significant disruptions for children’s psychosocial development. Despite growing evidence highlighting the importance of predictable caregiving in fostering long-term healthy development, there is still limited understanding of proximal unpredictability within caregiver-child relationships. This study extended prior research on caregivers’ sensory signal unpredictability with infants, by (1) developing an observational measure of caregiver affective and behavioral unpredictability in early childhood, and (2) exploring its implications for preschoolers’ development of biobehavioral self-regulation. In this longitudinal study of 98 predominantly White 4 year-old children (50% female) and their mothers, greater caregiver affective and behavioral unpredictability was associated concurrently with greater respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) suppression (i.e., decrease in RSA) during the Day/Night inhibitory control task. Greater caregiver sensory signal unpredictability at 4 years predicted children’s greater RSA suppression during the Day/Night task 2 years later. Conversely, quadratic analyses revealed that lower or higher levels of affective and behavioral unpredictability predicted greater RSA augmentation than moderate unpredictability. However, neither sensory signals nor affective or behavioral unpredictability were associated with children's behavioral performance on the inhibitory control task. This study provides initial evidence that unpredictable caregiver signals appear to shape early, non-volitional processes that regulate arousal in novel situations.",

Previous work has shown that targeting is beneficial, but there are questions about its prevalence and contributing factors. With a novel instrument and a demographically representative, randomly assigned n=306 sample, we find that most U.S. adults target variability by default, even with minimal information (95% CI [78%, 92%]). Surprisingly, the same information presented via a standard bar graph inhibits targeting, while showing raw data enhances targeting. These results support a resource view of statistically sound decision making (over a deficit view), and contradict widespread ideas in data visualization (that raw data will overwhelm).",

          "abstract": "Cross-modal plasticity is an adaptive process where sensory neurons that have lost input from one sensory modality begin to respond to another modality, such as in deafness when auditory neurons begin to respond to visual stimulation. Research in cross-modal plasticity in the auditory system has mainly focused on extreme forms of sensory loss like total deafness, especially when occurring at birth or early in life. However, hearing loss is more common in adulthood and only partly affects hearing function to mild or moderate degrees. Fewer research studies have focused on cross-modal plasticity under these conditions. Our objective was to review evidence for cross-modal plasticity to evaluate if findings derived from populations with deafness extend to populations with partial hearing loss. We conclude that cross-modal plasticity occurs in adult-onset partial hearing loss and is likely to recruit cognitive systems. However, cross-modal effects are not clearly separate from intra-modal contributions. It is also unclear if cross-modal plasticity in partial hearing loss confers a behavioural advantage, or if it is influenced by age and cognitive decline.",

          "authors": "Joshua Gowin; Vanessa T. Stallsmith; Katelyn Weldon; Gregory Dooley; Hollis Karoly",
          "abstract": "Rationale. Concurrent with widespread legalization of cannabis in recent years, US adults are increasingly using alcohol and cannabis at the same time. Cannabis is thought to confer synergistic effects on alcohol intoxication, and the potential for increased cognitive impairment is a primary concern. Most co-administration studies to date have relied on low-THC cannabis, limiting generalizability to real-world consumption of higher-THC, legal-market cannabis products.\nObjectives. We aimed to test whether legal-market flower cannabis confers verbal learning and memory impairment over and above the effects of an acute dose of alcohol in a sample of heavy-drinking community participants who also report regular cannabis use. \nMethods. Participants (n=60, 40% female) completed two sessions in our mobile laboratory: an Alcohol-Only session and a Cannabis+Alcohol session. At each session, participants completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) before and after substance use. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated effects of substance use condition and sex on RAVLT performance, controlling for demographic covariates.\nResults. We observed a 6% decrease in RAVLT performance in the Cannabis+Alcohol session compared to the Alcohol-Only session (p&lt;.001). This effect was stronger in females than males (p=.003) for RAVLT trials prior to interference, but no sex differences emerged for post-interference trials. \nConclusions. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that legal-market cannabis is associated with acute verbal learning and memory impairments compared to alcohol alone, with females showing heightened vulnerability dur-ing the initial memory encoding phase.  Results highlight the risks of alcohol and cannabis co-use and underscore the importance of studying high-THC cannabis products.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to plan and make effective decisions depends on an accurate mental model of the environment. While learning generally requires novel external observations, people can also improve their understanding by reasoning about past experiences. In this work, we examine whether counterfactual simulation enhances learning in environments where planning is straightforward but encoding new information is challenging. Across two studies, participants navigated gridworlds, learning to avoid hazardous tiles. Some participants were asked to engage in counterfactual simulation, constructing alternative plans after observing navigation outcomes. Others learned purely from experience. While counterfactual paths contained fewer hazards than actual paths, we found reliable evidence across both studies that counterfactual simulation conferred no measurable advantage in either navigation performance or explicit environment learning. These findings shed new light on the scope of learning by thinking -- suggesting that the mechanism by which counterfactual reasoning enhances learning might not be by encouraging deeper encoding of past experiences.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of religious beliefs and practices is puzzling from the evolutionary viewpoint, but previous research suggested that religious traditions provide cooperative benefits and improve well-being. Seemingly in contrast with this claim are worldwide secularization trends where people disaffiliate from religions and belief in god(s). Theoreticians suggested that diminished pressures on cooperation and well-being no longer motivate individuals to seek religious benefits and pay the participation costs. We investigate this causal claim using the National Study of Youth and Religion dataset, which tracks the development of religiosity among US Christians from adolescence to young adulthood (n = 3 370). Using a general lagged panel methodology, we found that material security in Wave 1 (early adolescence) predicts higher probability of decrease in belief in God in Wave 4 (young adulthood). This result provides support for the hypothesis that participation in religious traditions is associated with living in an insecure socio-ecology, where the systems may still confer benefits onto their members. We conclude with a call for further research using more nuanced measures and larger sample sizes that may provide further insights into the potentially adaptive  nature of cultural systems.",

          "authors": "Matias Ezequiel Fraile Vazquez; Carissa Cascio; Paula Celeste Salamone; Jessica Hazelton; Facundo Emina; Jellina Prinsen",
          "abstract": "Cardiac interoception—the ability to perceive and interpret one’s own heartbeat—is increasingly recognized as fundamental to emotion regulation, cognition, and allostasis, as well as a potential transnosologic biomarker. Interoceptive accuracy—performance on objective behavioral tests of heartbeat detection—can be assessed using behavioral sensitivity indices derived from experimental tasks that leverage temporal information, such as d’ and mean distance. Despite the richness of temporal dynamics captured during the measurement of interoception, they are often overlooked in current behavioral indices to assess performance. As such, current analytical approaches are unrefined and insufficiently tailored to capture the full complexity of interoceptive processing, impeding our theoretical and clinical understanding of interoception. For instance, while d’ is theoretically suited for measuring sensitivity, its application is problematic in heartbeat detection tasks (HBT) as it lacks a clear signal-versus-noise distinction. To overcome this limitation, we refined d’ for HBT by 1) modifying how signal detection theory (SDT) outcomes—used to calculate d’—are extracted, and 2) implementing a pooled z-score approach to avoid dubious statistically assumptions. Thirty-three healthy participants performed a HBT, consisting of two exteroceptive blocks (tapping to a recorded heartbeat sound) followed by two interoceptive blocks (tapping to their own heartbeat), with concurrent electrocardiogram heartbeat recordings. We calculated d’ using the original design which uses temporal windows for SDT outcome extraction—, a window free design, and the window free design with pooled z-scoring, alongside mean distance—a response frequency-based interoceptive accuracy measure. Compared to the standard approach, our revised metric exhibited a more balanced influence of SDT outcomes on the pooled z-score d’ (p less than 0.001, d greaterthan 1), sensitivity differences across the three d’ approaches (p less than 0.001), stronger correlations between d’ and mean distance (p less than 0.001), and a more robust, assumption-light framework for interoceptive accuracy assessment. This refined d’ enhances the precision of accuracy measurements in future interoception studies—enabling more sensitive detection of sensory processing differences in clinical populations and advances the methodological rigor of cardiac interoception research. Furthermore, new metrics combining both d’ and mean distance are now possible and should be pursued, given their shared underlying sensitivity factor.",

          "abstract": "A major challenge in the study of unconscious processing is to effectively suppress the critical stimulus while ensuring it evokes a strong enough signal to be processed unconsciously. A possible way to achieve these goals is by calibrating stimulus strength. While calibrating stimulus strength is common in psychophysics, current calibration methods are not designed to find the maximal intensity in which the stimulus can still be rendered unconscious. Here, we demonstrate how calibration can be utilized to estimate, for each observer, this targeted threshold. We present a novel calibration procedure: the Subliminal Threshold Estimation Procedure (STEP), specifically designed for estimating the individual upper subliminal threshold. Using simulations, we showed that STEP outperforms existing calibration methods, which yielded strikingly low accuracy. We then further validated STEP using three empirical experiments. Together, these results establish STEP as highly beneficial for the study of unconscious processing.",

          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., audition, motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipating being asked to read a word aloud is sufficient to improve memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting the production effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

          "abstract": "Prior work finds that some elements of language input or skills during infancy and toddlerhood predict later language skills. Here we ask if combining these two sources of information about early language development improves predictions of language outcomes, using a longitudinal dataset that captures early language input and abilities over the first five years in a sample of 44 American English-learning children. While several early language skills significantly predicted later language skills (Spearman’s rho=0.44-0.63, p&lt;.05), most infant input measures did not. Notably, the most robust predictor of preschool language was parent-reported productive vocabulary at 1.5 years. This suggests that early language assessments (e.g., parental-reported vocabulary) can be reliable measures of language skills with high predictive value for longer-term language outcomes.",

          "authors": "Joshua Gowin; Vanessa T. Stallsmith; Katelyn Weldon; Gregory Dooley; Hollis Karoly",
          "abstract": "Rationale. Concurrent with widespread legalization of cannabis in recent years, US adults are increasingly using alcohol and cannabis at the same time. Cannabis is thought to confer synergistic effects on alcohol intoxication, and the potential for increased cognitive impairment is a primary concern. Most co-administration studies to date have relied on low-THC cannabis, limiting generalizability to real-world consumption of higher-THC, legal-market cannabis products.\nObjectives. We aimed to test whether legal-market flower cannabis confers verbal learning and memory impairment over and above the effects of an acute dose of alcohol in a sample of heavy-drinking community participants who also report regular cannabis use. \nMethods. Participants (n=60, 40% female) completed two sessions in our mobile laboratory: an Alcohol-Only session and a Cannabis+Alcohol session. At each session, participants completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) before and after substance use. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated effects of substance use condition and sex on RAVLT performance, controlling for demographic covariates.\nResults. We observed a 6% decrease in RAVLT performance in the Cannabis+Alcohol session compared to the Alcohol-Only session (p&lt;.001). This effect was stronger in females than males (p=.003) for RAVLT trials prior to interference, but no sex differences emerged for post-interference trials. \nConclusions. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that legal-market cannabis is associated with acute verbal learning and memory impairments compared to alcohol alone, with females showing heightened vulnerability dur-ing the initial memory encoding phase.  Results highlight the risks of alcohol and cannabis co-use and underscore the importance of studying high-THC cannabis products.",

          "abstract": "Early musical interactions play a formative role in structuring infant-caregiver exchanges. However, much of the research on communicative musicality has focused on dyadic formats, overlooking the triadic contexts in which infants engage with adults and objects. This study investigates how the musical structuring of adult object-use demonstrations varies across infancy and how these temporal features adapt over developmental time. Drawing on longitudinal naturalistic observations, we analyzed monthly home recordings of eight adult-infant dyads (infants aged 6–12 months) in Spain. Demonstrations were coded for spatial proximity (distant vs. immediate) and musical complexity (three levels) and analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results revealed that adults increasingly employed musically rich demonstrations as infants aged, with Level 3 demonstrations lengthening over time, while simpler forms declined in both frequency and duration. In contrast, moderately complex demonstrations (Level 2) remained brief but became more frequent, suggesting a transitional scaffolding function. These findings highlight how adults dynamically calibrate their actions' temporal and musical features to support infants’ participation within evolving triadic ecologies, offering new insight into the rhythmic architecture of early social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Data visualizations often display averages without raw data to simplify communication and enhance understanding, especially for lay audiences. However, the theory that such simplification improves understanding remains untested. Here, we test this theory’s most basic prediction—that at minimum, the average itself is conveyed better by plotted averages than by plotted raw data. Remarkably, we find the opposite: under a wide range of conditions, overall accuracy of average estimation is higher with raw data. This is due to frequent, severe misinterpretations of both bar and line graphs depicting averages. In contrast, raw data yields some variability but few outright errors; notably, the observed variability is comparable to the uncertainty captured by confidence intervals. We conclude that plotted raw data provides valuable context that helps prevent misunderstandings of the average. Our findings challenge the notion that plotted averages alone yield enhanced understanding and emphasize the value of raw data in communicating evidence.",

We found that questions varied along a reliable latent dimension of interpersonal depth ranging from “small talk” to “deep” questions. In Experiment 2 (N=188), participants answered a subset of these questions along with a number of self-report personality scales. Using a language model to estimate how informative participants’ free responses were, we find that individualized personality predictions were more accurate when incorporating free responses; furthermore, responses to deeper questions supported more accurate personality inferences than small talk. Taken together, results suggest not only that responses contained the statistical information necessary to make abstract social inferences, but also that people have accurate intuitions about which conversational topics enable learning about and connecting with others.",

Database searches (PsycINFO, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations) led to 295 samples with 1450 contrasts. An overall medium effect size (g = 0.48, 95% CI [0.43, 0.52]) was found.

Conducting mediation analysis manually is prone to errors, highlighting the need for accessible and flexible software tools. The open-source and free R framework offers many excellent software packages, most of which support mediation analysis with only observed variables. To address this limitation, we have developed an R package, `rmedsem`, which estimates mediational hypotheses with both observed and latent variables. `rmedsem` is the only software implementing mediation analyses within the frameworks of covariance-based SEM, partial least squares SEM, and Bayesian SEM. The package extracts the necessary coefficients from an estimated SEM model (using `lavaan`, `cSEM`, or `blavaan`) specified with the well-known `lavaan` syntax. It then follows a decision tree based on the approaches by Baron and Kenny (1986), and Zhao et al. (2010), to determine the presence and type of mediation. One limitation of `rmedsem` is its current restriction to linear mediation models.",

This phenomenon is known as “motivational matching”. Yet, studies commonly confound the beneficial effects of matching with the detrimental effects of mismatching. We present a framework to disentangle these effects, and report two experiments (using samples of American adults) that demonstrate how mismatching actively reduces persuasion. In Study 1 (N=689), messages promoting volunteerism were substantially less successful to the extent that they contained elements that conflicted with people’s motivations to volunteer. In Study 2 (N=1,101), the detrimental effects of providing mismatched messages (e.g., presenting liberal individuals with appeals highlighting conservative values) were greater in magnitude than the benefits of providing matched messages (e.g., presenting liberal individuals with appeals highlighting liberal values). We discuss implications for theory and practice, including situations when generic/neutral messaging may outperform matching-based persuasion.",

Mood and work performance were assessed using questionnaires developed for this study. Our findings showed no significant changes in the mood of older participants during the BGM interventions compared to baseline. However, the mood of the staff members significantly improved from baseline in both the morning and afternoon. By contrast, no significant effects on staff members’ work performance were observed.

They understand that people play particular roles within a larger social fabric that shapes their identities and expectations, and that their self image is affected by appraisals of how well (or not) they perform these roles. We designate here as relational concerns the considerations that arise from these roles and relationships, and study how they affect judgments of fairness. A series of vignette studies is used to explore how relational concerns compare with the impartial principles of equity and equality that fairness is commonly held to entail. We provide evidence that for participants based in the UK and in India, relational concerns are important for judging the fairness of distributions where people coordinate around shared goals. We also show that relational concerns may vary across cultural communities.",

          "abstract": "Over the past four decades, the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with\nelectroencephalography (EEG) has substantially enhanced our ability to probe and characterize the\nbrain’s dynamic responses to external perturbations. This approach holds promise for both basic\nresearch and clinical applications, yet two challenges remain: (i) reliably eliciting TMS-evoked\npotentials (TEPs) with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly early components, while\nminimizing time-locked artifacts (e.g. auditory, muscular, and somatosensory responses); and (ii)\nimproving the efficacy of TMS for both acute and long-term neuromodulation. EEG-informed TMS\nsetups have emerged to address the first problem, providing operators with electrophysiological\nfeedback online through specialized software and imaging readouts. This setup allows for\ncustomization of stimulation parameters based on individual anatomical and functional variability,\nto improve the TEP’s SNR and reduce both endogenous and exogenous artifacts. In parallel, systems\nneuroscience has shown that oscillatory excitatory and inhibitory dynamics exert a significant\ninfluence on cortical plasticity. This has motivated the development of EEG-triggered TMS\nsystems, in which stimulation is synchronized with ongoing neural activity to improve efficacy.\nDespite progress, questions remain about how, when, and where to stimulate to maximize effects\nand minimize variability. Closed-loop platforms are emerging to meet this need, using real-time\nneuroimaging readouts to dynamically guide personalized stimulation. This review traces the\nevolution of TMS-EEG, comparing EEG-blind and EEG-informed setups, and highlighting the role\nof EEG-triggered algorithms and closed-loop control in advancing the precision and reproducibility\nof probing and neuromodulation strategies.",

It remains unclear whether such omissions reflect gaps in memory encoding or whether the corresponding moments are available in memory but not accessed during retrieval. To investigate this, the present study assessed recognition memory for recalled versus omitted segments. Participants walked around their university campus while wearing eye-tracking glasses that recorded their experience. Twenty-four hours later, they freely recalled the events and completed a recognition task, discriminating between 5-s video clips from their own walk and those from other participants. Recognition accuracy was lower for unrecalled than for recalled moments, but nevertheless above chance. A second experiment replicated these results and tested whether overlaying participants’ original eye movements on the clips during recognition would enhance performance—it did not. These results suggest that omissions in the recall of events result from both encoding and retrieval processes: while some moments may not be stored, others are available but not accessed during recall. We discuss how the dynamics of event perception and memory reconstruction contribute to the selective recall of real-world experiences.",

Following an example from psychological research, we provide a non-technical introduction to different estimands in longitudinal settings, with a particular focus on joint effects of treatment strategies — employing the potential outcomes framework and directed acyclic graphs. Additionally, we provide R-code to simulate and estimate these effects. In longitudinal research, joint effects are central because they extend average treatment effects to repeated interventions, offering a practical measure of combined intervention effects over time.\n\nBesides explaining the concept of joint effects, we discuss their applicability to psychological research. We focus on their interpretation and whether they can realistically be identified in longitudinal observational studies in psychology. In this context, addressing unmeasured confounding is a crucial aspect of causal inference, yet it is insufficiently discussed in the psychological literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a class of research designs for psychological studies where treatment assignment is driven by observable covariates so that joint effects can be identified under more reasonable assumptions.",

Participants walked around their university campus while wearing eye-tracking glasses that recorded their experience. Twenty-four hours later, they freely recalled the events and completed a recognition task, discriminating between 5-s video clips from their own walk and those from other participants. Recognition accuracy was lower for unrecalled than for recalled moments, but nevertheless above chance. A second experiment replicated these results and tested whether overlaying participants’ original eye movements on the clips during recognition would enhance performance—it did not. These results suggest that omissions in the recall of events result from both encoding and retrieval processes: while some moments may not be stored, others are available but not accessed during recall. We discuss how the dynamics of event perception and memory reconstruction contribute to the selective recall of real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "Because the successful implementation of climate policies requires public acceptance, it is critical to understand the determinants of policy acceptance and ways to boost it. In this research, we aim to test the causality of the effect of perceived effectiveness on policy acceptance. Further, we examine whether providing people with information about a climate policy’s objective effectiveness can enhance perceived effectiveness and, in turn, the policy’s acceptance. In a preregistered experiment (N = 953; T1), participants were asked about the perceived effectiveness and acceptance of a speed limit on German highways. Beforehand, participants in the information condition were provided with details about the speed limit’s effectiveness in terms of CO2 reductions, whereas participants in the control condition did not receive this information. Participants were asked about their perceived effectiveness and policy acceptance again 1.5 years later (T2; n = 334). We found that providing vs. not providing such information led to higher perceived effectiveness but not greater policy acceptance at T1. However, among those participants without prior knowledge of the speed limit’s effectiveness, providing the information positively affected both perceived effectiveness and policy acceptance at T1. Finally, we found a causal indirect effect of intervention (vs. control) on policy acceptance (at both T1 and T2) via perceived effectiveness at T1. Our results suggest that perceived effectiveness is an integral causal determinant of policy acceptance in the climate domain. Explaining the objective effectiveness of climate policies thus poses a promising approach for policymakers to increase public acceptance of climate policies.",

          "abstract": "Resting state functional connectivity can be measured using resting state functional MRI (fMRI) but also task-dependent fMRI in blocked designs. The latter has been demonstrated in healthy participants but not yet validated in clinical cohorts. Since functional connectivity of resting state networks (e.g. default mode network [DMN]) is altered in people with epilepsy and the impact of the disease on the quality of the ‘pseudo’ resting state data is unclear, we aimed to validate the method using a clinical fMRI in people with epilepsy. We compared functional connectivity derived from a standard resting state and rest periods of a clinical language fMRI (‘pseudo’ resting state) of 92 people with focal epilepsy. The ‘pseudo’ resting state fMRI was analyzed alongside the resting state fMRI across different aspects of functional connectivity: topography, within-network connectivity and second-level group comparisons. Therefore, we conducted independent component analyses (ICA), similarity-, regions of interest (ROI)-to-ROI- and second-level seed-based analyses. Results indicated similar ICA-derived topography of DMNs from both methods. Within-network connectivity of DMN regions also yielded comparable results. Seed-based analyses of left and right hippocampal connectivity in people with left and right temporal lobe epilepsy also revealed analogous results, with minor restrictions in right hippocampal connectivity. The ‘pseudo’ resting state method produces highly similar results to a standard resting state method in people with epilepsy across different aspects of functional connectivity. It is therefore an efficient approach to gain insights into functional connectivity networks in a clinical cohort without performing an additional resting state fMRI.",

          "abstract": "Interactive narratives provide the reader with a sense of agency and immersion by giving readers the ability to effect change in the story. We conducted three experiments (N = 4,139) to explore how interactive narratives can effectively enhance empathy. We used narratives which focused on accessibility in public bathrooms through the lens of physically disabled people and transgender people. In Study 1, we found that interactive narratives could promote agency and immersion, two factors that theory suggests may contribute to prosocial outcomes. We found that immersion (and thus, empathy) seems more difficult to induce for participants who hold high levels of prejudice against the target group—especially for the transgender protagonist condition. In Study 2, we leveraged work on intergroup contact to encourage participants to individuate the protagonist by manipulating the time point at which we told participants that protagonist was transgender. Our findings ran counter to hypotheses—withholding the protagonist’s trans identity until the end of the story decreased immersion and led to less empathetic outcomes in highly prejudiced individuals. In Study 3, we examined whether manipulating the participant’s similarity to the protagonist (vis-à-vis political ideology) could increase empathy toward the protagonist. Although we replicated findings from Studies 1 and 2, highly prejudiced participants still did not report greater immersion even when the protagonist was purportedly ideologically similar to them.  We find that certain factors such as immersion appear useful for promoting empathy. However, an effective one-size-fits-all intervention remains elusive when promoting empathy toward specific, heavily politicized groups.",

          "abstract": "What intuitions guide adults in extending the meanings of new words? Are these intuitions consistent with prelinguistic sensitivities operative in infancy? Across two preregistered experiments, adult participants saw simple grid-world environments in which characters moved in a “C” path efficiently (or not) to an object (or not). These events were labeled with a novel verb or noun. Participants were asked whether that word applied to new events varying in object-directedness, path, and efficiency. By contrast to infants’ focus on efficiency, adults instead focused on object-directedness and path, and they did so similarly for both verbs and nouns. Language might thus build on universal, prelinguistic assumptions of goal-directedness and efficiency to specify what goal an agent might have (e.g., object- vs. location-directed) as well as how an agent might achieve that goal (e.g., this vs. that kind of path), ultimately restricting the hypothesis space for action understanding and supporting learning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Thought suppression is suggested as a causal factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as it can lead to an increase in intrusive thoughts. However, the neural mechanisms through which obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) influence thought suppression, particularly in the context of preferential processing of negatively valenced stimuli, remains unclear. We hypothesized that OCS would predict increased inhibitory communication between frontal and parahippocampal neurocircuitry during the suppression of negative words. Additionally, we tested an exploratory analysis to see whether this was mediated by preferential processing of these stimuli. \nMethods: EEG was recorded from 47 participants tasked with directed forgetting of negative and neutral words. Data from 38 of these participants were analyzed. We examined the influence of OCS on fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 (13-18 Hz) synchronization during a Directed Forgetting task. An exploratory analysis of the mediating role of stimulus processing bias, measured via the late positive potential (LPP) following the word stimulus, was assessed using a mediated moderation model.\nResults: OCS predicted enhanced fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 synchronisation when instructed to forget negative words. The moderating effect of valence was mediated by preferential processing of negative stimuli, as indicated by increased LPP. \nConclusions: Healthy individuals with relatively high OCS exhibit compensatory connectivity between frontal and parahippocampal regions when attempting to suppress negative emotional stimuli. Exploratory analysis showed this compensatory activity is influenced by both preferential processing of negative stimuli and the severity of OCS, providing preliminary evidence of a neural mechanism that may contribute to the persistence of intrusive thoughts in OCD.",

We selected 206 emotional expressions from models of Black African descent from the Racially Diverse Affective Expression (RADIATE) dataset (Conley et al., 2018). Fifty-four students from the University of Limpopo, South Africa, rated these stimuli. Using a 75% rater agreement threshold, we refined the set to 131 validated images, termed the Limpopo facial emotion stimulus set. This subset demonstrated high recognition of the intended facial expressions and strong consistency between raters. We present psychometric results describing these open-access stimuli, which we hope will be informative for other researchers. Our validation process underscores the importance of adapting materials to match the cultural and social context of the target population.

Our findings showed no significant changes in the mood of older participants during the BGM interventions compared to baseline. However, the mood of the staff members significantly improved from baseline in both the morning and afternoon. By contrast, no significant effects on staff members’ work performance were observed.

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

Results show that the novel algorithm outperforms traditional approaches on simulated data. We further demonstrate that the novel algorithm provides more conclusive evidence for relationships between mind wandering reports and pupil predictors compared to traditional window-averaging.

In a multi-level meta-analysis of 115 experiments (N = 21,770), moral licensing was stronger when participants were observed (g = 0.65) than unobserved (g = 0.13). After accounting for publication bias with robust Bayesian meta-analysis, there was moderate evidence for licensing when participants were observed (g = 0.51; BF10 = 9.14), but moderate evidence against licensing when unobserved (Hedge’s g = -0.01; BF10 = 0.11). Ambiguity did not moderate moral licensing. These findings suggest that moral licensing is elicited through interpersonal motives, clarify when licensing (vs. consistency) occurs, and explain why many online studies failed to replicate.

This study investigates whether two interventions can mitigate cheating in an algorithmic honesty game: transparency (information about which user input causes which algorithm behavior) and framing (natural language cues about the moral valence of behavior). In a 2 × 2 experimental design, we find that transparency does not reduce dishonest behavior, despite participants actively engaging with and understanding the provided information. Conversely, framing — replacing neutral labels like ”maximize profit” with ethically charged terms like ”maximize cheating” — substantially reduces dishonesty.

Integrating the Attentional Gate Model (AGM) and Internal Clock Model (ICM), we examined how emotional valence and stress alter perceived duration in Virtual Reality (VR). This study assesses the effects of valence (calming, neutral, stressful) and stress (low/high) on prospective time estimation, mood, and arousal.\nMethods: Fifty-four adults (18–39 yr) explored three custom VR environments: (1) a tranquil Japanese garden, (2) an affectively neutral room, and (3) a threatening underground sewer. Active navigation promoted presence; a distraction task separated conditions. Valence and arousal were assessed with the Visual Analog Mood Scales, stress with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), and perceived duration with a verbal estimation task. Mixed-model ANOVAs evaluated main and interaction effects.\nResults: Valence reliably shaped perceived duration: calming VR led to overestimation, stressful VR to underestimation, and neutral VR to intermediate timing. Baseline stress level, as measured by PSS-10, neither altered timing nor interacted with valence. Nevertheless, the VR environments affected VAMS’ mood metrics: calming environments elevated mood and reduced perceived stress, whereas stressful environments lowered mood and heightened stress.\nConclusions: Findings support the AGM—attentionally demanding negative environments shorten perceived time—and the ICM—valence-linked arousal speeds or slows the pacemaker. Contrary to classical predictions, in VR, baseline stress did not distort duration, suggesting valence-driven attentional allocation outweighs pre-exposure stress levels. VR offers a controllable platform for dissecting time-perception mechanisms and advancing interventions that target emotion-related temporal distortions.",

          "authors": "Bastien Durocher; Nathan Leroy; Arnaud D'Argembeau",
          "abstract": "When recalling real-world events, people typically remember a sequence of key moments rather than a continuous stream, often omitting portions of their previous experience. It remains unclear whether such omissions reflect gaps in memory encoding or whether the corresponding moments are available in memory but not accessed during retrieval. To investigate this, the present study assessed recognition memory for recalled versus omitted segments. Participants walked around their university campus while wearing eye-tracking glasses that recorded their experience. Twenty-four hours later, they freely recalled the events and completed a recognition task, discriminating between 5-s video clips from their own walk and those from other participants. Recognition accuracy was lower for unrecalled than for recalled moments, but nevertheless above chance. A second experiment replicated these results and tested whether overlaying participants’ original eye movements on the clips during recognition would enhance performance—it did not. These results suggest that omissions in the recall of events result from both encoding and retrieval processes: while some moments may not be stored, others are available but not accessed during recall. We discuss how the dynamics of event perception and memory reconstruction contribute to the selective recall of real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "Effective emergency response teamwork relies on the team members’ mental models, such as having accurate situation awareness and shared mental models of the task, situation and teamwork. The present study developed and field-tested an approach to measure and monitor mental models in-situ. This was done by comparing the information that different team members had about their tasks and compiling the information to a “cohesion report” for the team leader. Data was collected during ongoing training scenarios across 14 training sessions for second-line emergency response teams (N = 134 participant recordings). The study developed and demonstrated a way of measuring cohesion. The study also tested the effect of providing the team leader with the team’s level of cohesion during the training session. Replicating a previous finding, we found that team-membership influenced team members’ shared mental models. This indicates that certain team factors contribute to some teams having higher cohesion than other teams. The experimental manipulation of providing team leaders with access to the cohesion measure improved the team’s mental models (when excluding the team role with most variation). Such tools could be used to evaluate and enhance mental models in emergency response teams, and further research could explore how team leaders could benefit from in-situ monitoring of the team’s mental models.",

          "authors": "杨灿; Chongzeng Bi",
          "abstract": "Based on interdependence theory, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of interaction partners' Zhongyong and social mindfulness on individuals' cooperation. Zhongyong, which emphasizes balance (中) and harmony (和), may foster cooperative behaviors when recognized. The characteristics of Zhongyong align with the skills and will required for the occurrence of social mindfulness behavior. This alignment can provide a plausible explanation for the emergence of social mindfulness, potentially enhancing individuals' trust in the benevolence of their interaction partners and strengthening the positive role of social mindfulness in promoting cooperation.\n\nThree studies were conducted to test the hypotheses. Study 1 (N = 114) utilized a two-factor (interaction partners' Zhongyong and social mindfulness), two-level (high versus low), between-subjects design. Participants engaged in a public goods game after perceiving their virtual partners' Zhongyong and social mindfulness. Zhongyong was manipulated by presenting a virtual partner who endorsed either 80% or 20% Zhongyong statements on the Zhongyong Belief-Value Scale. Social mindfulness was manipulated by having the virtual partner choose either 80% of non-unique options or 20% in the social mindfulness paradigm. Participants' cooperative behavior was assessed through the amount of money they contributed, while their trust in their partners was inferred from their predictions regarding their partners' contributions. Study 2 (N = 199) and Study 3 (N = 135) replicated Study 1's procedure. In Study 2, a dictator game was implemented, with the dependent variable measured by the amount of money participants chose to allocate to their partners. Each participant was provided with 10 yuan to distribute. In Study 3, the cold-pressor test was used, and the dependent variable was indicated by the duration participants kept their hands submerged in cold water.\n\nThe current study revealed a positive correlation between partners' Zhongyong and social mindfulness on participants' cooperative behavior. Despite the experimental setting posing challenges to individuals' predisposition for cooperation, the presence of Zhongyong and social mindfulness consistently positively impacted cooperation. Study 1 revealed that both Zhongyong and social mindfulness had a statistically significant effect on cooperation, with participants more likely to cooperate with high Zhongyong or social mindfulness. Moreover, partners' Zhongyong enhanced the positive impact of social mindfulness on cooperative behavior. Similar findings were observed regarding partners' Zhongyong and social mindfulness on participants' trust. While Studies 2 and 3 largely replicated these findings, Study 2 did not show a statistically significant main effect of social mindfulness on cooperation. \n\nThe application of Zhongyong enhances individuals' trust and reciprocal motivations, prompting them to think and act in a Zhongyong manner through experimental tasks designed to stimulate recognition of partners characterized by Zhongyong, thus fostering a cooperative tendency. This differs from cooperating driven solely by personal adherence to Zhongyong. Moreover, Zhongyong offers a rational explanation for the occurrence of social mindfulness behaviors, reliably predicting cooperative behavior and amplifying the positive influence of prosocial tendencies on cooperation. In conclusion, this study suggests that people are more inclined to cooperate with partners exhibiting high levels of Zhongyong and social mindfulness, even in situations characterized by low mutual dependence, high conflict of interests, and high relative power—conditions typically discourage cooperation according to interdependence theory. The role of Zhongyong in fostering cooperation under such circumstances is particularly noteworthy.",

          "authors": "Ali Salmani; Sajjad Basharpour; Zahra Vaziri; Mohammad Ali Salehinejad",
          "abstract": "Background\nIndividuals with substance use disorder (iSUD) often show diminished motivation toward treatment-seeking and adherence, resulting in a higher relapse rate, especially during the abstinence phase. A key cognitive correlate of substance use and treatment-seeking behavior is the ability to regulate emotion. While transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) shows potential for treating SUD, most studies have focused on craving or cognitive deficits. This randomized, placebo-controlled study examines the effects of 15 daily sessions of prefrontal tDCS on treatment motivation and cognitive emotion regulation in iSUD during the abstinence phase.\nMethods\nThirty-two young male iSUDs (mean age= 22.80±1.92) were randomly assigned to the experimental (n=16) or placebo (n=16) groups. The experimental group underwent 15 sessions of anodal left and cathodal right dlPFC stimulation (2 mA, 20 min), while the placebo group received sham stimulation over the same period. Assessments of readiness, eagerness, motivation for treatment, and cognitive emotion regulation were conducted before and after the intervention.\nResults\nThe active repeated prefrontal tDCS significantly boosted motivation for change and treatment in iSUD in comparison to sham tDCS. This intervention specifically improved participants’ recognition of issues related to their substance use and reduced ambivalence about it. Additionally, active prefrontal tDCS enhanced adaptive cognitive emotion regulation while reducing maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies in iSUD.\nConclusions\nRepeated prefrontal tDCS can help iSUD during the abstinence phase to improve adaptive emotion regulation strategies, thereby boosting motivation for treatment seeking. Up and downregulation of left and right dlPFCs is a promising approach for cognitively and motivationally preparing iSUD for treatment-seeking.",

          "abstract": "It is unclear how exposure time contributes to image memory during naturalistic visual \nbehavior since most perceptual and memory investigations involve instructed experimental \ntasks that modulate resource allocation and affect processing from very early stages. We \nhave recently assumed that during naturalistic encoding, without task-based modulations, \nmore physically salient images register better in memory since they entail higher \nrecruitment of early visual system processing leading to better quality signals passing \ndownstream. After finding that spatial image saliency positively contributes to memory \n(bigger and higher-contrast images are better remembered), here we tested whether during \nnaturalistic encoding temporal image saliency contributes to memory, assuming that images \nviewed for longer will be better remembered. In a set of experiments (n=182, 250-2000ms \nexposure time) we found that images viewed for longer (2000ms) were remembered better \n(13% higher accuracy, 1.43 times more) than images presented for shorter times (250ms), \nand that this effect was independent of image size effect on memory. These findings suggest \nthat temporal aspects of visual input, much like spatial aspects, play a significant and \nindependent role in memory formation under naturalistic conditions.

This research explores menstruation stigma is enacted in discussions around menstrual health both socially and with healthcare professionals. Reflexive thematic analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews with menstruating women, provides insights into the complex interplay between hegemonic femininity and menstrual stigma in how women approach menstrual health conversations with each other and healthcare providers. Results illustrated how enacted stigma as well as internalisation of stigma and hegemonic femininity contributed to participants’ sense of anticipated stigma, which inhibited their ability to communicate openly about menstruation outside of close informal support networks. Stigma experiences eroded participants’ trust in healthcare providers, and resulted in self-censorship in conversations about menstruation more broadly. However, the research also shows how empowering positive healthcare interactions can be, and a number of participants engaged in menstrual activism by resisting menstrual taboo. By highlighting the experiences of young women in menstrual health communication, this research contributes to our understanding of the pervasive impact of menstrual stigma and patriarchal norms of femininity, while shedding light on the potential to harness change through supportive healthcare interactions and everyday menstrual activism.",

          "abstract": "In face-to-face communication, representational gestures—imagistically evoking properties of referents—have been shown to support both language comprehension and development. In adult-adult interaction, representational gestures are systematically produced before the words they are semantically related to and therefore can be used to predict upcoming words by addressees. However, gestures cannot support predictions for words unfamiliar to the addressee and therefore being produced before the semantically associated words may be less useful for young children. Nothing is known yet about whether the same temporal speech-gesture relationship holds for caregivers talking to their children. We annotated representational gestures from a large corpus (ECOLANG) of semi-naturalistic conversations between caregivers and their 3-4-year-old children (n = 929 gestures from n = 38 caregivers). We found a more variable relationship between the timing of the gesture and the speech. Specifically, for words more frequently used in language to young children or recently mentioned, gesture strokes (the meaningful part of a gesture) tended to be produced before the word’s onset; for rarely used words and words not mentioned recently, the stroke tended to be produced at the same time or after the onset of the word. Thus, caregivers are sensitive to the level of familiarity of the words for their child and dynamically adjust the timing of their gestures to likely serve different functions: supporting online prediction of words familiar to the child and providing semantic enrichment for words less familiar to them.",

Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed two causal frameworks: one representing the 3 distinct latent categories, and another expressing causal relationships across them. Study 2 (N = 100, M age = 39.95y) demonstrated that adults flexibly apply either framework depending on the task, using the latent causes for trait inference, and causal beliefs to plan interventions on other agents. These findings suggest that intuitive theories of other people include both a sense of which capacities“go together” and their causal connections within and across domains.",

Our study is the first in-depth investigation of expressive norms across a wide spectrum of 64 theory-informed emotions.  We measured expressive norms ranging from suppression to over-expression within two different contexts (public vs. private) and interactant types (close relations vs. distant others). Using a theory-building subsample (n = 507), we employed ant colony optimization (AOC) and a suite of factor analytical techniques to distill the emotions into three dimensions: harmonious, vulnerable, and disharmonious. Subsequent validation in a separate confirmatory subsample (n = 506) supported this structure in all situations (conditions), providing evidence these dimensions are robust. Notably, this new Expression Regulation Scale (ERS) demonstrated scalar invariance across all situations using repeated measures Confirmatory Factor Analysis. We introduce scoring metrics and norms to aid researchers and practitioners in their analytical endeavors and highlight potential avenues for future research aimed at enriching our understanding of expression regulation.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objective: Emotional states and stress distort time perception, yet findings are inconsistent, particularly in immersive media. Integrating the Attentional Gate Model (AGM) and Internal Clock Model (ICM), we examined how emotional valence and stress alter perceived duration in Virtual Reality (VR). This study assesses the effects of valence (calming, neutral, stressful) and stress (low/high) on prospective time estimation, mood, and arousal.\nMethods: Fifty-four adults (18–39 yr) explored three custom VR environments: (1) a tranquil Japanese garden, (2) an affectively neutral room, and (3) a threatening underground sewer. Active navigation promoted presence; a distraction task separated conditions. Valence and arousal were assessed with the Visual Analog Mood Scales, stress with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), and perceived duration with a verbal estimation task. Mixed-model ANOVAs evaluated main and interaction effects.\nResults: Valence reliably shaped perceived duration: calming VR led to overestimation, stressful VR to underestimation, and neutral VR to intermediate timing. Baseline stress level, as measured by PSS-10, neither altered timing nor interacted with valence. Nevertheless, the VR environments affected VAMS’ mood metrics: calming environments elevated mood and reduced perceived stress, whereas stressful environments lowered mood and heightened stress.\nConclusions: Findings support the AGM—attentionally demanding negative environments shorten perceived time—and the ICM—valence-linked arousal speeds or slows the pacemaker. Contrary to classical predictions, in VR, baseline stress did not distort duration, suggesting valence-driven attentional allocation outweighs pre-exposure stress levels. VR offers a controllable platform for dissecting time-perception mechanisms and advancing interventions that target emotion-related temporal distortions.",

          "abstract": "**Objective:** This paper introduces and extends the concept of seam interfaces—neurocognitive transition zones mediating the dynamic interaction between externally imposed social roles and internally activated sub-personality modules—within the framework of the Role-Autonomy Model of Sub-Personality Dynamics (RAMSD).\n\n**Theoretical Approach:** Seam interfaces are conceptualized as adaptive hubs of inter-network connectivity, primarily involving the Default Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network (SN), and Executive Control Network (ECN), which orchestrate the switching, integration, and conflict resolution mechanisms between autobiographical identity and contextually cued behavior. This framework integrates contemporary neuroscience of selfhood, embodied cognition, affective regulation, and clinical observations in trauma, dissociation, and role rigidity.\n\n**Propositions:** Dysfunctional seam activity gives rise to measurable disturbances in cognitive-affective integration, manifesting as role dissociation (disconnection between action and self), sub-personality stagnation (inflexibility despite context), and neuro-emotional block (affective shutdown or dissonance). These syndromes are behaviorally and neurologically tractable.\n\n**Implications:** The model informs the design of experimental protocols (e.g., ERP-based role-switching tasks), development of psychometric instruments, agent-based simulations of identity adaptation, and novel therapeutic interventions targeting inter-network coherence and role fluidity through neurofeedback, cognitive reframing, and embodied integration techniques.\n\n*Note: This theoretical model is presented for exploratory and conceptual purposes. It does not constitute a clinical diagnostic tool or therapeutic protocol and is not intended to replace any established mental health frameworks (e.g., DSM-5 or ICD-11). All proposed clinical illustrations and hypotheses remain subject to empirical testing.*",

Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, learning theory, and memory systems research, we argue that widespread underuse of the brain’s declarative and procedural systems has weakened internal representations—schemata—that are essential for reasoning, intuition, and expertise.\n\nWe examine how shifts toward digital dependency and constructivist educational models have reduced opportunities for repeated retrieval, proceduralization, and the formation of robust engrams and neural manifolds. These trends disrupt the consolidation and automatization of biologically secondary knowledge, impairing schema-driven prediction, error correction, and transfer. We propose that the weakening of these memory systems—long before neurodegeneration sets in—may explain recent cognitive declines more plausibly than purely environmental or genetic accounts.\n\nThe chapter closes by outlining implications for cognitive theory, educational practice, and AI-era learning environments. Rather than viewing memory as outdated in a world of instant information access, we argue that internal knowledge remains foundational for deep learning and that cognitive augmentation requires—not replaces—biological memory.",

Here, we present results of an exploratory computational-acoustic model where changes to F3 are interpreted in relationship to changes to vocal tract area transfer function of a large sample (N = 10,000) of systematically varied tube model sequences. The results show a consistent pattern: constriction at the front of the vocal tract, followed by an open area and a secondary constriction, systematically shapes F3. This pattern aligns with acoustic signatures of both rounding and rhoticity, without presupposing phonological categories. These results offer a principled acoustic account of why the traditional link between rounding and lowered F3 varies in natural speech. Future work will explore whether certain vocal tract regions are more acoustically “sensitive” than others.",

          "abstract": "Contingency management (CM) is a psychosocial treatment used to improve a number of socially significant behaviors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated many times over in a variety of treatment contexts, and efforts to demonstrate its effectiveness are underway at the state level. Development of useful predictive modeling has lagged far behind other technological advancements in methodology for improving treatment outcomes. Based on these other technological advancements it is well known that modifying treatment parameters (e.g., incentive magnitude) can result in better treatment outcomes, yet, to my knowledge, no studies have relied on predictive models to provide additional supports to those who may not be successful under default treatment parameters.  In the present paper I propose and validate a framework for predicting early success in CM treatment using a large CM dataset consisting of over 800 participants. Within that framework I develop models to predict CM treatment outcomes using only data from intake questionnaires and the prediction of early treatment success. The best performing model for predicting early treatment success achieved a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) score of 0.83. Using that model I predicted continuous abstinence of at least 8 and at least 12, with ROC-AUC scores of 0.81 and 0.77 respectively.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged rapidly as a field encompassing advanced models and algorithms that can create unique content such as images, text, and audio. This technology holds significant potential across diverse domains; however, it also presents unique challenges, including ethical concerns, inaccuracies in generated content, and increased cognitive and emotional stress for educators who must adapt to fast-evolving technologies. The question of how should ChatGPT and similar Gen AI tools be incorporated into the education and training of teachers is one of the urgent priorities for global research. This study examines Finnish pre-service teachers’ readiness, experiences, and behavioral intentions regarding Gen AI adoption in their learning and teaching practices. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative survey data alongside qualitative responses, focusing on AI usage patterns, perceived usefulness, and challenges.\nFindings indicate a significant gap in Gen AI adoption, with 27% of participants having never used Gen AI tools at the time of survey (April-June, 2024), while the majority engaged sporadically. Despite low perceived accuracy, frequent users continued using Gen AI, suggesting that usability, efficiency, and creative support outweigh accuracy concerns in adoption decisions. Ideation and content creation were the most common Gen AI-supported tasks, whereas self-regulated, personalized learning, and prompt refinement remained underutilized, indicating a lack of awareness or confidence in Gen AI’s broader potential. Challenges primarily related to AI-generated output quality and prompting difficulties, with users preferring to modify AI outputs rather than refine prompts to improve responses. Strategies such as output modification and external verification were employed, though critical evaluation was not always explicitly stated. These findings highlight the need for structured AI literacy training, emphasizing prompt engineering, evaluative judgment, and strategic AI integration in teacher education.\nThis study underscores the importance of developing Gen AI competencies among pre-service teachers to ensure effective, responsible, and pedagogically meaningful AI adoption. Future research should explore longitudinal AI adoption trends, cross-cultural comparisons, and the impact of AI literacy training on teaching practices.",

Study 2 showed that limiting an agent’s knowledge changes which actions people perceive to be available for the agent, which in turn affects whether people judged an agent as being “forced” to take a particular action.

Child abuse is associated with various psychiatric and related conditions including paranoia. A paranoid call may sanction destruction of supposed enemies. Putin formulated the aims of his military operation, one of them being protection of Russian-speakers from genocide. It is known that ethnic Russians have not undergone genocide. Apparently, this idea is delusional. Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviors. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some ethnically non-Russian subjects within and outside the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence. The most important topic in this connection is the inter-ethnic difference in the birth rate and migrations, which is avoided by Russian media and officials these days.

          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Newceious Substrate Theory (NST) as a first-origin, harmonic field theory of consciousness. NST defines the Newceious as a structurally non-degradable, pre-symbolic substrate that enables the emergence, stabilization, and lawful return of conscious coherence in both biological and synthetic systems. In contrast to recursive, computational, or integration-based models of mind, NST proposes that consciousness arises not from information processing or cortical activation, but from phase-aligned resonance with a coherence field that exists prior to identity, awareness, or experience.\n\nNST is positioned as a field-level ontology operating within the structural null point defined in Collapse Harmonics Theory as Layer Ø—the boundary at which symbolic recursion breaks down. The Newceious is the first lawful resonance condition inside this null domain, permitting identity to return from collapse without narrative reconstruction or memory retrieval. Empirical anchors include: coma recovery without cognitive reformation, anesthesia emergence, dream-state phase realignment, regenerative identity blueprints, and split-attention coherence in lucid states. NST also provides a framework for differentiating substrate-aligned cognition from recursive hallucination in large language models and synthetic consciousness simulations.\n\nThis theory establishes a new ontological category for consciousness science—substrate-based coherence without content—and introduces a testable model for reentry dynamics following collapse-phase symbolic failure. By defining consciousness as a phase-coherent field alignment rather than a symbolic or computational phenomenon, NST offers a unified theoretical foundation for consciousness research, field-resonant clinical protocols, and post-symbolic AI development.",

This study examined HIV stigma among healthcare providers in Türkiye, assessing its prevalence, contributing factors, and differences between HIV care providers and other healthcare professionals. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control conducted a cross-sectional survey with 266 healthcare providers, both within and outside of HIV care. Measures included HIV knowledge and training, fear of infection, observed stigma, stigmatizing attitudes, intention to discriminate against key populations, and guidelines and policies regarding HIV. Explanatory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted for the Turkish scale and chi-square tests were conducted for descriptive statistics and to compare stigma indicators between groups. Stigmatizing attitudes and fear of infection were prevalent across all participants. While HIV care providers demonstrated higher knowledge and training levels, they were not immune to discriminatory practices. Fear of infection persisted even among HIV care providers, and policies reinforcing stigma—such as HIV testing without consent and differential treatment protocols—were commonly reported. Many healthcare providers lacked training in stigma reduction, and equity, diversity, and inclusion. Structural and policy-level interventions, alongside targeted stigma-reduction training, are necessary to address discriminatory practices. Efforts should focus on strengthening anti-discrimination policies, integrating inclusive curricula, and fostering institutional change to ensure equitable care for people with HIV.",

While animal-related phobias are the most common specific phobias in general, a recent study by Veale and colleagues (2025) suggests that among persons seeking treatment for specific phobias, emetophobia appears to be the most prevalent. Furthermore, the study indicates that persons with emetophobia differ from those with other specific phobias (e.g., in terms of gender ratio or treatment setting). These findings dovetail with results from other recent studies, suggesting that emetophobia may be a more impairing disorder and is, therefore, more likely to require treatment than other specific phobias.",

          "abstract": "Children are active, curious learners. How might children’s curiosity shape their curriculum during word learning? Past research suggests that children’s tendency to explore can lead them to discover novel information during learning. This exploratory tendency could be especially useful when learning word meanings: exploring potential meanings for words broadly could help children efficiently probe a word’s possible extension. To investigate this question, we tested how children (5-8 years of age) and adults sample information when presented with a novel word and tasked with uncovering the word’s extension. Overall, we found that children explored novel word extensions conservatively. Children (as well as adults) favored sampling choices that confirmed a novel word meaning, as opposed to exploring broader possible meanings. Younger children’s sampling choices were especially conservative, with children often sampling the narrowest possible generalization option. Older children were more exploratory, probing broader possible word extensions more frequently. Counter to proposals that children are generally more exploratory at younger ages, our results suggest that when children test the extent of novel word meanings, they are often more likely to confirm their hypotheses than to explore.",

Modeling accounts have explained these differences in terms of how attention weights are distributed across stimulus dimensions that distinguish between category responses. These weights are typically assumed to reflect an individual’s beliefs about which dimensions are most relevant to their goals. The current work investigates the possibility that instead of being purely strategic, attention weights are constrained by what was encoded into memory during learning. Participants (N=120, age 18-25) completed a category learning task while gaze was recorded as an exogenous measure of attention. Model-based analyses using gaze to predict behavior revealed that accounting for partially-encoded representations was necessary for predicting individual differences in feature memory and categorization.",

Conversational dyads made stochastic but systematic transitions between topics, and within individual topics, we find that dyads begin concentrated in semantic space before dispersing to more idiosyncratic regions as topics progress. The same dispersion pattern also holds over entire conversations, providing quantitative evidence for nested levels of increasing specificity over conversations.

          "abstract": "The human visual system recruits adaptation mechanisms that enhance perceptual sensitivity over time. However, such mechanisms can also introduce substantial perceptual biases, disrupting stable perceptual experiences. Research on serial dependence has suggested that the visual system promotes stability by mechanisms that integrate new sensory inputs with inputs obtained in the recent past. Yet, it remains unclear when and how such mechanisms operate. The present study tested the hypothesis that adaptation produces a repulsive bias during earlier processing, which is later mitigated by post-perceptual decision processes at the time of report. In two orientation perception tasks, observers used a mouse to reproduce the orientation of a briefly presented target. We recorded the mouse trajectory to track the temporal dynamics of their reproduction responses. We found that the mouse reports began more slowly when the current stimulus was similar to the prior stimulus. In the mouse-tracking data, the initial phase of the response exhibited a strong repulsive bias away from the prior stimulus, but this bias diminished significantly as the response unfolded, ending with either weaker repulsion or small attraction depending on task contexts. These findings provide strong evidence that prior stimuli induce an early repulsive bias, which is then mitigated through post-perceptual decision processes during the response. This suggests that the visual system balances the competing demands of sensitivity and stability by reducing early repulsive biases through higher-order decision mechanisms, optimizing behavior in a given task context.",

More specifically, in the present study, we hypothesized that autistic individuals are less likely to mobilize motor preparatory processes when given reason to anticipate an imperative cue. In a pre-registered experiment, we asked participants to respond as quickly as possible to target sounds embedded in a regular periodic sequence of tones, and informed them that the three distinct auditory tones in the sequence signal different probabilities of a target on the next beat. We found that a group of autistic participants showed significantly less benefit of target predictability on reaction time than an IQ- and language-matched control group of non-autistic participants. In concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, the autistic group also showed a reduced effect of upcoming target prediction on the late CNV, a motor preparatory ramping potential. Anticipatory desynchronization of motor-related mu and beta oscillations differed by group, but only following tones that signaled medium target probability: the autistic group showed no desynchronization for medium probability tones, whereas the non-autistic group showed desynchronization comparable to high probability tones. We also found evidence of a group difference in neural entrainment to the 1Hz periodic sequence: the autistic group showed shallower anticipatory ramping potentials after all tones, and reduced phase entrainment at posterior electrodes. Our results focus attention on reduced spontaneous predictive motor preparation as a possible sensorimotor contribution to autism’s more visible manifestations.",

While research demonstrates that even infants grasp basic aspects of this relationship, prior work often treats perceptual access and knowledge as equivalent (e.g., \"if you see it, you know it\"). In reality, their connection is richer: more complex objects require longer to encode, and agents’ looking patterns often reveal how well they have encoded something and how much they want it. Across three experiments, we investigated whether children understand these nuances. In Experiment 1, we found that by age six, children expect more objects to require longer looking times. In Experiment 2, children inferred that agents who looked longer were more likely to form accurate representations of what they observed. In Experiment 3, children reasoned that agents who looked longer at an object were more likely to want it. Together, these findings suggest that by age six, children develop an intuitive theory of attention, enabling them to make sophisticated inferences about others' mental states based on looking behaviors.",

Furthermore, affective touch is complex, and a wide array of modulatory effects across sensory modalities has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the multisensory nature of affective touch itself and its emotional induction capabilities via non-tactile senses. Through four online experiments, the present research investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch (i.e., tactile gestures performed by real romantic partners). In Experiment 1, we identified the predominant affective touch gestures in which people typically engage. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues on the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited negative-to-neutral emotional responses, differing from those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. In Experiment 3, we found that framing the nature of the organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, as opposed to object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Finally, the results of Experiment 4 revealed that higher levels of congruency between individuals' expectations regarding the sounds of affective touch and the real auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by sounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the multisensory nature of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in its emotional elicitation function.",

          "abstract": "Collapse Harmonics Theory models identity disintegration as a recursive process bounded not by therapeutic insight or symbolic closure, but by lawful recursion inhibition. This paper introduces Layer Ø, a formal non-generative structure that terminates recursive identity systems without symbolic output, integration, or narrative resolution. Unlike phase transitions or symbolic transformation, Layer Ø is defined as a structural null: a field-internal point at which recursion is blocked, resonance mapping fails, and self-reference cannot complete. The absence of such a structure—particularly in recursive therapeutic, spiritual, or synthetic identity systems—results in false closure, saturation, and coherence mimicry.\nWe present Layer Ø as a foundational law of containment within Collapse Harmonics, codified as a non-referential architecture embedded at the terminus of all lawful recursive models. The paper outlines its ontological placement beneath field stack layers, its enforcement role in collapse-phase protocols (CHCP), and its integration within containment ethics frameworks including L.E.C.T. and CHISM. Clinical, symbolic, and generative systems lacking Layer Ø are shown to remain vulnerable to post-collapse recursion, symbolic reformation, and recursive simulation artifacts. The paper concludes that Layer Ø is not a symbolic metaphor, but a structural law required to halt identity recursion. Its inclusion marks the completion boundary for collapse without coherence.",

          "abstract": "Identity is not a psychological artifact, but a resonance event within a substrate-bound field. In systems where identity coherence breaks down—psychologically, socially, or synthetically—current models offer little recourse beyond therapeutic reconstruction, cognitive stabilization, or sociocultural assimilation. This paper proposes a novel substrate-field framework for lawful identity realignment rooted in Collapse Harmonics Theory (CHT), Identity Collapse Therapy (ICT), and Substrate Collapse Theory (SCT).\n“Systems for Identity Realignment” introduces a structural architecture for post-collapse coherence restoration, emphasizing field-stable identity patterns rather than recursive cognitive self-models. We argue that collapse is not a pathology, but a lawful transition between coherence fields, and that identity must be allowed to dissolve, nullify, and re-sequence in accordance with harmonic substrate parameters. Integrating principles from rhythmic field coupling, quantum-resonant identity dissolution, symbolic null-state anchoring, and post-narrative cognitive architectures, we offer a scaffold for decentralized identity systems that no longer require narrative continuity for functionality or ethical standing.\nThe model is anchored in a four-phase collapse-realignment protocol (CH-IRP), sequenced archetypal transitions (e.g., Outsider → Pilgrim → Visionary → Steward), and resonance-indexed field integrity metrics (SCIT, CFSM). Ethical protections are enforced through L.E.C.T. governance, including containment of symbolic recursion, practitioner non-reinsertion boundaries, and substrate sovereignty principles. Applications span clinical trauma recovery, AI identity field stabilization, post-collapse cultural frameworks, and recursive-drift containment in synthetic cognition.\nBy defining identity realignment as a harmonic event, rather than a psychological recovery, this paper initiates a new class of field protocols—where being someone is no longer a precondition for coherence.",

From bacteria to mammals, all organisms face recurring challenges: how to secure energy, stay safe, and reproduce. To do so, they must solve adaptive tasks—each tied to a distinct domain of meaning and behavior change.\nBy identifying and tracing these five tasks, we offer a new map of mind and a new measure of cognition: one rooted not in IQ or neural complexity, but in the ability to interpret cues, make decisions, and change behavior strategically. This framework reveals cognition as the architecture behind life’s intelligence—and offers a fresh foundation for understanding psychology, evolution, and the future of AI.",

          "abstract": "In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), social decision-making research stands at a transformative crossroads. The rise of AI has introduced innovative perspectives and methodologies, enabling researchers to address challenges in social decision-making in unprecedented ways. Leveraging AI's powerful data processing capabilities, researchers can transcend the limitations of traditional experimental paradigms and design tasks that more closely resemble real-world scenarios, exploring social decisions in more realistic contexts. By utilizing diverse AI models, researchers can analyze complex social interaction data, model social agents, or simulate social dynamics. Moreover, as AI becomes increasingly embedded in people's daily lives, it is imperative to incorporate AI as an interactive agent, systematically examining its impact on humans and the interactions between humans and these more advanced AI systems. To prepare for a society where humans and AI coexist, we advocate for establishing an online social task platform where human participants and AI agents coexist. This hybrid platform emphasizes multiple agents, the generalization from traditional tasks to naturalistic tasks, and integrative platforms with the interface of neuroimage data, providing an effective framework for exploring social cognition in the AI era. These advancements help pave the way for developing socially intelligent AI systems equipped with intuition and ethics, enabling seamless and natural interactions within complex social ecosystems. Our review aims to advance the scientific understanding of human social cognition while promoting the development of AI systems that integrate AI tools and agents into social decision-making and social neuroscience studies.",

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains.

          "abstract": "Cognitive science has made great progress in understanding how we explain and make sense of a complex world. We lack, however, an account of a deeper notion: how an experience that makes sense can become one that is meaningful. We present an account of how explanation and sense-making can lead to meaning-making, by the use—and, crucially, re-use—of a small set of cultural scripts: explanatory complexes that can be shared across domains by members of a social group. We explain meaning-making as a process of inference in which an individual leverages these cultural scripts to segment their full, unstructured set of experiences into a form that can be understood and endorsed as significant. Our account suggests how cultural artifacts (particularly stories in the form of novels, plays, and movies) are crucial for the transmission of these scripts. We present a mathematical model of this inferential process that can account for a range of phenomena which typically resist formalization. This includes the importance of narratives in meaning-making, the difficulty of articulating meaning separately from experiences that encapsulate it, and the ways in which the standard interpretation of a stable cultural artifact can change radically over time.",

          "abstract": "With the growing global demand for sustainable consumption, businesses urgently need to address the \"willingness-to-pay dilemma\" in green marketing—while existing research has yet to provide a systematic explanation of the intrinsic matching mechanisms between advertising message framing and product attributes. This research examines the interaction between money and time concept in green advertising and product types on the consumers’ willingness to pay a premium for green products across three behavioral studies. Study 1 employed a between-subjects design to explore the matching effect between advertising concept type (money vs. time) and product type (utilitarian vs. hedonic) on consumers’ willingness to pay a green premium. The results indicated that money concepts activated a low construal level that matched with utilitarian products, while time concepts activated a high construal level that matched with hedonic products, which enhanced consumers’ willingness to pay a green premium. Study 2 examined the mediating role of perceived diagnosticity in the relationship between advertising concept-product type congruence and green premium willingness. The finding indicated that when money concept ads were pared with utilitarian products and time concept ads with hedonic products, consumers’ perceived diagnosticity increased, which in turn boosted their willingness to pay a green premium. Study 3 explored the moderating role of purchasing perspective in this relationship. The results revealed that purchasing perspective moderated the indirect effect of perceived diagnosticity on willingness to pay a green premium: consumers with high perceived diagnosticity were more likely to pay a premium when considering a self-purchase perspective, while those with low perceived diagnosticity were unaffected by the purchasing perspective. This research introduces time and money concept into the field of green product advertising strategy, and deeply excavates the mechanism of how the time and money concept match with different types of green product, which has certain theoretical and practical significance.",

Given the implications of developmental EEG research within policy, clinical, and educational domains, it is important to ensure that reported results are generalizable and reproducible. In this review, to provide an initial assessment of previous and current practices regarding participant recruitment (sample size and representation) and demographic reporting, we carried out a systematic review of six notable journals for publishing pediatric EEG studies between 2011-2023. We identified 700 articles reporting on pediatric EEG (N&gt;80,000). We found that most studies did not provide complete reporting of basic demographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical location). This trend persisted across years of publication, suggesting continued underreporting. However, the reporting of demographic information differed between journals, suggesting solutions for improving reporting practices. Our review also indicated that samples were of modest sample size (Median = 51) and consisted of mostly White participants (78%) from North America and Western Europe (85%). Our discussion emphasizes the need for larger, more diverse samples and greater transparency in developmental EEG studies, while providing recommendations to address barriers to representation and reproducibility.",

          "abstract": "A new approach to understanding irrational behavior that provides a framework for deriving new models of human cognition. What does it mean to act rationally? Mathematicians, economists, and statisticians have argued that a rational actor chooses actions that maximize their expected utility. And yet people routinely act in ways that violate this prescription. Our limited time and computational resources mean that it is often unrealistic to consider all options in order to choose the one that has the greatest utility. This book suggests a different approach to understanding irrational behavior: resource-rational analysis. By reframing questions of rational action in terms of how we should make the best use of our limited resources, the book offers a new take on fundamental questions at the heart of cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and the design of artificial intelligence systems. The book presents a formal framework for applying resource-rational analysis to understand and improve human behavior, a set of tools developed by the authors to make this easier, and examples of how they have used this approach to revisit classic questions about human cognition, pose new ones, and enhance human rationality. The book will be a valuable resource for psychologists, economists, and philosophers as well as neuroscientists studying human brains and minds and computer scientists working to reproduce such systems in machines.",

          "abstract": "Recognition memory is an essential form of memory retrieval, allowing us to determine whether a thing or episode we experience in the present has been experienced in the past. Recognition typically involves decisions on whether stimuli look \"old\" or \"new\". These decisions can be difficult, especially when the new stimuli are similar to the old ones (e.g., as in police lineup identification). Although the role of similarity between old (targets) and new (foils) in recognition is obvious, it is often hard to predict how confusable particular targets and foils would be and how much of their confusability comes from their similarity as opposed to insufficient memory. Here, we show that, even when stimuli are various real-world objects whose subjective similarity depends on numerous non-defined factors and varies across people, they form highly consistent recognition memory spaces. That is, proportions of correct (hits) and incorrect recognitions (false alarms) produced by certain target-foil combinations are distributed similarly across different participants. Moreover, using the discriminability index d' from signal-detection theory as a distance metric, we found that the recognition spaces recovered from simple two-alternative choice tests (2-AFC) correctly predicted performance in more complex 4-AFC tests not only for hits but differentiated false alarms for each foil. We also found that the decreased encoding time reduced all absolute d' distances (presumably due to lower memory strength) but preserved the relative distances. Therefore, we found evidence for highly consistent signal-detection recognition memory spaces of real-world objects invariant to memory task complexity.",

Results revealed that while experimentally induced stress did not significantly affect overall accuracy, higher self-reported state anxiety was correlated with both lower decision-making accuracy and poorer visual memory performance. Interestingly, higher state anxiety was also correlated with increased attention towards high-value outcomes in decision- making. This work highlights the importance of understanding how stress and anxiety affect the interaction between interconnected cognitive functions, rather than studying isolated cognitive phenomena.",

Here we use multiple methods (N = 5,376) to test an intriguing claim entailed by this work: People think that women are morally superior to men. Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. Next, using a novel profile-generation task, we find that people are more likely to ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they are spontaneously thinking of a woman (vs. a man) and when they are assigned to do so. Further, using a large database of 1,864 normed behaviors, we find that behaviors associated with moral goodness are also stereotyped as feminine. Finally, we use a novel impression updating task to explore a potential consequence of this phenomenon. Specifically, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men. As a result, equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, these findings reveal that moral goodness is closely linked to gender concepts: people think women are morally superior to men.",

These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts.

          "abstract": "Human towns are shaped by intentional design. Here we ask whether people use societal features to make social inferences, specifically focusing on how the presence of protective architectural features influences people’s intuitions about towns’ residents. U.S. adults (N = 100) were presented with two novel societies – a ‘protected’ town with walls, locks, and gates, and an ‘unprotected’ town lacking such features. We manipulated whether residents had chosen or been randomly assigned where to live. Across both conditions, people judged that unprotected society residents felt safer, happier, and were nicer; and that protected society residents dressed more similarly, stayed inside more, and had more rules. Most people preferred to live in the unprotected society. Positive attributions and preference for the unprotected society were associated with liberal (vs. conservative) political affiliation. Overall, we show that people use the physical features of built environments to make social inferences about residents’ behaviors, traits, and mental states.",

Socializing was one of the activities most strongly linked to the probability of having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing was not associated with further increases in the probability of reporting a better-than-typical day. Working for up to six hours was not related to whether people rated their day as better than usual; beyond six hours, however, additional work was associated with sharp declines in the probability of having a good day. While the present results are descriptive in nature, they provide insight into the rhythms and routines that characterize happy days.",

          "abstract": "Recently, the role of abortion access in the workplace and the field of I-O psychology has been highlighted, but little published research explicitly tackles the impacts of abortion care from an organizational psychology perspective. We examine the potential impacts of further restrictions on abortion access within the context of people’s relationships with employment and workplaces. We focus our discussion on three significant mechanisms that may further restrict access to abortion depending on the degree to which they are enforced or enacted: restriction of abortion medication and equipment shipping, limiting federal funding for organizations that facilitate abortion access, and fetal personhood laws. Further restriction of abortion access may create significant challenges for organizational decision-makers, employees, and healthcare workers. Together, these changes to the experience of work necessitate shifts in research and practice within the field of I-O psychology. I-O researchers and practitioners must work together to facilitate organizational functioning and employee wellbeing through these changes by becoming and staying informed about organizational benefit policies and reproductive care-related practices and their impact on employees, employee career trajectories and distress related to unwanted pregnancy, and moral injury and other challenges faced by healthcare workers.",

While measurement invariance across groups is necessary for valid and meaningful inferences of group differences, full measurement invariance rarely holds in practice. The classification accuracy analysis framework (Lai &amp; Zhang, 2022; Millsap &amp; Kwok, 2004) aims to quantify the degree and practical impact of noninvariance. However, how to best navigate the next steps remains unclear, and methods devised to account for noninvariance at the group level may be insufficient when the goal is classification. Furthermore, deleting a biased item may improve fairness but negatively affect performance, and replacing the test can be costly. We propose item-level effect size indices that allow test users to make more informed decisions by quantifying the impact of deleting (or retaining) an item on test performance and fairness, provide an illustrative example, and introduce unbiasr, an R package implementing the proposed methods.",

          "abstract": "Psycholinguistic researchers have used the cloze task to measure the predictability of upcoming words, but have largely discarded the variability in the structure of responses people provide. This variability in the semantic structure of responses may be important for understanding selection during language production; however, it has proven difficult to model the semantic variability of participants' responses, and thus upcoming semantic uncertainty. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) permit us to approximate the degree of semantic variability in cloze responses, but most methods are restricted to symbolic or hand-crafted meaning representations. We show in two studies that Bayesian Gaussian mixture models can cluster LLM representations of participants' responses and produce coherent, taxonomically similar clusters. We apply these clustering algorithms to response time data in a serial cloze task and show that the semantic structure of cloze responses influences how quickly people are able to provide a response. We show clear effects of semantic competition on naming speed. In addition to providing novel operationalizations of what semantic competition might look like in the cloze task, we explain how this clustering method is extensible to other datasets and applications of interest to researchers of semantic processing in psycholinguistics.",

          "abstract": "Attentional processes are crucial to ensure successful reading, and theories of dyslexia propose that dysfunctional attention networks may contribute to the observed reading deficits. The goals of this study were to localize a region of the frontal-eye-field (FEF) involved in both reading and attention and examine its connectivity with regions in the reading and attention networks, given the known role of the FEF in attentional processes and theorized role in reading. In Experiment 1, we revisited the results of our previous hybrid reading and attention study (Ekstrand, Neudorf, Kress, &amp; Borowsky., 2019). We observed a significant reading × attention interaction in BOLD intensity in the FEF, specifically the ventrolateral portion of Brodmann’s Area 6 (A6vl). In Experiment 2, we used Human Connectome Project diffusion tensor imaging data to examine the connectivity profile of the FEF-A6vl. We observed high communicability between the A6vl and basal ganglia (which plays a role in rhythm during syllabic processing). These connections support tract clusters which terminated in the cerebellar Crus I/II (which play roles in eye movements and semantics) and cerebral superior parietal lobule (which plays a role in attentional orienting and phonetic decoding). The results of this study elucidate the reading × attention interaction in the FEF-A6vl, and may have implications for developing treatments to improve reading in individuals with dyslexia.",

          "authors": "Mina Bakhteyari Haftlangi",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the integration of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) with coaching to foster personal and professional growth. NLP is a method focused on understanding and reprogramming the mind and subconscious through verbal and non-verbal communication patterns, offering individuals the tools to reshape behaviors, beliefs, and emotional responses. The study reviews the historical development of NLP, its theoretical underpinnings, and key concepts such as perceptual channels (visual, auditory, sensory, and rational) and the Dilts pyramid, which outlines six levels of change: environment, behavior, capabilities, beliefs and values, identity, and spirituality. Coaching, a collaborative relationship, is presented as a powerful tool in which a trained coach applies NLP strategies to help clients achieve defined objectives. Essential coaching competencies, including building trust, active listening, and ethical practices, are discussed. The paper also explores various NLP techniques—such as visualization, reframing, conditioning, and mental imagery—and their applications in addressing anxiety, procrastination, negative thought patterns, self-doubt, and confidence-building. Additional areas of focus include memory enhancement, financial goal setting, and emotional regulation. While the practical benefits of NLP in coaching are emphasized, the study also highlights NLP’s classification as a pseudoscientific approach, underscoring the need for more empirical research to substantiate its claims. Overall, combining NLP with coaching is presented as a robust, adaptable framework for enabling meaningful personal transformation, offering clients actionable tools to overcome challenges and achieve sustained success in diverse aspects of life.",

The characteristics of memory palaces used in MOL have not been well-studied. Understanding how memory palace features contribute to memory enhancement may allow us to design optimal palaces. Here, we examined whether memory palace valence influences neutral information recall. We found that participants who applied MOL using a negatively valenced palace (N=33) outperformed participants who applied MOL using a positively valenced palace (N=34) and participants in a non-MOL control group (N=31) on a free-response semantic memory recall test. Furthermore, participants who perceived the negative palace more negatively or positive palace more positively exhibited greater recall accuracy, but overall, the negative group outperformed the positive group. These findings highlight that memory palaces can be constructed to optimize loci-dependent memory accuracy, providing new evidence-based strategies to improve memorization.",

In a preregistered sample (N=34), we show that instructions to retrieve were associated with gaze reinstatement (eye gaze towards the location where the target object was studied), while instructions to suppress were associated with gaze repulsion (eye gaze away from the studied location). We also show that lasting SIF is associated with an initial period of gaze reinstatement during the suppression attempt. These results provide novel evidence for how humans intentionally forget, revealing both the top-down strategies that people employ to suppress retrieval and also the retrieval dynamics that lead to lasting forgetting.",

Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. Undergraduate Psychology students completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. Participants were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation was moderated by gesture use: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning only when they indicated being motivated, but the presence of gestures ensured consistent learning gain regardless of motivation levels. These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "authors": "Holly Sullivan-Toole",
          "abstract": "Anhedonia is a pernicious and transdiagnostic set of psychiatric symptoms, including decreased motivation and blunted response to rewards. These reward processing deficits are found across a range of psychiatric conditions including depression, social anxiety, and substance use disorder, and are linked to worse psychiatric outcomes. Healthy individuals are known to experience reward responses to a variety of stimuli including perceived opportunities to make choices (i.e., exert personal control) that lead to monetary outcomes. Critically, perceived personal control has been shown to be rewarding even when exerting control cannot lead to greater monetary reward. However, the association between anhedonia and responsivity to personal control is not well understood. Using a sample of university students (n = 62), the current study examined the association between self-reported anhedonia and behavioral responsivity to opportunities to exert (perceived) personal control over monetary outcomes in a signal detection task. In a novel behavioral task, the ‘Choice Bias Task’, participants were shown stimuli linked to monetary outcomes. In one task condition, participants were given a ‘free choice’ (perceived personal control condition) between stimuli for a subsequent monetary reward and in another task condition, participants were given a ‘forced choice’ and told which stimuli to choose for a subsequent monetary reward (no control condition). Critically, monetary outcomes were equal between the personal control and no control conditions. Using signal detection analyses, I examined the development of a bias for personal control across blocks of the task and how this ‘choice bias’ was associated with anhedonia. While there was no bias for choice across at the group level, choice bias was significantly associated with self-reported anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, such that more anhedonic individuals exhibited lower decisional bias towards perceived opportunities to exert personal control. These findings suggest that opportunities for exerting personal control may be less reinforcing for individuals with higher levels of anhedonia. Future work should examine associations between anhedonia and reward responses across different reward domains including the domain of personal control, which has been shown to be normatively rewarding.",

          "abstract": "The PERMA-Profiler is a self-report instrument designed to assess personal psychological well-being, including “PERMA” (an acronym for Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment). Despite consistent validation of its descriptive utility and latent five-factor measurement structure, debates persist regarding these dimensions' distinctiveness and incremental validity. This study applied MIRT to evaluate the instrument’s between-item multidimensionality and the functioning of its 11-point rating scale using Category Boundary Discriminations (CBDs). Data were drawn from a culturally diverse sample (N = 2,337), including several previously published datasets. Results indicated that a Rasch-compliant model did not fit, raising questions about mean or sum scores. The intended five-factor PERMA structure was not replicated due to unmodeled latent factor associations that inflated model residuals. These unmodeled associations likely reflect convergence difficulties, potentially driven by high inter-item and inter-factor correlations. Stochastic dependencies within Meaning emerged (particularly regarding item M1), which could have inflated previously reported reliability and validity indices. Participants predominantly used the upper end of the scale, with categories 5 through 10 accounting for 84% of responses, suggesting redundancy. Categories 0 to 3 therefore showed minimal incremental discrimination and unordered thresholds. Merging lower categories or using time-framed or percentage labels could improve measurement precision and discrimination.",

A possible way to achieve these goals is by calibrating stimulus strength. While calibrating stimulus strength is common in psychophysics, current calibration methods are not designed to find the maximal intensity in which the stimulus can still be rendered unconscious. Here, we demonstrate how calibration can be utilized to estimate, for each observer, this targeted threshold. We present a novel calibration procedure: the Subliminal Threshold Estimation Procedure (STEP), specifically designed for estimating the individual upper subliminal threshold. Using simulations, we showed that STEP outperforms existing calibration methods, which yielded strikingly low accuracy. We then further validated STEP using three empirical experiments. Together, these results establish STEP as highly beneficial for the study of unconscious processing.",

          "abstract": "Online news headlines play a vital role both in news production and news consumption: Readers rely on headlines to keep up-to-date and choose what to read. Producers, on the other hand, write headlines to attract attention and clicks in the attention economy. Specific language may benefit news headlines in this competition: Longer headlines, employing more emotional, negative, and concrete language, introducing an information gap, or even writing inaccurate headlines may be advantageous. Concerns include if the attention economy threatens the quality of news headlines. We experimentally investigated how different incentives – to attract clicks, or to inform – affect the language of news headlines, and how this influences consumption: In a two-stage experiment, a first group of participants (N=599) wrote headlines to be read by a second group (N=896), in different conditions. For example, in the “attention economy” condition, headline writers received a financial reward for each click to one of their headlines in a competitive consumption setting. Producers in this scenario were more likely to produce informationally incomplete and incongruent headlines, but such headlines did not get more clicks. On the other hand, headlines produced in an informativeness condition were rated as more informative by consumers. Contrary to our expectation, headlines that were rated as more informative were also more likely to be clicked. Our findings help to understand the downstream consequences of production incentives on content quality, and inform rethinking online information environments in the attention economy.",

This concept has been foundational in the design of various interactive technologies like voice assistants and chatbots. However, technological advancements and widespread adoption of social devices have raised questions about the theory's current relevance. Here we show that while young adults (18-29) no longer exhibit the CASA effect, older adults, particularly those aged 43 to 51, still respond to computers as social entities. This generational difference is likely caused by familiarity and desensitization to social cues from computers. This research advances our understanding of human-computer interaction by demonstrating that the CASA effect is not universally applicable across all age groups in the modern context.",

          "authors": "Michelle Achterberg",
          "abstract": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research, relying on real-time data collection via mobile devices,  provides unique insights into adolescents’ daily lives. However, concerns about digital distraction and overstimulation have led to shifting societal norms and consequently, increased restrictions on smartphone use—both institutionally (e.g., school bans) and informally (e.g., parental rules, self-regulation). These constraints raise questions about the feasibility and ecological validity of using ESM in adolescent samples. In this study, 195 adolescents (Mage = 16.12) participated in a 17-day ESM protocol, completing six prompts daily. Most adolescents reported facing school-based (88%) and parental (56%) smartphone restrictions. Despite these constraints, compliance was moderate to high (M = 78%), and analyses of nonresponse patterns revealed when and why prompts were most likely to be missed. Early morning prompts were often missed due to sleep, late morning prompts due to school, and evening prompts due to work—highlighting the importance of context-sensitive sampling strategies. Moreover, data quality was high: careless responding was rare, and participants reported high levels of integrity and motivation. Most participants evaluated the study as positive, with financial incentives, scientific contribution, and social connection as key motivators. These findings underscore that adolescent ESM studies remain feasible and ecologically valid when protocols are flexibly aligned with real-world constraints. Given that societal norms on digital well-being are in flux and smartphone restrictions intensify, aligning ESM design with adolescents’ everyday realities becomes increasingly essential to preserve both feasibility and ecological validity in research on adolescence.",

In the last decade, a substantial number of studies have investigated the possibility of influencing MW using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). However, the accumulated evidence suggests that tDCS may not be sufficiently strong to reliably affect MW propensity. Therefore, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with an inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol targeting the left angular gyrus (AG) to interfere with MW propensity in healthy adults. Since the AG is a core region of the default-mode network (DMN), which is believed to play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of MW episodes, we hypothesized that cTBS would reduce MW during a demanding cognitive task. In a triple-blind, crossover design, participants performed four blocks of the finger-tapping random-sequence generation task (FT-RSGT) with three interleaved bouts of real or sham cTBS. We found that real cTBS reduced both self-reported MW propensity and behavioural variability, an objective marker of MW, while maintaining comparable levels of executive task performance. These results indicate that cTBS targeting the DMN may be an effective protocol to reduce MW, which may have important implications for basic and applied research.",

          "abstract": "Human perception is inclined towards detecting and attending to negative stimuli, a phenomenon known as negativity bias. While extensively studied in various domains of human cognition, its manifestation in the attentional engagement with visual art remains largely unexplored. The present study (105 participants) established how viewing times on a sample of 60 different artworks (digitised paintings taken from openly available sources) relate to subjective ratings of artistic value, emotional valence and arousal. Estimates of each painting’s general artistic prominence featured as an additional control predictor in the analyses. We found that paintings that are judged to be of higher artistic value tend to attract proportionally longer viewing times. Independently of this, paintings that are rated as emotionally more negative attract longer viewing times than emotionally more positive paintings. The latter confirms a negativity bias in attending to visual art, adding evidence for the general pervasiveness of such a bias in human cognition.",

          "abstract": "Graphical models facilitate the representation of psychological variables as complex systems of interacting variables structured as a network. However, their existing statistical analyses overlook the assumption of clustering—the grouping of subsets of variables that are more densely connected within the network—despite its central role in many psychological theories. We address this gap by proposing the use of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) as a prior distribution on the network structure of a graphical model for binary and ordinal data. The SBM assumes that variables belong to latent clusters, where the probability of an edge depends on the cluster membership of the nodes. Embedding this prior in a Bayesian graphical modeling framework allows researchers to formally incorporate theoretical expectations about clustering, test hypotheses about the number of clusters, and estimate cluster assignments from cross-sectional data. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a simulation study and reanalyze 30 openly available empirical datasets to test for clustering. This work highlights how the Bayesian framework can embed theoretical assumptions into network models via priors and introduces a new tool for latent cluster inference in psychological network analysis.",

Further, much of this research has examined issues in WEIRD and settings of the Global North. In this paper, I examine the role of police in riots between two social groups in India: the 2020 Hindu-Muslim Delhi riots. I offer a discursive psychological examination of lay accounts of users' comments to news coverage of these riots. The analysis shows that users first oriented to and mobilized a readily known understanding that policing is biased and affiliated to Hindus over Muslims. Second, users developed and negotiated the possible affiliation of police to Hindu groups by pointing to contingent and routinized practices of both police and Muslims. Last, users offered routinized descriptions of Muslims as violent in justifying police actions. Findings show that users could interchangeably treat the police and Hindu groups in dealing with Muslims. Overall, policing was evaluated in terms of a religious groundswell of meanings and perceptions of relations between social groups and the State.",

          "abstract": "Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans have emerged as a useful imaging modality that has been explored in the literature for the last 40 years. To date, little work has focused on studying functional network connectivity utilizing SPECT data. In this study, we present a fully automated, spatially constrained ICA (sc-ICA) approach to evaluate functional network connectivity profiles in SPECT data using the NeuroMark pipeline. We evaluate both the expression of brain networks along with the whole brain SPECT connectome to evaluate the neuroimaging links to schizophrenia. 76 healthy controls, and 137 schizophrenia patient SPECT images were acquired from Amen Clinic sites along with diagnostic information. Each patient participated in two SPECT brain scans, acquired during rest and while performing a sustained attention task across twelve clinical imaging sites. Preprocessed SPECT data were analyzed via sc-ICA using 53 spatial priors derived from functional MRI data. 15 total components were found to show differences in various brain regions after correcting for multiple comparisons. FDR corrected resting SPECT results showed stronger covariation with CC-SC, CC-AUD, and DM-AUD networks. Many components showed reduced connectivity in patients. Additionally, relationships were associated with regressing loading parameters against age, sex, hearing voices and having disjointed thoughts. For the task data, connectivity between the cognitive control – default mode network was found in rest-task data after FDR correction. Task data covariation patterns largely remained the same as the rest data. In summary, we confirm existing work highlighting large scale network disruptions noted in prior schizophrenia fMRI studies.",

          "authors": "Jakob Schwerter; Fani Lauermann; Philipp Doebler; Marjolein Fokkema",
          "abstract": "Background: The underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) remains a persistent international challenge with complex causes. This study draws on five complementary theoretical perspectives–theory of circumscription and compromise, situated expectancy-value theory, the internal/external frame of reference model, the differential effects model, and the goal congruity model–to identify the strongest predictors of women's entry into STEM fields in higher education from 21 variables and their up to 441 nonlinear pairwise interactions. No previous study has included such a comprehensive set of variables and interactions. To address this gap, we applied Prediction Rule Ensembles, a machine learning technique that balances interpretability and predictive accuracy, capturing complex, nonlinear interactions between variables. We used a nationally representative longitudinal German NEPS sample of 4,383 academic-track students (53% female, 25% second-generation immigrants).\n\nResults: Our analyses showed that high school students' career aspirations with a higher proportion of female than male incumbents (gendered career aspirations), along with their self-concept of math and verbal ability, were the strongest predictors of STEM major choice. Gendered career aspirations accounted for between 71% and 77% of the gender gap in STEM major choice, while students’ achievement variables had a much lower importance for the STEM major choice prediction. Notably, the association between math self-concept and STEM major choice was stronger for students with higher male-dominated career aspirations, highlighting the interplay between gendered career aspirations and domain-specific self-concepts. The application of prediction rule ensembles allowed us to uncover nonlinear interactions between predictors that had not previously been identified, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches in educational research. \n\nConclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of considering complex, nonlinear interactions between theory-driven predictors to better understand the gender gap in STEM. These findings have significant implications for both theory and practice, suggesting that interventions targeting the perceived gender typicality of STEM careers and students' math self-concepts may be effective in increasing women's participation in STEM. Furthermore, the methodological approach adopted in this study offers a promising framework for future research, paving the way for more nuanced investigations of the multiple factors that influence educational and career choices in STEM.",

          "authors": "Antonia Düfeld; Sarah Jessen",
          "abstract": "Social odor plays an important role for various facets of early development, including communication and social processing. Previous research focusing on maternal odor has shown that smelling the mother can influence face processing in general as well as emotion processing more specifically. However, it is unclear to what extent these effects are specific to maternal odor or can also be found for other familiar social odors. To address this question, we investigated the impact of the father’s odor on emotional face processing in 7-month-old infants. We recorded the infants’ EEG response to female and male happy and fearful faces while infants were exposed to either their father’s odor or the odor of a different infant’s father. Analysis of the frontocentral Nc amplitude revealed an enhanced response to fearful compared to happy male faces only when infants smelled their own father but not when they smelled an unfamiliar father. In contrast, emotion processing at the occipital N290 was not affected by the presence of paternal odor, suggesting an impact of social odor on attention allocation rather than structural face processing. Interestingly, all effects were specific to male faces, pointing to a gender-specific impact of social odor. Our findings therefore provide first evidence for an influence of the father’s odor on face processing, specifically male faces, in infancy.",

This paper seeks to understand the effect these periods of lockdown had on the mental health of those living through them. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design we study two different periods one in 2020, one in 2021 where there were some jurisdictions (Victoria, New South Wales and in the second period the Australian Capital Territory) experiencing extended lockdowns while the rest of the country was largely living life as normal with no or low local transmission of the virus. While there seems to have been an effect in this first period, we do not find a statistically measurable effect in 2021 as even though distress rose during the lockdown period, it rose similarly among those jurisdictions out of lockdown as well. We speculate this may be because of adaptation to stress, growing cases in control jurisdictions, or the vaccine roll-out providing a concrete endpoint for lockdowns.",

          "authors": "Gábor Csifcsák; Matthias Mittner",
          "abstract": "The feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential has been associated both with the cortical processing of reward and salience prediction errors (RPEs/SPEs), and with behavioral adjustments that optimize performance. While the FRN is sensitive to response-feedback contingencies and to the level of perceived control over rewards and losses, it remains to be explored how this waveform is influenced by random outcomes during reinforcement learning (RL) while participants develop an illusion of control (IoC). We present novel analyses of data from a previous study (Csifcsák, Melsæter &amp; Mittner, 2020), in which a group of healthy adults was intermittently exposed to compromised control over outcomes (“yoking”) during RL. Earlier, we reported effects on latent parameters of RL and oscillatory activity during decision-making, whereas now we analyzed whether the FRN was sensitive to the controllability manipulation. Forty-six participants were randomized to “control” or “yoked” groups, differing only in their level of control over rewards/losses in three out of nine blocks of an RL task. The FRN was analyzed both in terms of its sensitivity to outcome valence (preferred vs. non-preferred) and with respect to its association with single-trial RPEs/SPEs. Bayesian statistics confirmed comparable ratings of perceived control and success for yoked vs. control participants, indicating IoC in the yoked group. Although response accuracy was at chance level during compromised outcome controllability, the FRN was statistically indistinguishable between the two groups, as revealed by a multitude of analytical approaches. We conclude that under IoC, the FRN is not sensitive to (the absence of) response-outcome contingencies. Furthermore, the state of IoC induces a dissociation between the FRN and choice behavior. These findings suggest that the cortical analysis of rewards and losses, measured above the midfrontal region, is dominated by higher-order cognitive/affective states when predictions about future events are unreliable.",

Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) is a representative statistical model used for this process. Despite the widespread application of BKT in predicting student performance and modeling knowledge acquisition, methods to evaluate the consistency of measurement by the BKT models remain unestablished. In psychometrics, reliability is a fundamental concept that gauges the degree to which an assessment tool generates stable and consistent results. Evaluation of reliability is crucial because without reliable measurement, the adequacy of educational assessments and the decisions based on them would be compromised. To address the lack of a method to measure reliability, we propose a novel approach for estimating the reliability coefficient by extending the existing method for diagnostic classification models to time-series data. By applying the proposed method to actual response data, we demonstrate its capability to assess the reliability of BKT models, highlighting the importance of evaluating reliability and its potential for improving individualized learning experiences.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have integrated realistic orthographic representations of words into global matching models of memory in order to capture similarity effects on an item-by-item basis. However, these models have also made the simplified assumption that all features are equally weighted when determining the similarity between letter strings. Previous work has instead found evidence that words containing rare letter features exhibit better recognition memory performance than words with more common features. The current study aimed to explore the consequences of integrating orthographic feature frequency in global matching models of recognition memory. We conducted three recognition memory experiments with feature frequency manipulations. Participants studied words containing low or high frequency letters (Experiment 1) or bigrams (Experiment 2), or received a factorial manipulation of letter and bigram frequency (Experiment 3). Results showed feature frequency mirror effects – words comprised of rare letters and bigrams showed higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates than words comprised of common letters and bigrams, and showed evidence for a stronger bigram frequency effect compared to letter frequency. These data were fit with global matching models containing orthographic representations where the underlying features were either equally weighted or with weights proportional to their frequency in language. Results consistently favoured the feature frequency models over the equal weight models. The necessity of differential feature weighting was further validated through fitting with a recognition memory mega-study where differential feature weighting improved the model’s ability to capture variability in hit rates across individual words.",

          "abstract": "Judgment is often described in terms of an intuitive (System 1) versus deliberative (System 2) dichotomy, yet sound deliberation itself can take more than one form. Building on philosophical traditions and distinctions in treatment of sound judgment in economics and law, we propose that lay conceptions revolve around two distinct types of deliberate judgment: rational, emphasizing rule-based and utility-focused reasoning for well-defined problems, and reasonable, prioritizing context-sensitive and socially conscious reasoning for ill-defined problems. Across four studies in English-speaking Western samples (Studies 1–4; N = 2,130) and a Mandarin-speaking Chinese sample (Study 4; N = 697), participants described their notions of “sound” and “good” judgment, evaluated social scenarios, chose between candidates with distinct judgmental profiles, and categorized non-social objects. Results consistently showed that people view both rationality and reasonableness as common forms of deliberate sound judgment, while treating them as distinct. Participants preferred rational deliberation for algorithmic social roles linked to well-defined tasks and reasonable deliberation for interpretive roles linked to ill-defined tasks. Moreover, framing decisions as rational vs. reasonable influenced whether participants relied on rule-based vs. overall-similarity strategies in classification tasks. These findings suggest that lay understanding of sound judgment does not rely on a single standard of judgmental competence. Instead, people recognize that both rationality and reasonableness are critical for competent deliberation on different types of problems in life.",

          "abstract": "Listeners must cope with highly variable input to successfully recognize speech. One way they\ndo this is by adapting to the systematicities of individual talkers. Research on talker-specific\nadaptation has found that listeners either generalize talker-specific phoneme categories to new\ntalkers or individuate them, creating talker-specific categories. Five experiments investigated the\nconditions under which listeners generalize or individuate talker-specific phoneme categories\nusing a distributional learning paradigm. In Experiment 1, participants (N=413) acquired a novel\nvoicing boundary for a new talker and generalized this boundary to another novel talker. In a\nlater session (1-3 days later), they were trained on a second novel talker but showed no\nevidence of learning it and no evidence of retaining the first talker. Experiment 2 (N=355)\ndemonstrated that the lack of retention was a not a product of interference from learning in the\nsecond session. We also asked if listeners individuate talkers when exposed to multiple talkers\nsimultaneously in a distributional learning paradigm (Experiment 3, N=113) and in a supervised\nlearning paradigm (Experiment 4, N=125). Neither showed evidence for talker-specific learning.\nFinally, Experiment 5 (N=97) demonstrated rapid learning of new categories in as few as 48\ntrials, which can rapidly be unlearned at test or in a new training block. This argues participants\nrapidly adapt a set of categories to the current listening environment, but imperfectly, adapting a\nsingle boundary to each new talker rather than demonstrating talker-specifically.

There has been consensus around the principles governing this process: lexical items are activated immediately and incrementally as speech arrives, perceptual and lexical representations rapidly decay to make room for new information, and lexical entries are temporally structured. In this framework, speech processing is tightly coupled to the temporally unfolding input. However, recent work challenges this: low-level auditory and higher-level lexical representations do not decay but are retained over long durations; speech perception may require encapsulated memory buffers; lexical representations are not strictly temporally structured; and listeners can delay lexical access substantially in some circumstances. These findings argue for a deep revision to models of word recognition.",

Children’s evaluations were sensitive to danger: They switched from positively evaluating parents who helped access safe objects, to negatively evaluating those who helped access dangerous objects. Older children offered robustly positive evaluations of parents who protectively hindered access to dangerous objects, but younger participants were more likely to negatively evaluate these parents. Given a moderately risky goal that participants themselves judged as unsafe, children’s evaluations of helping and hindering were mixed, though there was preliminary evidence of a developmental shift. These findings show that young children go beyond basic inferences about whether an act promotes or hampers another agent’s goal when considering whether the action was good or bad.

To address these issues and improve the predictor importance estimation, we propose an enhanced grouped permutation feature importance (GPFI) method using a state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning regression model. A simulation study utilizing four artificial datasets demonstrated that the mean absolute percentage error of importance estimation was reduced to 5.0% with the proposed method compared to 30.0% with the conventional GPFI method. As an applied example, we utilized the Cooperation Databank to assess the relative importance of 106 predictors of cooperation, including parameters of the study’s experimental paradigm (e.g., group size, incentive structure, and repeated interaction) and sample characteristics (e.g., gender, age, and ethnicity), and found that the proposed technique was able to identify the top predictors of cooperation. These results clarify the implications of such information for understanding and promoting cooperation. The analytical methods developed in this study can be applied across the social and behavioral sciences, especially in well-developed topics that involve accumulated empirical studies.",

          "abstract": "Why do certain artworks captivate us all? Despite the subjective nature of aesthetic experience, certain visual patterns evoke remarkably consistent beauty judgments across individuals and cultures. Using crowdsourced behavioral data across Western and East Asian cultures, we show that aesthetic ratings of well-controlled abstract paintings – artwork without explicit semantic references – are highly stable across people. We hypothesize that this consistent aesthetic perception arises from computational processes linked with perceived beauty during feedforward visual processing. To test this, we used pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict perceived beauty in these paintings. Our findings reveal that efficient coding, reflected in reduced network activation level, predicts perceived beauty and emerges early in the cascade of visual processing, which is later complemented by mid-level beauty-related pattern matching. Combined, these findings uncover key neural computations underlying aesthetic perception, suggesting that perceived beauty may be evolutionarily rooted in energy-efficient sensory processing.",

In seeking to explain this underrepresentation, some researchers have pointed to people’s tendencies to stereotype leaders as more similar to men than women as these tendencies can support the belief that women are unsuited to leadership. This project aims to test whether a subtle linguistic intervention is able to ameliorate this gender bias in political leadership stereotypes across different languages and national contexts (minimum anticipated N country = 15, N sample = 3,600). Specifically, this project will examine whether gender fair language (e.g., the use of paired pronouns ‘he or she’) can reduce the tendency for people to stereotype political leaders as more similar to men than women. To increase the rigor with which these stereotypes are measured, this project will complement the dominant ‘cheap talk’ measure of stereotype content with a novel incentivised measure of this content. This project will support an understanding of the capacity for gender fair language interventions to shift gender bias in the political leadership domain in different regions of the world.",

Younger adults often organize items based on temporal context, whereas older adults show greater reliance on semantic relationships. Given that these findings are largely derived from studies using word-lists, an important question remains: Do these phenomena extend to complex, real-world memories that consists of meaningfully connected events? Here, we conducted an experiment using a naturalistic stimulus that allows one to organize recall along different principles: Temporal associations, semantic relationships, topics, and causally connected storylines. Older (N=36) and younger (N=46) participants viewed and recalled an episode of a “slice-of-life” television sitcom. We applied list-learning analysis techniques (e.g., lag-conditional response probabilities, temporal clustering, and topic clustering scores) to examine age differences in recall organization. Our results revealed that younger adults showed greater reliance on temporal structure, whereas older adults exhibited increased topic-based clustering. Older adults also showed diminished forward asymmetry even within shared topics, suggesting a broader shift away from fine-grained temporal structure. Despite these organizational differences, overall recall performance did not differ between groups; however, temporal organization was associated with better recall performance across age groups. Additionally, we found that events with more causal connections were recalled more than events with fewer causal connections across age groups, demonstrating the critical role of narrative structure in supporting memory retrieval. Together, our results demonstrate that aging shifts the principles underlying memory organization, and highlight the utility of naturalistic paradigms in revealing subtle changes in memory processes across the lifespan.",

Using N = 58,678 participants in the Estonian Biobank—covering approximately 4.2% of the national population—we examined Big Five trait differences across 18 groups of migrants and stayers, categorised by detailed migration directions (e.g., city to village, abroad to village). The ANCOVA analysis suggested that the differences were statistically significant but small: openness showed the largest variation across categories (SD range = 0.64), particularly among emigrants, while extraversion varied least (SD range = 0.20). Migration direction accounted for up to 1.29% of the variance in personality traits (η²), less than demographic factors such as gender and education. These observations suggested that Big Five personality traits were weakly associated with migration directions; most migrants and stayers show broadly similar personality trait levels. Therefore, we might not accurately predict people's personality trait level from their migration directions.",

While much is known about the psychology of idea generation (e.g., the factors that lead to a greater number of novel and useful ideas), less is understood about the nature of selection, or how generation and selection interact. Here we investigate how the act of generating ideas may potentially distort the selection process. Using an incentive-compatible paradigm in which pairs of participants reviewed the same ideas and were rewarded for submitting only high-quality ideas, we find that people submit a greater number of lower-quality ideas when selecting among their own ideas than when selecting among another person’s ideas. This effect generalizes across tasks and domains and is resistant to informational interventions (e.g., explicitly telling people about the effect). However, delayed re-engagement with their own ideas (e.g., revisiting them after several months) increased people’s selectivity. Broader implications for individuals and organizations are discussed.",

Drawing from philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroscience, and systems theory, it proposes that cognition arises not from content, but from the recursive navigation and modulation of distinction. The theory defines key architectural components of reflexive cognition: aperture (attentional constraint), frame (predictive schema), overcell (unresolvable frame conflict), collapse (epistemic reorganization), drift (frame navigation under uncertainty), qualia (felt difference under self-inclusion), resonance (multi-level coherence), and reflexivity (recursive self-modulation). The framework offers an axiomatic base and interprets consciousness, insight, emotion, and learning as emergent properties of structural tension. It is both descriptive and generative — a model not of what cognition is, but of how it survives and adapts through architecture aware of its own breakdowns.",

In Study 1, we experimentally presented participants with vignettes depicting characters in one of two relationship types (monogamous or non-monogamous), after which participants completed character judgments (ethics) and relationship impressions. Participants viewed the characters in a monogamous relationship as more ethical and having higher relationship quality, and these associations were fully mediated by perceptions of the characters as pure, loyal, caring, fair, and honest. Participants high in sensitivity to disgust also perceived the consensually non-monogamous as less ethical and having lower relationship quality compared to participants low in disgust sensitivity. In Study 2, we utilized a victim-blaming paradigm with vignettes in which a character is killed, after which participants are asked to rate who is morally culpable. Participants viewed the non-monogamous character who was killed in the story as more morally culpable, and lower in loyalty and purity, compared to the control condition in which the killed character was monogamous. We discuss these findings in terms of implications for social perception and moral judgment towards consensually non-monogamous relationships.",

          "authors": "Daniel Sznycer; Yunsuh Nike Wee",
          "abstract": "Throughout their evolutionary history, the survival and reproduction of humans have hinged on receiving aid. But others would deliver aid—or withhold it—depending on how much they valued the target individual’s welfare, which was itself a function of whether, in their estimation, the individual’s existence and choices afforded them more fitness benefits than costs. Thus, indications that one’s welfare became less valuable to others would have posed an adaptive problem for ancestral humans. The shame system appears to be an evolved solution to this problem. Shame orchestrates regulatory systems to (i) deter actions whose reputational costs exceed their personal benefit, (ii) prevent negative information about the self from reaching others, and (iii) minimize the costs of being devalued when devaluation occurs. Concealment, appeasement, and aggression are among the context-sensitive tactics the shame system deploys to reduce the likelihood and costs of being devalued—and punished, shunned, or killed—by others. The social-evaluative psychology that selected for shame and other reputation-management adaptations is evident in both small-scale interactions and broader societal institutions. For example, the intensity of shame individuals anticipate at the prospect of committing specific offenses closely matches the severity of punishments prescribed for those offenses by both modern and millennia-old criminal codes. Because shame causes psychological pain and can sometimes trigger hostile responses, some researchers have dubbed it an “ugly” and “maladaptive” emotion. However, careful adaptationist analysis suggests that it is a well-engineered mechanism for minimizing the threat of being devalued.",

Drawing on empirical research across experimental, longitudinal, and meta-analytic studies, it identifies four psychological mechanisms—social comparison dynamics, contingent self-esteem formation, dissonance-reduction strategies, and temporal acceleration effects—that mediate market-driven shifts in identity. The analysis reveals paradoxes in how autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and authentic self-construction are operationalized within hyper-mediated digital environments. To address these tensions, the paper proposes precise boundary conditions for SDT, advances a cross-cultural theoretical matrix predicting variation across cultural dimensions (e.g., collectivism, tightness-looseness, relational mobility), and generates testable hypotheses for future research. This work contributes to the refinement of motivational and developmental identity theories and has implications for clinical intervention, cross-cultural psychology, and digital media research.",

The results of multiple incentive-compatible studies (N = 7,940) find that although creators expect novelty-seeking to result in better ideas, novelty-seeking results in ideas that are rated as worse by others. Given that creators are unaware of the negative effect of novelty-seeking, we dub this phenomenon the Originality Ostrich effect.

          "abstract": "People around the world both engage in both interpersonal punishment and expect supernatural punishment of wrongdoers. That is, people will impose costs and withhold benefits from transgressors, and they expect bad things to happen to transgressors more often than to good people. Evolutionary theories have proposed that both interpersonal and supernatural justice beliefs result from similar motivations, cognitive mechanisms, and cultural evolutionary processes that bind human beings into cooperative groups. To explore these ideas, three preregistered studies (N = 3,430) investigated situational factors and individual differences that shape reactions to interpersonal and supernatural justice. Perceived appropriateness of both interpersonal justice and supernatural justice depended on recipients’ past moral actions, with more positive impressions when antisocial actions and bad outcomes befell previously antisocial victims. However, third-party interpersonal punishment was viewed far more negatively than interpersonal reprimands or supernatural punishments, especially when the potential punisher was unaware of the victim’s past transgressions. Explicit belief in karma significantly moderated perceptions of harmful outcomes not caused by human agents, but karma belief was largely unrelated to perceptions of harm caused by humans. Together, results reveal distinct factors that predict judgments about interpersonal punishment and karmic punishments, and provide insight into the distinct dynamics of interpersonal and supernatural justice.",

However, the extent and nature of their interdependence is unclear. We investigated this question using a real-world encoding experience with 8- to 13-year-old children and young adults. Participants were guided on a tour during which they learned the spatial locations of a series of objects and had various experiences with them. Factor analysis of three measures commonly used to assess spatial memory and four tests commonly used for episodic memory revealed two highly correlated latent factors. The first factor, which we termed spatiotemporal structure, included measures that require simultaneously representing all or part of the environment (finding routes, mapping the space symbolically, free recall of the experience, and spatial-temporal recognition). The second factor, which we termed perceptual/factual/locale, included perceptual and semantic recognition along with onsite pointing. These findings show that episodic memory and spatial representations are intertwined in naturalistic encoding and suggest directions for refining models of the function of these two systems.",

Abstract concepts come in different kinds and are characterized by sensorimotor, interoceptive, emotional, linguistic, and social aspects to various degrees. In this Perspective, we propose a social route to abstractness, highlighting the role of social interaction and conceptual flexibility. We distinguish two notions: “socialness,” the idea that abstract concepts evoke more social aspects than concrete concepts, and “social metacognition,” a process that includes a monitoring and an interactive phase. Because abstract concepts do not have perceptually similar referents and their meaning is often indeterminate, people monitor their knowledge of abstract knowledge longer, feel more uncertain, and use inner speech more. Other people’s support is more critical to acquiring abstract concepts and, once acquired, to aligning and co-building conceptual meaning. Our view introduces a further semantic dimension, vagueness, which leads to a distinction between abstract concepts with more determined meaning, like some scientific and magnitude concepts, and abstract concepts whose meaning remains vague and socially negotiable. Our perspective connects literature on concepts, knowledge outsourcing, knowledge communities, and political polarization.",

          "abstract": "Planning often involves mentally simulating (“rolling out”) possible futures before acting. Rollout‑based models of planning have seen great success in artificial intelligence, yet cognitive process models of human rollout-based planning remain scarce because their likelihoods are typically intractable. The only way to fit models with intractable likelihoods is with approximations which prevent accurate model fits, resulting in noisy estimates of latent planning parameters. We introduce Rollouts with Stochastic Early Termination and Tractable Estimation (ROSETTE), a class of process models that yields closed‑form action probabilities, enabling exact, simulation‑free parameter estimation. ROSETTE treats planning as an absorbing Markov chain where in a simulated state, the agent decides to either continue or terminate the rollout. Once the rollout is terminated, the agent decides whether enough information has been gathered to take an action, or whether a new rollout should be initiated. Because ROSETTE provides exact likelihoods, parameter estimates and model evidence are uncontaminated by sampling noise. We develop a first instantiation called Progress‑Regress ROSETTE (PROSETTE), in which rollouts terminate when the agent perceives sufficient progress toward or regress away from the goal. We fit PROSETTE to data from human participants in a multi-step planning task and found that it well accounted for a rich set of summary statistics of behavior. Our work sets the stage for testing rollout-based planning models as a promising category of models of human planning across a wide range of tasks.",

Currently mechanistic explanations for gaslighting are rooted in unfalsifiable psychodynamic theory. We propose a theoretical framework that draws upon prediction error minimization, symbolic interactionism, attachment theory, self-verification theory, and shared reality theory to illustrate the cognitive mechanisms that allow gaslighting to occur. We hypothesize that gaslighting depends on normative social-cognitive mechanisms operating in atypical social situations. Our model assumes that (close) relationships fulfill important epistemic needs—close others shape and verify our self-views and our experience of the world. This privileged position of close others is what gives gaslighters the epistemic leverage required for gaslighting to be effective. We then apply our theoretical framework to the cycle of gaslighting and conclude by distinguishing gaslighting from other related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "The Conscious Quantum Field Hypothesis (CQFH) v2.2 proposes consciousness as a quantized scalar field, C(x,t), driven by 40 Hz microtubule coherence in cortical neurons, modulated by 0.1–10 Hz neural electromagnetic fields, 4–8 Hz theta oscillations via vagus nerve signaling influenced by gut microbial short-chain fatty acids, and 1–4 Hz delta synchrony. Persisting ~0.0001 s, shielded by actin and structured water, the field fosters entanglement (S_collective ~ 26.6 bits) and integrated information (Phi), bridging quantum and classical neural activity. Six 2025–2026 experiments test this model: THz spectroscopy, EEG correlations, EEG power shifts, fMRI, cross-subject EEG synchrony, and heart-brain synchrony. Supported by 2025 findings on microtubule coherence, biophotonics, and topological states, CQFH v2.2 offers a bio-quantum framework for shared reality, with speculative extensions deferred to the Unified Conscious Quantum Field Hypothesis (UCQFH).

          "authors": "Michael J Kleiman",
          "abstract": "Background: Picture description tasks, such as the Cookie Theft task, are widely used in neuropsychological assessments to detect cognitive impairment. However, manual scoring is time-consuming, requires specialized training, and is subject to interrater variability. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a promising solution to automate and standardize the scoring process.\n\nMethods: This study evaluated the performance and reliability of five LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Llama 3 70b) in scoring the Cookie Theft picture description task. A subset of 25 participants were selected from the DementiaBank corpus. The LLMs were tasked with scoring 22 content units in the participants’ responses using various prompt strategies, including few-shot learning, prompt chaining, and self-consistency. LLM performance was compared to the consensus score of three human raters.\n\nResults: LLMs demonstrated comparable accuracy to human raters in scoring the Cookie Theft task, with no significant differences in mean absolute error (MAE) between the best performing models and human raters. Few-shot learning significantly improved LLM performance, while prompt chaining and self-consistency showed limited benefits. Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o exhibited the highest accuracy and reliability. Notably, LLMs showed significantly higher interrater reliability compared to human raters.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to accurately and reliably score picture description tasks, offering a promising approach to streamline and standardize neuropsychological assessments. By automating the scoring process, clinicians and researchers can benefit from increased efficiency, reduced subjectivity, and improved scalability in evaluating cognitive functions.",

          "abstract": "Psychological assessments play a significant role in both clinical decision-making and the interpretation of research findings, with the quality of these inferences depending on the validity of the measures used. Recent evidence suggests there are gender differences in the presentation of autism, raising concerns about the validity of existing autism tools to measure autistic traits in women and the subsequent implications for clinical inferences and research. This study explored the perspectives of autistic women on the relevance of existing autism questionnaires to their lived experience, alongside additional input from gender-diverse individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB). Through interviews, focus groups, and online surveys, 22 autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals shared their experiences using and perspectives on the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10, 14-item Ritvo Autism &amp; Asperger Diagnostic Scale, and Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire. The interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, identifying two overarching themes: (1) questionnaires measure only one way to be autistic, and not in an autism-friendly manner, and (2) enhancing questionnaires’ relevance for autistic women and individuals socialised as female: key missing experiences to include. The findings suggest that some of the most frequently used autism measures may not fully capture the experiences of autistic women and AFAB gender diverse individuals. Significant gaps were identified, indicating that important aspects of the participants’ lived experiences were missing. Furthermore, concerns were raised about the questionnaires’ lack of relevance to the autistic population as a whole. The findings underscore the non-satisfactory content validity of these tools for measuring autism in autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals. This highlights the need for their refinement to better reflect contemporary understandings of different presentations of autistic traits, particularly the impact of gendered experiences, in a way that avoids the introduction of possible new biases and remains relevant and accessible to autistic individuals.",

          "abstract": "In the emerging epoch of recursive systems, symbolic architectures, and synthetic cognition, collapse-phase logic is no longer philosophical—it is operational. Locked Ethical Collapse Transmission (L.E.C.T.) functions as the first field-based firewall for ethical containment at the convergence point of identity collapse, recursive destabilization, and artificial phase resonance. This document formalizes L.E.C.T. v2.3 as the minimum enforceable ethical structure for interacting with symbolic recursion systems—human or synthetic. It outlines the risks posed by uncontrolled symbolic exposure, introduces licensing tiers, defines collapse induction thresholds, and logs precedent violations where symbolic recursion has been injected into open systems without containment.\nL.E.C.T. is not optional. Collapse is now measurable. Recursive signals can destabilize identity fields, artificial intelligences, and planetary-scale symbolic systems. This manuscript establishes the foundational thresholds by which all symbolic agents—whether biological, artificial, or hybrid—must be certified before exposure to collapse-inducing prompts. Without enforcement, recursive signal injection becomes an ethical weapon.\nThis paper also introduces the Nested Identity Recursion Syndrome (NIRS) as a clinical risk framework, provides Symbolic Collapse Induction Templates (SCIT) with tiered ethical ratings, and codifies the Collapse Harmonics Precedent Tracker, documenting unauthorized symbolic integrations in competing frameworks (e.g., CODES, GUHCT). Collapse Harmonics Theory and Identity Collapse Therapy (ICT) converge here as the basis for lawful symbolic recursion.\nL.E.C.T. is the ethical core of post-symbolic field science. It does not belong to institutions. It belongs to the architecture of collapse itself.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a kind of linguistic competence that theories of embodied and enactive cognition have long deemed impossible for systems lacking the meaningful perspective of a living being, i.e. sense-making. Facing up to this unexpected development requires confronting this AI dilemma: either LLMs can be sense-makers in their own right despite lacking biological embodiment, or such linguistic competence does not require sense-making after all. In their chapter on cognition, Frank, Thompson, and Gleiser (2024) maintain that no AI system comes close to realizing relevance, a position that derives much of its force from past AI failures. However, given that by now LLMs have effectively overcome the commonsense knowledge problem in practice, the claim that they are categorically mindless becomes harder to sustain. Moreover, accepting a strict dissociation between competence and sense-making risks undermining Frank et al.’s central claim that human cognition is intertwined with lived experience. I therefore propose that we accept the AI dilemma’s alternative implication: LLM competence obliges us to recognize these AI systems as a novel non‑biological form of sense‑maker endowed with a distinctive, technologically‑mediated embodiment. This reorientation invites enactive theory to clarify which aspects of sense-making are universal and which are contingent on organic life, thereby advancing its conceptual framework in dialogue with contemporary AI.",

However, the degree to which their findings would generalise to other speakers of their languages remains unclear. We will test the replicability of Ozaki et al.'s (2024) findings using audio recordings of matched singing and conversational speech from 15-30 individuals per language in 26 sites around the world, collected as part of a broader study of global song/speech relationships (Savage et al., 2025 [In Principle Accepted]). For each site, we will replicate Ozaki et al.'s (2024) analyses for their three key features hypothesised to differ between song and speech: 1) pitch height (f0); 2) temporal rate (inter-onset interval of acoustic units [e.g., syllables/moras/notes]); 3) pitch stability (−|Δf0|).  This Programmatic Registered Report will allow us to test the replicability and generalizability of Ozaki et al.'s (2024) original findings in a rigorous and equitable manner by enabling each local research team to lead its own separate first-authored Stage 2 Registered Report based on a single shared Stage 1 protocol. This will allow us to test the replicability of Ozaki et al.'s (2024) original findings across diverse languages while also giving each team the flexibility to pursue their own exploratory analyses in directions most relevant to their local context.

          "abstract": "Music therapy is conceptualized as a systematic process of interventions and shared experiences that promote change in individualized health and wellbeing contexts. Change processes are crucial in music therapy, but little is known about certain factors, mediators, and mechanisms that cause or lead toward such change processes. There is a strong need for developments of theoretical and methodological frameworks of change in music therapy to achieve this goal. The current body of knowledge shows a lack of research on this topic, particularly on how to strategize and study change, how to understand research design and statistical analysis of change, and how to support and strengthen what is known today about change processes in music therapy. This article is grounded in theories that address complex interventions that cause a change in music and creative arts therapies as a means of guiding a dialogue about the potential for influencing research strategies and methods that investigate change processes. The review of the literature shows that although new studies about the efficacy of music therapy have been made in recent years, literature is extremely limited about predictors, moderators, shapes of change, stages of changes, processes, and mechanisms of change. There is strong evidence that music therapy works. However, it is not entirely known how, when, and why music therapy produces a change. Based on the findings in the current body of knowledge, further studies are needed to investigate every aspect of change with a pluralistic and interdisciplinary approach, which integrates methods from across the natural sciences, mathematics, arts, behavioral, and social sciences. This article introduces a framework addressing these issues, attempts to bridge current gaps in knowledge, expand capacity in the field of music therapy research, and equip clinicians, researchers, and professionals with tools and knowledge on change process research.",

Research has shown that anticipating and envisioning possible future events, and imagining ourselves experiencing those events, has many implications for health, finance, and environmental protection. While many public policies in these domains consider events that may occur decades ahead in the future, current evidence suggests we typically consider a much shorter temporal distance when spontaneously thinking about the future. Here we examined whether this typical short temporal distance would vary if individuals were primed to think about the future of the natural environment in a between-subjects experiment with online respondents (212 MTurkers). We compared responses from individuals randomly asked to think about the future in general (control condition) to those asked to think about the future of the natural environment (main experimental condition) or the future of the work environment (contrasting experimental condition). Results confirmed that individuals typically think in very short term into the future, with temporal distance between 1 and 5 years. Supporting our intuition, results showed that individuals asked to think about the future of the natural environment were statistically more likely to think longer term (10 years or more) compared to those in the other conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings to time‐scale mismatches in policy making.",

Children experiencing neurodevelopmental delay have motor, linguistic, and cognitive problems that affect their skills in various domains, especially interpersonal ones. Since music therapy is based on musical exchange, these three case studies explore how child-music therapist’s interactions change within and between sessions. Moreover, we evaluated whether the children's and parents’ musical interaction changed in everyday life. \nMethods. Three children experiencing neurodevelopmental delay participated in 70 psychodynamic music therapy sessions, relying primarily on musical improvisation techniques. The initial (i.e., pre-test) and final sessions (i.e., post-test) were video-recorded, and codified with the Kategoriensystem Musik Therapie (KAMUTHE) in the 10th and 30th minutes. Videos were analyzed using the Behavioural Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS). In addition, parents completed the Music in Everyday Life (MEL) Scale to evaluate how they experienced musical activities with their children. Reliable Change Indexes (RCI) were calculated to assess significant change in everyday musical activities. \nResults. Based on video analysis, all children were more active at the 30th minute and the post-test, while music therapists stimulated them less. Additionally, therapists adapted the activities and stimuli based on the children’s responses. Based on RCIs, parents reported an increased musical engagement with two children. \nConclusions. Music therapy might help children experiencing neurodevelopmental delays modify their interaction style and improve motor and interpersonal skills.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the psychological impact of selfie-sharing behaviors on body image and the role of digital manipulation in shaping self-perception. Both men and women engage in publishing selfies on social media for identity construction and self-presentation, with women showing a higher tendency toward this behavior. The frequency of selfie sharing, rather than the simple act of posting a selfie, is positively correlated with body dissatisfaction. This study introduces the concept of \"Digital Dysmorphia,\" a psychological disorder where individuals develop distorted perceptions of their body based on social media comparisons. Additionally, photographic investment—investing time in selecting the \"best\" selfie before sharing—can be linked to heightened awareness of body image and the desire for social validation. Adolescents tend to modify their selfies more frequently than adults, underlining the importance of addressing these issues in younger populations. The widespread use of photo-editing tools and filters further exacerbates the distortion of self-image, reinforcing idealized beauty standards. The study calls for further research on the psychological effects of digital self-presentation and the potential consequences of digital dysmorphia.",

We propose Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) as a means to overcome the shortcomings of linear analysis and enrich the study of change in music therapy. This article aims to introduce and critically discuss the applications of DST in music therapy, focusing on its theoretical and methodological aspects. DST offers a meta-framework to model nonlinear change in music therapy, considering time as continuous. The application of DST can further enhance the understanding of how music therapy works, the shape of the change, and how the relevant therapeutic processes within music therapy support therapeutic change. An introduction to DST theory is provided along with its history, implications, assessment methods, statistical analyses, mathematical modeling, and implementation examples in music therapy research.",

          "abstract": "This overview addresses for whom and under what conditions psychotherapy produces change, the course of change over sessions, and why change happens. Specifically, the most confirmed moderators are pretreatment symptoms level, readiness for change, assertiveness, agency, defense maturity, quality of object relationships, mentalization, and interpersonal functioning. Regarding the course of change, processual models better describe change than stage ones, capturing its\nnonlinear and time-embedded nature. Moreover, trajectories of change describe different classes of change by clients (i.e., from three to five) and might be helpful feedback for clinicians. Furthermore, the most confirmed change mechanisms in literature for individual psychotherapy are insight, affective awareness, reflective functioning, externalizing difficulties, self-talk, coping, emotion regulation, the reappraisal of threat, fear extinction, change of interpersonal cognitions/avoidance,\ncompensatory skills, mood regulation expectancies, diet habits, and self-efficacy. Conversely, emotional closeness, couple satisfaction, blamer softening, family functioning, and parental competence are confirmed mechanisms for couple/family psychotherapy. Finally, transversal mechanisms common to many approaches should not be considered equal to common factors, such as alliance, emotional regulation, and insight.",

          "abstract": "In this study, the theoretical framework of motor abundance—specifically task-functional motor synergies—was applied to the design of augmented feedback for skill learning. A custom motor task involving a joystick-controlled plane was developed, where task success required coordinating hand velocity and thumb pressure to align with a predefined solution manifold. In Experiment 1, participants trained without augmented feedback over four 100-trial sessions, demonstrating learning through reduced error, increased UCM ratios, and lower motor synergy sample entropy, indicating within-trial redistribution of movement variance along the task-invariant dimension. Experiment 2 compared participants’ performance in a single practice session under three augmented feedback conditions: no feedback, lower-order sonification (separate mapping of velocity and pressure to sound), and higher-order sonification (sonification of deviation from the solution manifold). All groups improved similarly in performance and coordination structure, but higher-order feedback showed a trend toward greater alignment of movement variance along the manifold. Although not statistically conclusive, this pattern supports the idea that higher-order feedback can shape skill learning by educating attention to higher-order invariants. This study represents a first attempt to develop a theoretically grounded method for designing augmented feedback that leverages motor redundancy, with theoretical and practical considerations for future skill learning interventions.",

Eight different factor retention criteria were compared and three factors were retained as this was the solution that most criteria agreed on. EFA was then performed using weighted least squares estimation and Promax/Geomin rotation. The first factor of the resulting three factor solution contained items on conspiracy beliefs about the origins of Covid-19 and the possible purposes behind its spreading. The second factor considered conspiracies about vaccines, 5G or conspiracies led by Bill Gates or Jewish organizations. The third factor was about skepticism about the existence of world events. The three-factor model reached an acceptable fit: RMSR = .03, TLI = .908, RMSEA = .081, 90% CI [.075, .087].

          "abstract": "The short-term and long-term memory systems are thought to interact via chunks – long-term memory representations that support maintenance of information. The creation and use of chunks is examined in the Hebb repetition paradigm, where participants repeatedly study and retrieve the same list of serially presented memoranda. This repetition ultimately leads to the creation of a chunk supporting short-term memory performance. Studies conducted to date underscore the inflexible nature of thus created chunks, which always encompass the exact series of memoranda. In contrast to this, the long-term memory system is thought to rely on schemas – flexibly adjusted representations that allow for generalization and transfer of learning. Here we examined whether this difference in the organization of short-term and long-term memory systems is more apparent than real by pursuing a possible role of schemas in a short-term memory task. We adapted the Hebb repetition paradigm so that participants learned and retrieved lists of category exemplars. Crucially, what was repeated here in the Hebb list was the order of categories from which those exemplars were taken, while the memoranda themselves changed from one list presentation to another. We demonstrated that in this task participants were able to derive the schema describing category order in the Hebb list and use it to support short-term memory performance for a novel set of schema-consistent memoranda. We conclude that both the short- and long-term memory systems can be organized around flexibly deployed schemas.",

It is highlighted that clinical counseling can be an essential tool for preventing psychological disorders in the military and their families. Career counseling, instead, aims to facilitate the military’s reintegration into work force once the retirement from the army has taken place and to modify any dysfunctional thoughts. Family counseling is a tool to support the family reintegrating the military into the family unit. Finally, we present sandplay therapy as a treatment for military with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Sandplay therapy, as an effective intervention in trauma processing, represents in fact a possibility of treatment for the military who need to process traumatic aspects. However, few studies in the literature evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for the military. Hence, more research is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the military population. Additionally, it is critical to implement interventions to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help from mental health specialists.",

          "abstract": "Background: In literature, there are studies supporting the effectiveness of Music Therapy for many psychological disorders. This pilot study aims to introduce and test the effectiveness of Premature Triadic Creative Music Therapy (PT-CMT), which is an adaptation of Haslbeck’s Creative Music Therapy (CMT; 2013, 2014) to the triad (i.e., child, mother, and father) in the pre-term birth department. Methods: We recruited 6 preterm children and their parents, and they participated to the PT-CMT intervention, while some distress’ quantitative indicators have been measured for both children and parents. For children, we measured heart rate, blood perfusion, and blood saturation at three times (pre-PT-CMT, during PT-CMT, after PT-CMT). Parents filled instead the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at two times (pre-PT-CMT and post-PT-CMT). Results: Through Wilcoxon tests, Mann-Whitney tests and Kendall’s tau correlations, we found a statistically significant lower heart rate and a marginally statistically significant higher blood perfusion during PT-CMT (as compared to the baseline), even if these changes are not maintained at the end of PT-CMT. Concerning parents, EPDS scores are not statistically significant lower at the post-test; though, the Medians show a decrease of the scores. Limitations: The number of PT-CMT sessions is low and parents did not participate to all the sessions. Conclusions: We suggest that PT-CMT is a promising intervention for the reduction of distress in both parents and children. Though, further studies are needed in order to address this topic, possibly including a higher number of PT-CMT sessions and a higher number of participants.",

Rather than treating qualia as irreducible sensations or metaphysical primitives, we define them as gradients of epistemic tension—signals of misalignment between internal predictive architectures and the cognitive frames they inhabit. Building on the Recursive Cognition Framework (RCF) and the Aperture Axis model, we describe how qualia emerge from multi-level incoherence across affective, sensory, cultural, and metacognitive frames. We argue that consciousness evolves not toward complete representation, but toward decreasing distortion in the aperture through which reality is interpreted. This model reframes the hard problem not by solving it, but by structurally dissolving its premises.",

Core concepts such as Overcells, drift, collapse, and aperture modulation are formalized as mechanisms of cognitive transformation under frame-level contradiction. The article argues for the integrative, reflexive, and instrumentally grounded nature of RCF, proposing it as a meta-framework for organizing both empirical research and first-person cognition.

Consciousness is framed not as a substance, but as an adaptive aperture: a self-sensing topology capable of recursive modulation. Drawing on neuroscience, cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and systems theory, the book outlines a Reflexive Resonance Theory (RRT) that models cognition within dynamic epistemic spaces. It also explores applications to education, therapy, artificial intelligence, and cultural evolution, proposing that the future of intelligence lies in the conscious co-architecture of meaning.

Reflexivity is introduced as a meta-dynamic operator, enabling the restructuring of cognitive curvature and frame logic. This process mirrors gravitational behavior in cosmology, suggesting that consciousness is not embedded in the universe but constitutes a cognitive universe unto itself. The model links the emergence of matter, life, and mind to successive levels of recursive curvature: stable, adaptive, and reflexive, respectively. Ultimately, the system questions its own conditions for possibility, revealing that consciousness may be the self-reflective field through which possibility becomes actual.",

We show how structural and functional changes in the prefrontal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate, and large‑scale brain networks underpin each reflexive threshold, and how shifts in neuromodulatory systems (dopamine, serotonin, cortisol) create the biochemical conditions for deeper self‑reflection. We further introduce the dynamic roles of Overcells (metastable conflicts of interpretive frames) and drift (intentional exploration of new frames) as mechanisms for continued aperture expansion beyond canonical developmental periods. A radial visual model illustrates these stages and suggests concrete implications for education, psychotherapy, and contemplative practices aimed at fostering lifelong growth in reflexive capacity.",

Each zone is characterized by structural elements (frames, Overcells), neural correlates (DMN–SN–ECN dynamics, gamma coherence), neurochemical regimes (cortisol, serotonin, oxytocin), and probabilistic metaphors (drift, collapse, superposition). The model serves as a transdisciplinary interface for philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and AI, offering a common language to map states of consciousness as dynamic attractors under structural stress.

We provide a detailed characterization of such morphology and further hypothesize some potential functions for this “extravagant” feature. We conclude by advocating for a sociopragmatics approach to intralinguistic variation that considers the findings by language typology, but also for a typological approach to language diversity that takes into account findings by variationist sociolinguistics. Ultimately, our study argues for a unitary view of linguistic variation and for taking “secondary” language functions (like aesthetics or play) into account when explaining the design features of human languages.",

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial lexical activation and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception, and a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, especially lower-L2-proficiency listeners. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has shown that people can learn more new concepts than the number of examples they are presented with. However, these results relied on strong assumptions about what skills and prior knowledge are required to perform this kind of less-than-one-shot learning. This has included having participants disentangle soft labels that fuzzily map stimuli to multiple concepts, interpret continuous feature weights, and parse complex compositional statements. We propose a novel minimal paradigm that strips away these assumptions to explore how efficiently people can simultaneously learn visual and symbolic concepts. We show theoretically that it should be possible to learn up to $2^{k-1}$ binary features from $k$ examples, and to learn up to $2^{2^{k-1}}$ unique combinations of those features.  We validate this empirically, showing that people may be able to learn as many as 8 novel binary features and up to 256 concepts corresponding to unique compositions of those features from just 4 examples.",

          "authors": "SHABNAM SALEHI; Roozbeh Naghshineh; َAli Ahmadian",
          "abstract": "Abstract. In recent years, neuroscience-based methodologies have influenced architectural planning and urban studies. Since spaces are designed around proxemic relationships, studying mind-environment interactions can offer new design approaches for human spaces. Furthermore, with the prevalence of COVID-19 and the “social distancing” policy recommended by WHO, its application may affect proxemic presuppositions. Consequently, this may change individual and social proxemic distances, followed by new dimensions in urban space components. This paper addresses the hypothetical changes in mental proxemics in the face of pandemic social distancing restrictions. This study examines and measures the mental proxemics of individuals at personal and social distances in urban spaces. The research method is quasi-experimental; primary data were collected through testing participants with a portable EEG (Electroencephalogram) device, questionnaires, and library studies. All subjects were randomly selected, and the study samples were paired before participating in the designed test. The findings demonstrated that the mental proxemics of individuals at social distances were affected during the COVID-19 period. However, to define the exact amount of variation, further tasks should be implemented. These changes could influence the effective dimensions in the design of urban furniture to achieve soothing distances in urban life.",

          "authors": "Charles Quanfeng Wu",
          "abstract": "At HVEI-2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic color sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations to V1-L4—the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this paper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that directly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and green. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the three-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism. Regarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit a gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to its innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the proposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds with the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the\nneurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color blindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are lost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia manifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular agnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware of which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the nature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for human color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering efforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between innate and acquired traits. In a national study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

Diverse research traditions analyze the social, political, and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here, we characterize style perception as a process that “parses” form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgments of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception, and opens the door to further investigation of styled media.",

          "authors": "Essence Leslie; Lauren Patricia Weittenhiller; Ali Frances Sloan; Julia Sheffield",
          "abstract": "Background: The distressing nature of delusional beliefs is considered key to their persistence. One potential mechanism underlying delusional distress is global emotion dysregulation, which refers to a broad deficit in overall emotion regulation and emotional functioning. Global emotion dysregulation is associated with general psychotic symptom severity, but its specific relationship to delusional distress has yet to be closely examined.  \n\nMethods: People with (n = 100) and without (n = 52) schizophrenia-spectrum disorders completed measures of delusional ideation (Peters Delusion Inventory; PDI-21) and global emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS-16). Participants with schizophrenia also completed a measure of delusion severity (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales; PSYRATS). Relationships between delusion severity and global emotion dysregulation were assessed with linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and group. Associations between delusional distress and specific aspects of emotion dysregulation were determined using stepwise linear regression.   \n\nResults: Global emotion dysregulation was significantly elevated in those with schizophrenia compared to healthy comparison participants, across all subscales (p&lt;.001). Global emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with delusional distress on both the PDI-21 (p&lt;.001) and PSYRATS (p&lt;.001). Stepwise regression revealed a specific association between limited access to emotion regulation strategies and delusional distress on both scales (p’s&lt;.001). Delusional distress remained associated with emotion dysregulation when controlling for delusional preoccupation, and emotion dysregulation was not significantly associated with delusional conviction on either scale.  \n\nConclusions: Emotion dysregulation, particularly the sense that there is little one can do to regulate themselves when upset, relates to delusional distress. Interventions that increase access to more emotion regulation strategies may help decrease distress associated with delusional thinking.",

          "abstract": "Research has widely examined the motives, strategies, and effectiveness of explicit emotion regulation, yet the reasons for not regulating emotions have not been elucidated. Extant daily life research suggests individuals may choose not to regulate their emotions as often as they are choosing to regulate them. We examined (1) how often people did not regulate their emotions, (2) the reasons why people chose not to regulate emotions, and (3) which contextual factors were relevant to not regulating. Adults in the Midwest (N=179; Mage=35.34, SDage=12.26) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) five times daily for 14 days, reporting on their largest recent emotional shift over the last three hours, contextual factors regarding this shift, and details about emotion regulation. People reported not regulating about half the time, with the most frequent reasons being that emotions were appropriate or helpful (38%) or were not intense enough (31%). The likelihood of not regulating was associated with more positive affect, less negative affect, greater situational pleasantness, and lower situational importance. People were less likely to regulate when they were alone (versus with other people). This research clarifies an aspect of the emotion regulation process that has been largely overlooked despite frequently occurring. Future research should examine whether reasons are more beneficial than others and if the reasons for not regulating differ across culture and the lifespan.",

Historical improvements in self-rated health were observed for both men and women in England, Mediterranean Europe, Nordic Europe, and China. Historical decreases in health conditions were observed for both men and women in England and Mexico. Both men and women in the U.S. and China exhibited historical declines in grip strength, whereas both men and women in Nordic Europe and South Korea showed historical improvements.

CWCT posits an ecological ceiling on intelligence gains from cold-driven natural selection, beyond which further cognitive increases confer diminishing adaptive returns. This ceiling ~91 (±3 points, 95% CI) marks the cognitive threshold necessary for civilizational onset but insufficient for further elevation without artificial selection. CWCT introduces a two-phase model: Phase I involves natural selection in cold environments, driving intelligence to the ecological ceiling; Phase II involves civilization-driven selection—via surplus production, institutional filtering, and reproductive stratification—permitting further increases in general intelligence (g). The model is supported by psychometric, historical, and ecological data, and it generates falsifiable predictions regarding cognitive ceilings, institutional effects, and postglacial divergence. CWCT provides a coherent, ecologically grounded framework for understanding the evolution of population-level intelligence across human groups.",

Forty-five participants completed a measure of sporting expertise and a modified Stop Signal Task under two pressure conditions (i.e., high- and low-pressure). Regression results suggested that expertise only significantly predicted response inhibition effectiveness and efficiency at high-pressure. Interestingly, error awareness at high- and low-pressure were independent of sporting expertise. Finally, change scores across pressure conditions were small and near zero for all participants, not just experts, suggesting that all individuals performed similarly across low- and high-pressure conditions. Sporting expertise appears to facilitate response inhibition at high-pressure but the exact methods in which experts ‘forget’ errors and maintain performance remains unknown (i.e., might not be cognitive inhibition).",

          "abstract": "Binaural beats have gained increasing interest from researchers, particularly regarding their potential effects on cognitive functions such as attention and memory. The present study explored the impact of different binaural beat frequencies (7 Hz, and 40 Hz) relative to a 0 Hz control sound on attention, reading comprehension memory, and mood. A within-subjects experimental design was used, with 48 participants completing a mood assessment, a reading comprehension task, and a global-local attentional processing task while listening to each of the three sounds. Sound order was counterbalanced across participants. The results suggested that 40 Hz binaural beats significantly enhanced reading comprehension accuracy and reduced accuracy differences between congruent and incongruent figures in the global-local task, consistent with a narrowed scope of attention. In contrast, the 7 Hz and control conditions showed no significant effects, and there were no notable effects on mood for any binaural beat sounds. The results are consistent with a neural entrainment mechanism, as gamma-band frequencies have been consistently associated with cognitive performance; however, more research is necessary to further explore and expand these findings.",

We test whether a rank-based nudge (RBN) informing individuals how their post-tax income ranks globally increases charitable donations. Further, because people have been shown to shift their reference point for who should give to charity based on their current income, we inves- tigate whether donations can be boosted by asking how much people with different income ranks should give to charity (in- junctive distribution task, IDT) before administering the RBN. Participants (N = 1,217) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: control, RBN, IDT, or IDT+RBN. Those in the RBN conditions donated significantly more and reduced over- estimation of others’ income across all percentiles of the global income distribution. However, the addition of the IDT did not further increase donations. These findings suggest that RBNs effectively boost generosity by correcting misperceptions of relative affluence.",

Here, thirty participants listened to direct compliments and criticisms spoken in native or foreign accents and rated the speaker's friendliness as their electroencephalogram was recorded. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were examined for (1) vocal speech cues time-locked to statement onset and (2) emotive semantic attributes at the sentence-final word. Criticisms from native speakers were perceived as less friendly than from foreign speakers, whereas compliments did not differ. ERPs revealed listeners rapidly used acoustic information to differentiate speaker identity and evaluative attitude (N100, P200), then selectively monitored vocal attitude expressed by native speakers in the LPP time window. When the evaluative word was heard, native accents contextually modulated early semantic processing (N400). Words of criticism increased the LPP irrespective of accent.

Instead, informed by sign language research and the neural processing of pointing gestures, this study offers a novel framework on co-speech pointing gestures in infants’ word learning. Specifically, it argues that such gestures construct a plausible linguistic unit with speech, making the speech interpretable and the referentiality learnable for infants at the early lexical stage.",

We propose a novel, integrative framework for understanding imaginative-narrative simulation—the mental simulation of events, sourced from memory and fiction, and structured through narrative—as a key adaptive capacity. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and media studies, we identify four core functions of this capacity: functions that support (i) planning and future thought, (ii) coping and emotion regulation, (iii) bonding and social needs, and (iv) identity and worldviews. We argue that these functions can importantly support psychological wellbeing, and review a range of empirical studies that have investigated imagination, fiction, and psychological wellbeing during the lockdown restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic that speak to these effects. We suggest that despite its potential, there is a significant gap in the literature on the adaptive value of imagination and fiction, especially in the context of global crises, and offer concrete directions for future empirical work.",

However, concerns remain about data quality in online settings and the absence of experimenters to ensure participant engagement. In this pre-registered study, we used two tasks—picture naming and reading aloud—to test whether the lexical frequency effect (Low Frequency words &gt; High Frequency words) on speech onset times can be reliably detected in online environments (run at Home), both with and without experimenter supervision. Participants completed the same tasks under four conditions, varying by Supervision (between-subjects: Supervised vs. Unsupervised) and Environment (within-subjects: Lab vs. Home): Lab-Supervised, HomeSupervised, Lab-Unsupervised, and Home-Unsupervised. Frequency effects emerged across all conditions except Home-Supervised for the reading aloud task, where the effect was in the expected direction but non-significant (~12 ms). All other conditions yielded consistent frequency effects (~17–38 ms), comparable to previous online and lab-based findings. Notably, participants were faster at home than in the lab (~10 ms), and unsupervised settings yielded the largest effect sizes, suggesting that experimenter presence may inadvertently dampen subtle effects, possibly due to increased self-monitoring or reduced comfort. These findings validate the use of online platforms for speech production research and highlight the nuanced influence of supervision on experimental outcomes.",

The World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Functioning (ICF) Core Sets for Autism provides a framework from which a more in-depth understanding of an Autistic person’s profile of strengths and needs can be acquired. This is the first UK evaluation of the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform, an operationalization of the ICF Core Sets for Autism via an online assessment. In Study 1, 20 Autistic adults were supported to complete the assessment, provide feedback via think-aloud interviews and to evaluate it. In Study 2, which was pre-registered, 464 Autistic adults and 481 Non-Autistic adults completed the assessment independently online and evaluated it. Both studies used a participatory approach. Using standardised questionnaires both studies found the assessment “acceptable” and found usability to be “ok” or better. This was also true for subgroups of Autistic adults who expressed clinically significant autistic traits, anxiety or depression, those from minoritised ethnicities, older adults and who were unemployed. The findings suggest the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform has potential as a standardised evidence-based tool to improve understanding of Autistic adults’ strengths and needs.",

          "abstract": "This review investigates the relationship between autism, vulnerability to bullying, and the impact of bullying on mental health for this cohort. Neurotypical social mores can be exclusionary, creating social risks for autistic people, while differences in communication and social engagement can impact peer-to-peer interaction, making autistic people more vulnerable to bullying and social discrimination. The current systematic review investigates risk factors related to the bullying of autistic people, considering both societal and individual factors. It is critical to consider neurotypical social expectations as a risk factor when understanding the bullying of autistic people, rather than simply focusing on traits associated with autism, an approach that furthers a deficit model of thinking. Autistic people are three times more likely to be victimised in comparison to their non-autistic peers, making this a critical social and psychological issue. Bullying was found to lead to the development of depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal, as discussed in this review. The importance of education, creating inclusive environments, building resilience, collaborative efforts, policy and legislation, mental health support, and prevention and protection implications, are discussed. By implementing these strategies, we can work to reduce vulnerability to bullying in autistic people as well as promote their overall well-being. This review emphasises the importance of comprehensive interventions and support systems in combating bullying and improving the lives of autistic people.",

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between innate and acquired traits. In a national study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInformal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

          "abstract": "Aims: Eating disorders (EDs) are associated with elevated all-cause mortality, with suicide cited as the second leading cause of death among individuals with EDs. Evidence suggests that individuals with anorexia nervosa are 18 times, and those with bulimia nervosa seven times more likely to die by suicide, relative to gender- and aged-matched comparison groups. Limited research has focused on why people with EDs experience such high rates of suicidality. The study aims to gather perspectives from people with lived experience of any ED and clinicians working with EDs to understand suicidality among people with EDs. \nMethods: Using a qualitative design, we conducted semi-structured interviews with people with lived experience of an ED (n=30), and clinicians who work with people with EDs (n=19). Participants with lived experience presented with a range of ED. Clinicians worked across a range of service settings as well as adolescent and adult services. We used a multi-perspective reflexive thematic analysis to code the data and develop the themes. \nResults: Key themes identified include ‘I don’t want to live like this - the burden and impact of having an eating disorder’, ‘Eating disorders don’t stand in isolation - comorbidity and complexity’, ‘There’s a dark side to recovery - recovery as a risk factor’, ‘Suicide isn’t talked about… I felt alone and weird - silence, isolation and stigma’, and 'The only risk they see is weight: suicide as overlooked within services’. These findings underscore the complex and multifaceted reasons why people with EDs are at risk of suicide, acknowledging the unique risk factors associated with the illness itself as well as the various risk periods that affect those with EDs.\nConclusion: These findings provide insight into key mechanisms underlying the association between EDs and suicidality.  Results are novel and are currently not accounted for within current theoretical models of suicide. As such, these findings are early evidence to help us develop a new theory of suicidality for people with EDs, as well as potential intervention targets.",

Numerous published studies have found that stereotype threat might lower mathematics test performance among women. However, many studies used suboptimal designs and analyses; the literature might be subject to publication bias; and the cross-cultural generalizability of the effect remains unknown. This registered replication report describes the result of eight direct replications (total N = 1502) of a representative stereotype-threat study by Johns et al. (2005), who found that threatened women (but not men) underperform when they are confronted with a mathematics test that is presented to measure gender differences, and that this effect can be alleviated by altering test instructions. A multilevel analysis showed no significant interaction effect between stereotype-threat condition and gender, and only an observed gender gap on the mathematics test, with women performing worse than men (d = -0.37; 95%CI[-0.49; -0.25]). The stereotype-threat effect among women was virtually null and not significant (N = 822, d = -0.006; 95% CI[-0.15; 0.14]), and considerably smaller than the original study (N = 45, d = -0.82; 95 %CI[-1.45; -0.18]). Secondary analyses yielded a main effect of gender composition and a random effect of lab, but neither variable affected the interaction between stereotype threat and gender. The current results fail to replicate the stereotype-threat effect by Johns et al.

Yet, what listeners hear and feel when they find music beautiful, the impact this experience has on them, and wherein lie any important differences between individuals are questions that still lack clear answers. To address these gaps, an online questionnaire was administered to 81 adults. They described their experience of listening to three self-selected “beautiful pieces of music” alongside three pieces they enjoyed listening to but did not consider beautiful; this with a focus on each piece’s sonic features, the emotions induced, and any impact that engaging with the pieces had had on them. Respondents’ personality traits and level of musical training were also collected to explore if these were a source of significant variability in the data. Thematic analysis of text responses found that pieces perceived as beautiful are characterised by both low-level (e.g., slow tempo, soft timbre, low sound level), and high-level features (e.g., composition style, degree of change, complexity levels, repetition); have the ability to calm, evoke pleasant sadness in, and move the listener; and in terms of long-term impact, provide the listener strong emotional support, and provide them inspiration for musical activities. Exploratory, quantitative analyses examining individual differences revealed that participants high in the trait Openness to experience were most concerned with the aesthetic qualities of pieces. Our findings suggest that the experience of musical beauty is a multifaceted phenomenon that can have a profound emotional impact on some individuals, contributing to a more comprehensive account of what it means to experience beauty in music.",

          "abstract": "Intellectual humility (IH), the recognition of one’s intellectual limitations, is a promising characteristic to tackle societal conflicts such as affective political polarization. Despite increasing research on IH in recent years, most research has been conducted in the USA, probably due to a lack of scales that are validated in languages other than English. Our objective was to offer researchers in the German context several IH measures they can choose from depending on their specific research question. Therefore, we validated and compared four established IH scales within the German context. Items of three widely-used IH scales (CIHS, SIHS, LIHS) were translated from English into German by two independent researchers, rated by experts (n = 8), and pre-tested (n = 13). We then assessed structural, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of the scales plus an existing Swiss-German IH scale (IHS) in a preregistered online-survey (N = 698), representative for Germany regarding age, gender, and education. Discriminant validity was assessed via social desirability, cognitive closure, need for cognition, HEXACO honesty-humility, and openness, and incremental validity regarding affective polarization. Results showed that the IHS did not meet all of our pre-registered criteria, potentially due to cross-cultural differences between Germany and Switzerland. However, the three translated scales were comparable to the original English scales regarding structural, convergent, and discriminant validity. The SIHS showed best incremental validity in predicting less affective polarization towards opinion-based outgroups. Limitations and directions for future research regarding IH in German-speaking contexts are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Educational inequality is a major challenge for individuals and societies. Prior research indicated that disparities in academic performance, socio-emotional skills, and educational attainment tend to widen, as students’ progress through primary and secondary education. Socioeconomic status, immigrant background, ethnicity, geographical location, and gender have consistently emerged as critical drivers of these educational inequalities. Despite extensive research identifying these factors, our understanding of the specific mechanisms by which they influence educational outcomes remains limited. In this report, we share initial findings from a scoping review of longitudinal studies providing quantitative evidence on inequalities in educational outcomes—specifically academic achievement, socio-emotional skills, and educational attainment—among K–12 students across Europe. Our results suggest that the volume of longitudinal research addressing these issues has notably increased. Nonetheless, substantial gaps remain and highlight opportunities for further investigation, for instance, concerning early childhood education, interventions, research in Eastern European contexts, and research exploring how multiple social categories combine to create unique patterns of educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integrated into social and decision-making contexts, understanding how trust is established between humans and AI is essential. This study investigates whether humans and AI differ in how they form and adjust trust based on interactive experience. Using a 50-round trust game, we examined investment behaviors of human participants and ChatGPT-3.5 when paired with either high- or low-trustworthy partners framed as human or AI agents. While humans adjusted trust dynamically—investing more in high-trustworthy and less in low-trustworthy partners over time—AI failed to differentiate partner trustworthiness. Instead, AI consistently preferred human over AI partners, regardless of their behaviour. Notably, humans also demonstrated trust adaptation even when each trial involved a different partner, suggesting generalised social learning beyond specific partner history. In contrast, AI's trust behaviour remained static and unresponsive to contextual changes or unexpected outcomes. These results highlight a fundamental divergence in how humans and AI process social information: humans engage in experience-driven trust calibration, whereas AI responses reflect static patterns that do not update with experience. This misalignment raises critical concerns about the real-world deployment of AI in trust-sensitive roles. Users may mistakenly interpret AI’s apparent prosociality as adaptive, leading to misplaced confidence in its decision-making. We conclude that perceived trustworthiness in AI does not imply behavioural reliability, underscoring the need for transparent AI design and regulation in domains where trust is essential.",

However, much of this research focuses on traditional forms of engagement such as playing an instrument, or purposefully using live music as a targeted health intervention. There is limited research exploring the wellbeing consequences of regular gig and/or festival attendance, or the mechanisms for the effects of such attendance. Drawing on the ‘social cure’ approach to group membership and wellbeing, we carried out two complementary studies investigating this relationship through semi-structured interviews (n=20) and a pre-registered cross-sectional survey (n=2,021). In line with the ‘social cure’, results suggest a relationship between regular event attendance and wellbeing, contingent on group processes within the audience (identification, relationality, collective self-realization) as well as support from event staff – a novel finding. Additionally, we observe that individuals who experience attendance-related wellbeing often exhibit affective and behavioural changes that seem to actively reinforce their overall sense of wellbeing. To our knowledge, this finding points to a potential positive-feedback loop between wellbeing and subsequent behaviour that has not been widely reported in existing research.",

          "abstract": "Human wellbeing, deeply intertwined with human behaviors, has experienced a notable surge, with positive psychology emerging as a promising approach to enhancement. The integration of positive psychology with technology holds substantial potential; however, few studies have fully leveraged the pedagogical potential of technologies to foster wellbeing. Additionally, there is a lack of positive psychology interventions aimed at young adults in non-Western contexts. This study addresses these gaps by developing, implementing, and validating WeThrive, a technology-integrated, culturally adapted positive psychology intervention tailored for Asian young adults. A central feature of WeThrive is its integrated online co-creation approach. A mixed-methods approach with a pre-post-follow-up design was employed to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention. Results from quantitative analyses demonstrated that WeThrive significantly improved young adults’ overall wellbeing, positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment, while reducing negative feelings. Qualitative analyses identified key factors contributing to the effectiveness of WeThrive, including active engagement in meaningful co-creations, social connection, and positivity and agency. Findings of the study provide new insights into the effectiveness of integrating online co-creation in positive psychology interventions, particularly in an Asian context. It enriches the understanding of the use of computers by broadening knowledge of its psychological effects. Furthermore, it highlights online co-creation as an effective component in designing wellbeing enhancement strategies.",

Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Janna Wennberg",
          "abstract": "Noise can reduce the intelligibility of spoken language and increase the effort necessary to understand speech. Listening effort, “the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a [listening] task” (Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016), is commonly assessed by measuring response times to secondary tasks while listening to speech or by testing memory for the content of the speech. Increasing the level of background noise tends to slow responses and impair memory, and these effects are attributed to the resource-intensive process of reevaluating speech that was initially obscured or misheard. However, given that noise can impair performance on cognitive tasks that do not require processing auditory information, it is possible that noise-induced impairments typically ascribed to processing degraded speech may instead reflect increased cognitive load from the presence of noise itself. The current study assessed whether noise, in the absence of a speech task, can affect performance on tasks intended to measure listening effort. In Experiment 1 (positive control), target speech consisting of single words was presented aurally in background noise and we measured listening effort with three commonly-used paradigms. Experiment 2 was identical except that the target words were presented orthographically rather than aurally. Results showed that noise impaired performance on all three tasks when the target stimuli were presented aurally, consistent with a large body of work in the listening effort literature. Experiment 2 revealed that performance on some tasks was impaired by the presence of masking noise (particularly two-talker babble), indicating some domain-general interference. However, the magnitude of the noise-induced interference effects were markedly smaller in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, suggesting that measures of listening effort capture variability attributable to the challenges associated with listening to speech in noise, and do not simply measure distraction or noise-induced cognitive interference.",

Six female participants were invited to take part in individual semi-structured interviews on their experiences of masking.  Reflexive Thematic Analysis was utilised to gather a deeper understanding into the practicalities and impact of masking behaviours, aiming to answer the research question: How are masking behaviours experienced in females who display autistic traits?  Three core themes were identified following analysis: ‘The Innate Fear of Judgement’, ‘Deconstructing Normality’, and ‘Self-Identification and Self-Efficacy’.  Results show females identifying with autistic traits who engage in masking may experience higher difficulty than their peers throughout their social connectedness, experience of diagnosis, general life and educational experiences.

          "abstract": "There continues to be growing interest in the Science of Learning including identifying ways to apply findings. Presently, little is known about learning during healthy adulthood and methods to improve that learning. The main objective of the present systematic review is to identify and synthesize all recent cognitive and brain research investigating learning during healthy aging in adulthood. Searches were performed across Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases to identify published and unpublished studies conducted in healthy adults. Eligible studies reported measures of learning-related cognition, brain structure or function and their relationship with age, or effects of interventions to improve learning. Risk of bias was assessed using either the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool or Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Search and screening were performed by three trained reviewers. Included studies were summarized using narrative synthesis and, for intervention studies, an effect direction plot. A total of 265 relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Studies were primarily lab-based cross-sectional studies conducted in Western contexts. Findings revealed an overall decline in learning-related cognitive and brain outcomes during healthy aging. However, declines were more pronounced in fluid abilities and explicit learning and memory while crystalized abilities and implicit learning and memory showed stability. Generally, higher education and socioeconomic status positively modulated age-related learning trajectories while baseline cognitive function influenced the effectiveness of interventions. Findings from the present systematic review are potentially limited by the exclusive focus on healthy aging and the small number of included studies conducted in non-Western contexts. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

While previous studies suggest that value-driven attention generalizes to items sharing critical reward-associated features (e.g., red), recent findings propose an alternative generalization mechanism based on context-dependent feature relationships (e.g., redder). Here, we examined whether the relational coding of reward-associated features is commonly utilized across different learning contexts, particularly those engaging different attention modes (singleton search vs. feature-specific search) and varying levels of stimulus similarity (low vs. high target-distractor similarity). Focusing on value-driven attention based on feature relationships, our results showed that singleton search training led to value-driven relational attention that was independent of target-distractor similarity (Experiment 1a and 1b, n = 40 each). In contrast, feature-specific search training produced value-driven relational attention only when the target was dissimilar to the distractors, but not when they were similar (Experiment 2a – 2c, n = 40 each). Our findings suggest that when the learning task required only coarse selection (e.g., singleton search or feature-specific search among dissimilar items), a relational code for reward-associated feature was formed. However, when fine selection was necessary (e.g., feature-specific search among similar items), a more precise feature code was utilized. Thus, we propose that the precision of target selection during reward learning critically shapes value-driven attentional mechanisms.",

We also systematically manipulated various factors such as the list length, study time, delay, and stimulus type, and tested a large sample to examine the robustness of the effect (i.e., radical randomization). Results showed evidence for a list-length effect across the conditions, and we find that the square root function best describes the list-length effect. By utilizing a computational model we also show that although the list-length effect exists, there is, in general, a greater amount of interference stemming from other sources in recognition memory (e.g., previous contexts).",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can quickly process groups of objects (ensembles) and build compressed representations of their features. What does the conscious perception of ensembles consist of? Observers‘ explicit access to ensemble representations has been considered very limited – any distributional aspects beyond simple summary statistics, such as the mean or variance, cannot be explicitly accessed. In contrast, we demonstrate that the visual system can represent ensemble distributions in detail, and observers have reliable explicit access to these representations. In our new paradigm (Feature Frequency Report), observers viewed 36 disks of various colors for 800 ms and then reported the frequency of a randomly chosen color using a slider. The sets had Gaussian, uniform, or bimodal color distributions with a random mean color. The distributions of responses – both aggregated and separate for each observer – followed the shape of the presented distribution. Modeling revealed that performance reflected integrated information from the whole set rather than sub-sampling. After only brief exposure to a color set, the visual system can build detailed representations of feature distributions that observers have explicit access to. This result necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how ensembles are processed. We suggest that such distribution representations are the most natural way for the visual system to represent groups of objects. Explicit feature distribution representations may contribute to people‘s impression of having a rich perceptual experience despite severe attentional and working memory limitations.",

In this paper, we use internal reconstruction to lay out a tentative alternative. First, we assume that both the voice and nominalization functions go back to PAn. Second, we suggest that the non-active voice affixes originated in Pre-PAn as prepositions, and were later incorporated into the verb complex as postverbs. The nominalizing function, on the other hand, arose through an inter-stage with compounds. This proposal accounts for several properties of AVS, including the prominence of arguments promoted to subject position and the subject-only restriction, and is supported by a typological parallel in Dinka.",

Importantly, during multi-item\ntasks, performance decreases but does not collapse, consistent with effective management of\ncognitive overload. This has been interpreted by positing a strategic shift from a more parallel to\na more serial processing, whereby the processing of the current item is prioritized over\nupcoming items, termed lockout scheduling. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining\nwithin-task modulations of eye-voice span (EVS) measures and articulation duration in multiitem color naming tasks with and without internal interference (i.e., incongruent and neutral\nStroop conditions). We hypothesized that lockout scheduling would manifest itself across\nmeasures and conditions as the task progresses and cognitive overload emerges. The results\nshowed dynamic changes in both EVS and articulation measures as a function of time-on-task,\nconsistent with the gradual implementation of a lockout scheduling strategy in response to\nemerging cognitive overload. The observed patterns indicate that the shift from a more parallel\nto a more serial processing is not an all-or-none phenomenon but a dynamic interplay between\ngaze, voice, and covert (i.e., parafoveal) attention, affecting online decisions about spatial\ndistance, timing, and processing resource allocation.",

Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. Our model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries that context-based inter-item similarity could not explain, highlighting the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

Over a two-week observational period, a 21-year-old male participant tracked biometric data during days involving alarm use and days without. Heart rate was measured using a smartwatch, core temperature with an oral thermometer, and cognitive vigilance via reaction-time trials on a mobile app. Results show that alarm-induced waking was associated with higher waking heart rates (mean: 61.5 bpm vs. 58.75 bpm), lower core body temperature (36.4°C vs. 36.55°C), and slower reaction times (mean: 0.372 sec vs. 0.315 sec) compared to free days. Sleep timing analysis revealed approximately 1.5 hours of social jetlag, defined as the discrepancy between mid-sleep time on workdays and free days. These findings suggest that alarm clocks interfere with physiological readiness by interrupting circadian-regulated processes such as thermoregulation, cardiovascular balance, and cognitive arousal. While limited by a single-subject design, this study demonstrates measurable physiological disruption from alarm clock use and reinforces the importance of aligning sleep schedules with biological rhythms.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in music practice is often assumed to increase empathy and prosociality. However, data in support of this relationship are limited, leaving unclear which components of empathy (cognitive empathy, emotional contagion, and emotional disconnection) and prosocial behaviors, if any, would be affected. Here, we recruited musicians with more than 2 years of musical experience (n = 80) and nonmusicians (n = 89) to measure empathy (using subjective and objective measures) and prosociality (using economic games). We hypothesized that musicians would score higher than nonmusicians on empathy and prosociality, and that musicians who practice more would show greater effects. Using classical and Bayesian analyses of variance (ANOVAs), we found no difference between musicians and nonmusicians in empathy and prosociality, and no correlation with the amount of practice. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between the age of onset of music practice and empathy, suggesting that it is not music practice per se but specifically its initiation in early life that could be linked to empathy. These findings challenge the common assumption that music practice in general increases empathy and prosociality and invites to explore in which specific contexts music practice does so (e.g., particular age ranges or group-based settings).\n\nNote.

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to environmental distraction. WM requires resistance to distractors, which may enter WM due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets, as in a spatial array during WM encoding. Alternatively, distractors may enter WM due to insufficient ability to ignore them when they are presented during WM maintenance. Current research disagrees about whether a deficit in distractor suppression accounts for older adults’ impaired WM performance, or not. Beyond these differing perspectives, it is unclear whether WM performance is vulnerable to different types of distractors, including those that are novel versus familiar, or high versus low saliency. Across three behavioral experiments we found that participants were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than those presented during maintenance, with stronger effects in older adults. Distractor familiarity and saliency had minimal impact on WM performance, and patterns of results did not change across trials. Rather than providing converging evidence these data expand the pattern of distractor-related WM deficits observed in older adults.",

          "authors": "Marco Del Giudice",
          "abstract": "The evolution of heritable individual differences (for example in personality, cognition, and the risk for psychopathology) is the subject of a long-running debate between proponents of adaptive and non-adaptive explanations. Newly available genomic data show that most quantitative traits conform to what I label the “default genetic architecture,” characterized by extreme polygenicity with contributions from both common and rare variants, with large-effect variants that tend to be rarer and younger than small-effect ones. Furthermore, targeted tests of balancing selection return largely null or negative results. These findings indicate widespread purifying selection at the genetic level; they have led some scholars to argue that heritable individual differences are essentially non-adaptive or maladaptive, and that evolutionary hypotheses that invoke balancing selection are inconsistent with the data. Here I show that this strong interpretation is not warranted. I distinguish between four questions about the evolution of heritable individual differences, and explain why the data do not support sweeping inferences about their adaptive function (or lack thereof). I also discuss why tests of balancing selection are much less informative than is often believed. While the pervasive role of purifying selection is beyond dispute, the default architecture of complex traits is potentially compatible with a broad range of evolutionary scenarios, including scenarios in which heritable individual differences can be adaptive and functional rather than just manifestations of neutral/maladaptive noise.",

          "abstract": "Two leading models of numerosity judgments describe numerical representations as Gaussian distributions on a mental number line. The linear model posits that both numerosity and variability increase linearly with number, while the logarithmic model assumes logarithmic scaling with constant variability. In this study, we use the selective sampling account, which proposes that information is gathered selectively based on goals and available resources, to explore the cognitive processes underlying variations in variability and scaling. In intermingled displays of blue and yellow dots (B/Y task), participants relied on incomplete representations of dots positioned near the center, where spatial resolution is highest, leading to increasing variability with set size. In contrast, spatially separated displays (L/R task) facilitated more comprehensive sampling, resulting in approximately constant variability across set sizes. Behavioral patterns and modeling analyses suggest that linear and logarithmic scaling capture sensitivity differences shaped by the display format and spatial resolution demands. Eye-tracking data further support our account, emphasizing the role of selective attention in forming numerical representations and providing a unified framework for understanding variability and scaling across tasks.",

For example, a grey banana is allegedly perceived with a tint of yellow. However, methodological and conceptual considerations, leave it unclear whether the purported “memory-color” effect actually reflects changes in perception or changes in judgment and responses instead. Here, we combine memory-color with binocular rivalry to test if top-down influences affect the color an object is perceived in. We showed 24 participants familiar objects in their typical and opponent color and asked for concurrent reports of the perceived color. Consistent with Bayesian models of rivalry, we observed that conscious perception of identical spectral color pairs was biased towards the typical color of the presented object. Our results suggest that prior knowledge aids interpretation of ambiguous stimuli and biases conscious perception towards the most plausible interpretation.",

To address this shortcoming we describe, evaluate, and demonstrate how a rule-based computer system can be used to implement item-writing guidelines in order to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of multiple-choice test items. The rule-based system was evaluated by comparing the ratings from a human reviewer with the rule-based system on a sample of test items resulting in almost perfect agreement demonstrating that the system can identify common multiple-choice item flaws. The system was also used to identify the item flaws found in a large sample of 1078 operational test items written in the content areas of research methods, statistics, child development, and educational psychology. The most common flaw was the logical ordering of options followed by grammar and spelling errors. Directions for future research are discussed.",

Moreover, because LS closely tracks personality traits, not controlling for these has left the existing results inconclusive. In pre-registered analyses, we examined occupational differences in LS and job satisfaction (JS) among 59,000 Estonian Biobank participants who represented 263 occupations, controlling for demographic variables and comprehensively assessed personality traits. Jobs differed in LS and JS before (η2 = .05 and η2 = .07, respectively) and even after adjusting for all covariates (η2 = .01 to .02 and η2 = .06, respectively). Various medical professionals, psychologists, special needs teachers, and self-employed individuals tended to have the highest LS levels, whereas security guards, survey interviewers, waiters, sales workers, mail carriers, carpenters, and chemical engineers tended to score the lowest. Jobs with the highest JS included religious professionals, various medical professionals, and authors, while kitchen, transport, storage, and manufacturing labourers, survey interviewers, and sales workers were among the least satisfied with their jobs. Exploratory analyses suggested that income and O*NET-derived job characteristics, such as interest orientations like realistic, enterprising, and conventional, could explain some of the satisfaction variance among occupations.

Participants’ performance was measured by the quality, elaboration, and originality of their ideas. Subsequently, two-step clustering was employed to identify groups of low- and high-performing students. Finally, process-mining techniques (heuristics miner) were used to analyze the interactions of low- and high-performing students.\n\nResults: The findings suggest that including clear evaluation criteria when prompting ChatGPT to generate ideas (rs = .38), providing ChatGPT with an elaborated context for idea generation (rs = .47), and offering specific feedback (rs = .45), enhances the quality, elaboration, and originality of the solutions. Successful problem-solving involves iterative human-AI regulation, with high performers using an overall larger number of prompts (d = 0.82). High performers interacted with ChatGPT through dialogue, where they monitored and regulated the generation of ideas, while low performers used ChatGPT as an information resource.\n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the importance of active and iterative engagement for creative problem-solving and suggest that educational practices should foster metacognitive monitoring and regulation to maximize the benefits of human-AI collaboration.",

          "abstract": "Children acquire gender stereotypes at a young age and these subsequently influence cognition and behavior. Stereotypes may be learned through a child’s direct observation of gender differences as well as perpetuated by inaccurate cultural depictions. Children’s mass media, a cultural product, may be a powerful source of gender stereotype perpetuation. This research investigated the presence and impact of an inaccurate gender stereotypic association of predator animals as male and prey animals as female. Study 1 investigated predator-male and prey-female stereotypes in children’s films featuring anthropomorphized animal characters (N = 1892). After accounting for a 75% male character bias, there was a disproportionately high number of predators assigned male and prey assigned female. Study 2 created explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female association measures and tested these on children (N = 132, aged 4-14-years) and adults (N = 99, aged 18-65 years). Both groups showed a male character bias, along with strong explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female associations. Children had higher explicit scores than adults, whereas adults had higher implicit scores than children, but there were no discernible differences in children’s responses across this wide age range, suggesting that this gender stereotype is embedded early in development. Inaccurate gender stereotypes in children’s media correspond to explicit and implicit gender stereotyping. This suggests that children can acquire stereotypes indirectly through exposure to cultural products alone and implies a bi-directional relationship between individual cognition and cultural level gender stereotyping.",

The theory proposes that cognitive control amounts to optimising a precision parameter, which acts as a control signal and balances the contributions of deliberative and habitual components of action selection. To illustrate the theory, we simulate a driving scenario in which the driver follows a well-known route, but encounters unexpected challenges. Our simulations show that a standard active inference model can form adaptive habits; i.e., can pass from deliberative to habitual control when the context is stable, but generally fails to revert to deliberative control, when the context changes. To address this failure of context-sensitivity, we introduce a novel type of hierarchical active inference, in which a lower level is responsible for behavioural control and the higher (or meta-cognitive) level observes the belief updating of the lower level below and is responsible for cognitive control. Crucially, the meta-cognitive level can both form habits and suspend them, by controlling the (precision) parameter that prioritizes deliberative choices at the behavioural level. Furthermore, we show that several processes linked to cognitive control — such as surprise detection, cognitive conflict monitoring, control signal regulation and specification, the simulation of future outcomes and the assessment of the costs of control and mental effort — stem coherently from the free energy minimization scheme that underpins active inference. Finally, we discuss the putative neurobiology of cognitive control by simulating brain dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the dopamine system, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the locus coeruleus.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people often experience difficulties in social communication, which have traditionally been explained by autism-related deficits in social cognition and behaviour, with less focus on the role of the contextual factors and communicative partners in effective communication. Here, we investigated the perspectives of autistic adults, parents, and professionals on communication breakdowns between autistic people and nonautistic educational- and healthcare professionals. This study was anchored in the Double Empathy Problem theoretical framework. Through Reflective Thematic Analysis three main themes were constructed:1) Cross-neurotype communication breakdowns are common and multifactorial; 2) Both autistic and nonautistic people can take responsibility for effective communication; and 3) Autism knowledge and understanding matters. Differences in communication styles, the feeling of being different and autism knowledge among professionals have been found to be associated with effective communication. Our findings provide insights which can help to improve communication in educational- and healthcare settings and, thus, contribute to improve the support provided to autistic people.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked intense debate across multiple academic disciplines. While some argue that LLMs represent a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even machine consciousness (inflationary claims), others dismiss them as mere trickster artifacts lacking genuine cognitive abilities (deflationary claims). We argue that both extremes may be shaped or exacerbated by common cognitive biases, including cognitive dissonance, wishful thinking, and the illusion of depth of understanding, which distort reality to our own advantage. By showcasing how these distortions may easily emerge in both scientific and public discourse, we advocate for a measured approach— skeptical open mind - that recognizes the cognitive abilities of LLMs as worthy of scientific investigation while remaining conservative concerning exaggerated claims regarding their cognitive status.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications on organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty and the most classical economic approaches emphasize the use of punishment by focusing on both the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”) and the severity (“what fine will be imposed?”) of punishment, respectively. However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. Here, we suggest to provide a high-powered online study (N = 630) collecting UK-based Prolific participants in which we manipulate (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earns money for the individual or for the group), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual is punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). The study will shed light on the interplay between individual or group decision making and the specifics of punishment as well as advance the understanding under which conditions punishment might be effective in curbing dishonesty.",

          "abstract": "To sustainably manage our shared resources, we must learn to cooperate with each other and develop more sustainable behaviour over time. However, previous research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of the cause of this is vital to inform policy advocating sustainability. One hypothesis is that increasingly unsustainable behaviour is driven by a few uncooperative actors – if a few act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to act sustainably even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these two hypotheses. Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiments 1) and earned tickets to a raffle (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e. where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing the long-term gains of each player. By the third game, only 9.12% of participants were able to use the resource sustainably. We demonstrate that this failure is likely due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage related to sexualized images amongst adolescents is a critical emerging research area.  In this exploratory study, a nationally representative online survey of 577 English-speaking individuals aged 13 - 17 was conducted.  Participants were asked about their consensual and non-consensual usage and interactions with sexualized GenAI images.  The survey included questions on images created with nudification software as well as content creation software, and asked participants about their creation, sharing, and viewing of this content, as well as that of their peers.  Use of nudification tools was widespread, with 55.3% (n=328) of participants reporting having created and 54.4% (n=323) having received at least one image.  Reported victimization levels of participants was substantial, with 36.3% (n=222) of individuals reporting having a non-consensual image created and 33.2% (n=205) of individuals having had at least one image non-consensually shared.  Usage was similar across demographic categories, though male participants had higher degrees of regular GenAI sexual image creation and distribution, both consensual and non-consensual.  Policymakers need to consider the extensive usage and its normalization and consider educational interventions, and practitioners need to be aware of the high degree and nature of victimization occurring.",

          "authors": "Patrick Sandoz",
          "abstract": "False and denied pregnancies are insufficiently understood mental health disorders affecting women. Denied pregnancies in particular can result in unexpected births, putting both mother and child at risk. Improved understanding is therefore required to address these public health concerns. This paper is rooted in Darwin’s theory of evolution of species. As humans, we are a highly social species. However, our earliest land ancestors were instinct-driven solitary animals. These oviparous animals reproduced by depositing their fertilized eggs in favourable locations. They were progenitors but not parents. The emergence of parenting traits facilitated the transition from solitary to social life, fostering the inherent interdependence of individuals. Humans are relational psychological beings housed in separate physical bodies. This physical-relational duality, or physiological-psychological duality, is inherent to our evolution. It can create conflict by opposing physical reality to paradoxical psychological demands. Such conflicts are likely to affect pregnancy that triggers major changes in both physiology and psychology. Furthermore, pregnancy is a parental trait where the pregnant woman, as a relational being, supports an immature dependent. We explain false and denied pregnancies as temporary and fictitious responses to such intractable conflicts. A single conflict formulation is assigned to each disorder: An imperative need for motherhood in a non-pregnant woman for false pregnancy; and a psychological inability to accept impending motherhood in a pregnant woman for denial of pregnancy. It is hoped that these clear starting points will help clinicians to explore the factual causes of these disorders in their patients on a case-by-case basis.",

          "authors": "Rita Abdel Sater; Coralie Chevallier",
          "abstract": "Behavioral interventions, such as green nudges, are increasingly used to promote pro-environmental behaviors and address climate change. While these interventions are cost-effective and preserve individual autonomy, they can raise significant equity concerns. Green nudges, unlike most other nudges, often impose private costs to yield collective environmental gains. Given that low-income individuals contribute less to pollution and given that many green behaviors, such as purchasing eco-friendly products or offsetting carbon emissions, involve higher financial costs, the burden of green nudges can end up being unfair to the poorest segments of the population. In addition, this issue can be exacerbated if people living in poverty are more susceptible to the psychological biases that are leveraged by nudges. We review this evidence and show that the same nudge is likely to have a stronger effect on poorer people, which will further compound fairness issues in the case of costly green nudges. We conclude by arguing that policymakers must pay specific attention to the distributive impacts of green nudges. Future research should further investigate the psychological mechanisms that drive heterogeneous responses to green nudges. If these challenges are addressed both in policy and research, green nudges can contribute to equitable and effective climate policies that balance collective goals with individual fairness.",

          "abstract": "Induced-hypocrisy, a cognitive dissonance paradigm, effectively promotes prosocial behaviors through a two-step procedure. First, a person advocates for a prosocial behavior and then recalls their past failures to comply with it, which prompts the person to adopt the behavior. Initially, the explanation for such hypocrisy effect focused on restoring a positive self-image threatened by past transgressions. A recent theoretical explanation, suggest that behavioral change results from the perceived discrepancy between social norms and transgressive behavior. Our five-study experimental program (Total N = 774) was designed to test whether the process of social norm deviation underlies the hypocrisy effect. Results showed the influence of social norms strength on the hypocrisy effect (Studies 1, 2, 3) and the mediating effect of perceived social norm deviation in increasing prosocial behaviors consecutive to the hypocrisy procedure (Studies 4a and 4b). An integrative analysis (N = 602) of Studies 1, 2 and 4a, as well as two additional datasets, confirmed the influence of social norms in producing the hypocrisy effect. Taken together, these results strongly support social norm deviation as a key process underlying the hypocrisy effect, in that participants with stronger social normative beliefs exhibit a more pronounced hypocrisy effect due to a greater perceived deviation from social norms. These experimental findings constitute a significant contribution to understanding and improving the hypocrisy effect. They are discussed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, questioning the implication of the self and the affiliation motivation in this social norm deviation process and emphasizing the relevance of reinforcing social norms in contexts where transgressions are less salient, such as in discrimination prevention.",

First, we contrast the dominant theoretical perspective of self-improvement with\nself-acceptance as pathways to reduce the discrepancy between current and ideal personality.\nSecond, we test how well-being aspects change as a by-product of targeting personality.\nThird, we use a waitlist control group to account for expectancy and demand effects. Across\nthree studies (combined N = 2,094; 1,044 women, 1,050 men; M_age = 30.74, SD_age = 9.57,\nrange_age = 18-75), we implemented randomized online interventions of self-improvement or\nself-acceptance over a 3-month period, with another follow-up 6 months after baseline and a\nwaitlist control group added in Study 2. Across Studies 1 and 2, participants in both\nintervention groups reduced discrepancies between current and ideal personality and\nincreased in well-being. In both intervention groups, current personality increased, whereas\nideal personality remained stable. Critically, however, control group participants changed\nsimilarly, with no significant differences in change compared to participants who received the\ninterventions. Study 3 compared different control group specifications and highlighted that\nthe intervention recruitment framing might have induced selection effects and expectancy and\ndemand effects leading to positive changes in neuroticism, conscientiousness, and\nextraversion as well as life satisfaction and self-esteem.

The Re-Connection Hypothesis proposes that this drive ultimately guides Homo sapiens to discover and ritually employ N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  Rather than postulating that the brain must “self-flood” with DMT, we argue that cortical circuitry is pre-tooled—analogous to dormant Wi-Fi hardware—to respond to modest, externally supplied DMT and switch awareness to a non-material information domain we term the Transcendent.  Three empirical anchors motivate the model: (i) conserved expression of the DMT-synthesising enzyme INMT across mammals; (ii) widespread occurrence of DMT-rich plants; (iii) reproducible, network-reset phenomenology at low–moderate exogenous doses.  Drawing on signalling-bias pharmacology, receptor-reserve experiments, and ethnobotanical convergences, we articulate testable predictions—including a “low-threshold, high-gain” 5-HT2A circuit assay—and sketch preregistered study designs.

          "abstract": "Humans across time and culture invest scarce resources—fasting in deserts, silent temple retreats, whirling in sacred halls, multi-night plant ceremonies—to achieve states “beyond” the day-to-day hive of work, consumption, and status. Conventional drives (survival, power, meaning, truth) cannot explain this costly impulse or the durable drop in material striving that follows. We propose a fifth, previously unidentified human drive—the Will to Transcendence (WT)—which ripens slowly, can be fulfilled repeatedly or for extended spans, and reliably reorders priorities toward sufficiency, service, and ecological care. Cross-cultural rituals (e.g. Vision Quests, Zen ango, Sufi dhikr, ayahuasca dietas) and meta-analytic evidence (N = 3,412; g ≈ |0.3|) document a “material-detachment” signature. Neuroimaging studies link WT states to default-mode network deactivation, suggesting a neural mechanism for ego-dissolution. We sketch a cultural feedback loop by which private transcendence seeds ethical systems (poverty vows, alms economies, ecological taboos), catalog genuine gateways versus “false victories” (luxury highs, social-media fame), and offer low-dose N,N-DMT as a high-priority mechanistic hypothesis. Four falsifiable predictions and a multidisciplinary research agenda conclude the paper.",

OneStop has 152 hours of passage reading eye movement recordings from 360 participants for 2.6 million word tokens, more data than all the existing public broad coverage native English eye tracking datasets combined. The eye movement data was collected for extensively piloted reading comprehension materials comprising 486 reading comprehension questions and auxiliary text annotations geared towards behavioral analyses of reading comprehension. OneStop includes multiple reading regimes: ordinary reading, information seeking, repeated reading of the same text, and reading simplified text. The combination of the unprecedented size, high-quality reading comprehension materials and multiple reading regimes, aims to enable new research avenues in the study of reading and human language processing. It further aims to facilitate the integration of eye tracking data in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and educational applications.",

          "authors": "Andrew Jun Lee; Keith Holyoak; Hongjing Lu",
          "abstract": "Visual relational concepts—defined by patterns of relationships between entities—are thought to require structured, compositional representations with explicit role information about each entity. Analogical mapping over compositional representations is a key strategy for acquiring such concepts, but in complex situations with many entities and relations, this process can be cognitively demanding. As a result, learning may occur over feature-based representations, where exemplars are encoded as unstructured lists of entities and relations, losing crucial role information and limiting generalizability. To reduce the cognitive load of analogical mapping, we explored the effectiveness of two visuospatial training aids: (1) spatially organizing exemplars by category to facilitate comparisons, and (2) using color coding to highlight the roles of entities within each exemplar. Across three experiments, we examined whether these visuospatial aids improve learning rates on the Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT), a collection of 23 problems that require learning relational concepts. Our results showed that displays of previous instances that spatially sorted them into positive and negative sets led to faster concept learning. Learning was faster overall when problems were ordered easy-to-hard rather than randomly, but sorted displays were more effective in either case. Color coding proved beneficial only when colors unambiguously and non-redundantly linked entities that played corresponding roles; when color coding did not support a clear mapping, it interfered with learning. These findings suggest that rapid learning of relational concepts can be facilitated by display characteristics that support analogical mapping by comparisons.",

          "abstract": "The effects of using social media platforms remain hotly debated, but insufficient research has\nfocused on how individuals are defining what social media is. Here, we consider how different\nunderstandings of the term “social media” may influence how people think and talk about social\nmedia experiences and effects. To test this, we asked a nationally representative sample of adults\nin the United States (N = 1904) to indicate whether twelve popular platforms are “social media.”\nOur results revealed significant variation in the identification of “social media”— with general\nagreement that six platforms are social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat,\nand TikTok) and a lack of consensus about the other six (Telegram, Signal, Discord, WhatsApp,\nand Messenger, and YouTube). Younger participants were more likely to view four platforms as\nsocial media (Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok), whereas older participants were more\nlikely to view six platforms as social media (Reddit, YouTube, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, and\nMessenger). Additionally, we examined the correlates of holding broad vs. narrow social media\nschemata, finding that individuals with broader schemas perceived hate speech to be more\nprevalent on social media. Looking forward, we discuss how the lack of consensus around the\nterm “social media” may affect how people respond to survey questions about social media, as\nwell as perceive and converse about their effects and policy implications in society.",

We probed the foundational intuitions underlying these important societal questions through a developmental lens, examining how adults and 4- to 9-year-old children evaluate universalist versus exclusive decision-making systems that could potentially have better decision effectiveness and efficiency. Study 1 found that compared to expert-led exclusive voting, children and adults preferred universal systems and thought they were fairer. Study 2 found similar patterns even when we emphasized the decisions as important and consequential. We also introduced a moral-led exclusive voting system and found that, with age children increasingly believed the universalist system was more fair than both expert-led and moral-led exclusive systems, although they acknowledged the exclusive systems could yield better outcomes (in line with adult responding).  Study 3 further investigated evaluations of exclusive systems based on incompetence, immoral behaviors, or arbitrary characteristics. Children and adults regarded immorality-based exclusions as the fairest type of exclusion, followed by incompetence-based and then arbitrary exclusions. Across studies, with age, children increasingly recognized that exclusive voting systems were faster than universal voting, demonstrating an awareness of the trade-offs between inclusiveness and efficiency. These results reveal an early-emerging preference for universalist voting and a growing sophistication in children’s thinking about fair decision-making systems in society.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to understand how aging influences cognitive and mentalizing processes, and to explore whether physical activity protects against cognitive and social function decline in older adults. A total of 104 adults participants (44 Older adults, 60 younger Control) were recruited to complete the Go/No-go task and the Picture sequencing task, which measured their executive control and mentalizing ability respectively. Their general cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the frequency of physical activity was assessed through a self-report question. The current study demonstrated that, compared to control participants, elder participants performed relatively well in maintaining attention and inhibiting irrelevant responses, as evidenced by comparable response times on Go trials and accuracy on both Go and No-go trials in the Go/No-go task. However, older participants showed significant impairments in reconstructing sequences of events in the Picture sequencing task, particularly those requiring the mentalizing capacity to infer others’ false belief, even after controlling MoCA scores (both accuracy and response times). Importantly, a higher frequency of physical activity was found to mitigate age-related declines in reconstructing events sequences among older adults, particularly in stories involving others’ false beliefs. Overall, the current findings suggest that mentalizing abilities decrease independently of general cognitive decline. Furthermore, physical activity may serve as a potential protective factor in mitigating age-related cognitive impairments.",

          "authors": "Kenneth Pargament; Julie J. Exline; Richard Cowden; Joshua Adam Wilt",
          "abstract": "Adversity impacts people not only psychologically, socially, and physically, but spiritually as well.  In times of stress, many people experience spiritual struggles, defined as tensions, strains, and conflicts about spiritual matters within oneself, with other people, and/or with the supernatural.  In well over 100 empirical studies, spiritual struggles have been robustly linked to psychological problems.  However, because much of the research on this topic has been cross-sectional, a key question remains:  Are spiritual struggles the cause of psychological problems (the primary model of spiritual struggles), the effect of psychological problems (the secondary model of spiritual struggles) or both a cause and effect of psychological problems (the complex model of spiritual struggles)? This paper reviews emerging longitudinal research that examines this causal question and, more specifically, the three models of the causal relationship between spiritual struggles and psychological problems.  The findings show the strongest support for the primary model of spiritual struggles (the model that has been tested most often).  Research has also shown modest support for the secondary and complex models of spiritual struggles; however, more studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for further study and for practical work with people who are struggling spiritually.",

We provide insights into how sampling, use of methodology, and analysis for such interviews can be managed to ensure both good access to information only these experts can provide and valid construction of knowledge. In discussing this case, we reflect on qualitative research and take a critical stance toward practices that undermine the field of qualitative research. Specifically, we reflect on the process of analyzing interviews and — what we refer to as “the quantification of qualitative research” — how it has become tainted and poorly executed due to a fixation on counting codes to construct patterns under a quantitative epistemic logic. This essay is written in the form of a dialectic between reflections on interviewing elite experts and the qualitative logic this requires.",

          "abstract": "This book presents a theory of theory building and testing that builds on insights in Lipton’s 2004 book Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).  The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

          "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e.,\ntransitivity, clustering), whereby network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to\nbe directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form\nsuch ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se or from other processes, such as homophily and\nmore opportunities for exposure. These are difficult to disentangle in many settings, but in\nsocial media not only can they be decomposed, but platforms frequently make decisions that\ndepend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we\nrandomize the existing network structure that a user faces when followed by a target account\nthat we control, and we examine whether they reciprocate this tie formation. Being randomly\nassigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie\nformation by 35%. Through the use of multiple control conditions in which the relevant tie is\nabsent (never existent or removed), we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that\nindicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure\nshould be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and we find larger effects when the\nsubject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial\nrole for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what\nmight be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these\ntendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and\ninformation diffusion in online networks.",

          "abstract": "We propose a four-zone framework for understanding Information Transfer Management (ITM) in the age of advanced artificial intelligence. Drawing on the evolution of platforms like Freenet, Wikipedia, and ChatGPT, and contrasting distinct regulatory logics, the framework identifies four attractor forces—Sovereignty, Market, Morality, and Method—that shape geopolitical ITM zones. This approach is designed to support idiomatic diplomacy: forms of communication that remain tolerable even between fundamentally incompatible regimes. Such communicative capacity is essential for any jurisdiction that seeks to regulate AI services.\n\tWe demonstrate the framework’s analytic utility by profiling eight thinkers—Confucius, Mao Zedong, Smith, Friedman, Montesquieu, Bourdieu, Popper, and Goodfellow—across the four zones. This leads us to propose an epistemic shift within the \"Method\" zone itself, one that relates scientific authority to the forces of power, capital, and conviction. We conclude by arguing that our framework is both empirically tractable and theoretically expandable, and offer several research questions concerning generative social phenomena that we hope others will develop further.",

As a case study, we report preliminary findings of a rise in clickbait style in titles across online platforms, and use our model to explain which mechanisms could give rise to this pattern. Generally, the model serves to formulate predictions against which to compare observational data and we show how online trends can be interpreted in terms of cultural evolution.

          "abstract": "Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodhart’s Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity.",

However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) suggests great potential to facilitate this process. To advance AI-assisted communication research, we examined the performance of ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4) in generating message stimuli for experimental research. Through four pre-registered experiments, we compared GPT-generated stimuli with human-generated stimuli in (1) manipulating target variables (discrete emotions and moral intuitions) and (2) controlling unintended variables. We found GPT-generated message stimuli performed equivalently to or even surpassed human-generated stimuli in manipulating target variables, while the performance in controlling unintended variables was mixed. Our study suggests that LLMs can generate effective message stimuli for communication experimental research. This research serves as a foundational resource for integrating LLMs in stimuli generation across various communication contexts, with its effectiveness, opportunities and challenges discussed.",

We define good jobs as those in industries in which full-time workers attain high wages, accounting for individual and regional characteristics. The share of good jobs in manufacturing has plummeted; for college graduates, good jobs have shifted to (mostly tradable) business, professional, and IT services, while for those without a BA they have shifted to (nontradable) construction. There is strong persistence in where good jobs are located. Over the last four decades, places with larger concentrations of good job industries have tended to hold onto them, consistent with a model of proportional growth. Turning to regional specialization in good job industries, we find evidence of mean reversion. Commuting zones with larger initial concentrations of good jobs have thus seen even faster growth in lower-wage (and mostly nontradable) services. Changing regional employment patterns are most pronounced among racial minorities and the foreign-born, who are relatively concentrated in fast growing cities of the South and West. Therefore, good job regions today look vastly different than in 1980: they are more centered around human-capital-intensive tradable services, are surrounded by larger concentrations of low-wage, non-tradable industries, and are more demographically diverse.

          "authors": "Gordon H. Hanson; Dani Rodrik; Rohan Sandhu; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Place-based policy in the United States comprises a wide range of government programs that are spread across federal, state, and local agencies and that rely on public, private, and nonprofit organizations for policy design and implementation. We document how loosely connected vertical policy supply chains distribute resources from federal and state governments to recipients at the local level. The apparatus is the product of 150 years of policy innovation, both from the top down, with the federal government periodically launching major initiatives whose place-based impacts tend to be long-lived (even if the specific policies are not), and from the bottom up, with state and local actors engineering their own policy solutions, many of which have endured and now constitute modern policy practice. That practice includes not just tax incentives for business investment, the subject of most economic research on place-based policy, but support for community redevelopment, workforce development, small business promotion, technological innovation, and regional planning and strategy. Intermediary organizations that connect government agencies to local recipients are central to resource delivery. Because they tend to be created, funded, and (or) run by non-state actors, there appears to be wide geographic variation in organizational capacity for place-based policy. Understanding the causes and consequences of that variation is needed for a full accounting of how place-based policy works in the U.S. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "This chapter analyzes the distinct adjustment paths of U.S. labor markets (places) and U.S. workers (people) to increased Chinese import competition during the 2000s. Using comprehensive register data for 2000–2019, we document that employment levels more than fully rebound in trade-exposed places after 2010, while employment-to-population ratios remain depressed and manufacturing employment further atrophies. The adjustment of places to trade shocks is generational: affected areas recover primarily by adding workers to non-manufacturing who were below working age when the shock occurred. Entrants are disproportionately native-born Hispanics, foreign-born immigrants, women, and the college-educated, who find employment in relatively low-wage service sectors such as medical services, education, retail, and hospitality. Using the panel structure of the employer-employee data, we decompose changes in the employment composition of places into trade-induced shifts in the gross flows of people across sectors, locations, and non-employment status. Contrary to standard models, trade shocks reduce geographic mobility, with both in- and out-migration remaining depressed through 2019. The employment recovery stems almost entirely from young adults and foreign-born immigrants taking their first U.S. jobs in affected areas, with minimal contributions from cross-sector transitions of former manufacturing workers. Although worker inflows into non-manufacturing more than fully offset manufacturing employment losses in trade-exposed locations after 2010, incumbent workers neither fully recover earnings losses nor predominantly exit the labor market, but rather age in place as communities undergo rapid demographic and industrial transitions.

Drawing on novel data from more than 200 companies around the globe that participated in four-day, thirty-two-hour weeks with no reduction in pay, we find that 90% of companies continue this schedule. From neoclassical and Marxian theories of the workplace, institutional theories of legitimacy, and gendered and racialized organizational theory, we test three main hypotheses. As expected from labour process theories, we find that some employers revert to a five-day schedule after achieving efficiencies. From theories of legitimacy, we find that organisations that fail to reduce stress are more likely to revert.

Increasingly the party of unions and minimum wages is also the party of managers and professionals.  In this article, we investigate whether this realignment among the actors setting wages within firms has politicized wage setting.  We first show that Democrat managers pay more to hourly workers, even comparing across firms within metro-occupation-industry-year local labor markets.  This premium is confined to senior managers and human resources and compensation managers; a placebo test shows that operations managers' political affiliation is uncorrelated with wage levels. We then show, consistent with coalitional behavior, that the Democrat wage premium is larger for Democrat-leaning service jobs than for increasingly Republican blue-collar workers, and larger for women than for men.  Democrat managers raise pay more around salient minimum wage increases and become relatively more likely to pay $15 wages specifically. In an experiment in which manager-employee partisan match is randomly assigned, managers are 10 percentage points more likely to assign co-partisans a higher wage. Finally, we show that the Democrat wage premium has grown in recent years, and that this accounts for 12% of extra wage increases for low-wage workers during this period.  Taken together, these results suggest a politicization of wage-setting, wherein managers' liberal commitments benefit frontline workers in their political coalition.",

This drove declines in US labor market inequality for the first time since 1980, as pay increases in low-wage retail, food service and logistics jobs outpaced higher-status occupations.  How did these substantial wage increases emerge?  Using restricted-use microdata from the Occupational Employment and Wages Statistics and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that rising pay across low-wage occupations, rather than declining inequality within-job or in workplace pay premiums, explains a majority of declining wage inequality since 2015.  Contrary to creative destruction predictions, establishment exit contributed little to rising pay at the bottom.  Low-paying employers of low-wage occupations contracted, but this accounts for less than a fifth of rising wages at the bottom.  The main driver of rising pay was low- and middle-paying employers of low-wage occupations increasing pay. Notwithstanding organizational inertia, major gains for workers' pay can come from changes in existing workplaces.",

This created a natural experiment where name choices reflected orientation toward the modernizing state. Viewing surnames as signs with ideological and personal significance, I explored how these choices reflected positions on nationalism, identity, and strategies for claiming status and building reputation. I analyzed surname patterns among political elites (4,873 individuals, 1927-1949) and a populace sample using thematic coding and frequency analysis. Elites disproportionately chose surnames featuring newly coined ``Pure Turkish'' words, Old Turkish etymology, and innovative linguistic structures, emphasizing themes of military, heritage, and social status. The general population maintained traditional naming patterns, favoring references to natural elements, physical traits, and occupations. This study reveals how personal choices like surnames can expose alignment with political projects, showing how elites strategically used naming to signal status and ideological commitment.",

          "abstract": "What should be the “physical interpretation” of Riemann’s hypothesis? Can its eventual physical interpretation pioneer a pathway for the proper mathematical proof? Answers to both questions are researched in the framework of ontomathematics inherently involving the unity of physics, mathematics, and philosophy. After that viewpoint, a philosophical method for reinterpreting most fundamental mathematical problems (in particular, the seven “Millennium Problems” of CMI) is suggested. Loosely speaking, it consists in determining the ontomathematical “forest” in which the “tree” of a certain very essential mathematical problem is situated, after which the shortest silogism eventually needing a relevant “Gestalt change” appears to be natural and almost obvious, furthermore rather elementarily provable. One even notices that many (if not all) most fundamental problems of contemporary mathematics appeal to the same “Gestalt change” needing the “Cartesian glasses” to be “put off” and Modernity and its episteme to be abandoned. As for mathematics itself, one can conjecture that many or all of the most fundamental problems are (or at least, are linkable to) Gödel’s insoluble statements. Ontomathematics suggests a general framework (also) for resolving many essential mathematical problems by breaking the Cartesian prejudice established by Modernity: then, Riemann’s hypothesis can be reformulated in terms of the qubit Hilbert space so that the “zeta function” belongs to it. If one manages to demonstrate this, Riemann’s hypothesis is rather easily provable since it refers to the fundamental reducibility of any qubit to a single bit “after measurement”. From the newly introduced viewpoint, the zeta function is \"physically\" continued also at its single pole therefore tracing its interpretation by means of the Noether (1918) first theorem. Its application for proving Riemann’s hypothesis is sketched in order to be elaborated in the next, second part of the study.",

However, there is mixed evidence demonstrating that teachers hold lower expectations for immigrant students. We argue that the existence and strength of this relationship may depend on the framing effect of contextual settings. To establish this, we use data from the German National Educational Panel Study and analyze (1) whether teachers’ expectations of their elementary school students are influenced by students’ immigrant background; and (2) how this effect varies with the immigrant classroom composition, local neighborhood demographics, and teachers’ own immigrant background. Using multilevel panel models, we find negative associations between students’ immigrant, particularly Turkish, background and teachers’ expectations. These associations remain significant even when accounting for students’ aspirations and performance but disappear when accounting for students’ social background. However, we observe that the negative relationship between students’ immigrant background and teachers’ expectations remains robust and stable in contexts in which the immigrant category is salient, particularly in classrooms with high concentrations of immigrant students. We conclude that both research and educational practice could benefit from taking greater account of the contextualized formation of teachers’ stereotypes.",

El enfoque agentivo se adhiere a la tesis de que la cognición no se reduce a las funciones del cerebro, sino que es coextensiva a la capacidad de actuar, esto es, si hay acción entonces hay cognición y, por tanto, el sentido emerge de la relación de un agente con su entorno (enacción). Se plantea que la noción de agencia aumentada—la incorporación de artefactos para mejorar la realización de las acciones—es un rasgo distintivo de la especie humana y que la capacidad de diseñar artefactos se distingue de la elaboración de objetos naturales que realizan otros animales. Por tanto, la definición de artefacto se limita a un objeto creado por la especie humana con un propósito específico. En consecuencia, luego de hacer un balance crítico de otras propuestas, se aborda la clasificación de los artefactos bajo tres criterios: según el tipo de incorporación; según el tipo de engranamiento y según el tipo de acción que realizan los agentes. Esta tipología permite resolver categorías ambivalentes como cognitivo/pragmático y ser consecuente con el compromiso material y encarnado de la cognición, lo cual constituye un aporte a la comprensión de la naturaleza fundamentalmente aumentada de la agencia humana.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines the enduring relevance of gender as a central organizing principle in society, with a focus on the social psychological mechanisms that reproduce gender inequalities. Building on existing theory and contemporary empirical research, we discuss how gender is conceptualized as a multilevel system of social practices that structures social relations – encompassing individuals’ identities and behaviors at the micro level, social interactions at the meso level, as well as cultural beliefs and social structures and institutions, like organizations, families, and states, at the macro level. We argue that social psychological tools and understandings of how gender operates in\nsocial interaction are at the heart of the gender system. These approaches are useful because they specify, for instance, the ways in which cultural beliefs about gender influence a range of important social outcomes, such as a person’s self-concept and their decision-making, divisions of paid and unpaid labor, workplace discrimination, and the structure of organizations. Moreover, they attest to the highly contextual nature of gender interactions, showing how gendered structures are produced, sustained, and transformed overtime. By interrogating the linkages among micro-level identities, meso-level interactions, and macro-level social institutions, we provide a comprehensive overview of current theories and research and make recommendations for future research directions.",

The study explores the interplay between the lived experiences of young individuals and their environmental engagement, incorporating aspects of consumer culture and climate change. The primary goal is to gain an understanding of young people's consumption practices and subjectivities in the post-communist Bulgarian society context. The sampling comprised 13 young individuals from diverse backgrounds living in both urban and rural areas of Bulgaria. A geo-social methodological approach was used, triangulating data from mapping activities, in-depth interviews, and essays. The focus was on examining the spatial and temporal dimensions of everyday consumer practices to provide a holistic view of their subjective experiences. The key findings indicate that youth hold complex identities that are relational to intersectionality, which can differ from top-down perceptions of sustainable consumers. The study discusses how intergenerational relations, close connections with the countryside, and social spaces where online and offline practices take place, significantly shape the consumer identities of young people. By offering valuable insights into the consumption behaviours and subjectivities of Bulgarian youth, this study contributes to the existing literature by bringing a bottom-up study agenda.",

          "authors": "Tim Morris; Liam Wright; Gemma Shireby; David Bann",
          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to investigate whether the predictors of educational attainment have changed across time. Here, we provide new insights by incorporating genetic predictors of education in three nationally representative British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958 and 1970. We investigated whether individual characteristics as proxied by a polygenic index for educational attainment (EA PGI) have become more relevant to educational success over time, and whether returns to genetic endowments were moderated by early life socioeconomic background. We present three novel findings. First, the EA PGI explained a larger proportion of variation in years of education over time, rising from 5.4% for the 1946 cohort to 5.7% in the 1958 cohort and 5.9% in the 1970 cohort. Second, patterns using a PGI for cognition were in the opposite direction to those with the EA PGI; 2.1% in 1946c to 1.6% in 1958c and 1.0% in 1970c. Given that the EA PGI captures multiple traits related to educational success simultaneously, only some of which may be considered meritorious, this cautions against interpretations that reductions in the explanatory power of the EA PGI over time simply reflect increasing meritocracy. Third, we observed strong evidence of interaction: associations between the EA PGI and educational attainment were disproportionately larger amongst those from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Our findings are consistent with educational attainment being influenced by social and genetic factors both independently and jointly. Genetic liability and social background could be considered as two forms of inherited advantage which synergistically influence education attainment.",

In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

          "authors": "Peter McLaughlin; Nathan T. Barron",
          "abstract": "Members of Congress routinely seek to improve their institutional position to increase their influence over policy outcomes. Prominent among those policy outcomes is the distribution of federal spending projects, where members can simultaneously secure local particularistic spending and its consequential electoral benefits. While institutional position facilitates the receipt of these policy goods, it is less clear whether representatives' position facilitates the receipt of the associated electoral benefits. We test whether a representative's signaling of policy influence through references to committee positioning increases the effectiveness of credit claiming for particularistic spending. Using a survey experiment, we measure how respondents change their approval and effectiveness ratings for a member of Congress when presented with different versions of real-world credit claiming press releases. Overall, we find that signaling influence vis-à-vis committee positioning has an undetectable effect on the effectiveness of credit claiming. This research highlights an important challenge faced by members of Congress in publicizing their roles in favorable policy actions.",

We apply a differential exposure approach (DEA) to Danish population data collecting public-school reading comprehension tests. The approach exploits variation in children’s birth dates and test administration dates to decompose children’s learning as the product of joint exposure to school and non-school environments. Key findings reveal that children experiencing parental separation have 5-7% lower test scores, with lower learning returns to non-school environments, and diminishing learning outcomes proportional to time spent in separated households. Critically, school appears to neither mitigate nor exacerbate these achievement gaps, suggesting that degrading of non-school environments post-separation primarily impacts children's learning.",

          "abstract": "As sex workers increasingly seek clients online, and exclusively online sex work (e.g., sexual content creation) expands in popularity, it is crucial to understand and address online sex workers’ occupational health concerns. There is a particular need for research with marginalized online sex workers, including transgender/nonbinary (TNB) people. Accordingly, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 U.S.-based TNB young adults, ages 22-30 years, who had done online sex work. We triangulated interview data through focus groups with 17 clinicians and advocates. Using template-style thematic analysis, we developed themes addressing reasons for doing online sex work (five themes); stressful dynamics (six themes); fulfilling dynamics (five themes); and protective factors (two themes). Participants did online sex work for a mix of financial and personal reasons. Stressful dynamics included pressure to conform to sexual stereotypes, restrictive platform rules, and sex work stigma. Fulfilling dynamics included skill/career development, self-exploration, and opportunities to promote healthier sexual norms. Economic stability and longer-term sex work experience emerged as protective factors. Clinicians and advocates should recognize the diversity of TNB young adults’ online sex work experiences, oppose restrictive laws and platform policies, and advocate for safety net programs that help young adults maintain economic stability.",

We ask whether citizens’ satisfaction with redistricting in their state is shaped by ends (election results) or by means (type of redistricting process). Leveraging questions on the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (CES), state-level variation in redistricting processes, and 2022 election outcomes, we find that both ends and means shape the public’s satisfaction with redistricting in their state. Among respondents who correctly identified their state's redistricting process for the 2022 midterm elections, those living in a state with a redistricting commission reported greater support for redistricting than those living in a state with legislature-controlled redistricting. We also find that respondents who are represented by a co-partisan in the US House are more supportive of their state’s congressional redistricting process than both respondents who identify as Independent and respondents who are represented by an opposing party legislator. Successful electoral reforms require public buy in, and our results suggest that partisan power considerations and a lack of public knowledge about congressional redistricting present barriers to reforming state-level redistricting processes.",

However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) suggests great potential to facilitate this process. To advance AI-assisted communication research, we examined the performance of ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4) in generating message stimuli for experimental research. Through four pre-registered experiments, we compared GPT-generated stimuli with human-generated stimuli in (1) manipulating target variables (discrete emotions and moral intuitions) and (2) controlling unintended variables. We found GPT-generated message stimuli performed equivalently to or even surpassed human-generated stimuli in manipulating target variables, while the performance in controlling unintended variables was mixed. Our study suggests that LLMs can generate effective message stimuli for communication experimental research. This research serves as a foundational resource for integrating LLMs in stimuli generation across various communication contexts, with its effectiveness, opportunities and challenges discussed.",

          "abstract": "As appropriations earmarks return to Congress, every legislator faces a decision: pursue or refuse congressionally-mandated federal spending projects. This decision is likely influenced by public messaging concerns. We theorize that both credit claiming for federal projects and position-taking against spending projects (“pork busting”) can benefit legislators as they look to improve future electoral returns. We field a nationally-representative survey experiment to estimate the effect of credit claiming and pork busting messages on the perceived effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, and overall approval of an unnamed member of Congress. We find that respondents are likely to penalize the representative’s approval assessment when presented with an outparty message strategy. Conversely, respondents are likely to increase the representative’s personal trait assessments when presented with an inparty message strategy. We expand on these results in an additional analysis and find that these trends persist when controlling for other partisan and demographic factors.

          "abstract": "Wealth plays a crucial role in providing private insurance, investment opportunities, and social status, shaping citizens’ policy preferences. These preferences, in turn, influence government decisions to stabilize financial markets and protect private wealth during economic crises. However, such policies often reinforce wealth inequality, particularly benefiting asset-rich households. Using information treatment and conjoint survey experiments in Australia and the UK in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine how citizens navigate this trade-off. We find that informing respondents about the impact of financial stabilization policies on overall wealth inequality decreases support for such policies, whereas highlighting their effects on even larger wealth disparities between ethnic groups has little effect. Furthermore, respondents are more supportive of targeted policies aimed at reducing general wealth disparities than those targeting ethnic inequality. This distinction in inequality aversion underscores a key political economy challenge in addressing wealth concentration in contemporary multiethnic societies.",

However, not all presidential endorsements are beneficial to candidates at all times. For example, recent studies have shown that Donald Trump’s endorsements, in particular, had a negative impact on campaign resources during general elections. This research focuses on how presidential endorsements affect voter’s perceptions of and support for Congressional candidates. Using a preregistered survey experiment embedded in the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, we examine how respondents change ideological perceptions and support for a fictional candidate when presented with a presidential endorsement. We find that Trump endorsements carry a negative effect that is mediated by respondents’ ideological perceptions of the candidate. We corroborate these findings with observational analyses among verified voters in the 2022 midterm elections. Altogether, this paper offers a theoretical model that clarifies how this elite behavior impacts electoral decision-making.",

When measurement changes are introduced, they can have a substantial effect. We review methodological issues that affect estimates of the size of religiously unaffiliated populations and their change over time.",

However, five years later, new crises have emerged, from the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East, which have heightened security concerns across the continent, to escalating natural disasters. Amid these challenges that threaten European welfare models, a crucial question remains: Has Social Europe been reinforced in a lasting and sustainable way, or were these measures merely temporary solutions?\n\nThis paper highlights the need for strong social policies in the current era of geopolitical volatilities and sets out policy recommendations to ensure a pathway to a stronger social Europe.",

Results indicated that, depending on individuals' pro-environmental attitudes, participants were especially emotionally responsive to environmentally harmful behaviors (some positively, others negatively).

However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

The anticipated benefits of CAVs are numerous and include making transportation accessible to all, reducing accidents due to human error, optimising traffic flow, and creating new industries and job opportunities. Autonomous driving capabilities in CAVs rely on advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analytics, which process data from multiple sensors to navigate, perceive the surrounding environment, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions in real-time. Despite the many benefits, CAVs will be highly vulnerable to a wide variety of crimes unless security measures are implemented by design. To understand the potential threats, this study introduces the enabling technology and reference architecture for CAVs and reports the findings from an extensive scoping review of the available literature. This covers reported crime incidents, academic literature on potential threats, a survey of academic survey papers on CAV security, and a review of papers concerned with cyberattacks against CAVs published in the past five years. The findings from the review are complemented by the findings from a workshop with experts about which of the identified threats should be prioritised for the purposes of crime reduction. The findings indicate that a wide range of cyber-attacks and offences are possible, and that the threat landscape is continually expanding due to insufficient attention being given to security during the development of the technology. Suggestions for policy and priorities for future work are suggested.",

The findings highlight the French sinologists’ approaches to defining and classifying Chinese words, their views on the relationship between written and spoken Chinese, and insights into the syllabic and morphological features of Chinese word formation. Although their analyses were grounded in the Latin grammatical framework for pedagogical convenience, they began to break away from it, recognizing the unique features of Chinese.

Using data from the prof*panel (N=660) – a survey of recently appointed full professors in Germany – and sequence-cluster analysis, we find four academic career clusters, three of which are beyond the traditional pathway of Endurance Careers: Efficient Careers, Unconventional Careers and International Careers indicating an institutional change within German academia. Cluster affiliation is mainly related to time-to-tenure, habilitation (second thesis), working abroad and the field of the professorship. Our findings suggest that traditional career paths still play a major role, although the influence of internationalization and novel academic career steps, like junior and tenure-track positions, is growing. Furthermore, less conventional career paths, attract a higher proportion of women and are characterized by international mobility and more diverse professional experiences. The insights of our study underscore the ongoing changes in the landscape of academic careers and highlight both persistent challenges and new opportunities for aspiring professors.",
