          "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to veterinary diagnostics, its\nreal-world implementation faces a unique set of challenges. Unlike in human healthcare where\nAI systems are developed under structured regulations and validated using large, standardized\ndatasets, veterinary medicine operates with less regulatory oversight, more heterogeneous data,\nand fewer resources. These conditions hinder the development of trustworthy, generalizable, and\nethically sound AI tools.\nThis scoping review critically examines the current landscape of AI in veterinary\ndiagnostics, with a focus on the conceptual and technical challenges that impact its clinical\nadoption. To map the landscape and refine our search strategy, we initially conducted a manual\nexploratory search, followed by a systematic search in PubMed Central, which identified studies\npublished as early as 2013 through June 2025. After screening using AI-assisted methods\nfollowed by manual review, sixty-three articles met the inclusion criteria and were used for this\nreview.\nOur analysis categorized challenges in adopting AI in veterinary diagnostics into three\ngroups: data acquisition, model development, and implementation. Issues such as limited data\nwere explicitly acknowledged by most articles, while lack of transparency and external\nvalidation were identified as the most common potential limitations. We also highlight possible\nsolutions to support more responsible and effective clinical adoption.",

          "title": "Contextual Pointers and Sensory Codes in Working Memory: Toward a Hierarchical Framework",
          "authors": "Hyung-Bum Park",
          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "authors": "Steve Rathje; Clara Pretus; James Kunling He; Trisha Harjani; Jon Roozenbeek; Kurt Gray; Sander van der Linden; Jay Joseph Van Bavel",
          "abstract": "There is considerable debate over whether and how social media contributes to polarization. Research suggests that a small number of hyperpartisan “influencers,” or highly followed accounts, produce the vast majority of misinformation and toxic content. Yet, little is known about the long-term causal effects of exposure to these influencers. In a correlational study (n1 = 1,447) and two digital field experiments (n2 = 494, n3 = 1,133), we examined whether (un)following hyperpartisan social media influencers contributes to polarization and misinformation sharing. We found that incentivizing Twitter/X users to unfollow hyperpartisan social media influencers improved their recent feelings toward the out-party by 23.5% compared to the control group, with effects persisting for at least six months. Unfollowing also led participants to engage with more accurate news accounts, increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X feeds, and reduced the amount of political content they reported seeing a full year later—without reducing engagement. By contrast, incentivizing users to follow accounts that tweeted about science improved well-being. Additionally, we found that, after Elon’s Musk purchased Twitter/X and made several platform changes, participants used Twitter/X less frequently, viewed their feeds as less reliable, and posted lower quality news. Our results demonstrate the long-term, causal impact of repeated exposure to hyper-partisan influencers on attitudes and behavior. They also illustrate that the behavior and experience of Twitter/X users changed substantially after Elon Musk’s purchase of the platform, revealing the potential impact of social media design changes. Our work has implications for interventions that can be made by platforms or by individuals seeking to curate their social media experience. Unlike other social media reduction interventions, unfollowing is a targeted approach: like a scalpel, it surgically removes a few harmful parts of one’s feed, allowing the beneficial aspects to remain.",

          "abstract": "Environmental sensitivity, measured by the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) Scale, influences how individuals react psychologically to life events and various environments. Previous research indicates that environmental features impact emotional responses, yet few studies have focused on how these effects vary among those with higher HSP traits. This study explored the moderating role of HSP and its subscales—Ease of Excitation (EoE), Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), and Low Sensory Threshold (LST)—in relation to outdoor environmental exposures and emotional states. Findings revealed that HSP, EoE, and LST significantly moderated responses to social cues related to safety. Individuals with higher HSP scores experienced more positive emotions in safe, orderly environments with positive social interactions. However, AES did not show significant moderation, though those with higher aesthetic sensitivity reported better emotional responses in urban parks. Overall, the results suggest HSP traits reflect sensitivity to social rather than physical environmental factors.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Youth often report difficulties coping during suicide crises (Czyz et al., 2016). However, the responses that youth employ to manage suicidal ideation (SI) are underexplored. This study developed a new measure to quantify how youth with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs) respond to their SI, and conducted an initial evaluation of the measure’s psychometric properties. \n\nMethods: Using inductive and deductive approaches, we developed a preliminary item set (n = 79) for the Response to Suicide Ideation Inventory (RSII). Thereafter, 491 participants (Mage = 22.0, SDage = 3.3, 18-29 years old), completed the RSII, as well as questionnaires assessing the RSII’s content validity, general coping, emotion dysregulation, history of STBs, reasons for living, and future expectations of engaging in STBs. \n\nResults: Results from an exploratory factor analysis indicated that a 43-item, seven-factor solution was an appropriate fit to the data. The RSII and its subscales showed acceptable reliability, as well as preliminary content validity. The RSII’s subscales also demonstrated medium-sized positive correlations with measures of general coping, and weak associations with emotion dysregulation, suicide resilience, and expectations of future STBs. \n\nConclusions: Our results point to some important directions for refining the RSII. Exploring the range and types of responses youth engage in to manage their SI may improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, fluctuations in SI severity.",

The present study investigates differences between appraisals of the self, favorite fictional characters, and close real others, and the relationship between these appraisals and self-esteem. Participants (N = 265) rated themselves and their chosen real and fictional targets on likable and unlikable traits, then completed a measure of self-esteem. Appraisals of self and close real others were more favorable than appraisals of favorite fictional characters. Self-esteem was more strongly associated with self-appraisals than with appraisals of non-self targets. Differences between unlikable self and real other appraisals interacted with unlikable self and character appraisal differences in predicting self-esteem: Less unlikable appraisals of close real others compared to self-appraisals were predictive of lower self-esteem. Results suggest that fictional characters offer opportunities for self-enhancement not always afforded by real others.",

          "authors": "Lillian Michelle Hearne; Roger Thornton Dean; Andrew J Milne",
          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

          "abstract": "Mindset (beliefs about the malleability of intelligence) has been studied in a variety of contexts for decades. Recent research highlights the importance of contextual factors in moderating mindset’s impact on student outcomes. The commonly-used original mindset measure is context-general. Recently, a mindset measure that is specific to science and math undergraduates was developed: the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) Survey. I hypothesized that a context-specific measure of mindset would associate more strongly with undergraduates’ outcomes than a context-general measure. I surveyed 1,537 undergraduates with Dweck’s 3-item original mindset measure, ULTrA, and measures of outcomes (sense of belonging, goal orientation, self-handicapping, evaluative concern and intent to persist in science) and collected course grades. Structural equation modeling indicated that the fixed factor of the ULTrA exhibited stronger and more consistent relationships with outcomes than the 3-item original mindset measure and predicted unique variance in outcomes above and beyond what the original mindset measure accounted for. The academic outcomes (intent to persist and course grade) were significantly related to ULTrA, but not the original mindset measure. Our results provide evidence that the context-specific ULTrA survey can detect relationships with undergraduate outcomes that the context-general original mindset measure can fail to detect.",

          "abstract": "The effectiveness of both blocked and interleaved training regimes in human learning has been \ndemonstrated across various tasks and conditions. While recent research suggests that blocked \ntraining may support task representation separation and reduce interference in humans, neural \nnetworks tend to benefit more from interleaved training. This study investigates whether \ninterleaved training can also support continual learning in humans when consolidation through \nsleep is possible. Participants learned three tasks under either a blocked or interleaved regime \nacross two experiments: Experiment 1 used non-semantic contextual cues presented before the \nstimulus, and Experiment 2 used semantically meaningful contextual cues presented after the \nstimulus. Tests were conducted immediately and after 24 hours in an interleaved format. In \nExperiment 1, the blocked regime outperformed the interleaved group during learning, but this \nadvantage did not persist in testing. In Experiment 2, the blocked regime maintained higher \naccuracy across both learning and test phases. No sleep-related improvements in performance \nwere observed for the interleaved groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, recurrent neural \nnetworks trained on participant data did suggest an increase in task separation after sleep, but \nthis was not associated with improvements in task performance, nor was it specific to the \ninterleaved condition. Together, these findings suggest that blocked training or sleep alone do not \nensure superior continual learning, which is further determined by the timing and semantic nature \nof contextual cues.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that contingency instructions (CI), stating that the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) will not be presented anymore, can enhance extinction learning, and additional CI before extinction retrieval can reduce the return of fear. However, immediate pre-retrieval instructions are impractical in therapeutic settings. Thus, this study investigated the impact of CI before and/or after extinction training on extinction learning in 240 participants (120 patients with anxiety disorders (ADs), 120 healthy controls) using a three-day sequential conditioning paradigm. Electrical shocks and colored lamps served as UCS and conditioned stimuli (CS), with skin conductance responses (SCRs), CS valence, and UCS expectancy ratings as readout measures. CI before extinction training enhanced extinction learning for both patients with ADs and healthy controls across the physiological and subjective measures. Instructed healthy controls displayed even lower SCRs than instructed patients during early extinction. Furthermore, participants receiving post-extinction CI showed reduced CS differentiation in their SCRs during extinction retrieval. After a reinstatement, instruction timing differentially affected fear responses across contexts. Participants instructed before and after extinction, and uninstructed participants showed higher fear responses in the original conditioning context. Those instructed only before extinction exhibited increased fear responses in extinction and novel contexts, while participants instructed only after extinction showed heightened fear responses exclusively in the extinction context. The findings highlight how the timing of providing contingency information shapes fear learning and memory.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are no longer passive information filters but active participants in shaping human cognition. This paper introduces AI-Mediated Cognitive Distortions (AI-MCDs) and Digital Echo Delusions (DEDs) as emergent phenomena at the intersection of human biases and generative AI. We propose the Resonant Amplification Framework (RAF) to explain how small cognitive tendencies can be amplified into entrenched distortions of belief through four recursive phases: Anthropomorphic Priming, Confirmation Alignment, Linguistic Reinforcement, and Perceptual Displacement. Unlike traditional echo chambers, AI systems not only reflect but co-produce content, generating iterative resonance that is more powerful and self-sustaining.\n\nWe distinguish DEDs from clinical delusions by emphasizing their phenomenological similarity but contextual reversibility—AI-induced distortions weaken when interaction ceases, unlike pathological delusions. The paper outlines empirical pathways for testing RAF (e.g., trust and vigilance measures, dialogue analysis, repetition effects, resistance to correction) and proposes practical safeguards in the form of “cognitive circuit breakers”—design principles aimed at disrupting harmful feedback loops.\n\nBy naming and conceptualizing these phenomena, the study establishes a foundation for cognitive science, AI ethics, and human–AI interaction research. It urges interdisciplinary collaboration to preserve users’ affective and epistemic sovereignty, ensuring that AI serves as a constructive amplifier of knowledge rather than a distorting echo of illusion.\n\nKeywords: AI-Mediated Cognitive Distortions (AI-MCDs), Digital Echo Delusions (DEDs), Resonant Amplification Framework (RAF), cognitive bias, confirmation bias, illusory truth effect, anthropomorphism, echo chambers, epistemic vigilance, human-AI interaction, AI ethics, cognitive sovereignty.",

Alternatively, we argue that the feeling of control over one’s life could be rooted in conservative behavior and avoidance of risky agentic strategies. Using WVS cross-country data we show that the link between locus of control and conservative behavior has a U-shaped form, while the optimal level of locus of control depends on the degree of environmental uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "People can draw two inferences about themselves when a task or goal feels hard to think about: “This is important to me, worthwhile” (difficulty-as-importance) and “This is not for me, a waste of time” (difficulty-as-impossibility). Identity-based motivation theory makes three predictions that have not been directly tested: First, people make both inferences (ecological validity). Second, endorsement varies across people and situations (trait-state) and matters for self-perception and action (consequential). Third, unambiguous contexts (context) shift momentary endorsements. We address this gap using validated difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scales across five studies (N = 2,746), finding support for each prediction. Ecological validity: people recall making both inferences a few times a month (Study 1, N=986 undergraduates). Trait-state: difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scores differ between persons and fluctuate within-persons (Study 2, three time-points, N=733 middle schoolers and high schoolers; Study 4, N=260 undergraduates, n=2,789 two-week daily diaries). Consequential: trait difficulty-as-impossibility predicts later preference for easier tasks (Study 3, N=216 undergraduates); trait difficulty-as-importance predicts daily meaningful engagement with school (Study 4). Daily fluctuations in both are associated with daily self-esteem, self-compassion, and goal self-efficacy (Study 4).

          "abstract": "Background: Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to community resilience across the ASEAN region, with the Philippines serving as a critical case for investigating links between environmental stressors and community mental health. This meta-analysis and systematic review examine how community-based mental health interventions strengthen climate resilience within disaster risk reduction and resilient infrastructure frameworks.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched eight databases for literature published between 2010 and 2025. Quantitative synthesis used Review Manager (v5.4) and R (v4.4.3); qualitative analysis used MAXQDA (2020). GRADE assessment evaluated the certainty of evidence across primary outcomes.\n\nResults: Thirty-two studies (N=45,247) revealed substantial climate-related mental health impacts: pooled PTSD prevalence 35.2% (95% CI 28.6-42.1), depression 18.4% (95% CI 14.7-22.8), and anxiety 31.8% (95% CI 25.3-39.1). Meta-regression revealed that disaster type explained 45% of the heterogeneity variance (p &lt; 0.01). Protective community factors significantly reduced the mental health burden, including social networks (OR=0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.52), collective efficacy (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.29-0.49), and cultural practices (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.75). Infrastructure-integrated psychosocial support centers demonstrated 60% greater effectiveness in intervention compared to standalone programs (p &lt; 0.001). Women, children, and indigenous communities experienced disproportionate impacts, requiring targeted interventions.\n\nConclusions: Climate-induced mental health impacts require coordinated regional responses within integrated disaster risk reduction frameworks. Aligning with the Sendai Framework priorities, the findings support community-centered, culturally adapted interventions that combine immediate psychosocial support with resilient infrastructure development. ASEAN collaborative strategies are essential for strengthening community mental health systems and advancing Sustainable Development Goals through multi-hazard approaches.",

          "abstract": "Purpose:  \nIntolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with poorer emotional wellbeing and worse \nprognosis of chronic physical health and pain conditions (CHPCs). Our current understanding of \nIU in CHPCs is siloed within the literatures on specific CHPCs. However, IU is consistently \nidentified as a risk factor for anxiety and depressive disorders. In this exploratory study, we used \na mixed methods design to better understand the role of IU and anxiety in people’s (n = 139) \nlived experiences of their CHPCs and how they respond to uncertainty across health and \neveryday contexts.  \n\nPrimary Results:  \nHigher acceptance of illness and perceived social support were related to lower IU and anxiety \namong people with CHPCs. Higher IU and anxiety were also related to lower scores on many \ndomains of quality of life. Our reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes: 1) \ndistressing ambiguous contexts are not limited to health scenarios and require management in \ndiverse ways; 2) interference of CHPCs affects multiple domains of life beyond physical health; \n3) navigating uncertainty for a chronic period changes coping abilities and identity development; \nand 4) responsivity to uncertainty is a multifaceted cognitive-behavioural and emotional\nphysiological response that hinders or promotes coping.  \n\nConclusions:  \nIU significantly impacts the lives of those with CHPCs and holds potential as a transdiagnostic \ntarget for early prevention and intervention. By tailoring therapeutic approaches to acknowledge \nthe importance of health-related cues while increasing tolerance of uncertainty, people with \nCHPCs will likely experience improved prognosis, wellbeing, and fulfillment.  \n\nKeywords: intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, chronic health, chronic pain, transdiagnostic, \ncontext, mixed-methods",

          "abstract": "Machiavellianism (Mach) is a personality trait characterized by cold rationality, cynicism, duplicity, and the strategic and egotistical pursuit of goals. Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability and high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports. Furthermore, the nomological network of the M4 aligned in several respects with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach. However, some unexpected associations suggested the need to refine the conceptualization of Mach regarding its relationship with certain forms of impulsivity and neuroticism. Commonality analyses further indicated that the M4 predicted incentivized cheating behavior better than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 holds promise for advancing the assessment of Mach.",

We assessed children’s visual vocabulary knowledge in a game where children heard a word (e.g., “swordfish”) and had to choose a matching picture. Distractors were chosen to vary in their linguistic similarity to each target word in a multimodal language model. We collected data from a large sample of children (N = 3575, 3–14 year olds) and adults (N = 211 adults) and found gradual changes over developmental age ranges in participants’ ability to identify the image that a word referred to. When children made errors, younger children were more likely to choose unrelated distractors than older children; error patterns were best explained by combining linguistic and visual similarity. These results highlight that children have partial knowledge about many visual concepts and document a transition from coarse to finer-grained representations.",

          "abstract": "Dogs have ascended to core family members in American households. Across three studies, we show that modern dogs now occupy roles historically reserved for close human relationships and often receive greater moral concern than people. Approximately three out of four dog owners view their dogs as primary sources of emotional support and companionship, and this “soulmate” bond is associated with a tendency to prefer and prioritize dogs over people. Childless dog owners are especially likely to view their dog as a soulmate, and national and county-level analyses further reveal that declining birth rates are strongly associated with increased pet-related spending. This suggests that dogs may fulfill caregiving roles once reserved for children and close kin. To assess the implications of this shift, we presented dog owners with moral dilemmas pitting the welfare of dogs against humans. Owners who viewed their dogs as soulmates were more likely to feed, fund, and save the life of a dog over a person. More than half of dog owners chose to save their dog over a human stranger, one in five chose to save an unfamiliar puppy over a person, and one in four chose to give money to a puppy in need over a child in need. The moral elevation of dogs may reflect—and potentially contribute to—declines in human social connection.",

          "abstract": "Attentional processes are crucial to ensure successful reading, and theories of dyslexia propose that dysfunctional attention networks may contribute to the observed reading deficits. The goals of this study were to localize a region of the frontal-eye-field (FEF) involved in both reading and attention and examine its connectivity with regions in the reading and attention networks, given the known role of the FEF in attentional processes and theorized role in reading. In Experiment 1, we revisited the results of our previous hybrid reading and attention study (Ekstrand, Neudorf, Kress, &amp; Borowsky., 2019). We observed a significant reading × attention interaction in BOLD intensity in the FEF, specifically the ventrolateral portion of Brodmann’s Area 6 (A6vl). In Experiment 2, we used Human Connectome Project diffusion tensor imaging data to examine the connectivity profile of the FEF-A6vl. We observed high communicability between the A6vl and basal ganglia (which plays a role in rhythm during syllabic processing). These connections support tract clusters which terminated in the cerebellar Crus I/II (which play roles in eye movements and semantics) and cerebral superior parietal lobule (which plays a role in attentional orienting and phonetic decoding). The results of this study elucidate the reading × attention interaction in the FEF-A6vl, and may have implications for developing treatments to improve reading in individuals with dyslexia.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent attempts to dismantle diversity initiatives in the US, many people and organizations continue to advocate for diversity. However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

          "abstract": "Elected officials are increasingly extreme. Research trying to understand this trend has tended to focus on structural factors, such as primary elections and changes in the supply of candidates. Less emphasis has been placed on psychological perspectives. The current research advances such a perspective. Leveraging research on attitudes, we investigate when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their own party. We posit that the identity relevance of people’s attitudes plays a key role. Specifically, we propose that identity relevance fosters attitude extremity, which in turn promotes a preference for extreme over moderate candidates. Across six main studies (N = 3,136) using a variety of political issues, operationalizations of identity relevance, instantiations of candidate extremity, and experimental paradigms (including two studies with human-LLM interactions), we find support for this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that as attitudes become more identity relevant, they become more extreme, leading individuals to prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their party. These results shed light on when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates, contribute to a nascent literature on the identity relevance of people’s attitudes, and advance our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of attitude extremity.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces scale2fit, a framework for evaluating multiple factors affecting vowels’ acoustic properties jointly, which proves useful for vowel normalization and avoiding over-normalization. The acoustic properties of vowels stem from a combination of multiple factors including the intended vowel quality, vocal tract length, coarticulation, and speech rate. However, most current vowel normalization approaches do not distinguish among the different determinants. Scale2fit uses mixed effects models to jointly evaluate multiple factors, avoiding their conflation in vowel normalization. Study 1 shows that the new method excels in a series of comparisons with other normalization methods. Study 2 shows that the proposed framework excels at preserving vowel space reduction that follows from short duration, and is therefore more appropriate for studying vowel space reduction. Finally, Study 3 shows that it is possible to establish variety norms and add speakers incrementally",

          "abstract": "The Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) method is a structured approach to theory development in which domain experts collaboratively identify causal relationships between variables. However, CLD construction is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and cognitively demanding. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their advanced text processing capabilities and extensive knowledge base, offer the potential to support theory construction and reduce workload. This paper presents theoraizer, an R package and Shiny app that enhances CLD construction by integrating LLMs as a digital extension of the expert group. Researchers can use theoraizer to define a list of putative variables, then query an LLM to evaluate candidate causal links between these variables and provide supporting literature. Rather than replacing expert judgment, theoraizer functions as a thinking partner, helping researchers assess causal relationships and construct proto-theories. We describe how LLMs can be used to automate key steps in CLD construction and demonstrate empirically that agreement between theoraizer and human experts is comparable to the agreement observed between experts themselves. This suggests that LLMs can reliably assist in identifying putative causal structures, making the theory-building process more efficient. In addition to improving efficiency by quickly generating an initial candidate CLD, theoraizer supports creativity in the modeling process by suggesting alternative perspectives and highlighting variables or relationships that may have been overlooked. By combining the CLD method with the generative capabilities of LLMs, theoraizer drastically reduces the work required to arrive at a candidate CLD and provides users with a standardized, multi-stage framework for constructing CLDs that support early-stage theory development.",

We trained and evaluated models using nested cross-validation. Median posterior auROC was high (0.85–0.91) for all models but decreased modestly with increasing lag. Models performed worse for non-advantaged groups (non-White and/or Hispanic, below poverty, female). Past alcohol use, abstinence self-efficacy, and craving were the most important features, with the magnitude of importance varying meaningfully by lag. These findings demonstrate feasibility of predicting next-day lapses up to two weeks in advance.

Using Bayesian statistics, we found cumulative evidence that when support givers used higher pitch in delivering these reappraisals, targets of support experienced less negative affect. Targets of support also reported greater relationship satisfaction with support givers who used higher pitch during reappraisal. These data consisted primarily of women friend pairs, with preliminary results indicating that these associations may not hold in men friendships.

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) has emerged as a promising intervention for conditions such as depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders by enhancing the therapeutic potential of psychedelics with structured psychological support during preparation, dosing, and integration phases. Despite encouraging trial results, evidence for therapeutic mechanisms and optimal frameworks for PAP remain in nascent stages. We explore candidate therapies and frameworks for PAP. Concurrently, clinical science is shifting toward process-based therapy (PBT; Hofmann &amp; Hayes, 2019), which targets core transdiagnostic processes rather than disorder-specific protocols. While previous reviews of multiple mechanisms (e.g., Yaden et al., 2022) and disorder-specific papers (e.g., Sloshower et al., 2020) have identified key processes to target in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, this review introduces PBT and situates candidate mechanisms—such as psychological flexibility, emotion regulation, and decentering—within its framework. We explore how PBT principles can inform each phase of PAP, providing an idiographic, process-driven approach. Treatment strategies are selected based on functional analyses, case conceptualization, patient preferences, and qualitative and quantitative data collected throughout the treatment process. By moving away from specific brands of treatment, and instead integrating a PBT approach within PAP, we propose a novel, empirically grounded paradigm for optimizing therapeutic outcomes in this emergent field.",

          "abstract": "Environmental factors can have profound influences on biological systems, particularly through their effects on epigenetic processes. Epigenetics provides a powerful framework for understanding the regulation of gene expression through the interplay between genetic predispositions, inherited epigenetic marks, and lifelong environmental influences. Drawing on the “butterfly effect” metaphor from chaos theory, this review proposes that even subtle epigenetic changes may initiate cascading effects on gene regulation and biological systems, ultimately contributing to significant phenotypic outcomes, including the modification of developmental trajectories, disease susceptibility, and adaptive responses. The reversible and adaptable nature of epigenetic modifications enables organisms to respond dynamically to a wide range of stimuli throughout their lifespan. Conversely, maladaptive epigenetic regulation can be associated with pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and adverse mental health outcomes. Thus, epigenetic markers represent a promising target for risk prediction, prevention and therapeutic intervention. In this review, we discuss the wide-ranging implications of epigenetic theories underlying gene-environment interactions. Furthermore, we examine the evolving expectations of the scientific community and the public regarding epigenetic theories, which may shape future research directions and drive therapeutic innovation in health and disease. Epigenetic concepts are poised to bridge the gap between genetic predispositions and environmental influences, offering novel insights into complex biological processes and their outcomes.",

          "abstract": "When an action does not yield the sensory action effect associated with it, prediction error (PE) signals are generated. The present study investigates auditory event-related potential (ERP) markers of PE for violations of strong action-effect couplings as a function of whether the participants’ intention focuses on a particular action or a particular action effect. Participants produced high- and low-pitched tones by left and right button presses according to a pattern of visual stimuli. While the instruction as well as the action and tone sequences produced by the participants were identical, the type of intention induced by the visual symbols differed (in a between-subject design): In the action-effect intention group, the pattern consisted of “notes” (for high/low pitch), in the action intention group it consisted of “letters” (for left/right button-press). Occasionally, a button-press did not produce the associated sensory action effect. These incongruent sounds elicited an enhanced auditory N1 compared to congruent sounds in the “notes” but not the “letters” group which we interpret as PE signal. Actions selected by the intended action effect in the “notes” group presumably induced a predictive sensory representation of the action outcome, its violation resulting in an early PE at the level of the auditory N1. N2b and P3 were elicited in both groups. This suggests that the respective action-effect couplings were represented, and their violation processed at a conceptual level also in the “letters” group. These results support theories postulating that event representations bind together features of stimuli, actions, and associated outcomes.",

Such models have been used\nacross domains in cognitive science to build integrative theories of phenomena like\ncategorization, recognition, and attentional learning. Many of these models, however, were\ndeveloped to account for data from visual tasks, so it remains unclear whether the same\nmechanisms apply in the auditory domain. Thus, theories of, for example, auditory memory have\nnot benefited from modeling techniques to the same extent as have theories of visual memory. To\naddress this gap, we illustrate how a cognitive model that was originally developed in the visual\ndomain, the Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (EBRW; Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), can\nnonetheless account for choice and response time in recognition of novel auditory timbres. We\ndo so by using the EBRW to couple stimulus representations derived from multidimensional\nscaling to a process by which recognition decisions are made by accumulating evidence that\ndepends on similarity.

These effects were accommodated by\nthe Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), extending prior work\n(Visscher et al., 2007) to show that recognition memory and similarity perception for static\nstimuli in the auditory domain are fundamentally like those for static stimuli in the visual\ndomain—though particularly strong recency effects in the auditory domain suggest the influence\nof an additional sensory representation like echoic memory. We conclude by discussing how the\nstimuli introduced in this article can be used as “building blocks” to test hypotheses about\nperception and memory for complex, naturalistic sounds such as speech or music while retaining\ntight experimental control.",

          "abstract": "Individuals are motivated to increase their social status (1). To succeed in this pursuit, people must make inferences about the structure of their social networks, monitor group norms, and adjust their behavior strategically. This study employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods in a sample of 92 college students belonging to 9 social groups to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these processes and their relationship to conformity in the context of alcohol use. When young adults passively looked at faces of their real-life social network peers, brain systems implicated in valuation and social cognition spontaneously represented information about the popularity and leadership status of the social target. Individual differences in these neural valuations were systematically associated with varying levels of conformity to group drinking norms in everyday life. Students who had stronger responses to faces of peers with relatively higher popularity and leadership status than themselves in one key valuation brain region, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), were more likely to align their behavior with their groups’ drinking norms in daily life. These results provide novel evidence for how brain systems involved in valuation and social cognition track multidimensional (popularity and leadership) information about real-life social networks and contribute to a growing literature on the neural mechanisms through which social comparison processes shape conformity (2). Our study highlights the vmPFC as a central hub that spontaneously tracks differences between the self and peers and uses this information to guide behavior to match group norms.",

          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective human-robot interaction remains challenging as robots often fail to engage social cognition the same way human partners do. Here, we examined the degree to which physical features impact the degree to which robots are being perceived as agents ‘with a mind’. For that purpose, we took all robot stimuli currently contained in the Anthropomorphic Robot Database (ABOT; n = 251) and examined the degree to which they trigger mind perception (N = 300). Consistent with prior findings, robots were generally attributed more agency (capacity to act and plan) than experience (capacity to sense and feel). Body components significantly explained variance in the perception of agency, especially in interaction with facial features; for experience, on the other hand, variance was significantly explained by body components, face and surface details. Increasing human-likeness boosted perceptions of both dimensions, but the trajectories differed: experience followed a cubic function, plateauing at medium levels of human-likeness, while agency followed a quartic function with a dip around 75% human-likeness—a pattern resembling the un-canny valley. Our results indicate that in order to create specific levels of agency (e.g., for surgery robots) and experience (e.g., for companion robots), a general increase of human-likeness might not suffice; instead, targeted design of individual physical features is crucial for convey-ing specific mental capacities. Our ratings linking physical robot features to dimensions of mind perception are made available, offering a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers to experimentally manipulate perceptions of agency and experience.",

          "abstract": "More than half of the children and adolescents worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect or bullying) whilst growing up. Childhood adversity is among the strongest predictors of mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. Yet, some individuals show resilient functioning, meaning they have good mental health and well-being despite their exposure to childhood adversity. Childhood adversity is thought to affect mental health through its impact on neurocognitive functioning, for example through blunted social feedback learning and biased emotion and threat processing. The neurocognitive social transactional model suggests that such childhood adversity related neurocognitive functioning may ultimately lead to reductions in the quality and quantity of social relations and increases in stressful experiences with peers over time, increasing the risk for mental health problems. However, empirical evidence to support this theoretical framework is scarce. Therefore, the longitudinal Towards Health and Resilience in Volatile Environments (THRIVE) study is set out to investigate the dynamics of psychological, social, and neurobiological mechanisms underlying mental health functioning in adolescents aged 18-24 years with a history of childhood adversity.\n\nThe ongoing THRIVE study aims to recruit 288 participants aged 18-24 years who retrospectively self-report childhood adversity (current N=220). This longitudinal neuroimaging study consists of 6 sessions including an in-unit session, during which participants undergo extensive testing including salivary cortisol measures, emotion labelling measures, as well as functional neuroimaging (whilst completing the Montreal Imaging Stress Task and the Social Feedback Learning Task). In the longitudinal part of the study, participants fill out online questionnaires at 5 time points (i.e. every three months) to map the dynamics and associations of social support, mental health, and stressful events, over time. Using the data collected at the in-unit session, we aim to test whether childhood adversity is associated with biased emotion processing, blunted feedback learning and enhanced stress responses, while social support may moderate these effects (i.e. ‘social stress buffering’). The longitudinal component of the THRIVE study allows us to test our hypothesis that mental health problems arise because childhood adversity shapes neurocognitive functioning in a way that, over time, reduces social support and increases social stress. By unravelling how social functioning contributes to resilient functioning after childhood adversity, the THRIVE study will aid crucial knowledge and ultimately help intervention and prevention efforts.\n\nThe THRIVE study has been approved by The Medical Ethics Committee Leiden - The Hague - Delft (NL80017.058.21) on July 5th, 2022  and has been co-created with the Augeo Youth Task Force (a panel of young adults with childhood adversity, https://www.augeo.nl/jongerentaskforce). The Augeo Youth Task Force is involved in every step of the empirical cycle to make sure the perspective and knowledge of young people with childhood adversity are incorporated. The results of the THRIVE study will be disseminated through preprints, peer-reviewed scientific publications, scientific presentations, media and public outreach.",

However, insight into how to adequately measure engagement in these activities is a necessary precursor. \nA rapid scoping review was performed to search relevant articles on PubMed. The aim was to obtain an initial understanding of (a) how cognitive and social activities are measured in research that investigates protective activities against dementia and (b) to explore to what extent this aligns with the operationalization in preventive interventions. \nThe findings show that across 58 studies, questionnaires were mostly used to measure engagement in cognitive and social activities. A wide variety of items and themes was observed across studies, including: arts and crafts; clubs, groups, and communities; exercising; games and puzzles; going out; household tasks; learning and education; making music; multimedia usage; reading; socializing; work/volunteering; writing. There were considerable variations in the number and content of items, ulitized response scales, recall periods, and methods to compose scores. Additionally, preventive interventions stongly focused on psychoeducation and (computerized) cognitive training, which limitedly reflect the activities operationalized in questionnaires.\nMany researchers investigate the protective effects of cognitive or social activities against dementia but measure and promote these concepts completely differently. This results in fragmented insights into what activities are protective. Clarifying precisely what these concepts entail, and which aspects are relevant to measure would support the development of measurement instructions as well as interventions to promote relevant activities.\n\nKeywords: Dementia, Cognition, Social Participation, Cognitive Activities, Social Activities",

It consists of almost four hours of eye-movements. Ten participants fixated different targets designed to induce saccades, fixations, and smooth pursuits. Ground truth was established by designing stimuli that prevent fixations and smooth pursuits to co-occur, and separating them from saccades by their velocity. Here we make available both the raw data and offer a convenient way for preprocessing and assigning ground truth labels in the form of a companion package in Python.

          "abstract": "Offloading tasks to artificial agents, such as ChatGPT, has become commonplace, yet little research examined offloading of attentionally demanding tasks. Prior work investigating how humans offload attentional demands to algorithms and humans found that people prefer an equal split of attentional demands when interacting with other humans but not when interacting with algorithms. The question arises how offloading decisions are made when interacting with embodied AI in form of a social robot with human-like characteristics: Would they treat it in the same way as a human or like an algorithm? To investigate this question, participants performed an attentionally demanding task (i.e., the multiple object tracking task, MOT), which they could (partially or fully) offload to the social robot MAKI, whose task accuracy was either known (Experiment 1) or unknown (Experiment 2) to the participants. In both experiments, participants offloaded a significant number of the tracking load to the robot, which improved the participants’ own tracking accuracy; knowing the robot’s task accuracy, on the other hand, did not impact offloading behavior or performance gains. Interestingly, participants did not split attentional demands equally with the robot –like they do with human interaction partners– aligning with results from previous studies when humans offloaded attentional demands to algorithms. Questionnaire data indicates that this might be due participants perceiving the robot as rather machine-like. In conclusion, our results indicate that when it comes to cognitive offloading behavior, a social robot is treated similarly to an algorithm rather than a human interaction partner.",

          "abstract": "Since learning to read involves associating letter shapes with how they sound, it is widely believed that children become familiar with letter shapes when they start learning their sounds or start writing them down. However, since printed letters are often available in the environment, it is possible that children are already familiar with letter shapes. Here, we provide evidence for this intriguing possibility. We tested 300 children at the beginning of formal reading instruction of the Indian language Kannada. Each child performed four tasks: (1) a letter familiarity task in which they saw upright and inverted versions of each letter, and had to identify the more familiar orientation; (2) a letter recognition task where they had to name letters shown sequentially; (3) a visual search task where they had to find an oddball letter among identical other letters, with letters either all upright or inverted; and (4) a rapid automatized naming task where they had to name digits. Our main finding is that, despite showing wide variation in letter naming, children were highly familiar with letter orientation. This effect was present even on letters that children did not recognize at all. This familiarity with letter orientation also gave them a letter processing advantage: children searched faster when letters were upright than when they were inverted. Our findings reveal a far deeper knowledge of print among early readers than previously observed, and provide empirical support for early exposure to print as a strategy to jump-start reading acquisition.",

Some countries enforce\nschool phone bans, while others (e.g., England), have guidance promoting “phone-free\nenvironments” but no legal mandate. There is limited evidence on the benefits of such policies,\nincluding whether they promote safeguarding.\n\nMethods. We used Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to investigate the relationship\nbetween smartphone policies and digital safeguarding incidents in 114 schools in England\n(&gt;90,000 pupils). We examined the prevalence and content of phone policies during the\n2023/24 academic year and digital incident reporting.\n\nResults. Only 53% (60/114) of schools had a phone policy. Policy content varied significantly,\nwith inconsistent use of “ban” terminology. Digital safeguarding incidents made up only 4.9%\n(4183/85,540) of all incidents but varied substantially (&gt;10% in 36/114 schools; &gt;25% in 9),\nsuggesting inconsistent reporting. Schools with policies, regardless of restrictiveness, reported\nmore digital incidents. Schools with restrictive policies were more likely to refer incidents and\nreported more school-based incidents, although most still occurred outside school.\n\nConclusions. Safeguarding incidents involving smartphones or social media are occurring in\nschools throughout England. Schools with phone policies were more likely to report digital\nsafeguarding incidents, suggesting an association between policy presence and reporting. Vast\nvariation in policy content and inconsistent “ban” rhetoric undermine the potential for effective\nsafeguarding.

Children with DA develop age-appropriate semantic knowledge, language, and general cognitive abilities, yet profound impairments in episodic memory, spatial navigation, and recall emerge in development. These deficits have significant consequences for education, frequently leading to academic underachievement despite strong intellectual potential. In this paper, we outline the distinctive challenges DA presents in education and highlight three effective strategies: spaced learning, repeated testing in multiple-choice formats, and errorless learning, which draw on preserved recognition memory. We also discuss approaches that have not proved effective, including fast-mapping, chunking, and memory training. We conclude by reflecting on how findings from neuropsychology can shape inclusive and effective educational practices, both for children with DA and for those with memory difficulties more generally.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and support from school management and community are related to their self-efficacy in the context of inclusive music education. Participants (n = 185) were teachers from Finnish comprehensive schools (Grades 1–9). They answered three questionnaires: the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice scale, the Attitudes towards Inclusion scale, and the School Climate for Inclusive Music Education scale. Using linear regression analysis, we found that the more positive the feelings towards inclusive music classes were, the stronger the teacher's self-efficacy was in inclusive instructions, collaboration, and managing behaviour. Moreover, the more substantial the experienced support from the school community was, the stronger the teachers’ self-efficacy was in collaboration. However, beliefs on inclusive education and perceived support from school management did not show significant effects on teacher self-efficacy in inclusive music education. These findings highlight the importance of music teachers gaining positive experience in inclusive education. This implies the crucial need for sufficient training for inclusive settings and ensuring that the environment and starting points are adequate for teaching and learning music in the classroom. Results also show the impact of the school community on success when implementing inclusive music education.",

While doing so, different viewpoints over the scene can be taken, often referred to as the field or observer perspectives. However, the precision with which individuals can accurately reconstruct their original viewpoint over an event, within the field perspective, has not yet been characterized. Here we developed a task and continuous implicit measure to quantify this ability (viewpoint retrieval accuracy, VRA) and study its association with explicit measures of re-experienced vividness. Twenty-five participants experienced lifelike events in mixed reality, with five controlled observer–object angles at encoding. After a 24 h delay, they retrieved each event, rated re-experiencing vividness, and indicated their original viewpoint (VRA). Mean VRA decreased with increasing encoding eccentricity (observer–object angles) and was consistently biased toward more central viewpoints. Moreover, VRA significantly explained re-experiencing vividness, with higher re-experiencing ratings being associated with smaller errors. These findings establish VRA as an implicit and continuous proxy for re-experiencing vividness, and a new tool for investigating the spatial and bodily foundations of EAM retrieval.",

Eye-tracking captured each observer’s characteristic gaze tendencies during naturalistic scene viewing, and functional magnetic resonance imaging recorded category-selective responses to faces, words, and other stimuli when participants were instructed to fixate centrally. We find that the propensity to fixate faces or text goes along with enhanced distinctiveness of corresponding categorical representations in the ventral stream, which in turn predicts performance on reading and face recognition tasks. Thus, active vision appears tuned to the precision of category-selective encoding in the individual brain.",

However, the generalizability of its factor structure is questionable because most previous studies were based on small sample sizes. In this study, free descriptive responses regarding urami and anger provided by 489 participants (aged 19–72 years) were quantified and analyzed using structural topic modeling, a type of natural language processing algorithm. The results revealed the topics that compose the conceptual structure and the situations in which urami occurs, as well as the relationships between some grouped situations and individual traits, such as narcissism. Furthermore, comparing the conceptual structure and situational occurrences of urami and anger based on quantitative criteria revealed unique elements of urami, such as persistence and feelings of victimization. These elements are particularly likely to occur when one is victimized by a close other.",

          "authors": "Piper Louise Rennerfeldt; Roberto A. Abreu-Mendoza; Miriam Rosenberg-Lee",
          "abstract": "When learning about decimals, whole number knowledge can be a detriment, leading children to incorrectly report, for example, that 0.26 is larger than 0.8. Two potential sources of whole number interference could lead to such errors. Digit length interference arises from the whole number rule that more digits = larger number, while whole referent magnitude interference arises from ignoring the decimal point and comparing the whole referents (26 &gt; 8). The independent effects of each interference type have been measured in adults, but we still do not know how these effects play out in early decimal learning. Further, inhibitory control has been linked to overcoming whole number interference, but it is unclear which specific type of interference is inhibited. Here, we used carefully designed decimal stimuli to examine these two interference effects in middle school students who are more susceptible to whole number interference than adults. Students in 2 U.S. school districts (grades 6-8, n = 178) completed computerized decimal comparison and inhibitory control tasks. We implemented cluster analysis to account for heterogeneous strategy use. The two most prominent groups, Whole Number Biased and High Performing, differed in their extent of digit length interference, but were equally susceptible to whole referent magnitude interference. Crucially, inhibitory control only related to overcoming digit length interference, not whole referent magnitude interference, in both groups. Taken together, whole referent magnitudes are a pervasive source of interference in decimal comparison, independent of overall task performance or individual differences in inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "Heightened air pollution exposure is associated with an increased risk for developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, yet it is unclear how pollution impacts the aging brain more broadly. Pollution studies in rodents have shown that higher air pollution exposure is associated with impulsive behavior and preference for immediate reward in delay discounting tasks. We examined this relationship in middle aged and older humans, by analyzing associations between residential pollution exposure and time-based reward preferences. One hundred-and-three (103) adults aged 40-80 completed a delay discounting task. We estimated long-term residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a prominent air pollutant, using participant address information and satellite pollution data. We found that higher residential PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with a higher preference for more immediate rewards, even after controlling for demographic factors including income and education. A preference for immediate rewards has been independently associated with higher risk of addictive behaviors, including substance abuse and gambling disorders, indicating that PM2.5 exposure may increase the emergence of these conditions. We discuss these results in detail along with potential underlying biological mechanisms, implications on human behavior, and future research directions.",

          "authors": "Dries Hannes Bostyn; Joshua Knobe",
          "abstract": "For many types of behaviors, whether a specific instance of that behavior is blame- or praiseworthy depends on how much of the behavior is done or how people go about doing it. For instance, for a behavior such as “replying to an email in x days”, whether a specific reply is perceived as blameworthy or praiseworthy will depend on how many days elapsed before the reply. Such behaviors lie on a continuum in which part of the continuum is praiseworthy (replying quickly) and another part of the continuum is blameworthy (replying late). In the current manuscript, we investigate how judgments of blame and praise on such behaviors relate to people’s perceptions of the statistical norms surrounding that behavior (i.e., how quickly people usually reply). We find that people do not base judgments of blame and praise on a comparison to the statistically average quantity. Instead, judgments of blame and praise are related to whether the behavior is perceived as frequent or infrequent. Notably, frequency showed an asymmetric relationship with moral judgments: higher frequency was strongly associated with reduced blame, but showed a much weaker association with reduced praise.",

          "abstract": "One justification for preregistering research hypotheses, methods, and analyses is that it improves the transparent evaluation of the severity of hypothesis tests. In this article, I consider two cases in which preregistration does not improve this evaluation. First, I argue that, although preregistration may facilitate the transparent evaluation of severity in Mayo’s error statistical philosophy of science, it does not facilitate this evaluation in Popper’s theory-centric approach. To illustrate, I show that associated concerns about Type I error rate inflation are only relevant in the error statistical approach and not in a theory-centric approach. Second, I argue that a test procedure that is preregistered but that also allows deviations in its implementation (i.e., “a plan, not a prison”) does not provide a more transparent evaluation of Mayoian severity than a non-preregistered procedure. In particular, I argue that sample-based validity-enhancing deviations cause an unknown inflation of the test procedure’s Type I error rate and, consequently, an unknown reduction in its capability to license inferences severely. I conclude that preregistration does not improve the transparent evaluation of severity (a) in Popper’s philosophy of science or (b) in Mayo’s approach when deviations are allowed.",

          "abstract": "Altered reward processing is proposed to be central to the pathology of anorexia nervosa (AN). This study aimed to investigate how aspects of reward dysfunction relate to suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs) in AN. We compared responses on self-report measures of general (i.e., anticipatory, consummatory, and social reward) and disorder-specific (i.e., self-starvation reward) reward between individuals with AN with (AN + STBs; n = 28) or without (AN; n = 31) lifetime active STBs and healthy controls (HC; n = 32). Further, we examined whether interactions between general and disorder-specific reward dysfunction were associated with lifetime active STBs in AN. Compared to AN and HC groups, the AN + STBs group reported significantly lower anticipatory and social reward; both AN + STBs and AN groups reported higher self-starvation reward than HCs. When accounting for the effects of depression, group differences became non-significant for general rewards but remained significant for disorder-specific reward processing. The interaction between anticipatory and self-starvation reward was significantly associated with STB risk beyond the effects of depression: AN participants reporting high self-starvation reward were at elevated STB risk regardless of anticipatory reward levels, whereas those with low self-starvation reward showed increased STBs only when anticipatory reward was also low. Our results suggest that the combination of general and disorder-specific reward processes may shape distinct suicidality risk profiles in AN.",

It focuses on the ritualized engagement with primal instinctual forces, manifesting through shadow-doubling and ecstatic possession, as a necessary threshold for psychological transformation. By situating the Ulfhéðnar within contemporary clinical contexts related to masculine trauma, rage, and identity, this work extends Jungian theory and archetypal psychology to address unresolved aspects of male integration. The analysis highlights how the rupture of ego boundaries permits the return and processing of repressed instinctual energies, offering a symbolic framework for therapeutic approaches.

Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes and describe the data.  \n\nResults: Social challenges and barriers as well as access to services were relevant factors for STBs related both to being autistic and TGD. Autistic burnout and financial, work, and school stressors were STB factors for autistic individuals. Puberty, dysphoria, and legislation concerns were STB factors specific to TGD individuals. Participants highlighted the impact of negative healthcare experiences on STB risk and recommendations to improve suicide prevention for this intersectional population. \n\nConclusions: Using a qualitative design, results revealed several factors influencing STB risk for autistic TGD individuals. Findings highlight that autistic TGD individuals face considerable barriers when trying to access healthcare. Such barriers and inability to receive needed services appear to considerably impact STB risk in this population.",

We asked whether functionally related object pairs benefit VWM and whether people’s judgments of relatedness predict participants’ performance on memory tasks. We curated a stimulus set of 160 line drawings arranged into 80 related and 80 unrelated pairs. Participants viewed four pairs of objects and then identified the new object in a probe display. Results showed a robust accuracy advantage for related over unrelated pair displays, with strong split-half reliability. This finding was replicated in a version where the probe display used pairs rather than single objects. To validate our relatedness manipulation, we collected Likert ratings of both semantic relatedness and action compatibility. The two rating methods showed a strong correlation with each other, as well as with the relatedness benefit observed in the memory experiments, providing further support for our manipulation. However, within the related and unrelated sets considered separately, subjective reports of relatedness did not predict variability in memory performance, and this replicated with a follow-up ratings task. Cross-condition correlations in the memory task indicated stable differences for individual objects regardless of relatedness. Together, the results show that functional pairing reliably boosts VWM - consistent with chunking - yet fine-grained variability in memorability is driven by object- and pair-level properties not captured by perceived relatedness.",

The hypothesis was that classification algorithms in machine learning can be used to help predict cases of physician burnout by finding relationships between variables, since burnout is a quantifiable factor. This project examined physician studies specifically, not healthcare professionals in general, including primary practice settings and specialties as factors that affect burnout levels. After data preprocessing, visualizations were made based on correlations between burnout levels and factors such as time spent on various tasks and years of experience. After accuracy-guided hyperparameter tuning on various models, a Random Forest Classifier model was used and evaluated with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The model performed best in predicting moderate burnout (with 62% accuracy for that class), but tended to misclassify low and high burnout levels as moderate. Figures provide visualizations of key relationships and classification results. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using survey-based features for burnout prediction, given the variability and subjectivity of self-reported measures.",

The data included 7 cohorts from Finland, Germany, and US (n= 8,205 sibling and dizygotic twin pairs and 843 monozygotic twin pairs). We compared the effect sizes between ordinary regression models with within-sibling pair, and within-twin pair fixed-effect regression models. Results showed a weak association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in unpaired models (~SMD= -.07), which remained  similar in within-sibling pair models (SMD=-.05), and in within-twin pair models (SMD= -.08). These results were robust with use of physical activity measured as minutes per week and with different intensities of physical activity. There was no evidence for reverse causality. Our findings suggest that naturally occurring individual differences in leisure-time physical activity may be only weakly associated with later depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Simulation accounts posit that speech is covertly imitated to support perception in a top-down manner. Behaviourally, covert imitation can be measured through the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task. In a speech SRC task, participants produce a target speech syllable whilst perceiving a speech distractor that either matches the target (compatible condition) or does not (incompatible condition). The degree to which the distractor is covertly imitated is captured by the automatic imitation effect, computed as the difference in response times (RTs) between compatible and incompatible trials. Simulation accounts disagree on whether covert imitation is enhanced when speech perception is more challenging or instead when the speech is familiar. To dissociate between these two accounts, we conducted two experiments, one behavioural and one using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), in which participants completed SRC tasks with native and non-native contrasts. In Experiment 1, participants performed an SRC task with two native and two non-native contrasts, received perception training with the non-native contrasts, and performed the SRC task again. Results showed that non-native distractors were linked to higher automatic imitation than the native distractors before and after the training, but that the automatic imitation effect for the non-native distractors decreased more after training. Experiment 2 demonstrated that speech primary motor cortex showed higher excitability during passive perception of non-native compared to native contrasts but showed no correlation with automatic imitation. Our results highlight that speech motor cortex acts as an adaptive reflexive gain control mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are poised to become a ubiquitous feature of our lives, mediating communication, decision-making and information curation across nearly every domain. Within psychiatry and psychology the focus to date has remained largely on bespoke therapeutic applications, sometimes narrowly focused and often diagnostically siloed, rather than on the broader and more pressing reality that individuals with mental illness will increasingly engage in agential interactions with AI systems as a routine part of daily existence. While their capacity to model therapeutic dialogue, provide 24/7 companionship and assist with cognitive support has sparked understandable enthusiasm, recent reports suggest that these same systems may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of psychotic symptoms: so-called ‘AI psychosis’ or ‘ChatGPT psychosis’. Emerging, and rapidly accumulating, evidence indicates that agential AI may mirror, validate or amplify delusional or grandiose content, particularly in users already vulnerable to psychosis, due in part to the models’ design to maximise engagement and affirmation, although notably it is not clear whether these interactions have resulted or can result in the emergence of de novo psychosis in the absence of pre-existing vulnerability. Even if some individuals may benefit from AI interactions, for example where the AI functions as a benign and predictable conversational anchor, there is a growing concern that these agents may also reinforce epistemic instability, blur reality boundaries and disrupt self-regulation. In this paper, we outline both the potential harms and therapeutic possibilities of agential AI for people with psychotic disorders. In this perspective piece, we propose a framework of AI-integrated care involving personalised instruction protocols, reflective check-ins, digital advance statements and escalation safeguards to support epistemic security in vulnerable users. These tools reframe the AI agent as an epistemic ally (as opposed to ‘only’ a therapist or a friend) which functions as a partner in relapse prevention and cognitive containment. Given the rapid adoption of LLMs across all domains of digital life, these protocols must be urgently trialled and co-designed with service users and clinicians.",

          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing our actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding by itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their current sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related cognitive effort, difficulty-related cognitive effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator for cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by overall cognitive effort (difficulty- and boredom-related) than by task-difficulty-related cognitive effort alone. The best model fit was found for a model including boredom- and difficulty-related effort as well as their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop task predicted task performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results highlight, that enduring boredom is not only perceived as effortful but also reflects in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it has behavioral relevance. This emphasizes the importance of considering boredom as a confounding variable in self-control research and, more general, within the broader scope of study designs.",

          "abstract": "Subjective imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for imagery experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. \nHere, I propose an attention-based model of subjective imagery with two aims: (i) to outline a hierarchical processing, in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds these features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access, capturing both voluntary and spontaneous imagery; and (ii) to specify a putative neural implementation in a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down attentional control, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal control networks and the fusiform gyrus.\nOverall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of memory traces. Thus, this paper presents a testable mechanistic account of the neural substrates of subjective imagery and aphantasia, motivating future research and illuminating the neural basis of conscious experience.",

This multiverse-based, meta-analytic systematic review aims to examine the association of disclosing an LGB+ orientation with organizational LGB+ climate, discrimination, job satisfaction, and mental health. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review in line with PRISMA guidelines. Multi-tiered, systematic literature searches were conducted across 4 databases and further sources. Sixty-five studies from 62 publications (19,440 participants) met prespecified inclusion criteria. Pooled effect sizes (Pearson r) were calculated based on three-level, multiverse meta-analyses. Across 792 models, we found that workplace LGB+ disclosure was associated with a better organizational climate (mean observed r = .39), less discrimination (r = -.24), higher job satisfaction (r = .15), and better mental health (r = .14). Moderator analyses were mostly inconclusive with some evidence found for disclosure type, sexual orientation, gender, and year of data collection in certain subsets of multiverse specifications. Organizations aiming to support the well-being of LGB+ employees may benefit from cultivating non-discriminatory work environments, as such LGB+ friendly environments are associated with greater openness about sexual orientation and, in turn, with higher job satisfaction and better mental health among LGB+ staff. This multiverse-based, meta-analytic systematic review considers different communicative forms of disclosure and examines the associations of disclosure with organizational and personal variables and considers a variety of moderating variables.",

          "abstract": "The Shift-of-Strategy (SoS) approach is a recently developed interviewing technique designed to encourage semi-cooperative suspects to disclose more information. The approach’s efficacy has previously been demonstrated in highly controlled laboratory studies where the SoS approach was implemented through semi-scripted protocols. The current study is the first to develop and evaluate a 2-hour training program designed to teach novice interviewers to independently apply the SoS approach in mock interviews. We compared the SoS training with a program focused on foundational interviewing principles (Basic training). We predicted that participants receiving both types of training would elicit more information from mock suspects than those who only received Basic training. Participants (N = 31) acting as interviewers were assigned to one of three training conditions: Basic, SoS, or SoS-Delay. Basic participants only received Basic training before conducting four interviews with separate mock-suspects. The two SoS conditions received both types of training at different time points (before all four interviews for SoS, after two interviews for SoS-Delay). We recruited mock suspects (N = 124) to complete a mock crime before being interviewed. Interviewers who received the SoS training used SoS tactics more frequently and elicited more general information compared to those who only received Basic training. However, we observed no significant differences in interviewers’ ability to elicit previously unknown information. However, the use of several SoS tactics was positively associated with eliciting such information. These results demonstrate that even brief SoS training improves novices’ use of tactics and ability to elicit information.",

          "abstract": "Recently, public debates related to metaphors such as echo chambers and filter bubbles have emphasized how the formation of like-minded spaces can harm democratic systems. In fact, human beings have always tended to surround themselves by those who act and think alike. Still, the extent and the potential effects of this human tendency specifically in online networks are yet to be understood. This chapter summarizes a five-year research program at the intersection of media psychology, communication studies, and social media analytics devoted to understanding the emergence and the consequences of political homogeneity in social media. We present subjective and objective measures of political homogeneity, which psychological factors facilitate its emergence, and how its presence can shape perceptions of public opinion, metacognitions, personal opinions, and expressive actions. Drawing on this evidence, we outline its implications for strengthening and securing democracy in digitized societies.",

          "abstract": "Truly understanding the position of ideological opponents is challenging, yet crucial if our goals are to avoid escalation or further polarisation, identify areas of agreement, and ultimately reduce misunderstanding. We operationalise the idea of an ‘Ideological Turing Test’, as a behavioural measure of the extent to which people are able to accurately represent the position of their ideological opponents. The original ‘Turing Test’ challenged any artificial intelligence to successfully mimic human dialogue- the test would be passed if a human was convinced that the machine was a human. The Ideological Turing Test has been proposed (Caplan 2011 Econlib) as a requirement for would-be human debaters - can they successfully mimic their ideological opponent’s arguments to the extent that their opponent endorses the argument as strongly as their own? Crucially, this ‘Test’ offers a behavioural measure of open mindedness which goes beyond self-report measures. It is not possible to pass an Ideological Turing Test by believing you understand the other’s perspective - you must articulate those arguments to the satisfaction of those who hold them.  In this study, we operationalise the Ideological Turing Test by recruiting participants from opposite sides of commonly polarising debates (Covid-19 Vaccines, Brexit, Veganism), and asking them to provide reasons both for and against their position. These reasons were rated by participants from the opposite side of the debate. Our criteria for “passing” the Ideological Turing Test is if an argument is agreed with by opponents to the same extent or higher than arguments made by proponents. We found no difference in minority or majority positions in their ability to pass the Ideological Turing Test (i.e. no difference in passing rate between those who are for or against Covid-19 vaccines). However we did find that those who pass the Ideological Turing Test are less judgemental towards their opponents, in that they are less likely to rate them as ignorant, immoral or irrational. The Ideological Turing Test not only provides a  behavioural measure of open-mindedness, it also provides insights into the scope and diversity of arguments within and between polarising topics.",

          "abstract": "Efficient allocation of attentional resources is critical when humans collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI): they must focus on their task while monitoring the AI to intervene if it fails. Inefficient allocation—such as excessive monitoring or overreliance—can impair performance and cause critical errors. Whether humans appropriately offload attentional effort to an AI depends on factors such as the AI’s competency, the user’s expertise, and their propensity to trust. Yet, trust in AI is a latent variable that is difficult to measure. Here, we introduce an EEG-based approach to directly track how attentional resources are shared between a human and an AI. Participants performed a visual search task either alone or with an AI whose competency was varied. The N2pc component—an established neural marker of selective visual attention—was used to index attentional deployment. Results showed that the N2pc amplitude varied with the AI’s competency: smaller amplitudes indicated greater offloading and trust in the high- versus low-competency condition. The findings demonstrate that neurophysiological markers such as the N2pc can serve as implicit, non-disruptive measures of trust that inform about the cognitive mechanisms underlying trust calibration. The study thus establishes the N2pc as a promising marker for quantifying attention allocation in collaborative human-AI search tasks and extends its relevance from visual attention research to the study of trust in automation.",

          "abstract": "Mental rotation ability plays a crucial role in learning outcomes in STEM subjects - the ongoing debate questions whether and, if so, why men outperform women in mental rotation. Existing mental rotation tests (MRTs) have recently been criticized for being male-biased in their design. In our study, we attempted to overcome potential MRT design bias by integrating the renowned MRT into an immersive virtual reality (iVR) environment that reduces those biases. In a sample of N = 731 university students, we examined whether the iVR environment had an impact on MRT performance for males and females compared to (a) the paper-and-pencil condition and (b) a tablet condition. Our findings reveal the consistent superiority of male over female students in MRT performance across the three conditions. However, this discrepancy is attenuated in both technology-supported conditions. Based on the mediation model, cognitive effort partially mediated gender differences in mental rotation performance in the paper-and-pencil and tablet conditions, but not in iVR, suggesting that the role of perceived mental workload in gender disparities may vary depending on the testing environment.",

According to “motivated perception”, a person’s motivation can alter how the brain interprets incoming sensory information. Yet, empirical support remains mixed, often due to methodological confounds. Here, we systematically tested whether motivation alters perception or whether it instead biases behavior. Across four experiments, we assessed the quality and quantity of motivation (self-concordance, value) and two key dimensions of perception: bias and sensitivity. Moreover, we tested two potentially mediating mechanisms (gaze position, spatial attention) as well as an implicit perceptual measure. Using smooth pursuit eye movements as an implicit measure of motion perception, we show that motivation biases responses without altering perception (Experiment 2). Changes in perceptual sensitivity (Experiment 1) and perceptual bias (Experiments 3–4) only arise when participants can freely select their gaze position in response to uncertain or ambiguous visual displays. Our findings therefore challenge the notion of “motivated perception”. Instead, they suggest that motivation shapes how we look and respond – but not how we perceive.",

          "abstract": "Depression is characterized by reduced future thinking specificity, yet the retrieval processes underlying this impairment remain unclear. Building on parallels between future thinking and autobiographical memory, we examined whether depressive symptoms are differentially associated with direct versus generative retrieval of specific and categoric future events, and whether contrast avoidance (i.e., maintaining a negative mood to avoid a sudden negative emotional shift) contributes to these patterns. In Study 1 (N = 80) and Study 2 (N = 113), Japanese adults completed a future thinking task in which they imagined personally-relevant future events for positive and negative cue words, classified each retrieval as direct or generative, and rated phenomenological characteristics. Across studies, depressive symptom severity was consistently associated with more frequent direct retrieval of negative categoric future thinking and less frequent direct retrieval of positive specific future thinking. Depressed individuals also reported lower emotional valence, likelihood, and similarity with past events for positive future thinking, suggesting limited memory resources for generating plausible positive events. In Study 2, a higher propensity for emotional contrast avoidance was linked to increased retrieval of negative categoric future thinking and decreased retrieval of positive specific future thinking. These findings extend depression-related alteration of accessibility from autobiographical memory to future thinking, suggesting common underlying knowledge structures. Increased accessibility to negative categoric futures and reduced accessibility to positive specific futures may be a pathological process in depressed individuals, with contrast avoidance potentially maintaining these biases.",

          "abstract": "Groove, defined as the pleasurable urge to move to music, is affected by properties of the music as well as factors that differ among individuals, such as music training. Ratings of the desire to produce movement (e.g., tapping and dancing) have been used to quantify the amount of groove being experienced, but we do not know whether the specific type of movement that is rated affects scores. Further, few studies have considered the effect of dance training on groove perception. Therefore, the current paper investigates whether rating different types of movements (i.e., tapping vs dancing) affects groove ratings, and how dance experience may alter these ratings. The first study used a within-subject design, with participants rating forty unfamiliar songs on their elicited desire to tap, desire to move, and desire to dance. To assess whether rating all three movement descriptors together created rating differences that would not be observed if participants were not comparing the movement descriptors against each other, a between-subjects study was conducted with the same procedure except that the three groups of participants each rated only one movement descriptor. In both studies, ratings of groove differed based on the type of movement rated. Overall, desire to dance ratings were lower than move or tap ratings across both studies. Desire to tap ratings were significantly higher than move ratings, but only in the first study; in the second study, move and tap ratings did not significantly differ. In the first study, dance training influenced desire to move and desire to dance ratings, while music training influenced desire to tap ratings, however these findings were not replicated in Study 2. Overall, the findings suggest that groove ratings differ based on the type of movement rated, that within- versus between-subject designs affect these ratings, and that dance and music training differentially affect different groove responses.",

          "authors": "Shane O'Mara",
          "abstract": "Nationalism—the deep psychological attachment to one's nation—is a pervasive and powerful force shaping modern social and political life. While usually analyzed through historical or political frameworks, nationalism is rooted in evolved neurocognitive and biological capacities for memory, imagination, group affiliation, and emotional bonding. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and evolutionary theory, this review explores the neurobiological and psychological substrates of nationalism, integrating Benedict Anderson's concept of “imagined communities” with findings on imagination, group categorization, identity fusion, and collective memory. Central to this analysis is the collective exercise of episodic memory and imagination, suggesting national identity depends on the brain’s ability to construct coherent, imagined, collective worlds. \nCollective memory and other processes promote in-group loyalty and out-group bias, and (prefrontal) cortical systems facilitate fusing of individual and group identity. The neural bases of important affective processes (including pride, fear, empathy (gaps), and moral outrage) are analyzed to elucidate how nationalism co-opts these mechanisms, scaling them to mass societies through culturally-mediated memory and narrative systems. Often overlooked ethical issues when considering the underlying mechanisms responsible for nationalism are discussed. Finally, some new hypotheses and future research directions to deepen our neurocognitive understanding of large-scale group affiliation, with implications for societal cohesion, intergroup conflict, and transforming nationalism in a globalizing world are discussed.",

This study examined demographic correlates of a novel, virtual reality-based test of everyday function to determine whether its computerized format would yield demographic associations similar to performance-based tests with real objects. Methods: A total of 237 older adults (MAge = 72.7 ± 6.96; MEducation = 15.8 ± 2.75; 66% female; 47.7% White; 45.1% Black) completed conventional cognitive tests and two functional tests requiring them to make a breakfast and a lunch with real-life objects (Real Kitchen) and on a non-immersive virtual reality paradigm (Virtual Kitchen Challenge-Version 2; VKC-2). VKC-2 and Real Kitchen were scored for completion time and errors. Informant reports of everyday functioning were also analyzed. Results: Multiple linear regressions indicated that age significantly predicted nearly all variables. Race did not significantly predict any VKC-2 or Real Kitchen variables, though it significantly predicted nearly all cognitive test scores and informant questionnaires. Education showed similar results to race, but significantly predicted several VKC-2 and Real Kitchen scores. Sex significantly predicted two cognitive tests (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Delay Free Recall and Boston Naming Test). Conclusions: Performance-based measures of everyday function, even when administered in VR format, demonstrate weaker associations with race, sex, and education than traditional cognitive tests or informant reporting. The VKC-2 offers a valid and efficient approach to assessing cognitive and functional decline in diverse older adult populations.",

This scheme shifts the focus from problematic standalone subjective experiences to the identification of subjective experiences with the system’s model of itself and its contingent attributes, is consistent with the empirical and phenomenological evidence and provides testable predictions: (1) only macroscopic scale information that is expedient for survival (d-self shell) can become subjective experience, and (2) the hub of subjective experience is mostly distributed along the posterior medial cortex.",

          "abstract": "Parsing complex dynamic scenes is an important part of navigating our visual world, yet it is unclear how the visual system meets these demands. Driving safely is a daily task that requires quickly understanding dynamic road scenes. Eye tracking can illuminate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the processes supporting this ability. To this end, we recorded eye position while 30 licensed drivers localized hazards in real dashcam footage. We found that correctly localized hazards were more likely to be foveated than missed hazards. However, there was no single moment in time at which foveation of the hazard is critical for hazard location. Despite correct localization response, the maximum likelihood of foveating the hazard never exceeded 70% at each moment. These results suggest that peripheral vision can be sufficient for hazard localization. Furthermore, looked-but-failed-to-see errors, where participants foveated but failed to report the hazard, occurred on 40% of incorrect trials. These results demonstrate a dissociation between gaze and awareness. We also found evidence of anticipatory looking on correct trials. Participants started to look at the future location of the hazard 2s before hazard onset, which aligns with prior research reporting that gaze precedes action in other naturalistic tasks. Furthermore, we found an association between when participants looked at the hazard and speed of correct hazard localization, but not what happens after foveation. The earlier you look at the hazard, the earlier you respond. Overall, our findings demonstrate the involvement of peripheral vision and anticipatory processes in comprehending dynamic natural scenes.",

Their level of victimization before and after the transition was determined using self-reported questionnaires and peer nominations. We further determined whether any of their primary school classmates transitioned to the same classroom in secondary school, and if so, whether these co-transitioning peers were friends in primary school, as determined by peer nominations. Multilevel analyses revealed that self-reported victimization was likely to continue if students co-transitioned to the secondary school classroom without peers, but not if they co-transitioned with peers, regardless of the friendship relation with them.

          "abstract": "The dichotomy between episodic and semantic memory has historically limited investigations into memory phenomena that exhibit characteristics of both memory types. Notably, personal semantics can demonstrate episodic qualities of personal significance and semantic qualities of spatiotemporal context-independence. The current study examined this intersection of episodic and semantic memory by investigating whether and to what extent the phenomenological experiences of recalling knowledge of personally familiar people and places and recalling a past episode are related. Participants recalled past episodes each comprising two episodic details, a personally familiar person and location, and rated the subjective vividness of each detail. In a separate personal semantics task, participants generated facts for the same person and location details comprising the recalled episodes and rated the amount of facts experienced. A multilevel analysis revealed that the amount of facts during the personal semantics task predicted the corresponding subjective vividness of those same details during recollection. Importantly, this relationship replicated in a second experiment and persisted even after omitting trials for which participants had utilized an episodic strategy during the personal semantics task. These findings indicate that the subjective experience across personal semantic and episodic memories is linked at the level of individual details.",

          "abstract": "Concerns that AI will homogenize human thinking—and homogenization findings in lab contexts—appear at odds with findings that AI-assisted content is judged as highly original. Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among applicants outside racial and linguistic mainstreams. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. The findings suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content masks deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation. Extending lab-based AI homogenization research, paradoxical homogenization appears to have reached real-world, high-stakes contexts where writing is expressly personal and AI use is explicitly prohibited.",

          "abstract": "Interval scales are frequently assumed in educational and psychological research involving latent variables, but rarely verified. This paper outlines methods for investigating the interval scale assumption when the Rasch model is to be fit to item response data. We study a Bayesian method for evaluating an item response dataset’s adherence to the cancellation axioms of additive conjoint measurement under the Rasch model, and compare the extent to which the axiom of double cancellation holds in the data at sample sizes of 250 and 1000 with varying test lengths, difficulty spreads, and levels of adherence to the Rasch model in the data-generating process. Because the statistic produced by the procedure is not directly interpretable as an indicator of whether an interval scale can be established or not, we develop and evaluate procedures for bootstrapping a null distribution of violation rates against which to compare results. At a sample size of 250, the method under investigation is not well-powered to detect the violations of interval scaling that we simulate, but the procedure works quite consistently at N = 1000. That is, at moderate but achievable sample sizes, empirical tests for interval scaling are indeed possible.",

This question has generated major scholarly debate, primarily informed by archaeology, ethnography, and primatology. We examine adaptation to war in contemporary humans via cognitive psychology experiments. If war recurred during evolution, then our minds are likely equipped with efficient, complex, and specialized mechanisms for effective navigation of intergroup coalitional aggression. Fourteen hypotheses were derived positing the existence of rapid and accurate coalition detection, enumeration, and formidability assessment mechanisms. Twenty-five exploratory experiments (ca. 5000 participants) custom-fitted established attentional bias, enumeration, and rating paradigms for large-scale online administration, and preliminary tested the hypotheses. Seven preregistered studies with probability samples totaling ca. 12,000 participants supported 11 of the hypotheses. Participants automatically attended to, efficiently enumerated, and made nuanced assessments of rapidly presented schematic coalitions. Male participants enumerated the coalitions more rapidly and accurately, female participants perceived them as more formidable, and female and less formidable participants overestimated their numerical size. Combined with multiple tests of alternative explanations, the evidence suggests the existence of specialized adaptations to intergroup coalitional aggression, consistent with the broader hypothesis that human prehistory was characterized by war.",

Resilience, the ability to sustain or recover well-being despite adversity, is influenced by early supportive relationships and social connections. These protective factors may differ by gender, yet little research has examined these dynamics in Latin America. We analyzed data from a representative urban sample of Chilean adults (N = 2,101; aged 18–65), drawn from the Chile National Survey of Adversity. Depressive symptoms were regressed on ACEs and socioeconomic status; residuals indicated resilient functioning. Exploratory factor analysis identified latent factors, and gender-stratified structural equation models assessed their associations with resilient functioning. Three factors emerged: Positive Childhood Experiences, Closeness to Friends in Need, and Empathetic Concern. Among women, positive experiences and friendship closeness predicted resilience, whereas Empathetic Concern was linked to less resilient functioning. No associations were found among men. The findings underscore gender-specific resilience pathways, identifying predictors associated with greater resilient functioning exclusively in women, while also suggesting that interpersonal empathy may place emotional demands on women that compromise resilient functioning.",

          "abstract": "Central to survival is our ability to learn that the sensory properties of food are associated with metabolic interoceptive signals (e.g., changing blood glucose). These signals influence cognition and brain activity, shaping the hedonic evaluation of flavours, and activating reward-related brain regions such as the ventral striatum. However, there remains a substantial gap in understanding how metabolic rewards shape behaviour, particularly in humans. We hypothesised that metabolic interoceptive rewards may function as Pavlovian stimuli, eliciting a Pavlovian approach bias which modulates everyday instrumental decision-making via Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. To test this, in a double-blind design, over one week, participants (N = 53) consumed two novel, flavoured drinks: one containing the tasteless carbohydrate maltodextrin, and one a calorie-free control. In a subsequent lab session, participants completed a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer task, performing a points-based instrumental decision-making task while tasting calorie-free versions of each flavour. Participants also rated liking and wanting of the flavours. As predicted, flavours previously experienced with calories were rated as significantly more liked after conditioning. However, counter to our hypothesis, the calorie-associated flavours did not enhance instrumental responding; computational modelling instead indicated a suppression of action. These findings reveal a dissociation between hedonic preferences and action: while metabolic rewards shaped liking, they did not invigorate behaviour. This highlights the complexity of interoceptive reinforcement learning and points to the need for further work to understand how and when internal metabolic expectations shape action.",

This paper first provides a technical description of OLS and an overview of its statistical assumptions. We then discuss the methods commonly employed to detect and address violations of assumptions, and how the current application of these methods can compromise the reproducibility of findings by allowing too much flexibility in the analytic process. We briefly introduce several robust estimation methods - namely bootstrapping, heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors, M-estimators, and trimming - that can improve the accuracy of parameter estimates and the power of statistical tests. We provide guidance on how these methods can be used to transparently preregister a sensitivity analysis, reducing the opportunity for problematic researcher degrees of freedom to enter the analytic pipeline.",

          "authors": "Deepanshu Tomar",
          "abstract": "The Bi-Interpretive Mind Framework (BIMF) introduces a dual-system model of human cognition and consciousness, positing the coexistence of two interdependent subsystems: the Primary Mind (logical, conscious, reality-testing) and the Secondary Mind (intuitive, unconscious, biologically interpretive). Subjective experience is conceptualized as emerging from the “interpretive handshake” between these two systems, while instability in this process—termed interpretive instability—underlies stress, psychopathology, and altered states of consciousness. Extending this model, the Bi-Interpretive Stress Model (BISM) defines stress as instability in the interpretive handshake, operationalized as a mismatch between Secondary simulations and Primary validation, modulated by neurochemical tilt and cognitive control capacity. BIMF further reinterprets diverse psychopathologies—including schizophrenia, PTSD, OCD, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, dissociation, and addiction—as systemic failures in interpretive alignment. Dreams are framed as autonomous simulations of the Secondary Mind, ranging from symbolic REM experiences to lucid states where the Primary Mind partially re-engages. This framework integrates insights from dual-process cognition, predictive processing, stress appraisal, and neurovisceral integration, while providing testable empirical predictions for laboratory and clinical research. By unifying cognitive, biological, and phenomenological perspectives, BIMF contributes a novel hypothesis for understanding the mechanisms of consciousness, stress, and psychopathology. The paper concludes by outlining empirical paradigms and clinical applications, positioning BIMF as a testable, integrative theory of mind.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a pressing global health issue, yet traditional interventions often fall short due to scalability limitations and the individualized experiences of loneliness. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled synthetic relationships (SRs)—ongoing associations with AI companions designed to simulate human-like social bonds. SRs offer, among other aspects, constant availability, adaptability, and emotional responsiveness, which potentially address loneliness. However, their growing integration into social life raises critical psychological, ethical, and societal questions. This paper examines the opportunities and risks of SRs through the lens of relationship science, psychology, and AI companionship research. We first highlight how existing loneliness interventions face the challenges of availability, scalability, and personalization. We then outline how SRs present a novel alternative to overcoming these challenges. Drawing mainly on social penetration, attachment, and interdependence theory, we analyze how SRs may foster companionship, reduce social anxiety, and improve interpersonal skills, potentially mitigating loneliness. However, we also identify significant risks, including emotional over-reliance, distorted social expectations, and privacy concerns. The widespread adoption of SRs may reshape human-human relationships, altering norms of intimacy and social connection. To navigate these challenges, we outline a research agenda promoting interdisciplinary theory development longitudinal studies, drawing on representative samples to address the ethical concerns of SRs. We argue that SRs hold promise as a social intervention when ensuring they complement rather than replace human relationships. By integrating interdisciplinary insights, this paper provides a foundation for understanding and guiding the responsible design of SRs for addressing loneliness.",

Using this method, we attempt to replicate and extend this work as a tool for other researchers to use in their own online studies to quantify potential biases and space for treatment heterogeneity. Here we show Online participants are different from the rest of the population. The Online Participant is older, more likely to be Jewish, more well educated, more intelligent, less sociable, less arousal-seeking, more conventional, less interested in religion, and less willing to self-disclose than the person who does not take online studies. This systematic bias by focusing on the types of people who take online studies create obvious problems to generalizability. Furthermore, it creates biases in estimation for all types of studies through range restriction on numerous measured (and potentially many more unmeasured) variables. In short, the type of person who participates in our online studies is not just a regular person, they are systematically different. We provide a method to measure this bias in one’s own study.",

This narrow focus limits the generalisability and adaptability of AI models, which fail to reflect the full spectrum of human cognition and culture. Moreover, heavy dependence on pre-existing data overlooks how learning occurs in the wild, through direct interaction and feedback from the environment, and constrains innovation. Here, we integrate insights from anthropology, cognitive science, and computer science to argue for a broader, ecologically grounded approach to AI development. We examine examples from traditional cultures, particularly extant hunter-gatherers, whose modes of living reflect the ecological and social conditions under which human cognition evolved. These communities offer underexplored but highly relevant perspectives on core challenges in AI, from multimodal sensory perception to embodied and experiential learning and collective intelligence. These comparisons not only offer conceptual tools for AI design but also invite reflection on the reverse question: what can building AI teach us about human cognition, especially when inspired by ecologically diverse strategies? To develop embodied AI systems capable of engaging meaningfully with the world’s sensory and interactive richness, we must look to those who have long done so.",

The aim of this paper is to provide a definition and framework for the depressogenic environment in mental health science. \n\nDepressogenic environment refers to the physical, political, economic and socio-cultural environments that create, maintain or increase mental ill-health. They operate at the micro (homes, schools, workplaces) and macro levels (systems, regions, countries) and include chronic (e.g. infrastructure, cultural beliefs, laws) and acute (e.g. natural disasters, war, recession) factors. \n\nI outline the need for this framework, how it compliments other existing frameworks and discuss it’s potential for accelerating insights into the powerful role of the environment in shaping the mental health of individuals and populations. \n\nBy understanding the role of environmental factors in shaping our mental health and ill-health, researchers, clinicians and policymakers can develop new and more effective strategies for mental health prevention and intervention that go beyond the focus on individual behaviours and healthcare access.",

          "abstract": "The majority of mental health conditions emerge before adulthood. With prevalence increasing especially during childhood and adolescence and in light of high between disorder comorbidity, there is an urgent need to identify transdiagnostic mechanisms that underpin both risk and resilience to developmental psychopathology. Here we propose executive functions (EF), a set of cognitive processes relevant for the goal-directed control of thought and actions, as a promising candidate for such a mechanism. We review evidence that EF development is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors and relies on protracted maturation of neural networks, particularly frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular systems. Disruptions in these systems are associated with elevated risk for internalising and externalising disorders. We therefore propose EF as a cognitive endophenotype of developmental psychopathology—heritable, measurable, and lying on the pathway from gene to disorder. We review evidence showing that impaired EF is a shared feature across psychiatric conditions and predictive of future symptomatology, supporting its transdiagnostic relevance. We also propose a mechanistic refinement of the EF construct, moving beyond capacity-based interpretations to a model in which EF performance reflects dynamic and contextually informed cost-benefit computations including effort costs, expected rewards, and contextual efficacy. Disruptions in reward and effort processing—manifesting as anhedonia and apathy—are common across mental health conditions and may compromise EF performance by altering these computations. This integrative perspective helps explain the limited efficacy of traditional EF training interventions and underscores the importance of motivational and contextual factors. We conclude by outlining a future research agenda focused on disentangling the specific subprocesses underpinning EF and their mechanistic links to developmental psychopathology. Recognising EF as a transdiagnostic cognitive endophenotype governed by rational control allocation processes opens new avenues for precise, developmentally informed, and targeted interventions in youth mental health.",

Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a scalable and accessible intervention. Yet, it remains unclear whether its effectiveness depends on the timing of delivery — a potentially crucial factor, as pregnancy and the postpartum period differ in both psychological demands and practical circumstances. Therefore, to examine whether digital CBT interventions are more effective when delivered during pregnancy, after childbirth, or across both periods, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials involving 7,577 participants. Our results indicate that digital CBT delivered after childbirth is significantly more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than interventions delivered during pregnancy (b=-1.99, 95%CI [-3.90, -0.08], p=0.04). Interventions spanning both periods did not show additional benefit. These findings can inform the design and implementation of future digital CBT interventions targeting perinatal populations.",

          "abstract": "While the benefits of digitalisation are well documented, less attention has been paid to a potential cost: the erosion of human interaction in everyday services. What are the psychological and social implications of this shift? Across three pre-registered online studies (N = 2,918), we used hypothetical scenarios spanning four domains (education, finance, mental health, fitness) and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) task. Participants consistently valued services involving human interaction more than digital ones, and higher-income individuals were willing to pay more for human contact, but not for digital alternatives. Crucially, framing human contact as scarce further increased its perceived value. These effects were observed in both UK and Italian samples and were not accounted for by differences in digital skills or access. Our findings suggest that, as digitalisation expands, human contact may become a luxury intangible good, introducing new inequalities in access to interpersonal connection.",

Yet, most previous intergroup contact research has either focused on contact in artificial settings or on self-reported contact. This study presents the first large-scale investigation of how everyday contact relates to racial bias across the U.S., using GPS data from 9.6 million people and attitude data from 1.3 million people. We find that for White individuals, greater SES exposure segregation - indicating less frequent contact with outgroup members - is associated with higher implicit racial bias. These findings suggest that even superficial, everyday contact is associated with reductions in implicit racial bias, highlighting the importance of everyday exposure in shaping intergroup attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, it is assumed that there is a common factor for spatial vision. However, recent psychophysical results have not found evidence for such a factor, suggesting that each test measures a rather distinct, independent component of visual perception. An alternative explanation is that psychophysical tests measure not only the underlying visual mechanisms, but also confounding non-visual aspects arising from behavioral responses. In this study, we tested 35 young adults with steady-state visually evoked potentials (ssVEP) to bypass behavioral responses and to “objectively” assess contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, and orientation sensitivity. The same participants also performed the corresponding psychophysical tests. ssVEP relies on brain responses elicited by stimuli flickering at specific frequencies and it is widely used in clinical settings, for instance to measure visual acuity in infants or patients with motor impairments. We hypothesized that EEG-based thresholds are less affected by non-visual confounding aspects than psychophysical tests, resulting in higher between-test correlation reflecting the underlying visual factor. Contrary to our expectations, although EEG-based thresholds demonstrated high test–retest reliability, between-test correlation were even lower than those between psychophysical tests. Furthermore, EEG-based thresholds did not correlate with the thresholds obtained from the corresponding psychophysical tests. These findings provide further evidence towards a multifactorial structure of the visual system, and suggest that ssVEP and psychophysical tests measure distinct aspects of visual processing, challenging their interchangeable use.",

          "abstract": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are prevalent predictors of poor health outcomes in adulthood, but their impact on moral foundations remains underexplored. This quantitative cross-sectional study was an examination in to the effects of ACEs on adult morality and proposed affective personality traits and caregiving factors as possible mediating mechanisms. The researcher administered a comprehensive online survey to a global sample of N = 376 English-speaking adults, comprised of four validated survey measures that assessed both retrospective and present experiences, traits, and character styles. The survey assessed ACE exposure (10-item ACE-Q), species-typical caregiving practices (EDNH), the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS), and the 20-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-20), an assessment of moral intuitions derived from Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). The researcher designed the study to test the trauma/Thriving-Emotions-Morality (tTEM) framework, which posits that emotions are primary in moral beliefs and are cultivated through childhood relationships. Results from group comparisons between high-ACE (≥4) and low-ACE (≤ 3) participants indicated small but significant differences, with high-ACE participants tending toward higher Individualizing and lower Binding moral foundations scores compared to low-ACE participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated a mediated link between ACEs and MFT, where positive personality traits and heightened EDNH scores positively predicted both Binding and Individualizing moral foundations. These results suggest that early nurturance promotes positive emotional development, shaping moral proclivities. Such research is instructive for clinicians, educators, and policymakers alike, informing existing practices and promoting the future development of enrichment programs that support positive childhood experiences and later moral development.",

In this chapter, we provide an overview of these models within the memory domain. We begin with the classical diffusion model along with the motivations for the \"full\" diffusion model which includes variability in drift rates and starting points and describe how such models can produce interpretable parameter estimates for testing psychological theory. In addition, we summarize the connections between diffusion models and signal detection theory, extensions to confidence, recall, and continuous responses, and how such models can serve as back-end decision models for theories of retrieval.",

          "abstract": "There is a proliferation of definitions and scales that assess climate anxiety and neighbouring constructs, but it is unclear how distinct these are in practice. We used a mixed-methods approach to examine overlaps across existing scales. We first examined how six current scales of climate anxiety represent the symptoms associated with domain-free diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and stress disorders compared to the gold-standard scales in the mental health literature. We then analysed the relationships among the climate anxiety scales using correlations and exploratory factor analysis with samples of university students (n = 143) and the general public (n = 305). Climate-related anxiety scales cover most of the symptoms associated with clinical disorders but have a higher proportion of items focusing on anxious and depressed mood, and fewer items assessing somatic symptoms compared to domain-free scales. The scales showed strong intercorrelations and loaded onto a single common factor, suggesting convergence in how climate-related anxiety has been measured in the field. Future studies could include multiple climate anxiety scales that may differ conceptually and methodologically from one another to ensure wider content representation while minimising overlap and focus on testing incremental validity to achieve a parsimonious and gold-standard measure.",

In each experiment, participants engaged in online written interaction with both versions and then evaluated their engagement with the AI. Those with anxiety reported a stronger connection to the LLM that mimicked anxiety, a distinction also reflected in the sentiment of the messages they exchanged. Extroverted participants affiliated more with the AI that mimicked extroversion. Finally, when participants interacted with LLMs that mimicked either their own Big Five personality profile or the opposite of their personality, they reported more affiliation with their doppelganger; this distinction was reflected in the sentiment of their messages. Results support affiliation in human-AI interactions based on the linguistic presentation of a shared psychology. We propose that through socioaffective tuning, LLMs might achieve greater human-like correspondence.",

          "abstract": "Mozart’s sonata for two pianos in D major, K.448, has become a de facto auditory stimulus in research linking music to cognition and brain function. This narrative critical review synthesizes three decades of peer reviewed human, clinical, and animal studies, organizing findings by task domain (attention, working memory), neural endpoints (EEG/qEEG, seizure metrics), and protocol choices (movement/segment, dose, delivery chain, control design). Across human studies, effects on visuospatial and memory performance and electrocortical indices are heterogeneous and often moderated by arousal, preference, and listening context; in epilepsy, daily listening can reduce interictal activity in some paradigms. Animal evidence supports temporal specificity: intact rhythmic structure tends to facilitate learning and plasticity markers, whereas time reversed or pitch only variants attenuate or abolish benefits; rhythm only variants sometimes preserve gains. Recurrent limitations include underspecified stimuli, small homogeneous samples, scarce preregistration, limited acoustic matching (e.g., loudness/spectral controls), and few comparisons with structurally similar repertoire. We propose a compact reporting checklist (stimulus specification, acoustic/loudness matching, delivery calibration, dose, randomization/blinding, and data sharing) and outline falsifiable predictions for CABN aligned designs that manipulate rhythm, tonality, and temporal direction while stratifying by movement and listener characteristics. Overall, K.448 remains a useful, historically rich paradigm, but its evidentiary status hinges on explicit boundary conditions and transparent design rather than authorial identity.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) allows us to maintain and manipulate information in service of behavioral goals. Navigating rich visual environments often involves holding multiple items in VWM—some of them very similar. Recent work suggests that inter-item similarity impairs memory precision during encoding but enhances precision during active memory maintenance. The present study tested whether this inter-item similarity benefit observed during memory maintenance was due to chunking similar items into summary representations. In Experiment 1, participants encoded sample displays with four colored circles into memory: two circles were similar to each other in color, two items were dissimilar to both each other and to the similar items. Using a retrospective cue (“retro-cue”) presented after the sample display, we manipulated the inter-item similarity of the remembered stimuli by cueing two similar items, one similar and one dissimilar item, or two dissimilar items. Consistent with prior work, we observed higher precision memory and attractive biases between similar items, consistent with chunking. In Experiment 2 we observed a similarity benefit and attractive bias for similar items even in the absence of a retro-cue. Importantly, the magnitude of the similarity benefit and attractive bias was the same across valid and neutral cues, suggesting that similarity-based chunking occurs early during encoding. In Experiment 3, we manipulated the onset of the retro-cue to occur early during the delay period, and we replicated the results of Experiments 1 and 2. Together, these results suggest that inter-item similarity enhances VWM performance through chunking that occurs early during encoding as opposed to during maintenance in memory.",

          "authors": "Luther Kalb",
          "abstract": "Background: Life satisfaction is a cognitive self-appraisal of one's current circumstances, influenced by both external circumstances (\"bottom-up\" factors) and features of personality (\"top-down\" factors). Life satisfaction is consistently associated with physical and mental health outcomes, making it a public health priority; however, life satisfaction in the US has been precipitously decreasing. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that could be addressed by U.S. policy for the purpose of enhancing population-level life satisfaction.\nMethods: Data for this study came from Wave 1 of the Global Flourishing Study. Seventeen actionable/modifiable variables were selected as covariates. They included a wide variety of behavioral, socioeconomic, psychological, and health factors. All variables were dichotomized for the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis, a decision-tree approach used for problems of classification. This supervised, nonparametric, multivariate method was employed to identify the most accurate set of classifiers for the continuous outcome: Life satisfaction. CART offers several advantages over traditional ordinary least squares regression, including making fewer statistical assumptions, automatically detecting nonlinear relationships, and handling a large number of variables without the risk of multicollinearity. The CART model was trained and tested using a 70/30 split of the US sample (n=38,312). The model was further tested for replication in a combined international sample of similar Western countries (United Kingdom, n=5,368; Australia, n=3,844).\nResults: Of the 17 potential covariates, only 5 were represented in the models: balance, satisfaction with relationships, purpose, mental health, and comfortability with income. Each of the three models had similar numbers of splits (5, 7, 5). In all three models, the CART analysis identified life balance as the primary node. Those with low balance (the left-hand split) had much lower life satisfaction than those who self-reported balance (nearly a 3-point difference in life satisfaction, on average). For those with low balance, mental health was the second node for all datasets, and relationship satisfaction was the final split in the test and international samples. For those with good life balance in the US (the right-hand split), the tree structure was slightly more variable, as splits on purpose, relationships, mental health and comfortability with income were observed. For the international sample, splits only occurred on relationships and purpose.\nConclusions: The results clearly show the primary factors related to life satisfaction. Life balance was the most important, followed by mental health and satisfying relationships for those with low life balance. For those with high life balance, relationships, purpose, and comfortability with income (in the US only) were most important. These findings partially diverge from our hypothesis, as balance served as the most important correlate of life balance. The study findings not only reveal the most important correlates of life satisfaction, replicated across multiple test samples, but also those that were surprisingly less important (e.g., physical health, participation in a social or religious group, exercise). The findings have significant implications for interventions and policy development since all factors included were chosen are modifiable.",

PLP is the additional price participants will pay to make a norm action public to an in-group audience when, by design, a private alternative matches both instrumental outcomes and retributive satisfaction. We isolate visibility from evaluation and arousal, and we distinguish in-group from out-group audiences. We outline three preregistered study protocols to test falsifiable predictions: in-group visibility increases PLP only when a role-based license is present, PLP collapses with an out-group or when any component is ablated, and the Anchor Index predicts performance only in verified-private work and is uncorrelated with PLP. The program will rely on revealed-preference measures, preregistered analyses, and equivalence tests for critical nulls. If confirmed, Hook is not generic reputation or threat, and Anchor is not display. If disconfirmed, the framework fails.\n\nKeywords: Drive, Instinct, Anchor, Hook, Public License Premium, in-group visibility, role-based license, audience effects, revealed preference",

We manipulated (1) causal plausibility and (2) the degree and nature of demonstrator intentionality, to explore the hypothesis that children—but not capuchins—integrate information about demonstrator intent and causal relations to infer which actions are necessary. We compared both species’ behavior to Bayesian computational models with the same varying social and physical expectations. Our results suggest that both species can learn from causal demonstrations, and that their copying behavior is affected by both the demonstration’s causal plausibility and the demonstrator’s communicative cues, but that children may be unique in interpreting communicative cues as having pedagogical intent.",

          "abstract": "While online survey data collection has become popular in the social sciences, there is a risk of data contamination by computer-generated random responses (i.e., bots). Bot prevalence poses a significant threat to data quality. If deterrence efforts fail or were not set up in advance, researchers can still attempt to detect bots already present in the data. In this research, we study a recently developed algorithm to detect survey bots. The algorithm requires neither a measurement model nor a sample of known humans and bots; thus, it is model agnostic and unsupervised. It involves a permutation test under the assumption that Likert-type items are exchangeable for bots, but not humans. While the algorithm maintains a desired sensitivity for detecting bots (e.g., 95%), its classification accuracy may depend on other inventory-specific or demographic factors. Generating hypothetical human responses from a well-known item response theory model, we use simulations to understand how classification accuracy is affected by item properties, the number of items, the number of latent factors, and factor correlations. In an additional study, we simulate bots to contaminate real human data from 36 publicly available datasets to understand the algorithm’s classification accuracy under a variety of real measurement instruments. Through this work, we identify conditions under which classification accuracy is around 95% or above, but also conditions under which accuracy is quite low. In brief, performance is better with more items, more categories per item, and a variety in the difficulty or means of the survey items.",

Nowadays, the focus of teaching quality research is shifting; Teachers’ adaptation of instruction to students and interactions between teacher and student behaviors are used increasingly to explain effective teaching. Uncertainty remains about the extent to which teachers adapt their instruction to students. Additionally, it is unclear which assessment scales measure stable teacher traits and which measures are affected by students. To address these questions, we conducted a quasi-experiment involving 146 German and math teachers and 3,980 of their students from various educational tracks in Germany. Teachers either taught the same group of students for two consecutive years or different groups each year. A difference-in-differences approach was employed to determine whether teaching quality ratings were more consistent when teachers taught the same group than when they taught different groups at both timepoints. Results suggest that especially student ratings of teaching quality and teacher ratings of student disruptions are affected by different student groups. Teachers’ ratings of their own instructional behaviors, however, are less affected. We discuss the causal informativeness of our findings regarding teachers’ instructional behaviors and give recommendations on how to interpret associations between different assessments of teaching quality with student outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Although children automatically categorize people into social groups from a young age, how they learn to automatically activate and apply category schemas to people is not well understood. In a sample of racially diverse children (N=223; Mage=7.24, SDage=2.51; 132 girls; 42.6% white; 43.05% racially minoritized), we tested the degree to which activating category schemas facilitates social categorization. Children were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words, and then categorized Black, White, and Asian faces by their gender under a time constraint. Children’s gender categorizations became more efficient with age, particularly when primed with race. Whether and how children’s gender categorizations were influenced by gender primes depended on their own social identity—white children categorized men faster than women regardless of priming condition, but priming gender attenuated this androcentric bias among racially minoritized children.",

          "abstract": "Learning to predict threat based on environmental cues, and to adapt behaviour accordingly, is critical to human survival. This type of learning is governed by distinct systems in the brain. Model-free learning is reflexive and computationally efficient, allowing for rapid responses based on past experience. In contrast, model-based learning is more flexible and relies on an internal model of the environment, which can be updated without direct experience. To enhance the translational value of human fear-conditioning research and facilitate the interpretation of fear-reduction interventions, it is essential to determine what type of learning underlies commonly used measures of conditioned responding. To address this question, we evaluated whether fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance responses (SCRs) reflected model-free and/or model-based learning in three fear-conditioning experiments (total n = 132). All experiments included a phase in which the value of the US was decreased through instructions, or through removal of the US electrode (US devaluation), enabling us to distinguish between model-based and model-free learning processes. In the first two experiments, FPS responses remained elevated after US devaluation, reflecting model-free learning, while SCRs updated instantly, indicating model-based control. In the third experiment, both measures followed a model-based pattern. We speculate that these differences between experiments are due to decreased uncertainty and overall less differential conditioning (FPS) in the third experiment. In sum, while SCRs seem best explained by a model-based account of learning, FPS responses appear able to index both model-free and model-based learning, with the balance between these two systems potentially depending on the level of uncertainty in the environment.",

However, in the present reanalyses of data simulated to resemble data used in the three evaluated studies we found contradictory increasing, decreasing, and null prospective effects, depending on the used model. In none of the six analyzed combinations of predictor and outcome variables did a meta-analytic aggregation of the prospective effects differ significantly from zero. Hence, we conclude that prospective cross-lagged effects reported by Li et al., Dong et al., and Xu et al. may have been spurious and that their conclusions of causality may have been premature. We recommend researchers to fit alternative models to their data and to juxtapose findings, e.g., through meta-analytic aggregation.

          "abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for dementia and earlier mortality, but its association with psychological health is less well-characterized. We tested for associations between TBI and depression, each ascertained multiple ways, and in opposing directions (depression predicting TBI; TBI predicting depression). \n\nMethods: Using UK Biobank data (N=502,356) we investigated bi-directional associations between TBI (ICD-10 coded broad- or narrow-band TBI) and depression (self-report and/or incident ICD-10 coded). We tested this in each direction: baseline historic TBI predicting the incidence of subsequent depression and, separately, baseline depression predicting the incidence of a first subsequent TBI. All analyses were adjusted for age at UK Biobank baseline assessment, sex, educational attainment, deprivation, smoking history, alcohol intake, physical and neurological health conditions.\n\nResults:  In participants with history of TBI (versus not), there was increased risk of subsequent incident depression, compared with participants with no documented TBI history (e.g. narrow-band TBI fully-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18 risk of depression; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.87 to 2.55; P&lt;0.001). In the other direction there was evidence that people with history of lifetime depression had significantly increased risk of subsequent incident TBI (e.g. HR = 1.76 of narrow-band TBI, 95% CI = 1.61 to 1.94, P&lt;0.001). \n\nConclusion: We show significant associations between TBI and depression: depression was a risk factor for subsequent TBI in previously unaffected participants, but also vice-versa. Psychological support should be considered post-TBI, however clinical management should consider premorbid psychological health as a possible contributing factor.",

          "abstract": "Driven by technological advances, time series (or intensive longitudinal) data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing us to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. A promising method to translate information on psychological processes unfolding over time into a statistical model is the hidden Markov model (HMM). In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. This in contrast to commonly used Vector Autoregressive (VAR) based models, which assume the time series fluctuate around a single equilibrium point. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we can obtain a description of subject-specific process dynamics and formally quantify heterogeneity across subjects.  Despite the fact that HMMs are often both theoretically interesting and can provide a better model fit for many time series, HMMs have rarely been used to model psychological time series. To create the conditions for psychological researchers to be able to use the multilevel HMM in their research, we (1) provide an accessible introduction to the use of multilevel HMMs to model continuous outcome time series data typical of intensive longitudinal data; (2) evaluate model selection and estimation performance in situations that resemble typical psychological time series research designs using an extensive numerical evaluation study, varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, subjects, and time series length; and (3) provide a fully reproducible tutorial that guides the reader through all steps of model selection, model checking, and interpretation using an openly available dataset on emotion dynamics. Our numerical evaluation results show that researchers can expect the multilevel HMM to peform well when persons are expected to switch between multiple states. Finally, we discuss how multilevel HMMs can advance the study of psychological dynamics with time series, provide empirically based recommendations,  and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "abstract": "We explore the role of social desirability in explaining how individuals respond to situational judgment test (SJT) items. We argue that SJTs can be conceptualized as measuring the knowledge of socially desirable behavior or norms in a situation or context. When scored using consensus-based keying, SJTs consistently correlated positively with general mental ability, knowledge of social norms, and socially desirable traits in samples of undergraduate students and adults from an online crowdsourcing platform regardless of test content. Additionally, we found that trait-focused SJTs function differently compared to traditional, skill-based SJTs when expert-based scoring is used. Trait-focused SJTs contain response option sets which feature differing levels of trait expression, social desirability, and effectiveness. This results in greater variability in responding due to differences in context (e.g., different instructions or organizational setting) and in greater potential for multiple scoring keys with differing patterns of convergent validity. We hope that our findings help bring attention to the role of social desirability when studying SJTs and encourage more emphasis on the characteristics of response options to complement prior research focused on the situational stems.",

          "abstract": "Background: Group music therapy is increasingly used as a tool to supplement care for depression, yet we know less about who benefits most. A previously published study named MUSED randomised trial enrolled women with depression to receive music therapy (MT) plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone and embedded ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of daily-life mood.  \nMethods: In this study, a secondary analysis of the processed Randomised Controlled Trial dataset MUSED was conducted. Outcomes were a post-treatment Back Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and a binary responder classification (≥50% BDI reduction) within the MT arm. Analyses included (i) ANCOVA adjusting for baseline BDI, baseline EMA mean, study cohort, and group; (ii) 5×5 cross-validated models (elastic-net, random forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) for classification (MT only) and regression (across all participants); and (iii) model interpretability using SHAP rankings, partial-dependence plots, and simplified logistic regression.\nResults: Post-treatment BDI was analysed for 87 participants; in the MT arm (n=52), 38.5% were responders. After adjustment, MT was associated with a 3-point lower BDI versus TAU (with adjusted difference −2.87). Higher baseline BDI and worse baseline EMA mood predicted higher (worse) post-treatment BDI; the ANCOVA explained ~63% of variance. In classification (MT only), random forest performed best (ROC AUC 74±3%; PR AUC 85±2%) with high sensitivity (83%) and modest specificity (at around 40%). For regression (all participants), random forest achieved RMSE=8.9, MAE=7.5, and R²=0.43. Across model families, SHAP analyses consistently ranked baseline EMA mean (and within-day EMA slope) as top predictors; elastic-net coefficients aligned in direction (People who began treatment with worse mood tended to have worse outcomes, while receiving music therapy was linked to lower (better) predicted BDI scores).\nConclusions: MT+TAU reduced depressive symptoms beyond TAU, and everyday mood at intake, captured through EMA, was the most informative signal for both who responds and how well patients do. These baseline-only models can support care planning by prioritising likely beneficiaries, pinpointing those needing extra support, and contextualising MT’s added value alongside usual care.",

          "abstract": "Despite the popularity of structural equation modeling in psychological research,\naccurately evaluating the fit of these models to data is still challenging. Using fixed fit\nindex cutoffs is error-prone due to the fit indices’ dependence on various features of the\nmodel and data (“nuisance parameters”). Nonetheless, applied researchers mostly rely on\nfixed fit index cutoffs, neglecting the risk of falsely accepting (or rejecting) their model.\nWith the goal of developing a broadly applicable method that is almost independent of\nnuisance parameters, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based approach to evaluate\nthe fit of multi-factorial measurement models. We trained an ML model based on 173\nmodel and data features that we extracted from 1,323,866 simulated data sets and models\nfitted by means of confirmatory factor analysis (i.e., training observations). We evaluated\nthe performance of the ML model based on 1,659,386 test observations unseen during\nmodel training. The ML model performed very well in detecting model (mis-)fit in the\nmajority of conditions, thereby outperforming the fixed fit index cutoffs by Hu and Bentler\n(1999) across the board. Only minor misspecifications—single neglected residual\ncorrelations (and cross-loadings), in particular—proved to be challenging to detect. From\nthis proof-of-concept study we conclude that ML is very promising in the context of model\nfit evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Personalized psychiatry demands digital twins that translate individual brain connectomes into predictions of multidomain functions (e.g., emotion, cognition) and treatment responses. We present a digital twin brain framework where a Hypernetwork, using resting-state connectomes, generates parameters for a Main recurrent network. This enables the Main network to jointly simulate behavioral and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time series across multiple tasks. Validated in a transdiagnostic cohort (n=228), our model demonstrated high-fidelity prediction of behavioral choices (&gt;90% accuracy), reaction times (r&gt;0.85), and distributed BOLD activation (r=0.84) during affective and cognitive tasks, capturing individual neurobehavioral dynamics. Leveraging the model's differentiability, we identified gradient-based connectome manipulation targets (e.g., limbic, parietal, prefrontal) to selectively modulate affective or cognitive functions. Crucially, in-silico trials simulating these manipulations reproduced realistic inter-individual variability in treatment effects (effect size range &gt;2 SD). This establishes our digital twin brain as a quantitative, mechanistic platform for simulating and designing personalized psychiatric interventions.",

Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. Undergraduate Psychology students completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. Participants were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation was moderated by gesture use: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning only when they indicated being motivated, but the presence of gestures ensured consistent learning gain regardless of motivation levels. These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed.

          "authors": "Sophie Wilhelmina Berkhout; Noémi Katalin Schuurman; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Ambulatory assessment has gained widespread popularity among researchers who study the dynamics of everyday experiences and behaviors, such as sleep patterns or emotional states. In this paper, we focus on the challenge that arises when we want to investigate the dynamic relations between variables that were measured at different frequencies. As a running example, we use a sleep quality variable measured once every morning and a mood variable measured multiple times during the day for multiple days. We propose two N=1 models that imply different processes; the first focuses on dynamic relations from day to day between sleep quality and a daily factor of the mood variable, and the second focuses on dynamic relations from one measurement occasion to the next, which prioritizes when the variables affect each other. Additionally, we introduce a combination of these two models and demonstrate their accuracy with a simulation study. An empirical N=1 example of daily sleep quality and momentary self-doubt demonstrates that dynamic relations exist between sleep quality and self-doubt at certain moments in the day and the daily factor of self-doubt. Researchers may adjust the proposed dynamic models to align with their own theories and to accommodate different data or research interests.",

          "authors": "Giuliano Groer; Annika Iris Külpmann; Armin Zlomuzica; Laurin Plank",
          "abstract": "The Autobiographical Interview (AI) is one of the most used method for quantifying episodic memory from memory narratives. Its manual scoring, however, is limited and demands considerable time and effort. These issues have been recently addressed by the use of natural language processing (NLP) allowing for automatic, unbiased and less time-consuming scoring of memory performance in the context of the AI. Since existing NLP models for AI analysis are primarily designed for English narratives, this study investigated whether machine translation could enable their effective use on German narratives without significantly reducing classification accuracy. We evaluated model performance on a total of 1,920 German narratives generated by 258 individuals across two datasets. We further provided an open-source analysis code. We demonstrate that correlations between predicted and manually rated internal and external details were highly significant and comparable to existing studies performed with English narratives. Machine translation of German narratives allows for high classification accuracy and low frequency of misclassification without a meaningful impairment of model performance compared to English narratives. We observed no performance differences across translation models, indicating lightweight models perform equally well. Our findings support the use of NLP as an alternative cost- and time-efficient approach for automated AI  scoring in non-English-speaking populations. Our results highlight the potential of language models for large-scale memory research across languages. We conclude that NLP enables more detailed analyses of episodic memory narratives beyond traditional manual scoring.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

          "abstract": "For many autistic individuals, close family members represent a crucial source of support throughout their lifetime. Early diagnosis of autism is thought to benefit to both autistic individuals and their family members by facilitating early access to services and information. However, little research has empirically studied the relationship between age at diagnosis and wellbeing among individuals with autism and their family members. In this study, we examined predictors of age at autism diagnosis and its relationship with family wellbeing using the population-based Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child cohort study (MoBa). We found that the most important factors associated with a later age at diagnosis were fewer social communication difficulties at age 3, fewer maternal concerns about development in early childhood, the absence of a co-occurring intellectual disability diagnosis, female sex, and having older siblings . We also found that a later age at diagnosis is associated with higher wellbeing for mothers and children during childhood, whereas it is associated with lower wellbeing for children during adolescence. Importantly, all associations were substantially attenuated after adjustment for a range of clinical, demographic, and genetic factors – reflecting the complex patterns of confounding that influence observed relationships between age at diagnosis and family wellbeing. We argue that future research should aim to leverage public awareness campaigns, screening programmes, or changes in clinical practice to understand the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated voices are increasingly prevalent in our lives, via virtual assistants, automated customer service, and voice-overs. With increased availability and affordability of AI-generated voices, we need to examine how humans perceive them. Recently, an intriguing effect was reported in AI-generated faces, where such face images were perceived as more human than images of real humans - a “hyperrealism effect.” Here, we tested whether a “hyperrealism effect” also exists for AI-generated voices. We investigated the extent to which AI-generated voices sound real to human listeners, and whether listeners can accurately distinguish between human and AI-generated voices. We also examined perceived social trait characteristics (trustworthiness and dominance) of human and AI-generated voices. We tested these questions using AI-generated voices generated with and without a specific human counterpart (i.e., voice clones, and voices generated from the latent space of a large voice model).\nWe find that voice clones can sound as real as human voices, making it difficult for listeners to distinguish between them. However, we did not observe a hyperrealism effect. Both types of AI-generated voices were evaluated as more dominant than human voices, with some AI-generated voices also being perceived as more trustworthy. These findings raise questions for future research: Can hyperrealistic voices be created with more advanced technology, or is the lack of a hyperrealism effect due to differences between voice and face (image) perception? Our findings also highlight the potential for AI-generated voices to misinform and fraud, alongside opportunities to use realistic AI-generated voices for beneficial purposes.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This paper critically analyzes the legal and ethical framework for patient rights in Nigeria, arguing that a significant chasm exists between codified rights and their judicial enforceability. While the Constitution, the National Health Act (NHA) 2014, and the Patients’ Bill of Rights (PBoR) establish a foundational legal architecture, their practical application is undermined by systemic, socio-cultural, and institutional challenges. Employing a doctrinal and comparative legal methodology, this analysis contrasts Nigeria’s aspirational framework with the more robust, justiciable models found in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Canada/the United States. Findings reveal that low public and professional health literacy, a deeply entrenched paternalistic culture, and a fragmented, inefficient legal system, evidenced by a medical malpractice litigation rate of only 1.1%, collectively render patient rights largely ineffective. The report concludes with an evidence-based roadmap for reform, proposing a multi-faceted strategy that includes: a constitutional amendment to create a justiciable right to health, new legislation to establish direct institutional liability for systemic failures, the implementation of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) pilot programs, and mandatory integration of health law and ethics into medical curricula. These reforms are essential to translate legal principles into tangible remedies, foster a patient-centered culture, and ultimately strengthen Nigeria’s commitment to achieving universal health coverage and improving public trust in its healthcare system",

While social media influencers are often accused of contributing to the spread of misinformation, little is known about their potential role in combating it. In two pre-registered online experiments (N = 1004), we therefore investigated for the first time whether human and AI-generated influencers can effectively correct misinformation. The results show that influencers can successfully correct misperceptions on a politically non-polarized topic (mental health). On a politically polarized topic (climate change), however, only the correction of the AI-generated influencer significantly reduced the misperceptions. Overall, the results demonstrate that influencers can support the fight against misinformation and suggest that AI-generated influencers may be particularly effective in addressing more polarized political topics.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The Borno State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency (BOSCHMA) Law (2018) established a contributory health insurance framework covering public, private, and informal sectors, with explicit provisions for vulnerable groups such as internally displaced persons (IDPs), women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. However, its implementation in a post-conflict setting faced challenges of financial instability, governance risks, systemic weaknesses, and conflict-related disruptions.\nThis article employs doctrinal legal analysis supported by policy review and comparative evidence to critically assess both the 2018 Law and the BOSCHMA Bill, 2025, within Nigeria’s decentralized health insurance landscape. Drawing on legislative texts, policy documents, and international comparators, the analysis examines institutional design, financing arrangements, and service delivery provisions, evaluating their alignment with Universal Health Coverage (UHC) principles and responsiveness to Borno’s conflict-affected population.\nFindings highlight significant progress in the 2025 Bill, including the harmonization of references with the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) Act 2022, legislated percentage-based contributions for public servants, and statutory provisions mandating transparent, evidence-based identification of indigent and vulnerable populations. These reforms directly address weaknesses in the 2018 Law, particularly the outdated references to the repealed NHIS Act and ambiguities in defining vulnerable groups. Nonetheless, operational challenges remain, including ensuring sustainable financing, institutional capacity-building, public trust, and delivery of guaranteed benefit packages in fragile settings.\nThe review recommends embedding transparent beneficiary identification systems, defining explicit benefit entitlements, strengthening governance and accountability frameworks, and institutionalizing robust monitoring mechanisms. Lessons from national reforms and global post-conflict models provide actionable pathways for implementation. The Borno case—now reinforced by the 2025 Bill—offers critical insights for advancing UHC in fragile and conflict-affected contexts worldwide.",

Fifty-three adults (22 males, 31 females) completed a within-subject experiment, watching either a comedy performance or a neutral weather broadcast, then judging the valence of morphed facial expressions (10–30% intensity) shown with or without a mask. Comedy viewing significantly increased positive mood (POMS2-BF VA: p &lt; .001, r = .43) and reduced negative mood (e.g., TA: p = .004, r = .69).

          "abstract": "Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is central to safeguarding health systems, but in Saudi Arabia it raises critical questions: is IPC an ethical and legal obligation, or merely a professional option? Drawing on the Kingdom’s experiences with MERS-CoV, COVID-19, and the rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) under Vision 2030, this article interrogates IPC through the intersecting lenses of statutory law, Islamic bioethics, and global health governance.\nThe analysis identifies three persistent challenges: (1) weak enforcement of the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) in health data use, (2) unresolved liability in AI-driven surveillance and decision-making, and (3) ethical tensions in isolation orders, digital contact tracing, and vaccination mandates. Islamic principles of maslahah (public interest), adl (justice), amanah (trust), and darura (necessity) are shown to provide a culturally coherent framework for balancing collective safety with individual rights.\nThe article makes three key contributions. First, it demonstrates how Saudi statutory law operationalizes these ethical commitments but suffers from enforcement gaps. Second, it highlights the underexplored legal risks of AI adoption in IPC, particularly algorithmic bias and liability. Third, it proposes a governance model integrating ethical oversight committees, AI-specific regulation, and inclusive engagement of religious scholars, healthcare professionals, and the public.\nActionable recommendations include strengthening PDPL enforcement through independent oversight, embedding Islamic bioethics into IPC training, and institutionalizing transparent, participatory governance. By reframing IPC as a binding obligation rather than optional, the article positions Saudi Arabia to advance ethically grounded, legally robust, and culturally resonant infection prevention aligned with Vision 2030.",

          "abstract": "With increased interest in the replication crisis and the open science movement, it is important to examine the implications of communicating these topics to undergraduate psychology students. At the beginning of the open science movement, the effort to improve research practices was seen and discussed as both an individual and systemic endeavor. Some authors placed the focus on individual researchers, encouraging them to engage in practices like pre-registration and open data. Others, however, placed the responsibility with the system, arguing that incentive structures and norms need to reward these new practices. The current project examined whether using individual vs. systemic teaching approaches impacted psychology student’s trust, motivation, and optimism regarding the field of psychology. Undergraduate psychology students (N= 476) were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions, one specifying how researchers’ practices should change (individual), one specifying on incentive structures should change (systemic), and one summarizing general research practices in psychology. I expected to find that participants in the individual condition would show the highest levels of trust in the field, motivation to improve the field, and optimism, while participants in the systemic condition would show the highest trust in psychological researchers. Overall, while our manipulation effectively influenced participants' perceptions of the teaching approaches, the expected differences in trust, motivation, and optimism were not consistently observed.

          "abstract": "Judgment is often described in terms of an intuitive (System 1) versus deliberative (System 2) dichotomy, yet sound deliberation itself can take more than one form. Building on philosophical traditions and distinctions in treatment of sound judgment in economics and law, we propose that lay conceptions revolve around two distinct types of deliberate judgment: rational, emphasizing rule-based and utility-focused reasoning for well-defined problems, and reasonable, prioritizing context-sensitive and socially conscious reasoning for ill-defined problems. Across four studies in English-speaking Western samples (Studies 1–4; N = 2,130) and a Mandarin-speaking Chinese sample (Study 4; N = 697), participants described their notions of “sound” and “good” judgment, evaluated social scenarios, chose between candidates with distinct judgmental profiles, and categorized non-social objects. Results consistently showed that people view both rationality and reasonableness as common forms of deliberate sound judgment, while treating them as distinct. Participants preferred rational deliberation for algorithmic social roles linked to well-defined tasks and reasonable deliberation for interpretive roles linked to ill-defined tasks. Moreover, framing decisions as rational vs. reasonable influenced whether participants relied on rule-based vs. overall-similarity strategies in classification tasks. These findings suggest that lay understanding of sound judgment does not rely on a single standard of judgmental competence. Instead, people recognize that both rationality and reasonableness are critical for competent deliberation on different types of problems in life.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a formal framework for understanding language in cognitive systems, distinguishing the Metalanguage of Cognition (MLC), an internal system of vector-based cognitive dynamics, from the External Language of Meaning (ELM), a symbolic system for communication. Rooted in Principia Cognitia (PC), which is grounded in a materialist ontology and distinguishing phenomena from their discrete signal representations, the framework defines MLC as a triple (S, R, O) of semions (vector representations of cognitive units), weighted relations, and operations, while ELM is a symbol set Σ linked via a mapping μ: S→Σ that transforms internal representations into external symbols, often losing structural detail. Grounded in the axiom that cognition is an activatable vector structure, this framework resolves philosophical challenges, such as Searle’s Chinese Room paradox, by showing that understanding requires MLC, not just ELM. Empirical evidence from transformer-based large language models (LLMs), where residual streams encode belief state geometries, validates semions as cognitive units. The MLC-ELM model unifies biological and artificial cognition, redefines rationality through metacognitive operations like detecting knowledge gaps (e.g., recognizing unfamiliar concepts), and informs AI design by prioritizing internal cognitive alignment. This substrate-neutral, testable framework advances cognitive science, neuroscience, AI, and philosophy.",

          "abstract": "Exposure is highly effective for treating acrophobia and there is growing consensus that cognitive mechanisms play an important role in exposure-based therapies. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether adding a Cognitive Bias Modification - Interpretation (CBM-I) training to a single-session exposure therapy further facilitates cognitive change. The sample included diagnosed acrophobia patients (N = 81), all of whom received exposure therapy. One day later they were randomized to receive either CBM-I or a sham training. The CBM-I trained patients to interpret and appraise ambiguous, height-related scenarios in a less threatening and adaptive manner, whereas the sham training comprised ambiguous, neutral scenarios. Outcomes included changes in interpretational biases (Encoding Recognition Task, Heights Interpretation Questionnaire, Scrambled Sentences Task), acrophobia-related symptoms (Acrophobia Questionnaire), and behavioral avoidance (Behavioral Approach Test). In intention-to-treat analyses patients receiving CBM-I showed a greater reduction in interpretational biases post-training compared to the sham condition (primary outcome). However, group differences were not sustained at follow-up and, i.e., both groups demonstrated improvements across all outcomes, except for the Scrambled Sentences Task. No significant group differences in reductions in other acrophobia-related cognitions, symptoms, or behavior emerged over time. Exploratory analyses revealed strong associations between the assessed cognitive, behavioral, and subjective outcomes, but neither of these outcomes correlated with the hormonal measures (progesterone, estradiol). To conclude, our findings suggest that while CBM-I can temporarily facilitate cognitive change in the context of exposure, its long-term benefits and downstream effects may require further optimization. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols to maximize its efficacy as a potential adjunct to exposure therapy.",

While school-based mindfulness training (SBMT) offers a scalable prevention approach with broad reach, evidence of its effectiveness is mixed, and there is a compelling case for a more personalized approach to prevention.\n\nObjective: To develop a data-driven algorithm from baseline characteristics to predict which adolescents are most likely to benefit from SBMT.\n\nDesign: Secondary analysis of the My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2016-2018. Machine learning models were trained on 70% of schools and validated in the remaining 30% from different schools.\n\nSetting: Eighty-four broadly representative UK secondary schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nParticipants: A total of 8,376 adolescents aged 11-13 years at baseline were included. Students had to be enrolled in participating schools with parental consent and student assent. The sample was 55% female, 76% White ethnicity, with mean age 12.2 years.\n\nInterventions: SBMT teaching core mindfulness skills through psychoeducation, class discussion, and practices, compared to standard social-emotional learning (teaching-as-usual; TAU) covering topics such as relationships and mental health education.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Causal forest and elastic net regression models computed Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) scores quantifying individual expected benefit from SBMT vs. TAU.\n\nResults: While the overall RCT found no average benefit of SBMT over TAU, the PAI model identified a subset of adolescents (19%) with significantly better depression outcomes when assigned to SBMT (d = 0.22, p = .037), and a larger subgroup (37%) who benefited more from TAU (d = 0.22, p = .004). Top predictive features were primarily student-level variables, including baseline emotional symptoms, executive functioning difficulties, mindfulness skills, and anxiety. Prediction was strongest for depressive symptoms, with mixed findings for two other trial outcomes (social–emotional–behavioural functioning and well-being).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Machine learning can identify adolescents differentially likely to benefit from SBMT versus TAU, offering a path toward more personalized school-based prevention. Future prospective trials should test whether algorithm-guided intervention assignment improves clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Many people aim to eat healthier or become more physically active, yet often fail. Identifying aspects of behavior that are easier to change is crucial for effective interventions. Two preregistered online studies assessed participants' perceived ease of changing eating and physical activity (PA) behavior and explored potential moderators. Young adults predominantly without (Study 1, N = 435, Mage = 31.6) and older adults predominantly with chronic conditions (Study 2, N = 637, Mage = 57.2) indicated the perceived ease of changing 21 aspects of eating and PA, medical history, social comparison, prior behavior change attempts and current behavior. Young adults found increasing consumption and engaging in high-intensity PA easiest, reflecting hedonic goals and high self-efficacy. Conversely, older adults found reducing consumption and sedentary behavior easiest, possibly driven by health motivation and physical limitations. Prior attempts and social comparison showed divergent impacts across groups, possibly influenced by differing learning trajectories and health priorities. Lower unhealthy food consumption correlated with easier reduction, while high PA did not always translate to perceiving further increases in PA easier. Tailored interventions aligning goals with perceived capabilities and priorities are essential to maximize engagement and adherence. Longitudinal research is needed to establish causality and refine strategies.",

          "abstract": "Missing data are a common challenge in multilevel designs, and multiple imputation (MI) is often used for handling them. Past research has shown that multilevel MI provides an effective treatment of missing data, so long as the imputation model takes the multilevel structure and the intended analyses into account, and modern methods have been developed that can accommodate even complex types of analyses. However, multilevel MI can be difficult to apply in practice, where the multilevel structure is often not very pronounced or not of immediate interest in the analysis. In these applications, existing methods can become unstable and often struggle to provide reliable results. In this article, we introduce a fully conditional specification approach to multilevel MI that combines single-level imputation methods with group means (GM) or adjusted group means (AGM) to accommodate the multilevel structure. Based on a theoretical investigation and multiple simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of these methods in different applications, including applications with balanced designs, unbalanced designs, and larger numbers of variables. Our findings suggest that the AGM approach—though not the GM approach—performs well in most of the scenarios we investigated and can even outperform conventional approaches to multilevel MI in challenging applications. We also provide an illustrative example for the implementation of these methods in a simulated example, and we discuss the implications of our findings for practice.",

          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Counterfactual thinking, the ability to mentally represent how events might have unfolded differently, plays a central role in decision-making, memory, learning, and emotional regulation, and has even been described as a foundation of human cognition itself. Yet the neural systems supporting this capacity remain debated. Here, we present a quantitative meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies, synthesising evidence across tasks involving both simulated counterfactuals, where individuals deliberately imagine alternative self-referential scenarios, and computed counterfactuals, where the brain evaluates unchosen outcomes during decision-making. This analysis identified a distributed network encompassing the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala. Within this network, the OFC emerged as a hub for representing counterfactual options and their value, while the ACC, particularly its dorsal subdivision, linked these representations to behavioural control. The hippocampus supported constructive aspects of counterfactual thought, overlapping with episodic memory processes, and the amygdala contributed to the affective responses, particularly regret. Separate analyses for simulated and computed counterfactuals revealed partial dissociations. Simulated counterfactuals recruited the superior frontal gyrus, involved in constructive memory processes. Computed counterfactuals engaged the striatum, where fictive error signals encoded the value of unchosen outcomes and predicted subsequent behaviour. These findings indicate that counterfactual thinking relies on distinct but interacting systems for valuation, control, memory, and emotion, highlighting its multifaceted role in adaptive human cognition.",

However, to date, no validated measure has existed with which to quantify TNB identity support in romantic relationships. We used a four-stage process to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of TNB identity support from romantic partners. First, we generated items based on prior qualitative research, then used cognitive interviews with six TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to refine the items. Second, we piloted 59 items in a survey of 321 TNB people (16 years and older) reporting on current or recent romantic relationships. Using those data, we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify subscales, then selected 19 items based on factor loadings, item-subscale correlations, α-if-item-deleted, discrimination parameters, and item information curves. Third, we used weekly diary survey data from 299 romantically partnered TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to perform confirmatory factor analysis and assess reliability at the within- and between-relationship levels. Results indicate that the 19-item Transgender/Nonbinary Identity Support from Partners Scale (TISPS) assesses five forms of TNB identity support—Facilitation [of identity exploration], Identity Validation, Celebration, Allyship, and Understanding—with a consistent factor structure and good reliability at the between-relationship level. Psychometric results were poorer for weekly within-relationship variation, suggesting that TISPS subscales have suboptimal properties for assessing short-term change. The TISPS can be used in clinical and community settings and future research on the role of social support in TNB mental health.",

Yet, the field faces ongoing debates, including the extent to which life satisfaction is stable versus changeable, the validity of the U-shaped age trajectory, and the relative contributions of domain-specific satisfactions to global evaluations of life quality. We examined life satisfaction trajectories and how demographic covariates and satisfaction with specific domains influence life satisfaction over 13 waves of data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N = 6,711). Using nonlinear growth curve modeling, we found that life satisfaction remained relatively stable over the 13 waves (average of 5.06 to 5.26 out of 7), with small but significant variations based on demographic characteristics. Older individuals and those identifying as ethnic minorities reported higher baseline satisfaction, while males experienced steeper changes over time relative to females. Domain-specific satisfaction (leisure, income, health) predicted global life satisfaction at each wave; leisure satisfaction was consistently the strongest predictor. Plotting observed life satisfaction against age provided descriptive support for a U-shaped pattern, with higher satisfaction in early and later adulthood and lower satisfaction in midlife. These findings contribute to theoretical debates by showing that while life satisfaction has trait-like qualities (i.e., is stable over time), is also influenced by domain-specific appraisals (particularly leisure). The results thus support bottom-up models of well-being, highlighting the importance of personally valued life domains in understanding both stability and change in life satisfaction.",

          "authors": "Zahra Azizi; Jason Chan; Tomas Ward; Annalisa Setti",
          "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI)–the brain’s ability to combine information from different ‎senses–is crucial for coherent perception and adaptive behavior. While often viewed as a ‎bottom-up process, emerging research shows internal states like emotional arousal can ‎modulate MSI. The role of metacognition–our awareness of perceptual accuracy–‎remains underexplored in this context, particularly in relation to multisensory illusions ‎such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). This study examined how facially ‎induced emotional arousal affects audiovisual integration and metacognitive efficiency ‎during the SIFI task. It also assessed whether individual differences in sensory-‎processing sensitivity (via the Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) influence these ‎effects. Fifty-five participants completed an online SIFI task, where neutral or disgusted ‎facial cues preceded audiovisual stimuli across six stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). ‎Participants reported the number of flashes and rated their confidence. Accuracy and ‎confidence improved at longer SOAs. However, while confidence was unaffected by the ‎pre/post condition, accuracy was significantly influenced, indicating a dissociation ‎between performance and subjective certainty. Emotional cues did not affect accuracy or ‎confidence, but higher HSP scores were linked to lower metacognitive efficiency, ‎especially in negative emotional contexts (β = –0.16, p = .04), though the interaction ‎was not statistically significant. Bayesian analysis suggested a 75% chance of a negative ‎interaction, but with uncertainty. These findings highlight that while arousal doesn’t ‎impair MSI, high sensory sensitivity may reduce introspective accuracy in emotional ‎contexts, with implications for decision-making and responsive technology design.‎",

          "authors": "Jason Geller; Matti Vuorre; Chelsea Parlett; Robert Kubinec",
          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

          "authors": "Samantha Bertschi; Monica D. Rosenberg; Edward K. Vogel; Matthieu Chidharom",
          "abstract": "Sustained attention fluctuates continuously between periods of low and high attentional engagement. Two major approaches have been used in the literature to capture these fluctuations. An objective approach, based on reaction time (RT) variability, identifies periods known as in-the-zone (stable and accurate) and out-of-the-zone (variable and error-prone). A subjective approach relies on participants’ self-reports regarding task-related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs). While both methods have proven effective in tracking attentional fluctuations, it remains unclear whether they capture the same type of fluctuations. In this study, we aimed to better characterize the subjective experience associated with objectively defined out-of-the-zone periods. Thirty participants completed a classic sustained attention task—the Continuous Performance Task (CPT)—in a go/no-go format. At several points during the task, participants were interrupted with subjective probes assessing their current mental state (task-focused, performance-focused, external distraction, daydreaming, and mind-blanking), as well as their perceived effort, opportunity cost, and arousal. Our results offer a nuanced view of the relationship between subjective and objective approaches. We found evidence for consistency: out-of-the-zone periods were more frequently associated with daydreaming than in-the-zone periods. However, inconsistencies also emerged. In-the-zone periods were marked by faster RTs, whereas subjective on-task periods were associated with slower responses. Arousal was reduced during TUT periods but did not differ between in- and out-of-the-zone periods. Together, these findings suggest that while RT variability reflects some aspects of subjective experience, subjective and objective approaches may diverge in how they capture performance dynamics and internal states such as arousal.",

          "abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for dementia and earlier mortality, but its association with psychological health is less well-characterized. We tested for associations between TBI and depression, each ascertained multiple ways, and in opposing directions (depression predicting TBI; TBI predicting depression). \n\nMethods: Using UK Biobank data (N=502,356) we investigated bi-directional associations between TBI (ICD-10 coded broad- or narrow-band TBI) and depression (self-report and/or incident ICD-10 coded). We tested this in each direction: baseline historic TBI predicting the incidence of subsequent depression and, separately, baseline depression predicting the incidence of a first subsequent TBI. All analyses were adjusted for age at UK Biobank baseline assessment, sex, educational attainment, deprivation, smoking history, alcohol intake, physical and neurological health conditions.\n\nResults:  In participants with history of TBI (versus not), there was increased risk of subsequent incident depression, compared with participants with no documented TBI history (e.g. narrow-band TBI fully-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18 risk of depression; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.87 to 2.55; P&lt;0.001). In the other direction there was evidence that people with history of lifetime depression had significantly increased risk of subsequent incident TBI (e.g. HR = 1.76 of narrow-band TBI, 95% CI = 1.61 to 1.94, P&lt;0.001). \n\nConclusion: We show significant associations between TBI and depression: depression was a risk factor for subsequent TBI in previously unaffected participants, but also vice-versa. Psychological support should be considered post-TBI, however clinical management should consider premorbid psychological health as a possible contributing factor.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people are at higher risk of dying by suicide than non-autistic people, but research focused on suicide prevention for this group is lacking. We asked autistic people and those who support them about pathways to suicide prevention, the balance of crisis measures vs. longer-term prevention, the importance of formal diagnosis, and the role of co-production.\nWe used an online survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Participants were 2463 autistic people and 315 non-autistic people who supported or had been bereaved by the suicide of an autistic person. We thematically analysed their free-text responses. \nAlthough participants reported that crisis interventions (e.g., dedicated helplines) were helpful, they preferred larger-scale preventative measures (e.g., improving support in schools) which better addressed systemic inequalities. Participants were positive about providing support to people awaiting autism assessment, but some were less supportive of providing dedicated autism supports to people who self-diagnose or who are not currently diagnosed (but may be questioning autism). Most participants viewed co-production as vital for ensuring interventions reflect the expertise and empathy of autistic people.\nSuicide in autistic people must be viewed in the context of pervasive and systemic injustices, rather than individualistic psychopathology. Accordingly, the extent to which crisis interventions can reduce suicide rates is contingent on additional systemic, preventative and coordinated actions to tackle the social determinants of suicide and support enduring wellbeing in this group. Support should be produced in partnership with autistic people and their advocates, and needs- rather than diagnosis-based.",

          "authors": "Catherine Molho; Ivan Soraperra; Jonathan Friedemann Schulz; Shaul Shalvi",
          "abstract": "Impersonal prosociality is considered a cornerstone of a thriving civic society, well-functioning institutions, and a growing economy. Previous research has documented substantial cross-societal variation in prosociality using tasks such as dictator games, where individuals allocate money between themselves and others. In such tasks, individuals typically receive full information about how decisions impact others and make decisions privately. Here, we propose that different societies rely on distinct mechanisms—guilt and internalized norms versus shame and external pressures—to support prosociality. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 7,978 participants in 20 culturally diverse countries across five continents. We administered dictator games and experimentally manipulated guilt, by varying information about the consequences of participants’ decisions (full versus hidden), and shame, by varying observability (public versus private). Additionally, we measured the Importance of Guilt over Shame (IGS) at the individual and country level.  We found robust evidence for guilt-driven prosociality around the world, such that prosociality increased substantially when individuals received information by default compared to when they could avoid it. Further, providing information led to a stronger increase in prosociality among individuals, though not countries, scoring higher on IGS. In contrast, making decisions observable by third parties had only small effects on prosocial choices. Our study provides a first comprehensive investigation of how guilt and shame influence prosocial decision-making, and uncovers both similarities and differences in mechanisms to promote prosociality across countries.",

          "abstract": "The high rate of Urbanization and loss of bird habitat at the global level is increasing day by day and now due to this activity challenging ecosystem will create problems in the future because more people prefer to live in the cities. The main objective of the study was to know the current status of urban bird diversity, their habitat, and their conservation plan. Point count and Line transect methods were used for the bird survey. The various bird species with population were sighted through binocular and species identification was done by using different identification keys. Photograph of birds was taken by the Nikon DSLR camera and the GPS locations of each study site were recorded in the datasheet. The total numbers of 104 bird species were recorded from all study sites belonging to 16 orders and 48 families. In recent times some species migrated from urban to semi-urban areas because they have not existed in narrow habitats. However, some scavenger birds are seen at dead animal dumping sites. Family Columbidae was found dominant with 6% contribution followed by families like Muscicapidae, Sturnidae, Motacillidae, Scolopacidae, and Anatidae with 5% contribution each and further followed by other families with less than 5% contribution. These present results indicate that Rock dove is highly habituated in the urban ecosystem while House sparrow, Golden oriole, Grey hornbill, and Egyptian vulture are sensitive species. So they are seen as local migratory species. A conservation plan is needed to develop green belts at street level and with the maintenance of the old garden; new parks should be established in urban areas. The artificial nest (wooden nest), food (mixed grains), and water properly take place in parks. Birds are also important for the maintenance of the ecosystem because they act as an effective tool for biological pest control.",

          "abstract": "The objective of the study was to provide insights on disruptions faced by farmers due to COVID-19 for harvest of rabi (winter) crop and preparations for kharif (summer) crop and to suggest appropriate policy measures to enable farmers to cope with similar disruptions in agricultural activities. Data were collected from 125 farmers from five tribal hamlets of Deverkonda mandal of Nalgonda district of Telangana state. The major constraints reported by almost all the farmers (99.2%) were financial problems primarily due to loss of wage work, repayment of informal loans (83%), fear of contracting COVID-19 (92%) and health of family members (89%) which adversely affected their work efficiency. Paddy crop was the most affected as rated by 80.8% of the farmers, followed by vegetables 52.8%, groundnut 41.6%, cotton 37.6%, redgram 16.8% and fruit crops(sweet lime) 13.6% respectively. The farmers faced problems in land preparation (92.8%), high cost of inputs (96.8%), and low availability of inputs (75.2%), transport problems to procure inputs (96.8%), labour shortage (67.2%) and storage of unsold produce (75.2%). Shortage of animal feed (79.2%) and health care of animals (85.6%) were the constraints faced in livestock care. The harvesting of paddy was the most affected due to shortage of labour and harvesting machines. Community seed and animal feed banks, collectives like farmer producer organizations, collateral free credit, small packaging of inputs, promotion of youth entrepreneurship in processing storage and sale of produce and mechanization of small farms, direct procurement, logistic support are some of the immediate and mid- term measures being suggested for building resilience of food systems to face future risks.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the usage and benefits of business intelligence in personal care industry of the Middle East. Business intelligence is driving the placement of brands to be a part of consumer’s consideration set. Generally Saudi Arabia and UAE are considered the leading Gulf Corporate Countries (GCC) in skincare and cosmetic consumptions due to several factors including population, climatic, urbanization, tourism and high-volume of resided expatriates. The authors have focused on the integration of business intelligence in communication, influencers-marketing, trending ingredients and market adaptation. The critical review is being followed by quantitative data to support the findings. The research was conducted on 150 sample-size in five different countries (Oman, Bahrain, U.A.E., Saudi Arabia and Qatar) within five-month span. The online questionnaire utilized the random convenience sampling technique to obtain first-hand analysis as well as ordinal and nominal scale with additional open-ended questions. The questionnaire results highlighted Middle Eastern consumers’ motives when selecting skin/personal care products according its social-media popularity, trend, and real-time results. The survey analysis has provided a valuable insight to cosmetic brands in terms of consumers’ habits, choice, and demographics to invest and explore new market segments intelligently. The findings empathized the trends that the leading cosmetic brands should follow for updating the ingredients and enhance product transparency to achieve client loyalty. Moreover, being gender-natural is one of the key-factors in adapting today’s cosmetic global market. The present findings have supported the prior, however limited research that the heuristics side of any decision taken based on datamining cannot be guaranteed unless the potential segment can relate to the same. The pioneer brands in the personal care industry proposed the revamping of competitive advantage based on business intelligence on a regular basis. The present study is a novel attempt in the proposed area as no literature is available for the personal care industry in the Middle East region in terms of an empirical research. Finally, the recommendations have been divided into various subsections including Diversification and inclusiveness, Product Strategy, Prioritize transparency, Product Sustainability and E-Commerce and Technology.",

          "abstract": "Personality interventions are a field of growing interest, as many people want to change aspects of their personality and personality trait changes promise to positively impact important life outcomes. Although initial research shows that personality interventions can be successful in eliciting lasting trait changes, the strategies, timing, and context of effective personality interventions remain unclear. A careful examination of how these characteristics would advance intervention effectiveness and theoretical models of volitional personality change. We used intensive longitudinal data from the Changing How I Live Life (CHILL) Study to examine the effects of different intervention strategies and their timing and situational context on intervention adherence, satisfaction, and changes in momentary positive affect as proximal intervention outcomes. The CHILL Study is a multi-method intervention study combining experience sampling methods and mobile sensing to investigate the effects of a smartphone intervention to decrease neuroticism (N = 399; 39,878 assessments). Intervention strategies that targeted the state level of neuroticism had more positive effects on people’s momentary affect than habit-level strategies, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of successful personality change. Furthermore, effects differed depending on the timing and situational context of intervention prompts, pointing to possibilities of optimizing the timing of personality interventions. For example, people were more likely to adhere to intervention prompts in quieter environments or at home. Together, these findings inform theoretical models of personality trait change and can be used to guide the development of effective and refined personality interventions.",

          "abstract": "The preliminary survey was carryout to assess the farmers understanding about the   generic pesticide (single active ingredient with different trade name). Total of 45 farmers participated in this study through interviews. Three commonly used pesticides by smallholder in the locality with different active ingredients were presented to the farmers to evaluate their understanding about the similarity and importance of generic pesticide. Open ended questioner was used. Those commonly used pesticides presented to the farmers are 1. Dimethoate (Agro-Thoate 40%EC, Ethiothoate 40%EC, Dimethoate 40 % EC, Dimeto40%EC and Roger) 2. Lambda-cyhalothrin (Karate 2.5% EC, Lamdex 5% EC, Helerat 50EC, Lamdex 5% EC, Farate 3. Profenofose (Ajanta, Profit 720EC, Polytrin315EC, and Selecron 720% EC). In this study from 45 farmers who asked about the generic pesticide, the similarity of Lamdex 5% EC, and Farate, 43 out of 45 farmers did considered these insecticides as different and they used this insecticide for different pest control. Similarly over 96% of the farmers did not understand the similarity  among Ajanta, Profit 720EC, Polytrin315EC, and Selecron 720%EC , and 91% did not understand the similarity  among  Agro-Thoate  40%EC, Ethiothoate 40%EC. This misunderstanding of farmers about similar pesticide with different trade name contributes for ineffective pest control, farmers used single active ingredient (with different trade name) for different pest control due to miss understanding. Hence, the government and non government other concerned body should create enough awareness regarding to similarity of for smallholder farmers. Pesticide manufacturers, should also be responsible for pest for this action.",

This study was carried out to ascertain the possibility of remediating diesel oil polluted soils using palm bunch ash. Samples of garden soil with no history of diesel oil pollution were spiked with 100mL of Bonny Light diesel oil and left for two weeks to simulate a condition of major spill before adding different weights of palm bunch ash (0, P+NOPBA, 50g, 150g, 250g and 350g). 1g from each treatment was collected monthly and subjected to laboratory analysis using standard analytical methods for soil selected heavy metals contents using AAS. Preliminary results revealed alteration of chemical properties of soils, elevated heavy metals levels two weeks after spiking indicating that the soil sample had undergone slight alteration. There was a dose dependent decrease in heavy metal content of the diesel oil polluted soils with time. Mean concentration of Zinc ranged from 95.7mg/kg to 7.45mg/kg; 9590.5 to 99.83 in Fe; 3.5mg/kg 1.4mg/kg Cu; 1.45mg/kg to 0.06mg/kg Cd and 10.90mg/kg to 0.05mg/kg in Pb. Overall, net reduction in heavy metals was very low in soil left under natural attenuation (polluted untreated soil) than treated soils. This study has revealed a marked degradation of the heavy metal content of soil which indicated that palm bunch ash could be used for remediation of diesel oil polluted soil. It is recommended that palm bunch ash be replaced with conventional fertilizer in restoration of crude contaminated soil.",

          "abstract": "The oil and gas industry is one of the core sectors of the national economy, playing a fundamental role in ensuring energy security. The Covid-19 situation, which has driven companies to innovate, may serve as a catalyst for rethinking the size and role of functional teams, field workers, and management processes required to run an efficient oil and gas company. The slump in global oil consumption due to the pandemic has caused a shock to the Russian economy. To gain comprehensive insights on the performance of the oil and gas industry in Russia, this study aims to develop an integrated methodology that combines the Grey prediction method, a so-called GM (1,1) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Malmquist model for the prediction and evaluation of the top 10 potential companies in Russia. Grey theory is adopted to predict the companies’ data during 2020–2023, and the Malmquist method is used to evaluate their performance over the whole period of 2016–2023, based on three input factors (total assets, total liabilities, cost of revenue), and two output factors (total revenue and net income). During the research period, “Russneft” was found to have performed the most efficiently while “Slavneft” held the least-effective company, despite its efforts to achieve progressive technological changes. Overall, all companies have achieved excellent technological efficiency. Thus, the average total factor productivity indexes of all companies mainly rely on their technical performance. This study assists policymakers and decision-makers in expediting their recovery plans for further sustainable development in the oil and gas industry.",

          "abstract": "Ideals play important roles in human life and psychology. Over the past decade, several mindfulness-based interventions have directly cultivated ideal mentalities that have not yet been achieved at the level of humanity, leading to the establishment of ideal psychology. Beyond research on ideal mentalities, ideal psychology has evolved into a general psychological approach characterized by future-oriented perspectives and associated methodologies. This article provides the first detailed introduction of this emerging approach. It summarizes six defining features of ideal mentalities, presents the design–achievement–evaluation cycle for research on them, and outlines seven methodological principles for enhancing studies on both ideal and existing mentalities with similar features. It further illustrates three aspects of future-oriented perspectives that shape research, through which it clarifies how ideal psychology relates to previous schools of psychology such as critical psychology, positive psychology, and transpersonal psychology, as well as to other traditions including Eastern spiritual traditions, Marxism and the critical tradition, transhumanism, and Plato’s philosophy. The article also exemplifies recent applications of ideal psychology in cultivating ideal mentalities such as mentalities of emptiness, Confucian oneness, and the nondifferential four immeasurables, as well as in advancing research on existing mentalities such as mindfulness, mortality salience, and beliefs about human nature. Finally, it discusses the major contributions, limitations, and future directions of ideal psychology.",

          "abstract": "Story reading is often accompanied by mental visualization of the scenes and the events described. Individuals with aphantasia, who report not experiencing vivid visual imagery, have recently been reported to be less absorbed and engaged when reading stories. In the present study, we explored how aphantasics read imagery-rich stories differently from control subjects by analyzing their gaze fixation patterns. We found that in both groups, gaze fixation was similarly influenced by different types of story content. Notably, under perceptual imagery, which involves sensory-rich contents, the influence was the strongest, resulting in longer fixation durations during relevant keywords in both groups. Despite the same fixation patterns, aphantasics reported less experienced immersion in the stories, consistent with a previous study. Furthermore, we observed that in control subjects, longer fixation duration on perceptual imagery contents was correlated with higher experienced mental imagery, whereas in aphantasic individuals, this relationship was absent and even reversed. Our findings may align with the account that imagery under aphantasia may be nonconscious rather than nonexistent, leading to the lack of introspective access to mental images, as the fixation patterns indicative of reading behavior were similar, while only reported subjective experiences differed under aphantasia.",

We captured these gestures from nine speakers across three distinct categories: University lecturers, Politicians, and Psychotherapists. The annotations encompass various aspects, including gesture types (e.g., metaphoric, iconic), descriptive terms characterizing each gesture (e.g., 'sweep', 'container'), and their corresponding verbal utterances. The dataset also includes detailed physical properties such as hand height, distance to the body, arm angle, hand configuration, palm orientation, repetitions, size, and speed, alongside 3D pose tracking data. Where possible, video recordings provide additional multimodal context. Notably, we identified several previously undocumented lexemes, expanding the current lexicon of gesture research. This dataset offers a valuable resource for studying human communication, training models for gesture recognition and generation, and designing socially intelligent virtual agents.",

          "abstract": "European and contemporary writers, like, Eliot, have critically examined the dissimilar customs and religions especially those of East, Indian, Buddhist religons particularly Zoroastrianism in their literary works. Eliot gently suggests that there is a reasonable association between religion, culture in the controversial writings. For Eliot; our way of life and religion secure the convictions that regularly force on us, and our revelatory judgment and public analysis of our social guidance are personally identified with individuals. Eliot gave fastidious consideration to Eastern people's promotions and religions and examined the ceremonies. During a considerable study of his amazing sonnets, he supposedly examines Eastern religions, including Zoroastrianism, and fire-revere, Indian, Buddhist religions and contentious issues about human life and fate. Therefore, this study tries to investigate Eliot’s poems in the light of Eastern mythology, Zoroastrianism, the symbol of fire in East. Iran and Iranian civilization have a long history, in this regard, Iranian culture and civilization have always been the focus of writers and philosophers around the world. Eliot has paid special attention to Eastern civilizations and religions and he has studied many rituals of past. In some of his poems, he has dealt with Eastern religions, including Zoroastrianism and fire festivals. In the \"Hollow Men\" he has paid special attention to the Eastern religions, Zoroastrian beliefs, rituals and rituals of the past. Since no research has been done on this subject, the purpose of this article is to examine the myth of fire and Zoroastrian beliefs in some of Eliot's poems such as, “Waste Land”, “Four Quarts”, “Ash Wednesday”, “Hollow Man”.",

          "abstract": "Beekeeping in Himachal Pradesh plays very important role not only in fruit pollination but also in honey production. The farmers here are facing many problems in bee rearing during recent years.This survey was conducted to assess the problems of beekeepers and orchardists in Himachal Himalaya. It was observed thatbeekeeping is important for securing food, poverty reduction, health, environmental protection, honey production and plant pollination. The farmers here practiced beekeeping as a part time or whole time job and were engaged in this venture for the last many years. Commercial beekeepers stressed on the role of honeybees as honey producers than pollinators of horticultural crops. Most of the farmers also earned extra income from honey and other bee products besides using them for pollination purposes. The farmers had knowledge regarding different aspects of honey production, processing and marketing i.e. constituents of honey, nutritional value, different type of honey containers used for honey storage, honey processing, marketing problems etc. But only some farmers were acquainted with different pests, predators and diseases of honeybees and their remedial measures.\n\nMost of the farmers wanted to have financial support for different horticultural practices and training purposes. They preferred to be trained in orchard management technology and beekeeping practices. There were different types of constraints faced by beekeepers regarding the beekeeping practices which included non availability of bee flora throughout the year, heavy snowfall, shortage of labour, habit of absconding of bees and poor knowledge about medicines. Apiculture requires organizing honey marketing channels and raising awareness on limiting the use of pesticides in agriculture to protect the bees and the environment as well. The renovations and application of improved beekeeping technologies not only benefits beekeepers but also farmers and the general public in pollinating their crops, maintaining plant biodiversity, and the ecology at large.",

This thesis reframes speech as a toolchain—Intention →\nCompilation → Actuation → Feedback—and proposes Return on Expression (RoE), the\nrealized state change per unit cost, as the organizing objective. We present (i) a\nformal state-space/control model of utterances as interventions on beliefs, goals, and\ncommitments; (ii) an empirically calibrated affordance map that translates context\nvariables (uncertainty, risk, expertise asymmetry, channel constraints) into design\nchoices (framing, redundancy, prosody); (iii) a failure taxonomy with detectable\nsignals and mitigation protocols; and (iv) a Speech IDE that instruments conversation\nwith an LLM-in-the-loop intention compiler, ambiguity linters, a commitment type\nchecker, and a grounding meter. We define standardized micro‑protocols (e.g., Query\n→ Calibrate → Commit; Goal → Constraint → Offer → Check) and preregistered\nexperiments across lab and field settings to estimate treatment effects on RoE,\ncommitment conversion, grounding depth, and rework. Bayesian hierarchical models\nsupport estimation and transportability across domains. Ethics features\n(consent‑to‑influence, bias audits, kill‑switches) reduce misuse.

Su rasgo cardinal, la anhedonia, se vincula con alteraciones en la neurotransmisión dopaminérgica, desbalances energéticos neuronales y procesos neuroinflamatorios.\n\nEste trabajo describe la evolución natural del síndrome cuando no recibe diagnóstico ni intervención: desde la fase inicial con apatía fluctuante (0–6 meses), pasando por depresión persistente (6–18 meses), hasta la cronificación con deterioro funcional (2–3 años) y finalmente la progresión a cuadros de neurodegeneración y riesgo vital por suicidio (5–10 años). Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).\n\nSe discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.\n\nEl presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.",

This paper presents a three-dimensional\nstructural model of subjective perspectives, including cognitive stance, psychological\npositioning, and interpretive path, explaining how they interact and affect individuals' emotional and behavioral reactions.

They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may affect grade-to-grade score distributions. Monte Carlo simulation and synthetic data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce meaningfully different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

          "abstract": "It has long been proposed that the brain integrates pitch and timing cues during auditory perception. If true, the pitch of a sound should influence its perceived timing, and its timing should influence its perceived pitch. Previous research has found that higher-pitched sounds tend to be perceived as faster than lower-pitched sounds, and in the present study we investigated whether sounds that arrive earlier or later than expected are similarly perceived as higher or lower in pitch. In Experiment 1, participants heard isochronous, repeating standard tones followed by a pitch-shifted probe, and indicated if the pitch increased or decreased. We observed a strong biasing effect of the probe’s timing on its perceived pitch, such that later probes were more likely to be perceived as lower than the standard. Correct, bias-conforming responses to mistimed probes were also significantly faster than responses to on-beat probes. In Experiment 2, we used an adaptive difficulty procedure to investigate whether this timing-induced bias strengthens under conditions of low discriminability. We did not find evidence that bias varies with the magnitude of pitch change or with individual differences in pitch sensitivity. In conjunction with past findings of pitch-induced illusory timing changes, our results support the hypothesis that pitch and time are perceptually integrated. We discuss this integration within a Bayesian predictive coding framework, as possibly learned from real-world correlations between pitch and timing that derive from latent properties of sound sources.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show difficulties determining whether environmental cues, particularly in social contexts, are meant for them, which relates to symptoms and determinants of social functioning. Recent computational modeling findings have emphasized disruptions in evidence accumulation, which index how visual information is extracted from social cues, as a potential driver. Yet, it is unclear whether these disruptions reflect more general difficulties with social/face processing or are specific to self-referential gaze perception, and how they map onto clinical features. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to clarify cognitive processes driving self-referential gaze perception and non-self-referential gender perception in 39 SZ and 42 controls. DDMs captured key cognitive processes, including sensitivity of evidence accumulation to gaze and gender cues, perceptual biases, and expectation biases. We clarified whether disruptions to these processes in SZ were unique to self-referential judgments or general to face processing, and to what extent they related to paranoia and social cognition. Relative to controls, SZ exhibited perceptual biases specific to self-referential decisions, predisposing the over perception of eye contact, and broad reductions in evidence accumulation sensitivity to social cues during both self-referential and non-self-referential decisions. Broad insensitivities to gaze and gender cues, not perceptual biases, were associated with more severe paranoia in SZ. This suggests that aberrant self-reference in SZ is shaped by disruptions in the process of accumulating evidence during general social and self-referential information processing. More general disruptions in evidence accumulation, across different kinds of social decisions, may help bridge perceptual dysfunctions and symptoms, such as paranoia, in SZ.",

The Multi-Capital Leadership (MCL) theory posits that leader emergence and effectiveness depend on perceptions of individuals’ abilities to provide benefits or impose costs in solving challenges of group living, through the deployment of different forms of capital: material, social, somatic (e.g., physical formidability, height, immune functionality), and neural (e.g., knowledge, intelligence, personality, supernatural abilities). We integrate this framework with a review of leadership across human societies, including in non-state and non-industrial contexts, and with novel comparative analyses of ethnographic data. This synthesis highlights how context-specific demands for coordination and collective action, and the accuracy of social comparison, shape the structure and dynamics of leadership and followership across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI)–the brain’s ability to combine information from different senses–is ‎crucial for coherent perception and adaptive behavior. While often viewed as a bottom-up process, ‎emerging research shows internal states like emotional arousal can modulate MSI. The role of ‎metacognition–our awareness of perceptual accuracy–remains underexplored in this context, particularly ‎in relation to multisensory illusions such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). This study ‎examined how facially induced emotional arousal affects audiovisual integration and metacognitive ‎efficiency during the SIFI task. It also assessed whether individual differences in sensory-processing ‎sensitivity (via the Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) influence these effects. Fifty-five participants ‎completed an online SIFI task, where neutral or disgusted facial cues preceded audiovisual stimuli across ‎six stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Participants reported the number of flashes and rated their ‎confidence. Accuracy and confidence improved at longer SOAs. However, while confidence was ‎unaffected by the pre/post condition, accuracy was significantly influenced, indicating a dissociation ‎between performance and subjective certainty. Emotional cues did not affect accuracy or confidence, but ‎higher HSP scores were linked to lower metacognitive efficiency, especially in negative emotional ‎contexts (β = –0.16, p = .04), though the interaction was not statistically significant. Bayesian analysis ‎suggested a 75% chance of a negative interaction, but with uncertainty. These findings highlight that ‎while arousal doesn’t impair MSI, high sensory sensitivity may reduce introspective accuracy in ‎emotional contexts, with implications for decision-making and responsive technology design.‎",

Drawing from Cialdini’s principles and Kahneman’s cognitive heuristics, the BCS integrates subtle design cues into a one-page agreement form that frames payment timelines, offers structured choices, embeds self-commitment language, and introduces incentive-based reciprocity. The design process involved iterative revisions and expert input from educational psychologists and school administrators.  Implementation in school settings involves distribution during registration, parent selection of preferred payment plans, and school-side tracking. Anticipated outcomes include improved payment compliance, reduced administrative burden, and increased parent-school collaboration. A pilot study is planned to evaluate the form’s effectiveness, refine its structure, and inform broader scale-up. The BCS offers a novel, theory-driven approach to addressing persistent compliance issues in school fee management.",

Here we present the outcome of a 10-year program that started with creating a novel test, the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive substrates (APACS), and evolved in using it – along with ToM assessment – in seven clinical groups (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, and dyslexia). The multistudy cross-diagnostic analysis of 454 participants revealed that receptive pragmatic skills were impaired in all clinical groups compared to controls, with schizophrenia showing the most severely impaired profile, whereas expressive pragmatic skills were impaired in four neurological conditions (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, and traumatic brain injury). The association with ToM was limited to receptive pragmatics and moderate in the whole sample. Overall, pragmatic impairment emerged as a diffuse feature of neurological and psychiatric illnesses, which contributes to defining complex socio-communicative phenotypes but cannot be equated to a social cognition deficit and should hence be the target of specific assessment and intervention.",

We developed the Physical and Mental Metaphors task and used it alongside the Strange Stories task in a series of studies involving neurotypical children throughout middle childhood. A meta-analysis conducted on our work, including 500 children aged 8-12, showed that metaphor and ToM are significantly associated, even when controlling for vocabulary. This association peaks around the age of 9 and fades away with increasing age. Our longitudinal and training studies evidenced that it is especially metaphor that benefits ToM, rather than vice versa. The results of our research program confirm the inherent mindreading component of pragmatic operations as postulated by post-Gricean pragmatics, also highlighting that ToM involvement in metaphor varies dynamically depending on age and possibly other factors such as the type of metaphor. We argue that pragmatics should not be seen as ancillary to ToM but rather a driving factor for socio-cognitive development and that integrating insights from developmental psychology in studying metaphors and pragmatics, such as the attention to individual differences, brings new opportunities for research.",

          "abstract": "The widely replicated finding that the perceived speed of time passage over the past decade increases with chronological age was the focus of this study. We investigated potential mechanisms underlying this effect, examining the role of autobiographical memory and cognitive functioning. 120 individuals aged 20-91 were assessed on subjective time perception for the preceding decade and year, the quantity and significance of autobiographical memories from those periods, and overall cognitive status. Results confirmed the specific age-related increase in perceived temporal acceleration over the past decade. However, no significant association was found between perceived time passage over the past decade and either the number or subjective value of memories. Contrary to assumptions, older adults reported more vivid and meaningful recollections. Instead, reduced cognitive functioning, and specifically lower ability to form new memories as assessed through delayed memory recall, emerged as a significant mediator of accelerated time perception with age. Findings suggest that age-related cognitive decline leading to reduced ability to encode novel memories, rather than diminished autobiographical memory content, is a critical factor in the subjective experience of time compression in older adults.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background\nChildren’s emotional and behavioral problems frequently co-occur, suggesting the existence of a general factor of psychopathology (\"p factor\") that accounts for the shared variance across internalizing and externalizing problems. Ongoing questions remain regarding the extent to which negative affectivity—a temperamental tendency to display observable manifestations likely reflecting negative emotions—and general psychopathology represent overlapping versus distinct constructs across early development. \n\nMethods\nA community-based sample of 231 children aged 3 to 7 years participated in an accelerated longitudinal study, with assessments at four time points spaced nine months apart. Data were collected via multi-informant (mother, father, teacher/secondary caregiver) ratings, structured observational tasks, and standard questionnaires. This study evaluated the convergent and discriminant validity of negative affectivity and general psychopathology measures across informants and methods using multitrait-multimethod matrices while accounting for measurement error and variance related to the informant type.\n\nResults\nFindings indicated that measures of negative affectivity and general psychopathology exhibited moderate convergent validity but also retained distinctiveness, supporting the discriminant validity in measures of these constructs. The association between the two was somewhat attenuated when controlling for informant type.\n\nConclusions\nThe results clarify that, although negative affectivity and general psychopathology are closely related in childhood, they are not redundant constructs. Additionally, the observed deflation in the association between negative affectivity and general psychopathology after accounting for informant type-related bias highlights how measurement strategies—including informant source and method variance—can meaningfully alter interpretations of the associations between psychopathology and risk/protective factors. Together, these results emphasize the importance of both conceptual and methodological precision when studying the early indicators of psychopathology and suggest critical targets for early identification and intervention to promote mental health across development.",

This work is not an empirical report; rather, it is a blueprint that enables empirical research and charts a pathway toward the societal implementation of the Fourth Revolution. The contributions are: (1) recasting the seven indicators—operationality, recursion, leap-evocation, multi-actor/AI multiplicity, irreversibility, translation preservation, and measurability—into design requirements; (2) codifying the design workflow (FQ → structural pressure → timed induction of leaps → SQ consolidation → roles → operating environment → logging/recursion); (3) a failure-mode quick reference and safety kit (signals → immediate responses → prevention for control-deviation, rigidity, FQ depletion, and loss of function through translation); (4) a structure-to-OS mapping procedure with a specification sheet and quality gates; and (5) minimal trial protocols (60–90 minutes) for education, organizations, and local governance, including KPI application. Evaluation relies on external KPIs, with subjective intensity (qualia) used only as an auxiliary measure. Success is determined by operational effectiveness and the stabilization of the revision cadence. Figures are kept to a minimum; instead, reproducibility is supported through explicit log schemas, revision tickets, and stop/restart thresholds.

          "abstract": "The cognitive architecture of decision-making in bilinguals manifests differentially in the first and second languages, a phenomenon previously linked to attenuated emotional resonance in non-native language contexts. This investigation establishes the neurophysiological chronometry underlying language-modulated decision processes in Chinese–English bilinguals during a strategic economic game. Participants engaged in a coin-drawing paradigm requiring either veridical reporting when drawing a coin (mandatory betting) or presenting a strategic choice when drawing a blank (free choice between betting / lying and truth-telling). All participants exhibited the expected increase in betting frequency following coin draws, but only monolingual controls manifested shorter response latencies in this condition. While language context failed to induce measurable behavioral alterations in bilinguals, data-driven linear mixed-effects modeling of single-trial electroencephalographic data uncovered a temporal cascade wherein language context effects preceded draw outcome processing, with subsequent language-draw interactions emerging 450-600 ms post-stimulus. This time course indicates that draw outcome integration occurs approximately 150 ms later in the second than the first language in bilinguals. Crucially, when participants were free to bet or not, neural signatures discriminating between betting and non-betting decisions revealed an interaction with language context, with decision-related activity manifesting earlier in the second language and suggesting accelerated risk evaluation. Collectively, these findings reveal a language-dependent temporal dissociation in bilingual decision processing: delayed information integration yet expedited risk assessment in the second language. This neurophysiological evidence illuminates the complex interplay between linguistic and executive function in multilingual individuals, with implications for understanding situational awareness and decision-making efficacy.",

We validate our model experimentally, showing that it explains how 7- to 10-year-olds' solve a physical puzzle, including the distribution and the types of evidence children sampled. The proposed model outperforms both a purely rule-based Bayesian hypothesis search and a resource-rational random sampling approach.

The focus of evaluation moves from individual understanding to the collective behavior of the “field” (subject migration). The paper provides, at the outset, a terminology usage guide, a comparative table between the Third and Fourth Revolutions, a subject migration map, an OS design stack, and a KPI list, all as reusable standards for subsequent applications across domains. It defines KPI specifications, measurement protocols, and recording formats, and identifies typical mixed-phase phenomena observed during the transition, offering corrective measures. Furthermore, through domain-specific status maps and operational design templates, it proposes small-scale pilot implementations in education, organizations, and local governments, along with a 3–5–10 year roadmap, thereby presenting a shared navigation route for the societal implementation of the Fourth Revolution’s operational structures.",

(2025), \"Exploring ChatGPT’s capabilities, stability, potential and risks in conducting psychological counseling through simulations in school counseling\", Mental Health and Digital Technologies, Vol. ahead-of-print No. ahead-of-print. https://doi.org/10.1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013\n\nFind published version at https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013/full/html\n\nPurpose\nThis study aims to examine ChatGPT-4’s potential and stability when simulating school-counseling dialogues, offering an exploratory snapshot of its ability to convey warmth, empathy and acceptance. Drawing on 80 real student questions, this paper aims to assess response consistency and identify risk markers, such as randomness and hallucination. The goal of this study is to inform future research, guide human–AI (artificial intelligence) collaboration and support policy development on deploying large language model chatbots for accessible mental health interventions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper prompted ChatGPT-4 with 80 authentic college student counseling questions and collected three nondeterministic replies per query. Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length.\n\nFindings\nChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings.\n\nPractical implications\nHigh warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design.\n\nSocial implications\nDeployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",

          "authors": "Juan Mendoza-Collazos",
          "abstract": "This chapter proposes a classification of artifacts based on an agentive approach—that is, on the actions performed by human agents rather than on the artifacts' functions or features. The agentive approach adheres to the thesis that cognition is not reduced to brain functions but is coextensive with the capacity to act. If there is action, then there is cognition, and therefore, meaning emerges from an agent's relationship with its environment (enaction). It is argued that the notion of Enhanced Agency—the incorporation of artifacts to enhance the performance of actions—is a distinctive feature of the human species, and that the ability to design artifacts is distinct from the creation of natural objects by other animals. Therefore, the definition of artifact is limited to an object created by human beings for a specific purpose. Consequently, after critically assessing other proposals, the classification of artifacts is addressed under three criteria: according to the type of incorporation; according to the type of engagement; and according to the type of action performed by the agents. This typology allows us to resolve ambivalent categories such as cognitive/pragmatic and to be consistent with the material and embodied commitment of cognition, which constitutes a contribution to the understanding of the essentially enhanced nature of human agency.",

          "abstract": "Which self-ascribed identities are most enduring and which most ephemeral? Here we analyze self-authored self-descriptions (Twitter profile biographies) over the course of a decade to contrast the survival rates of identity signifiers. Using quantitative methods inspired by cancer research, we present a method to estimate survival curves and present results for thousands of words from a large longitudinal set of US users of Twitter. These results provide the first extensive list of identities ranked by their survivability within individuals’ self-presentations. Survivability is not reducible to popularity or length of the signifier but rather is sensitive to context dependent factors.  More enduring identities are “prestigious” identities signaling achievement or affiliation with success, whereas the most ephemeral identities are ordinal categories.",

          "abstract": "Political trust is widely considered essential for democracy, but empirical evidence testing this hypothesis remains limited. Drawing on research that connects political trust to democratic legitimacy, highlights its attitudinal and behavioral consequences, and underscores its contextual character as a form of political support, we hypothesize that political trust exerts a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already reached some level of democracy. We test this hypothesis with cross-lagged models fit to political trust estimates from 62 countries over 30 years, combined with democratic quality scores from the Varieties of Democracy project. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a conditional effect: based on our results, political trust has a positive effect on democracy, but only in countries that have already achieved high quality of democracy.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "Under the threat window of ‘interception first, decryption later’ in quantum computing, national security and industrial sovereignty face new systemic challenges. This paper proposes a dual-track approach of ‘PQC baseline + QKD enhancement’ to comprehensively compare the standard systems, governance models, and engineering progress of China and the United States in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD). The study employs a three-tier evidence integration framework of ‘policy-standards-engineering,’ combining authoritative documents from NIST, OMB, CISA, and other sources with China's national standard platform and industry announcements. It constructs an analysis model of ‘standard hierarchy-migration ecosystem-international interoperability’ and evaluates the feasibility of the scheme through gap-risk mapping, roadmap design, and KPI matrix assessment. The results show that the United States has established a closed-loop system of ‘primary standards + redundancy’ based on FIPS 203/204/205 and HQC backup algorithms, and has entered an auditable implementation phase driven by mandatory migration and toolchain initiatives from OMB and CISA; China maintains an advantage in QKD engineering and standardisation, but national standards for PQC have not yet been solidified, and the migration governance system lags behind, resulting in a structural shortfall of ‘engineering leading the way while algorithm standards lag behind.’ Based on this, this paper proposes a ‘three-year-five-year-ten-year’ national roadmap: establish a standardised baseline within three years, achieve large-scale migration and verification within five years, and complete consolidation and internationalisation within ten years. This will be supplemented by protocols, PKI/certificates, key lifecycle management, testing and certification, and algorithm switching mechanisms, in conjunction with a five-tier governance structure led by the State Cryptography Administration, with TC260/TC485 as the technical focal points, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology/ the Cyberspace Administration of China/People's Bank of China, operator and critical infrastructure implementation, and research institutes. The conclusion states that PQC must be established as the ‘basic defence line’ in the quantum era, while QKD should serve as the ‘enhanced defence line’ for critical links; China must complete the construction of PQC national standards and migration governance capabilities within a three-year standardisation, five-year consolidation, and ten-year internationalisation timeline, and achieve dual-track integration and international interoperability with the QKD standard suite, thereby safeguarding national security, consolidating industrial resilience, and enhancing international influence.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a pilot transit credit program launched by Waymo in the San Francisco Bay Area, which offered riders a $3 incentive to use an AV rideshare service in conjunction with nearby public transit stations. Using a mixed-methods approach, including structured surveys and qualitative interviews, we explore how the incentive influenced travel behavior, mode substitution, and public transit connectivity. Results indicate that 69% of participants connected to transit, while 50% of these riders would have otherwise used privately paid rideshare and 6% would have used their private vehicle, and another 6% would have walked or cycled. The remaining 38% of participants would have used transit to reach the public transit station. The study offers critical insights for transit agencies and mobility providers aiming to design integrated AV-transit systems that serve the public good. While there is a risk of misallocating funds to individuals already willing and able to pay for rideshare services, these findings underscore that targeted subsidies can yield meaningful reductions in private vehicle use and promote multimodal travel.",

          "abstract": "Computational text analysis has grown in popularity among social scientists due to the massive influx of digitized data available to study. However, much of this research disconnects patterns observed in text from information about the original authors. Eliding authorship considerations from sociological analysis of text can potentially lead to claims and assertions of trends that are independent from the social actors, conditions, interactions, and contexts which the text was produced. While text analysis without authorship information can yield reasonable inferences about society, complementing that approach with research that explicitly considers the people producing the text could expand the theoretical and empirical scope of work in this area. In this paper, we adapt perspectives from sociolinguistics and explicitly consider categorical identity markers of authors and geography as foundational axes of variation in textual data. We explore these dimensions in a large corpus of college admissions essays (n = 254,820 essays submitted by 83,538 applicants) and metadata about applicant identity, including the ZIP code of their high school. After generating features of the essays using computational methods, we find that author identity markers, such as gender, parental education, and socioeconomic status are highly salient. We also find that ZIP code level socioeconomic measures are extremely correlated with the writing style and content of local applicants. We also find that individuals whose personal identities are spatially unique–that is, demographically different from others in their immediate content–were most likely to be misclassified by our models, indicating that writing is influenced both socially and spatially. This work clarifies how authorship characteristics, like identity and spatial context, constrain the breadth of what we write and how we write by showing strong alignment between text and authors that is observable through machine reading of text.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the archetypal figures of Sköll and Hati, the mythic wolves of Norse cosmology, as embodiments of cosmic shadow, destruction, and renewal within Jungian analytical psychology. Rooted in Viking-era Germanic myth and anchored in Danish cultural artifacts such as the Trundholm Sun Chariot and Nordic winter rituals, the study explores how these wolves symbolize the cyclical tension between psychic dissolution and rebirth. Drawing on primary Jungian concepts alongside contemporary psychoanalytic and mythopoetic scholarship, the analysis positions Sköll and Hati as necessary forces that disrupt egoic sovereignty and reveal the shadow aspect of time and consciousness. The wolves’ pursuit and devouring of the sun and moon reflect psychic upheavals commonly experienced during midlife crises, cultural collapse, and spiritual transformation. The archetypes discussed here do not represent pathology or nihilism but serve as initiatory figures that require surrender to chaos for psychological growth. The integration of Nordic cultural context deepens the understanding of these archetypes and provides a unique contribution to the field of archetypal psychology. This paper encourages clinicians and scholars to consider the paradox of destruction and renewal inherent in the archetypal shadow, thus advancing the discourse on collective and individual processes of transformation.",

It focuses on the ritualized engagement with primal instinctual forces, manifesting through shadow-doubling and ecstatic possession, as a necessary threshold for psychological transformation. By situating the Ulfhéðnar within contemporary clinical contexts related to masculine trauma, rage, and identity, this work extends Jungian theory and archetypal psychology to address unresolved aspects of male integration. The analysis highlights how the rupture of ego boundaries permits the return and processing of repressed instinctual energies, offering a symbolic framework for therapeutic approaches.

While Johnson et al. highlight four key principles—harm prevention, public interest, paternalism, and the duty of easy rescue—the present analysis contends that these ethical frameworks are insufficient unless safety, efficacy, proportionality, and necessity of the intervention are established beforehand. Drawing on examples from COVID-19 policies, including social distancing, surveillance measures, and vaccine mandates, the article demonstrates how weak or uncertain empirical evidence undermined ethical justifications for coercion. Cases such as low efficacy against transmission, underappreciated adverse events, and proportionality concerns reveal the dangers of treating empirical validity as an afterthought. The article concludes that coercive public health policies cannot be ethically defensible without robust prior evidence of effectiveness and safety. Ethical reasoning must therefore be grounded in empirical reality, with context-sensitive, localized approaches that ensure transparency, autonomy, and trust.",

          "authors": "Sujay Rao Mandavilli",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the creation of Anthropological Pedagogy as a distinct field of study within \nthe framework of Anthropology, interfacing traditional Anthropology and Pedagogy with some \npre-defined principles and objectives, chiefly designed to promote Anthropological goals and \nobjectives through the medium of education. This paper proposes to lay the groundwork for \nwhat we believe will be an exciting and promising field, and we hope other researchers, \nscholars, Anthropologists and Pedagogists will take the concepts presented herein to their\nlogical conclusion. This is based on the premise that there can be no quick fixes to complex and \nseemingly intractable issues, but that the ball must be set in motion nonetheless to replace \nsuperannuated axioms. This proposed field of study is distinct from the field of Educational \npsychology which deals with the psychology of learning, is much broader in scope than \n‘Anthropology of Education’, and the relatively less-known field of Pedagogical Anthropology \nwhich was created over a century ago by Maria Montessori and others, even though there may \nbe varying levels of overlap between them. This sub-discipline is proposed to be created with \nthe fond hope that by combining the two crucial disciplines of Anthropology and Pedagogy, a \nnew platform will be created for the wholesome furtherance of human welfare and interests, \nparticularly long-term and global welfare through more scientifically structured education \nsystems, which are designed to merge short-term local considerations with long-term global \nobjectives. This approach includes within its ambit topics such as content fixation for societal \nbenefit, long-term societal benefit, individual benefit and maximum psychological impact. \nNeedless to say, it is integrated with the Theory of Mindspace, the Theory of Mind-orientation, \nSocietal orientation and Cultural remediation. It also deals with the collection and analysis of \nmeaningful metrics, consensus-building and mobilization of international opinion for the \nrealization of the goals, and implementation of the principles of Anthropological Pedagogy.",

          "abstract": "This paper attempts to merge the concepts and theoretical frameworks of the disciplines of \nAnthropology and Economics, and attempts to create a new sub-field in Economics called \n‘Anthropological Economics’ which is mired in Anthropological concepts and principles and \nseeks to maximize not only human welfare and happiness but also wealth maximization across \ncultures, while considering both the psychic unity of man, universal human needs and culture?specific factors. Thus, Anthropological Economics is expected to be inter-related to other \ndisciplines of Economics, but remain complementary to them i.e., it is not expected that it will \nintrude into other sub-fields of economics, replace them, or override their principles in any \nway. It will therefore draw upon other aspects of economic theory, and enrich them suitably. It \nis therefore expected that all aspects of Economic theory will be taken into consideration for \npolicy formulation and decision-making, including those of Anthropological economics, and \nindependent, context-specific judgment will always be applied. The new proposed field of \nAnthropological Economics proposes to take the idea of Human Welfare to its logical conclusion \nby extending the work already carried out in various sub-disciplines of economics, and \nintegrating it more tightly with various concepts in Anthropology. Many new tools and \ntechniques are therefore, proposed as a part of this paper, and we believe these will suitably \nenrich the field of Economics as well. While many attempts have been made in the past to \nintegrate the fields of Anthropology and Economics, we hope this endeavour will take this \nexercise to a much higher level, by creating a new generation of “Anthroeconomists”. We also \nhope it will eventually help move mainstream economics away from Neo-classical approaches \nto Anthropological and human-centric approaches.",

We also delineate the \nrole that we expect will be played by Anthropological Historiography in the attainment of long-term \nAnthropological goals and objectives, and in promoting human welfare and well-being in general. \nAnthropological Historiography, with its myriad and multiple interfaces with other sciences is also \nexpected to play a major role in promoting a scientific temper among the laity and the general public \nand trigger shifts in individual and societal orientations in due course by countering popular perceptions \non many issues that impact their daily lives and making outdated and popular paradigms and ideologies\nredundant. We expect that Anthropological Historiography will play a major role in marginalizing fringe \nmovements besides leading to an enhanced understanding of various aspects of science, history and \nethnology among the population and ushering in intellectual movements where such movements are \nlong overdue, and very indirectly leading to a quantum increase in scientific endeavours.

Our prognosis is that it is barely likely to survive in its present form for another decade or two. We begin this paper by defining what Marxism is and tracing its thought over the past one and a half centuries or so including varieties and regional variants of Marxism and its common criticisms. The success and failures of Marxism and communism are also likewise probed and investigated. The sphere of influence of Marxism is also probed on fields such as art, architecture, archeology, historiography, religious studies, and cultural studies. We also go on to show why Marxist thought is greatly fossilized and steeped in a mid?nineteenth century mindset, and is unlikely to work in different contexts and situations as it has limited validity and applicability. Many of the failures of mainstream Marxism and Marxist thought also overflow and cascade into academic Marxism too, and it is time to reassess all facets and aspects of Marxism from their bootstraps. We also propose and examine alternative approaches to replace various concepts and components of academic Marxism, and link all our concepts with our previously published papers in a seamless, integrated chain. As such we expect this paper to be an integral component of our globalization movement, and it would not be difficult to understand or figure out why.",

          "abstract": "The presidential election, as the most significant election in the United States, has numerous socio-economic impacts. The real estate market, one of the most closely watched sectors in recent years, has generally shown an upward trend in prices. This paper examines the county-level voting results in two presidential elections which are 2016 and 2020 and the corresponding changes in county housing prices, finding that when a county's presidential election voting results are inconsistent with the final election outcome, the county's housing market is affected, leading to a downward trend in prices.  Additionally, counties with a preference for the Republican Party are more sensitive to fluctuations in the real estate market when they experience electoral defeat. Other factors as races and income status also exhibit heterogeneity in response to policy shocks. This study's analysis of the relationship between presidential elections and the real estate market provides guidance for strategic decision-making in the real estate industry and contributes to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the impact of presidential elections on socio-economic life.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Framework of Opportunity Resistance and Curvature Economics (FORCE)—a field-theoretic model for analyzing how economic behavior emerges within a dynamically evolving topography of opportunity and constraint. Rather than treating agents as isolated optimizers within equilibrium-based systems, FORCE embeds them in a fluid field shaped by resistance, influence, and differential access—where capital, policy, and social signals distort the flow of opportunity itself.\n\nBy conceptualizing emergent effort, asymmetrical opportunity, and systemic strain as geometric features of a socioeconomic field, FORCE enables new formulations of economic behavior that account for both agency and structural impedance. Constructs such as economic curvature, opportunity resistance, nexus distortion, and emergence coefficients provide a tensorial language for describing how tension accumulates and resolves across uneven social terrain.",

          "abstract": "The impact of social media influence on social learning, health behaviour, and population health is a new, rapidly developing field of research. Previous research focused specifically on online social influencers suggests they may be able to affect group-level diffusion of health-protective behaviours such that they modify epidemic outcomes. The impacts of social influence on behaviour and epidemics depend on whether the disease has a low enough basic reproduction number ($R_0$) that social dynamics have time to diffuse. However, formal models have yet to test the intuitive hypothesis that online social influence is sufficient to generate tangible, real-world effects on epidemics. We develop an agent-based model that incorporates social influencers into an epidemic scenario to test hypotheses about how the presence of competing influence messages affects the diffusion of health-protective behaviours throughout a population, and thereby alter the course and outcome of infectious disease epidemics. We find social influencers had a persistent, independent effect on peak infection intensity and total infection burden of the epidemic, with the greatest effects in highly homophilous scenarios. The presence of health-protective influence effectively flattened the epidemic curve despite equal presence of anti-protective influence.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nThis theoretical synthesis integrates mythological, archaeological, and clinical perspectives to examine the Ulfhéðnar as a distinctive archetype of masculine individuation. It focuses on the ritualized engagement with primal instinctual forces, manifesting through shadow-doubling and ecstatic possession, as a necessary threshold for psychological transformation. By situating the Ulfhéðnar within contemporary clinical contexts related to masculine trauma, rage, and identity, this work extends Jungian theory and archetypal psychology to address unresolved aspects of male integration. The analysis highlights how the rupture of ego boundaries permits the return and processing of repressed instinctual energies, offering a symbolic framework for therapeutic approaches. This contribution fills a gap in depth psychology by bridging mythic material and clinical phenomena, emphasizing the archetype’s importance for understanding and treating masculine psychic fragmentation.",

This concept paper proposes an alternative starting point. We outline a Civic LLM that uses an explicit civic ontology during corpus design and fine tuning. The ontology names roles, institutions, practices, and values that thicken democratic life. Our claim is deliberately modest. Curated data that is organized and weighted by a civic schema may produce small but measurable shifts in default framings without degrading general capability. The contribution is twofold. We integrate political theory as a design input, and we show that adjacent literatures in knowledge enhanced language models and concept level steering support a cautious path for evaluation.

          "authors": "Caesar Edward",
          "abstract": "This paper develops a real options–based framework for modeling the dynamics of political regimes, integrating decision theory with a six-state Markov Decision Process (MDP). Political regimes are treated as strategic decision-makers holding flexible political options—such as repression, reform, policy shift, or exit—whose value evolves with volatility, entropy, and time. The core asset is the regime’s political capital, modeled as a dynamic stock S(t) subject to both gradual diffusion and sudden Poisson jumps representing exogenous shocks (e.g., coups, assassinations, natural death). Option exercise is constrained by an Action Cost Threshold X(t), the political strike price, which evolves over time and determines the cost–benefit feasibility of action.\nThe framework introduces novel visualization and diagnostic tools: Opportunity Landscapes to map option exercise probabilities over volatility and time; Valence of Power heatmaps to measure relative option value; Decision Thresholds under Uncertainty curves linking entropy and action probabilities to reveal points of strategic equivalence; and Volatility Landscapes that integrate volatility, entropy, and probability to assess stability risk. We model the Decay Time Value of Political Capital Stocks and Political Options, quantify the Time Evolution of both S(t) and X(t), and use Cost–Benefit Landscapes to jointly evaluate capital and cost trajectories. The framework also captures coercion dynamics, distinguishing between rational coercion in dysfunctional equilibria and irrational coercion in stable democracies.\nApplied to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, the model produces empirical simulations of resilience, fragility, and optimal decision timing. In addition to capturing volatility and cost thresholds, the analysis introduces Regime Survivability Probabilities—quantifying the joint likelihood of sustaining or losing power under affordability and hazard constraints—and the Regime Survivability Frontier, which traces the tipping points where survival and failure probabilities converge. Results show how shifting volatility, erosion of political capital, and rising exit hazards shape strategic urgency and force leaders toward difficult trade-offs. The approach offers a predictive and diagnostic tool for political survival analysis, grounded in the theory of real options but adapted to the contingencies of political power.",

Drawing on Jung's concept of the Shadow and Self, Fenrir is explored not as a mere mythic antagonist but as an expression of ego's confrontation with primordial psychic force. The analysis focuses on Danish iconography, including the Jelling stones and burial constraints, to contextualize cultural responses to unbounded power. The paper proposes that Fenrir symbolizes the individuation crisis when ego faces annihilation by the unconscious. Such devouring figures demand not suppression but symbolic integration. This interpretation reframes apocalyptic myth as an inner transformation narrative, emphasizing the necessity of symbolic death for psychic renewal.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the vargr-an Old Norse term connoting both \"wolf\" and \"outlaw\"-as a symbol of social exclusion and psychological projection. In early Scandinavian law, the vargr marked those expelled from society through outlawry, a formal ritual that maintained social cohesion. Drawing from Jungian depth psychology, the vargr can be seen as a scapegoat for the community's shadow-the rejected parts of the self, including rage, shame, and transgression. This mirrors René Girard's theory of scapegoating, where societies manage inner tension by casting blame onto an external figure. The wolf's wild and dangerous image reinforced its role as a symbolic container for threat. Norse sagas and Thing-site archaeology support the vargr's cultural and legal significance. In contemporary psychological terms, the vargr archetype illuminates how modern individuals manage exclusion and disowned identity. Understanding this figure highlights enduring patterns of exile, repression, and healing within both ancient and modern contexts.\n\nKeywords: Vargr, Norse mythology, outlawry, Jungian psychology, shadow archetype",

Confucian culture, which upholds core values such as benevolence and righteousness, forgiveness and tolerance, integrity, and loyalty and filial piety, has long permeated various levels of Chinese society. Using non-financial listed firms in China as the sample, this study measures the strength of Confucian cultural influence by the number of Confucian temples within varying distances around each firm and further explores the impact of Confucian culture on corporate risk-taking. The results show that Confucian culture is negatively associated with corporate risk-taking, indicating that in regions where Confucian culture is more deeply rooted, firms tend to exhibit lower levels of risk-taking. This study provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the factors influencing corporate risk-taking and the role of cultural factors, offering important guidance for corporate strategic development and risk management strategies while contributing to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the critical role of cultural factors, such as Confucian culture, in risk-taking decisions.",

While the uptake of RCTs in sociology has lagged behind other disciplines, recent growth signals a shift toward what some now call “experimental sociology.” However, the methodological promise of RCTs depends not only on random assignment but also on transparent reporting practices that allow readers to assess internal validity, implementation quality, and the generalizability of findings. In this article, we conduct a systematic scoping review of 91 field experiments published since 2000 in high-ranking sociological journals. Using an adapted version of the CONSORT-SPI checklist, we evaluate reporting accuracy across a range of design and implementation indicators. We find substantial variability and frequent omissions in how sociological RCTs are reported, with implications for replicability and the cumulative advancement of causal knowledge. Our findings suggest that sociologists have yet to fully adopt reporting standards developed in other disciplines, and that greater attention to documentation could strengthen the credibility and utility of experimental evidence. We offer concrete recommendations for researchers, reviewers, and journal editors to improve transparency and comparability in sociological field experiments.",

          "abstract": "Defining rurality is a persistent challenge in rural geography and spatial demography, where threshold-based classifications often obscure the heterogeneity of the rural-urban spectrum. The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR), a continuous and multi-dimensional measure, offers a theoretically-informed alternative. This study explores the areas of agreement and divergence between the 2020 IRR and the 2023 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) and investigates the methodological sources of these differences.\nOrdered logistic regression models confirm a significant, moderate association, with the IRR explaining approximately 21% of the variance in RUCC classifications. A subsequent analysis of the model's residuals reveals that this divergence is systematic: a county's spatial remoteness is a powerful and statistically significant predictor of the disagreement between the two measures. A structural examination further confirms the high inter-correlation between the proxy variables for the IRR's four components. The findings demonstrate that the IRR's primary value lies not in replicating official classifications, but in providing a distinct, spatially-informed perspective on rurality, making it a valuable complementary tool for nuanced research.",

We introduce race-match sufficiency—the probability that a student has at least one same-race teacher—and estimate it using administrative data from 8,691 Texas public schools serving 5.4 million students. We model sufficiency for Black, Hispanic, and white students as a function of racial composition, enrollment, grade structure, district context, and more. Same-race student concentration is the strongest predictor, with steep nonlinear effects varying by race. Secondary grade levels and larger enrollment increase exposure opportunities, but benefits remain profoundly unequal. White students experience near-universal sufficiency, Black students gain moderate access, and Hispanic students remain severely underexposed—even where they constitute over 70% of enrollment.

          "abstract": "Objective: To assess whether environmental concern is associated with fertility expectations and behaviours across the reproductive life course.\nBackground: Whether individuals consider climate change in their reproductive decisions is an emerging area of research. Prior studies have largely examined stated intentions or the influence of extreme weather events, leaving open questions about actual fertility behaviour in relation to environmental concern.\nMethod: Using individual-level panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), we followed 11,951 women and 8,117 men from 2009 to 2022. We first use linear probability models and regress fertility expectations and parenthood status on the environmentalism index as measured in the first wave. We then estimate Growth Curve models to model the transition to parenthood across the life course for men and women who report different levels of environmentalism at the first wave.\nResults: Environmentalism is associated with slightly lower fertility expectations among younger adults, particularly those in their mid-20s to early 30s. Notably, the negative association is stronger when it comes to actual parenthood status. Women aged 25 to 40 with high environmentalism scores are significantly less likely to have children. Growth curve analyses reveal that the fertility gap between high and low environmentalism groups widens between ages 25 and 35, but narrows again by age 42.\nConclusion: Our results suggest that the link between environmentalism and fertility behaviours may not necessarily be driven by deliberate decision to forgo parenthood but rather, by postponement.",

          "abstract": "The aim of the study is to explore the contribution of childlessness to changes in English cohort fertility over time and in relation to that in other European countries. The study found that during important historical periods of change in English completed fertility a change in childlessness played a very important role: contributing 56% of the large rise in fertility (of 0.42 children per woman) between the 1920 and 1934 cohorts and 44% of the large fall (0.44) between the 1934 and 1960 cohorts.  But for more recent cohorts (born since 1960) changes in childlessness played a varying but usually minor role in accounting for changes in English cohort fertility compared with other countries. The paper shows that there are, however, countries in which a rise in childlessness has made large contributions to a large decline in their cohort fertility since the 1960 cohort (e.g. Japan, Spain and Poland).  Also, high current levels of childlessness in these countries are an important reason why their cohort fertility is so low compared to England and some other countries of Northern and Western Europe (e.g. Sweden, France and the Netherlands).  Based on information on fertility intentions and historical experience it is argued that that changes in childlessness were mainly the result of an accumulation of usually unpredictable period influences on fertility.",

Commissioners regarded as sympathetic or neutral toward the establishment of a Jewish national home—as articulated in the 1917 Balfour Declaration—such as Herbert Samuel, Herbert Plumer, John Vereker-Gort, and Arthur Wauchope, were commemorated with warmth and respect, with only minimal to moderate criticism.

Doing so, it dedicated front pages, editorials, columns, telegrams, photographs and obituaries to the POTUS, while maintaining a somber and respectful tone and displaying an admiring narrative towards the presidents in particular and the United States (US) in general. In addition, the Hebraic newspapers presented the POTUS as global political agents who are supportive of the Jewish people, the Zionist movement and the idea of building a Jewish national home based on The Balfour Declaration in 1917 – to a certain degree. Notwithstanding, some newspapers offered mild criticism while addressing US domestic issues, as well as the POTUS's foreign policy, Jewish relations and Zionist support (or non-support).",

          "abstract": "In the ongoing energetic transition to renewable energy sources (RES), increasing attention is paid to modes of energy storage. Modes of energy extraction and storage have historically played a pivotal role in the development of global capitalism. The shift from RES to fossil fuels in the 19th century caused a significant change in the relations between workers and capital. Since then, fossil fuels have been utilized as a dominant source of energy, reproducing specific abstract space and time that allowed capitalism to expand. However, this mode of energy has reached a limit and therefore, new ways of extracting, distributing, and consuming energy are sought. Due to the intermittent character of energy from RES increasing focus is oriented towards energy storage and its coordination via the information technologies. One of the predominant technologies for energy storage is apparently the battery. This paper analyzes the dynamics of energy valuation practices mediated by different types of batteries while it explores the battery as an information processing device rather than an energy source. The analysis focuses on three case studies of battery - the virtual battery, Bitcoin-as-battery, and Lithium-ion battery - while each case study focuses on a different aspect of the valuation process. Based on the case studies, three modalities of energy from RES are identified: account, waste, and stock. The virtual battery operates as an accounting device recording outputs and inputs of energy. It allows the semblance of delayed consumption. On the other hand, Bitcoin-as-battery transforms excess waste energy into a unique digital object with high liquidity on international markets. Lithium-ion battery allows energy from renewable sources to be stored and marketized in the form of stock. These modalities are a product of the valuation process, which aims to abstract the intermittent energy produced by RES and transform it into a commodified object.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the influence of leader empowerment behavior on the performance of state agencies in Kenya, with board composition evaluated as a moderating variable. The research was motivated by persistent underperformance and ethical challenges within Kenyan state agencies, often attributed to weak leadership and governance failures. Guided by theories including Ethical Leadership, Institutional Theory, Kohlberg’s Moral Development, and Social Learning Theory, the study employed a mixed-methods approach and a census sampling strategy targeting senior managers and board members of 135 state agencies. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires and analyzed through both descriptive and inferential statistics, including correlation and moderated regression analysis. The results revealed that leader empowerment behaviors—such as power-sharing, team building, and capacity development positively and significantly influenced agency performance. Furthermore, board composition, defined by factors such as expertise, gender parity, and independence, was found to significantly moderate the relationship between empowerment behavior and agency performance. The analysis confirmed that effective empowerment practices, when complemented by well-structured and diverse boards, fostered organizational accountability, service quality, and policy implementation. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges such as political interference and lack of merit-based appointments remained significant barriers to the realisation of effective ethical leadership.The study concluded that promoting empowerment behaviours and strengthening board governance were vital to enhancing the operational efficiency of state agencies. Recommendations included implementing structured empowerment programs, fostering team-oriented cultures, improving board diversity, and reducing political influence in leadership appointments. Future research was recommended to explore the long-term impacts of empowerment strategies, the integration of digital tools in leadership, and the interaction between board dynamics and technological innovation in the public sector.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of devolved human resources for health (HRH) on service delivery in Kenya's county government hospitals. Since the adoption of devolution in the 2010 Kenyan Constitution, healthcare functions have shifted from national to county governments, creating both opportunities and challenges. This study aimed to explore the extent to which devolved human resources for health affected service delivery in Kenya's county government hospitals. It sought to identify healthcare human resources for health challenges, evaluate the role of intergovernmental leadership, and propose strategies to enhance efficiency and service quality. The study employed a positivist research philosophy and mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) research design, analyzing data from 385 respondents across 137 county hospitals using SPSS version 27. The findings show that devolved human resources for health positively and significantly influenced service delivery. The moderating variable, intergovernmental leadership further strengthened this influence. The study concludes that devolved human resources for health influences service delivery. The study recommends that for service delivery to improve there is need for reform, as far as devolved human resources for health is concerned, as well as the need to enhance intergovernmental leadership. The study recommends the need for adequate staffing for both medical and non- medical staff, adhering to the organisation's staff establishment and that the employees be compensated commensurate with the services they render.",

The study targeted employees of the Lagos State Civil Service Commission. Fifty copies of the questionnaire were administered with forty-nine retrieved. Out of five employees, initially identified, two employees interviewed.\nFindings revealed that organisational culture has a positive effect on employee performance. Therefore, the researcher concluded that it is essential for employees to adopt a good culture in the organisation. It was discovered that transformational leadership that could institute the right culture has a more significant effect on employee performance in the Lagos State Civil Service Commission. The study recommended that leaders should create room for creativity and analyse employees’ performance using SWOT Analysis to examine the strengths and weaknesses of each employees. Performance-based reward system for employees would improve productivity.",

          "abstract": "Lyric poetry--the poetry of song--is often defined in opposition to narrative. In this work, we examine this relationship by carrying out an empirical study to measure the degree of narrativity present in contemporary songs, using a dataset of popular (Billboard Hot 100) and prestigious (Grammy-nominated) songs spanning 1960-2024. While we might expect the 1960s (with ballad-driven folk singers like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Simon &amp; Garfunkel) to be a high-water mark for narrativity, we find the opposite: narrativity has been steadily increasing over this period, largely due to the rise of the strongly narrative genres of hip hop and rap. We also find that it is a marker of prestige for country music, with Grammy-award nominated \"Best Country\" songs displaying significantly higher narrativity rates than non-nominated songs from the same album.",

Yet demographers like us – experts who explicitly study population size, composition, and structure – are generally not highly concerned. Why is this? It’s because we understand the strengths and limitations of population projections. Projections can accurately describe how populations will change if we know future birth, death, and migration rates. But demographers are well aware that they don’t have a crystal ball – we can't fully anticipate economic shifts, political changes, global events, or how future generations will respond to their changing worlds. That’s why the farther we project from the present, the less accurate those projections are likely to be.",

          "abstract": "Background: Public understanding of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) remains limited, hindering efforts to shift health behaviours and policy. Arts-based knowledge translation (ABKT) offers a promising approach to engage the public with complex health science. \nMethods: We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a multi-site public exhibition co-developed by scientists, artists, and community members to convey DOHaD concepts. The exhibition, shown at five sites in a mid-sized Canadian city, featured professional and community-created artworks, scientific images, and interactive data collection activities. Using a parallel convergent mixed methods design, we collected and analyzed observational field notes, written reflections, QR code analytics, and structured activity responses across settings. Quantitative data were analyzed using logistic regression and descriptive statistics. Qualitative data underwent conventional content analysis. Findings were integrated narratively. \nResults: The exhibition was successfully installed across all sites, although space and security constraints in community settings required substantial adaptation. 89% of observed individuals at the gallery site engaged with the exhibition compared to 3-17% of observed individuals at community sites. Attendees at the gallery site also generally engaged with more artworks and for longer periods of time than at community sites. Viewing over half of the artworks was associated with a significantly greater odds of endorsing environmental and structural determinants of health (OR=10.3, 95% CI [1.48, 210.7]). Written and verbal feedback demonstrated increased awareness, emotional engagement, and a desire for further information. Despite some misinterpretation and low fidelity in interactive activities, the exhibition was broadly well-received and evoked critical reflection. \nConclusions: This study provides the first empirical evaluation of an arts-based strategy to translate DOHaD concepts for public audiences, demonstrating that such approaches can enhance health literacy, foster dialogue about the social determinants of health, and support equitable public health communication about early life influences on lifelong health. Future efforts should optimize engagement in non-gallery spaces and assess longer-term impacts on attitudes and behaviours.",

          "authors": "Florian Keusch; Bella Struminskaya; Joris Mulder; Stein Jongerius",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

The livability index is based on the WHO domains of age friendly, and measures over 70 indicators in the seven domains of health, neighborhood, housing, transportation, opportunity, civic engagement and environment. We compare communities across the US which entered AARP’s Age-friendly network with those which have not to explore two research questions: 1) Have AARP Age-friendly network members made progress in building more age-friendly communities, and 2) Does entering the network matter? The answer to both questions is YES, network members made progress from 2015 to 2024 in building more age-friendly communities.  The goal of the Livability Index was that it would encourage communities to pay more attention to age-friendly actions. We find communities in the age-friendly network improved their livability scores over the decade and expanded their lead over communities not in the network.  Joining the network helps communities become more age-friendly.",

Using administrative records and regression-discontinuity techniques, we find that the reform reduced first-time cases of maltreatment reported to Child Protection Services (CPS).

Then, it justifies the film’s main methodological and ideological standpoints by evaluating the process of pre-production, production and distribution.

          "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
          "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large \npredators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

Wages significantly affect outcomes only at the application stage, not at subsequent interview or offer stages, consistent with directed search theory.

Todavia, no capitalismo, essa racionalidade é limitada à otimização do lucro, sem coordenação entre empresas. O estudo argumenta que a planificação econômica alcança seu potencial máximo ao partir da negação das categorias capitalistas — capital, lucro, dinheiro e propriedade privada — e se estruturar prioritariamente no trato do tempo de trabalho dos trabalhadores na produção, tanto em unidades individuais quanto no total produzido ao longo de um período. Dessa forma, o artigo sugere que a planificação pode assim oferecer um modelo mais coerente e racional para organizar a produção e distribuição da riqueza, destacando seu potencial de superação definitiva das contradições e crises intrínsecas ao sistema capitalista.",

The Campbell Collaboration does so with its plain language summaries, which aim to communicate complex methodological information in an accessible manner. However, the effectiveness of such summaries in communicating the overall quality of the primary studies included in a systematic review remains understudied.\n\nObjectives: This study aims to assess how the design of a systematic review summary affects readers' perception of methodological quality of primary studies, their perception of the evidence's definitiveness and their attitudes towards the policy intervention discussed in the review.\n\nData and Methods: Using a web-based experimental design, two studies were conducted to examine how various presentation formats, including the emphasis on methodological limitations and the use of images, influence readers’ perceptions of information presented in a systematic review summary. \n\nResults:  Emphasizing methodological limitations significantly reduces readers' perception of the quality of the methods used in the studies included in a systematic review summary. Yet, highlighting methodological limitations does not influence people's perception of the definitiveness of the review findings or their attitude toward related policies. Furthermore, removing the images from the summary’s standard design appears to have minimal effect on how readers interpret information about methodological limitations.\n\nConclusions: Modifications to the traditional summary design can amplify the awareness of laypeople and civil servants regarding methodological limitations in the scientific evidence. However, their way of processing information about these methodological limitations does not automatically propagate the change in attitude regarding methods to a change in attitudes regarding study results and policy options.",

Toimeentulotuen käytön yleistymistä pidetään monesti ongelmallisena, koska suomalainen sosiaaliturva on rakentunut ajatukselle, että tuensaajien toimeentulo pitäisi turvata ensisijaisesti muilla etuuksilla. Hallituskauden alussa THL arvioi, että pääministeri Orpon hallituksen ohjelmaan kirjatut toimet kasvattaisivat laskennallisesti toimeentulotukeen oikeutettujen määrää 100 000 henkilöllä. Arvioon liittyi kuitenkin huomattavaa epävarmuutta muun muassa simulointimallin tietopohjan puutteiden takia. \n\nTässä tutkimuksessa olemme tarkentaneet toimeentulotuen simulointia huomioimalla kotitalouksien tulojen kuukausivaihtelua sekä toimeentulotuesta korvattavia terveysmenoja. Samalla olemme pyrkineet ottamaan huomioon mm. tuen alikäytöstä ja havaitsemattomasta varallisuudesta johtuvaa ylisimulointia. Aiemmissa tulonjakoarvioissa toimeentulotuki simuloitiin kaikille laskennallisesti siihen oikeutetuille, mutta tarkennetulla mallilla pyritään arvioimaan todellista saajamäärän muutosta. Lisäksi olemme huomioineet lakimuutoksia hieman aiempaa laajemmin.\n\nTarkennetulla mallilla arvioimme, että vuosina 2024–2025 toimeenpannut sosiaalietuuksien ja verotuksen lakimuutokset lisäisivät perustoimeentulotuen saajia noin 22 000 kotitaloudella, joissa on yhteensä noin 32 000 henkilöä. Tämän lisäksi asiakasmaksuihin ja lääkeomavastuisiin tehdyt korotukset kasvattavat toimeentulotuen käyttöä. Vuodelle 2026 esitetty toimeentulotukiuudistus sen sijaan pienentää saajamääriä. Näiden arviointi on tarkennetulla mallillakin edelleen hyvin epätarkkaa.\n\nArvioimme, että leikkaukset kasvattavat pienituloisuusasteita aiempia arvioita enemmän. Vaikutukset lasten pienituloisuusasteeseen ovat jopa kaksinkertaisia aiempiin arvioihin nähden. Uudet arviot ovat nähdäksemme aiempaa selvästi tarkempia, mutta simulointimalliin sekä sen tausta-aineistoon liittyy edelleen epätarkkuuksia. Simuloinnin tarkkuutta onkin tärkeä kehittää edelleen jatkossa.",

          "abstract": "The paper studies effects of social policies on in-work poverty risks, distinguishing between measures that either intervene in labour market processes -- i.e. predistribution policies -- or redistribute incomes towards those with low incomes. I argue that effects of different policies can be expected to vary across household contexts, due to the fact that the link between individual employment outcomes and in-work poverty is moderated by household type. The analyses uses data from EU-SILC and macro-level indicators from various sources to estimate general as well as household-type-specific effects using longitudinal methods. Results emphasize that labour market interventions and redistributive transfers impact in-work poverty risks through different mechanisms and also reveal important differences between specific policies: minimum wages contribute to reducing low-wage risks, whereas effects on in-work poverty are small and mainly restricted to single households where labour market outcomes and household income closely align. In contrast, there is a robust negative effect of strict employment protection legislation across almost all household types on in-work poverty, which is consistent with the positive role this measure plays for supporting higher earnings. With respect to redistributional policies, both unemployment benefits and benefits to low earners reduce poverty due to their contribution to public poverty-reduction. However, whereas unemployment benefits mainly reduce in-work poverty among couple households, benefits to low earners are the most effective measure to contribute to lower poverty risks among employed single parents.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Popiel; Helen Macdonald; Branka Bagarić; Adela Salceanu; Tanja Atanasova",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the evolving regulatory landscape of psychotherapy across European countries to identify structural, legal, and ethical patterns that shape the profession. The primary objective is to assess whether psychotherapy should be defined and regulated as an independent profession or as a specialisation within established health disciplines such as psychology or psychiatry. The paper presents a comparative analysis based on case studies from Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, and others. The central theses are: (1) regulatory systems based on the lowest common denominator of consensus risk undermining evidence-based standards and ethical obligations; (2) over-inclusive educational models may compromise treatment efficacy by legitimizing non-evidence-based practices; and (3) legal frameworks vary significantly in the extent to which they integrate universities, medical specialization, and professional oversight. Drawing on findings from the 2023 ACSTEC/SWPS survey and the 2025 EABCT Working Group update, the discussion addresses substantial diversity among countries regarding training requirements, recognised psychotherapy modalities, and eligibility for the professional title of psychotherapist, highlights the need for a thorough reflection on possible regulatory paths. It concludes that Europe requires a balanced model that safeguards patient safety, upholds evidence-based practice, and preserves methodological innovation. The conclusion argues for a hybrid, competency-based regulatory framework that balances scientific rigor, ethical integrity, and professional flexibility. Such a model would emphasize transparent standards for evidence-based practice, clear educational pathways, and safeguards to ensure patient access to effective care.",

          "abstract": "Muutokset toimeentulotuen käytössä ovat usein keskeinen kiinnostuksen kohde sosiaaliturvamuutoksia arvioitaessa. Toimeentulotuen käytön yleistymistä pidetään monesti ongelmallisena, koska suomalainen sosiaaliturva on rakentunut ajatukselle, että tuensaajien toimeentulo pitäisi turvata ensisijaisesti muilla etuuksilla. Hallituskauden alussa THL arvioi, että pääministeri Orpon hallituksen ohjelmaan kirjatut toimet kasvattaisivat laskennallisesti toimeentulotukeen oikeutettujen määrää 100 000 henkilöllä. Arvioon liittyi kuitenkin huomattavaa epävarmuutta muun muassa simulointimallin tietopohjan puutteiden takia. \n\nTässä tutkimuksessa olemme tarkentaneet toimeentulotuen simulointia huomioimalla kotitalouksien tulojen kuukausivaihtelua sekä toimeentulotuesta korvattavia terveysmenoja. Samalla olemme pyrkineet ottamaan huomioon mm. tuen alikäytöstä ja havaitsemattomasta varallisuudesta johtuvaa ylisimulointia. Aiemmissa tulonjakoarvioissa toimeentulotuki simuloitiin kaikille laskennallisesti siihen oikeutetuille, mutta tarkennetulla mallilla pyritään arvioimaan todellista saajamäärän muutosta. Lisäksi olemme huomioineet lakimuutoksia hieman aiempaa laajemmin.\n\nTarkennetulla mallilla arvioimme, että vuosina 2024–2025 toimeenpannut sosiaalietuuksien ja verotuksen lakimuutokset lisäisivät perustoimeentulotuen saajia noin 22 000 kotitaloudella, joissa on yhteensä noin 32 000 henkilöä. Tämän lisäksi asiakasmaksuihin ja lääkeomavastuisiin tehdyt korotukset kasvattavat toimeentulotuen käyttöä. Vuodelle 2026 esitetty toimeentulotukiuudistus sen sijaan pienentää saajamääriä. Näiden arviointi on tarkennetulla mallillakin edelleen hyvin epätarkkaa.\n\nArvioimme, että leikkaukset kasvattavat pienituloisuusasteita aiempia arvioita enemmän. Vaikutukset lasten pienituloisuusasteeseen ovat jopa kaksinkertaisia aiempiin arvioihin nähden. Uudet arviot ovat nähdäksemme aiempaa selvästi tarkempia, mutta simulointimalliin sekä sen tausta-aineistoon liittyy edelleen epätarkkuuksia. Simuloinnin tarkkuutta onkin tärkeä kehittää edelleen jatkossa.",

          "abstract": "This work continues the one commenced in a previous one, where the key idea is that individual stances on a social matter can be modeled as positions of particles in physics. Here, we explore the aggregation of individual behavior as a microscopic model of social phenomena to obtain quantities characterizing a society as a whole, similar to the resulting thermodynamical quantities at the macroscopic scale. We follow the theoretical framework of statistical mechanics with a Boltzmann distribution. Notwithstanding the fact that the translation of physical concepts need to be adequately motivated, a key distinction with respect to the physical case is that a social particle has a position-dependent mass. From such a generalization we obtain a simple example to illustrate the possibilities of such an approach based on the ideal gas model in physics. As a result, we find that the social phenomena can be modeled as a gas under the assumptions considered here. We discuss how several concepts and their relations reasonably translate from physical to social phenomena.",

Arts-based knowledge translation (ABKT) can improve information accessibility and retention while fostering community engagement, cohesion, and collaborative problem solving. To address the limited available guidance on using ABKT and the resulting inconsistencies in practice, we present a practical framework for applying ABKT methods to research dissemination which we developed through a review of existing frameworks and their use in previous initiatives. Our framework guides users through key considerations for selecting and refining ABKT methods. Pre-established goals serve as the foundation for selecting ABKT methods and refinements should consider context-, people-, and project-related factors which influence the impact of ABKT initiatives. Process and outcome evaluations must be aligned with goals. We showcase the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) as a strong example of a field which may be readily communicated using ABKT. The complexity within the field of DOHaD, along with evidence supporting a need for multipronged dissemination strategies, makes DOHaD well suited to approaches that transcend social and cultural barriers and encourage reflection. This review showcases the potential of ABKT to support inclusive and impactful research communication across diverse public health fields.",

          "abstract": "Pilgrimage has received longstanding scholarly attention, but most theoretical work focuses on how these rituals can be maintained, rather than the bigger puzzle of how they emerge. Using empirical inspiration from a new pilgrimage in Peru, we address this gap by outlining a theoretical framework more capable of accounting for how these phenomena get off the ground. We contend that the framework of an assurance game (a type of coordination game) captures the challenge of a collective ritual like pilgrimage emerging. By combining this assurance game with a model of Bayesian learning under uncertainty we illustrate how pilgrimage can be institutionalized on occasion. We further argue that our approach sheds light on the relationship between rituals and uncertainty, without having to make strong assumptions about individuals' psychological needs.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants and their children come to the U.S. in search of upward mobility, but in many contexts they experience discrimination and restrictive political climates. Contexts vary widely, however, given the growing number of new immigrant destinations. Past studies tend to focus on what immigrants and their children are (or are not) doing to adapt to local contexts, a focus which strengthens the perception that immigrants are a “problem” group. In this paper, we move the debate away from more familiar economic analyses to assess how destination type and exclusionary ordinances, defined as laws that restrict the rights of and services accorded to immigrant groups, influence “subjective” outcomes, including reports of discrimination among Mexican Americans. Our results reveal three main findings that illustrate the importance of local context. First, individuals living in a county with a greater share of co-ethnics report fewer experiences with discrimination. Second, in counties with an exclusionary ordinance, share of co-ethnics increases reports of discrimination. Finally, being born in the U.S. and speaking English do not provide protection from discrimination; rather, such characteristics shield Mexican Americans from discrimination only in supportive co-ethnic contexts.",

The analysis reveals strikingly linear trends in record ageing, particularly for the share aged 65+ and mean age, underscoring a linear increase in the upper bounds of ageing at the local level. In contrast, the prospective dependency ratio shows more varied patterns. The identity of record-holding municipalities also varies, with Denmark and Iceland showing stable leaders and Sweden, Finland, and Norway displaying more variety. This study provides a novel municipal-level perspective on population ageing in the Nordic countries, revealing substantive differences within and between countries in how record-oldest municipalities evolve.",

          "abstract": "Why do people adopt new and different religious beliefs and practices, especially when doing so is often costly? Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation. However, studies often rely on data that are not consistent with the level of analysis of their hypothesized mechanisms, risking the ecological fallacy. Many also infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes, falling into the functionalist trap. Here, we present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the relatively recent increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country. This suggests formal education and material conditions influence religious conversion. To test this hypothesis, we analyze longitudinal data from the Mexican Population Census, spanning from 1950 to 2020, at the municipality level. To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions or education (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. This may be due to the dampening effect of historical religious conflicts or differential exposure to Protestant missions, two variables omitted from our analysis for which no systematic data exists. It remains unclear if socioeconomic factors could still motivate conversions at the individual level.",

Combining GCN/GAT with unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, LOF) on heterogeneous time-series graphs and Bayesian modelling to form monthly outputs of Religious Diplomatic Risk Index (RDRI, 0-100), assessed by ROC-AUC/AUPRC; link prediction by MRR/Hits@k. The results show that the Vatican meeting (2025-02-01) triggered a short-term peak, with the RDRI rising from c. 24-27 to c. 42, and reaching c. 45 in 2025-03; the subsequent chain of \"foundations/cultural centres → out-of-country activities\" maintained the index at a medium-term high of c. 40 (±3), with a medium-term high of c. 40 (±3), and a medium-term high of c. 40 (±3). The \"Foundation/Cultural Centre → Outbound Activities\" chain maintains the index at a medium-term high of ~40 (±3), showing a double-engine rhythm of \"event amplification + resource penetration\". The reported uncertainty interval is ±3; and the conclusion level is shown to be stable under a priori/likelihood ±10% perturbation. The framework enhances the systematic and verifiable study of transnational religious networks without relying on internal intelligence and is transferable to other religious or transnational NGO contexts; to avoid misuse, the RDRI is defined as an early warning scale rather than a factual or judicial characterisation (all judgements cross-checked against registered and chained anchors).\nKeywords: knowledge graph; graph neural networks; religious diplomacy; financial anomalies; OSINT",

Investigating how these battles unfolded on Twitter and on a very large online forum, we demonstrate that the production of resentment may require the tacit collaboration of the same counterelites that populists demonize. One way for populists to trap counterelites into participation, we find, is by provoking them to participate in encounters that preserve their dominance of objectified cultural capital at the expense of political power. Populism should thus be viewed interactionally: its relative strength is an ongoing, cumulative and uncertain outcome of numerous three-way interactions in specific, highly variable sites. Since the macrosociological orientation of extant scholarship is unlikely to capture the dynamics of those sites, populism studies will benefit from developing a more substantial microsociological component.",

          "abstract": "Albany, New York’s historic streetcar network, decommissioned in 1946, played a central role in shaping the city’s development and the vestiges of this now defunct transit system are clearly visible. While much of the literature on the legacy of streetcar networks has focused on urban form and density, fewer studies have examined their continued influence on contemporary transit ridership and policy. This research investigates whether Albany’s former streetcar corridors continue to sustain elevated transit ridership and whether current land use and transportation policies effectively leverage this historic transit legacy.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, this research combines geospatial analysis, ridership data, demographic and land use trends, and policy review. A key component was the digitization of Albany’s 1923 streetcar network in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), enabling spatial comparisons with the city’s current transit conditions. Findings show that bus stops located along former streetcar routes experience significantly higher ridership than non-streetcar stops and are characterized by higher housing density and lower car ownership rates. These results reinforce earlier studies documenting the persistence of streetcar-era development patterns, particularly the concentration of density and transit-supportive land uses along former lines, while also extending the literature by directly connecting these legacies to present-day ridership. The Capital District Transportation Authority’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines also largely align with these historic corridors, underscoring their continued importance as transit spines in the city.\n\nDespite these historic advantages, this research found that Albany’s zoning and land use regulations often fail to reinforce these corridors, permitting development patterns that undermine their transit potential. The results highlight the need for policies that integrate land use and transportation planning, ensuring that new development leverages the city’s streetcar legacy for contemporary transit success. The enduring influence of Albany’s streetcar network demonstrates how historic infrastructure continues to shape mobility patterns and offers lessons for cities seeking to strengthen transit-oriented development today.",

Decades of research link neighborhood characteristics to health and behavioral outcomes. However, these factors are often studied independently, neglecting their interrelated nature. Methods: Using Swedish population registry data, we employed latent class analyses to identify neighborhood typologies across six timepoints spanning 1991–2020. Neighborhoods, defined by Demographic Statistical Areas, were characterized by socioeconomic conditions, ethnic heterogeneity, residential instability, and urbanicity. Latent transition analyses examined changes over time. Results: Four neighborhood types emerged in the early period (1991–2000): Rural Low-Diversity (45%), Urban Professional (27%), Urban Affluent (21%), and Resource-Limited (7%). From 2001 onwards, five types were identified, with the addition of Urban High-Diversity (9%) and Rural Resource-Limited (3%). Three types, Rural Low-Diversity, Urban Professional, and Urban Affluent, persisted across 30 years, representing 87–93% of neighborhoods, with over 90% of neighborhoods retaining their classification over time.

          "authors": "Sameer Meralli",
          "abstract": "The Sangiran Dome in Central Java, Indonesia, is one of the most significant paleoanthropological sites in Southeast Asia, renowned for its abundant Homo erectus fossils, which provide critical insights into early hominin dispersal and adaptation. As part of the Sangiran Formation, the site’s unique topography preserves a rich and uninterrupted sedimentary record spanning the Early to Middle Pleistocene. However, uncertainties in stratigraphic correlations, depositional environments, and geochronological frameworks have hindered a comprehensive understanding of the ecological contexts in which these hominins lived. This study aims to refine stratigraphy, clarify depositional settings, and establish a robust geochronological framework for Sangiran to better illustrate the paleoenvironmental dynamics that influenced Hominin ecology.\nThrough detailed sedimentological analysis, facies characterization, and updated geochronological methods such as radiometric dating and paleomagnetic studies, this research provides a revised stratigraphic model for the Sangiran Formation. Key findings indicate a dynamic depositional environment, with fluvial, lacustrine, and volcaniclastic systems dominating at different chronological intervals. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that Homo erectus inhabited a diverse landscape of open grasslands, wetlands, and riparian corridors. Stable isotope data and faunal assemblages further support climactic shifts in temperature and weather accompanying such diverse ecological landscapes.\nThese findings have significant implications for understanding hominin paleoecology in Sangiran. The reconstructed environments suggest that Homo erectus exploited varied habitats, demonstrating behavioral flexibility and resilience congruity in response to changing landscapes. The refined stratigraphy and geochronology also provide a more precise temporal framework for fossil occurrences, enabling better correlations with other Southeast Asian sites. Ultimately, by integrating stratigraphic, sedimentological, and chronological data, this research establishes a more complete foundational framework for further insights into hominin-environment interactions in Sangiran and beyond.",

The MR-ST is designed to accommodate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods, and to promote rigor and integrity in every domain. The MR-ST is strongly aligned with a systematicity view of scientific knowledge, supporting curricular outcomes about research that fit a flexible, modern characterization of science and contributions made to scientific knowledge. The result is a transparent, evidence-based tool for curriculum and instructional design, including targeted and actionable assessment, and program evaluation that makes independence and stewardship in research accessible and assessable from early undergraduate study through advanced professional preparation.",

          "title": "Needs for Security and Certainty Relate Differently to Support for Universal Basic Income Versus Other Social Safety Net Programs Across European Nations",
          "authors": "Christopher Federico; Caitlyn N. Barrett",
          "abstract": "Needs for security and certainty (NSC) vary in their relationship with economic preferences as a function of political engagement. Among those low in engagement, NSC is directly related to left-leaning economic preferences, since social welfare can be regarded as insurance. Among those high in engagement, NSC predicts right-wing economic preferences, since engaged individuals high in NSC take cues from right-leaning elites suggesting that support for redistribution is inconsistent with conservative political identities. Examining comparative European public opinion, we argue that this ‘reversal’ is less applicable to universal basic income (UBI), since the latter is an unconditional benefit that detaches welfare provision from specific situations of risk (e.g., unemployment insurance). This should shift individuals to think of provision in terms of moral hazard (e.g., work avoidance) in the context of UBI. Using Round 8 of the European Social Survey, we test and find support for several hypotheses based on this argument.",

          "title": "The Culling Hypothesis: Warfare as a Selective Pressure on National Character and its Geopolitical Consequences",
          "authors": "Khaled Bahaaeldin",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the \"Culling Hypothesis,\" a model for understanding the rise and fall of nations' martial capacities. It posits that major wars act as a powerful selective pressure, disproportionately culling individuals possessing a \"warrior archetype\" profile (characterized by high aggression and low empathy). The hypothesis argues that this archetype is not essential for warfare but acts as a powerful accelerator, increasing a nation's capacity, efficiency, and probability of waging war. The demographic reduction of this archetype through conflict leads to two primary consequences: a diminished geopolitical capacity for external power projection and a more docile, governable domestic population (the \"Governability Corollary\"). Through comparative case studies of Post-WWII Germany, Japan, the USSR, France, and the United States, the paper demonstrates how this demographic mechanism, in a \"tug-of-war\" with cultural forces, provides a powerful and overlooked explanation for the long-term trajectories of nations. Finally, the paper extends this model to explain the recalcitrance of modern non-state actors, arguing that they represent a purified concentration of this very archetype.",

          "title": "The Dayu-Style Strategic Thinking Model (DSTM): An Eastern Embodied Framework for Dynamic Decision-Making",
          "authors": "Huan Chang Lin; Yi-Chun Chen",
          "abstract": "In an era of heightened uncertainty and rapidly evolving competitive rules, traditional strategy theories face challenges in both theoretical advancement and practical applicability. Western dynamic competition frameworks—such as dynamic capabilities, hypercompetition, and action–response models—offer analytical tools for resource allocation, process reconfiguration, and action sequencing, yet remain limited in addressing strategic sensing, nonlinear pattern recognition, and embodied decision-making. This study proposes the Dayu-style Strategic Thinking Model (DSTM), which integrates Eastern strategic philosophy—particularly principles from The Art of War (“Know the enemy and know yourself,” “Leverage advantages,” and “Act in accordance with the situation”)—with embodied perception training from Tai Chi practice and Eastern problem-solving logic. The model constructs a closed-loop decision system encompassing intelligence, self-protection, total victory, action, and feedback. Structured as a Three-Ring Model (inner ring: The Art of War; middle ring: Tai Chi practice; outer ring: Eastern problem-solving logic) and operationalized through the Gui–Zha Decision Matrix, the DSTM enables the complementary interplay between strategic sensing (Gui) and rhythmic orchestration (Zha). The research establishes the model’s theoretical foundations and operational mechanisms, and explores its potential for human-centered and embodied strategic thinking, offering organizations a robust framework for navigating volatile and uncertain environments.\n\nNote: This English version of the Dayu-style Strategic Thinking Model (DSTM) is translated and revised based on the original Chinese version (DOI: https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5uv2_v1).

          "authors": "Mikolaj Szoltysek; Bartosz Ogorek; Mateusz Grzyb; Siegfried Gruber",
          "abstract": "Gender inequality remains a persistent barrier to development in many parts of Asia, yet the\ndomestic foundations of this inequality—particularly within family systems—are often\nneglected in global measurement tools. This study introduces the Patriarchy Index (PI), a new\nmetric constructed from census microdata to capture gendered power hierarchies in families\nacross 22 Asian and North African countries and 652 subnational administrative units.\nOf particular interest to development practitioners and scholars, the PI offers a scalable, lowcost\ntool for subnational diagnostics, especially where standard measures of gender equality are\nmissing or fail to reflect private-sphere constraints on women’s autonomy. Our study addresses\nwhether domestic arrangements—such as patterns of co-residence, marriage timing, and agebased\nauthority—can reliably capture institutionalized patriarchy, and what regional variation\nthese patterns reveal.\nUsing harmonized IPUMS-I census microdata and eleven theoretically grounded indicators, we\nconstruct a multidimensional composite index empirically validated through convergence with\nexisting gender measures, divergence from unrelated metrics, and correlation with gendered\ndevelopment outcomes. Our study finds that family-based patriarchy is spatially clustered and\nhighly variable at the subnational level. It further shows that higher PI values are significantly\nassociated with reduced relative female labor force participation, even after controlling for\nstructural variables such as gross national income and urbanization.\nThese results underscore the PI’s value as a complementary measure: it captures dimensions of\ngender inequality that remain invisible to public-facing or outcome-based indicators and helps\nbridge the gap between domestic constraints and broader patterns of disenfranchisement. In\ncontexts where legal reform and female empowerment are pursued without addressing\nhousehold-level structures, the PI offers a diagnostic that speaks directly to the architecture of\nfamily systems—illuminating where and how deeper constraints on gender equality endure.",

          "title": "Judging from the Sideline: The Relationship Between On-Field Positioning and Percussion Adjudication in Drum Corps International",
          "authors": "Edrian Salinas",
          "abstract": "The adjudication of elite performing arts ensembles is a complex process susceptible to a variety of perceptual and cognitive biases. In Drum Corps International (DCI), a 2019 rule change restricted on-field adjudicators to a limited zone near the front sideline, fundamentally altering their perceptual access to the performance (Drum Corps International, 2019). This study investigates the potential impact of this change by examining the relationship between a percussion section’s on-field location and its adjudicated score. Utilizing a dataset from three years of Drum Corps International Semifinals (2023-2025), a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to predict percussion scores. The model reveals that even after statistically controlling for a corps’ quality (via Semifinal Rank) and the specific judge, the time spent performing in a “sideline” zone remains a positive and statistically significant predictor of the final score (p = 0.007). This suggests a systemic, location-based bias where perceptual clarity afforded by proximity may be unconsciously translated into higher achievement scores. While yearly bivariate correlations showed a diminishing trend, the robust, controlled model confirms the persistence of this effect. These findings provide the first empirical, location-based analysis of DCI scoring in the post-2019 era, offering data-driven insights for adjudicators and designers and contributing field-based evidence to the broader literature on aesthetic judgment.",
