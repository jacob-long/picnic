          "title": "Tracking transformative agreements through open metadata: method and validation using Dutch Research Council NWO funded papers.",
          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer; Jeroen Sondervan",
          "abstract": "Transformative agreements have become an important strategy in the transition to open access, with almost 1,200 such agreements registered by 2025. Despite their prevalence, these agreements suffer from important transparency limitations, most notably article-level metadata indicating which articles are covered by these agreements. Typically, this data is available to libraries but not openly shared, making it difficult to study the impact of these agreements. In this paper, we present a novel, open, replicable method for analyzing transformative agreements using open metadata, specifically the Journal Checker tool provided by cOAlition S and OpenAlex. To demonstrate its potential, we apply our approach to a subset of publications funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and its health research counterpart ZonMw. In addition, the results of this open method are compared with the actual publisher data reported to the Dutch university library consortium UKB. This validation shows that this open method accurately identified 89% of the publications covered by transformative agreements, while the 11% false positives shed an interesting light on the limitations of this method. In the absence of hard, openly available article-level data on transformative agreements, we provide researchers and institutions with a powerful tool to critically track and evaluate the impact of these agreements.",

          "title": "When Hypothesis Preregistration Feeds Into Theory Development",
          "authors": "Agata Bochynska; Giosuè Baggio",
          "abstract": "Study preregistrations and theory development have been proposed as independent strategies for improving the quality, transparency, robustness, and reproducibility of research. Yet, a discussion of how theory and preregistration could interact and complement each other towards improved science is currently lacking. Here, we argue that hypothesis preregistration could stimulate theory development by serving various roles, depending on the availability or quality of theories and hypotheses in a field at any given time. We suggest that, in appropriate conditions, preregistration can increase the quality of hypotheses before they are tested, with indirect beneficial effects on theory development. In fields where theories are less developed or agreed upon, or are lacking altogether, hypothesis preregistration can nudge researchers to improve and share their hypotheses, engaging their community and facilitating accumulation and development of hypotheses. As a field’s theories and hypotheses become more advanced and better understood, hypothesis preregistration can become less important: the theory itself can function as a public repository of hypotheses and can constrain methodological aspects of research. We explore possible relations and synergies between hypothesis preregistration and theory development in a range of scenarios. We conclude with a discussion of implications and recommendations for researchers and meta-scientists.",

          "authors": "Hayato Idei; Keisuke Suzuki; Yuichi Yamashita",
          "abstract": "Mindfulness has established psychological benefits such as stress reduction and emotional regulation; however, the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in contrast to mind-wandering, remain unclear. This study aimed to present a hierarchical recurrent neural network-based agent model grounded in the free-energy principle to explore these processes within the framework of allostasis. The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states (“deep-being” mode) in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.",

          "authors": "E. F. Haghish",
          "abstract": "Clinical differentiation between adolescent suicidal self-harm (SSH) and nonsuicidal self-harm (NSSH) is a sig- nificant challenge for mental health professionals, and its feasibility is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine whether adolescent SSH can be differentiated from NSSH based on a holistic multimodel domain analysis (HMDA) of individual, psychological, sociodemographic, and environmental data without relying on intent and acquired capability for suicide. The study also sought to compare the compatibility of the HMDA result with four theories of suicide: the interpersonal theory of suicide, the three-steps theory, the inte- grated motivational-volitional model, and the theory of adolescent suicidality and self-destruction. This cross- sectional study analyzed data from a nationwide survey conducted from 2017 to 2019 in Norway. The sample included 26,904 adolescents (mean age=15.01; 29.9 % males), who self-reported suicidal and nonsuicidal self- harm. The meta-learner classification model reached an AUC of 77.0 % and a 70.0 % for both sensitivity and specificity in differentiating the two conditions. Exploratory factor analysis suggested eight factors for clustering the important risk and protective indicators: 1) disordered eating and future orientation, 2) sleep disturbance, 3) orientation toward affects and self, 4) risk-taking behavior, 5) peer relationships, 6) victimization, safety, and security, 7) family relationships, and 8) substance use. These factors emphasize that domains central to adolescent physical, personal, social, and expected future well-being provide invaluable information about risk of suicidal and self-destructive behavior. The results also indicated that despite their high comorbidity, adolescent SSH and NSSH are multifaceted and can be differentiated without relying on suicide-related information. These findings fully supported the theory of adolescent suicidality and self-destruction and partially supported the ideation-to-action theories.",

          "title": "College Students’ Reading and Digital Listening Habits:  A Survey Study",
          "authors": "Anisha Singh; Kayla King",
          "abstract": "The reading landscape in higher education continues to evolve with the proliferation of digital technologies and diverse textual formats. This study examined college students’ reading patterns across different mediums, purposes, and contexts. Data from 922 students of US universities revealed distinct patterns in reading habits and preferences. Students engaged in an average of 1.68 hours of pleasure reading and 4.16 hours of news consumption weekly. Graduate students reported more extensive reading habits (8.61 hours/week) compared to undergraduates (5.55 hours/week). Medium preferences varied significantly by purpose: students favored paper formats for leisure reading (53.79%) but showed a strong preference for screens in academic contexts (76.04%) and news consumption (80.03%). This digital dominance in academic reading persisted despite evidence suggesting better comprehension with paper materials, likely driven by the accessibility and cost advantages of digital texts. Analysis of COVID-19’s impact revealed that 37% of students increased their leisure reading during lockdown, primarily as a stress management strategy. The study also uncovered distinct multitasking patterns: while 36.9% reported reading for pleasure without other activities, only 23.5% maintained singular focus during academic reading. These findings suggest that supporting student success requires understanding and adapting to evolving patterns of textual engagement, particularly as institutions navigate the balance between digital accessibility and optimal learning conditions.\nKeywords.

          "title": "The FlexER-Scale: A new Self-report Measure of Individual Differences in Emotion Regulation Flexibility",
          "authors": "Anne Gärtner; Christoph Scheffel; Timo Schweikert; Denise Dörfel",
          "abstract": "Previous research on emotion regulation abilities has primarily focused on individual strategies and their association with (a lack of) well-being and psychopathology. Recent frameworks add emphasis to the importance of a context-sensitive and goal-dependent approach to emotion regulation, defining emotion regulation flexibility as the ability to adaptively adjust emotion regulation strategies based on contextual demands and personal goals. Despite growing evidence for its relevance in psychological well-being and psychopathology, a concise self-report measure capturing trait-level, strategy-independent ER flexibility has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed the Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER-Scale), designed to assess the context- and goal-dependent variability of emotion regulation strategies. The scale was derived from theoretical models of emotion regulation flexibility and validated using data from three independent samples (N = 857). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) examined the scale’s structure, and criterion validity was assessed via correlation with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The final 10-item FlexER-Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory item discrimination and high internal consistency (α = .85). EFA suggested a two-factor structure, differentiating the ability to upregulate negative and downregulate positive emotions as a separate factor. The FlexER-Scale correlated significantly with psychological well-being (r = −.244, p &lt; .001), supporting criterion validity. The FlexER-Scale provides a novel, psychometrically sound tool for assessing trait-level emotion regulation flexibility. It offers a concise alternative to existing assessments by capturing adaptive regulatory variability without restricting specific strategies. Future research should further examine its construct validity, as well as its longitudinal stability, predictive and ecological validity to further elucidate its role in psychological well-being and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Transgender and/or nonbinary (TNB) people often highlight romantic partners as a key source of social support related to their TNB identity. However, to date, no validated measure has existed with which to quantify TNB identity support in romantic relationships. We used a four-stage process to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of TNB identity support from romantic partners. First, we generated items based on prior qualitative research, then used cognitive interviews with six TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to refine the items. Second, we piloted 59 items in a survey of 321 TNB people (16 years and older) reporting on current or recent romantic relationships. Using those data, we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify subscales, then selected 19 items based on factor loadings, item-subscale correlations, α-if-item-deleted, discrimination parameters, and item information curves. Third, we used weekly diary survey data from 299 romantically partnered TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to perform confirmatory factor analysis and assess reliability at the within- and between-relationship levels. Results indicate that the 19-item Transgender/Nonbinary Identity Support from Partners Scale (TISPS) assesses five forms of TNB identity support—Facilitation [of identity exploration], Identity Validation, Celebration, Allyship, and Understanding—with a consistent factor structure and good reliability at the between-relationship level. Psychometric results were poorer for weekly within-relationship variation, suggesting that TISPS subscales have suboptimal properties for assessing short-term change. The TISPS can be used in clinical and community settings and future research on the role of social support in TNB mental health.",

          "abstract": "What differentiates a happy day from a typical one? Answering this question can help to identify the building blocks of a happy life, but little is known about what makes some days better than others. To identify the ingredients of a good day, we used interpretable machine learning techniques to assess how time spent on over 100 activities predicted whether Americans rated their day as typical or “better than typical.” Using data from the 2013 (N = 9286) and 2021 (N = 6196) waves of the American Time Use Survey, we identified clear tipping points that distinguish better days from typical ones. Socializing was one of the most important activities for having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing had little impact. Time spent with friends, in contrast, had an almost boundlessly positive effect. The impact of working was also highly time contingent. We found that working for up to six hours had no impact on whether people rated their day as better than usual. When individuals worked for more than six hours though, the effects rapidly turned negative. Taken together, our results suggest that good days emerge from the constantly shifting value of time; each minute in a day represents a choice between competing opportunities, with clear tipping points when benefits diminish and costs mount.",

          "authors": "Marcus Horwood",
          "abstract": "Ineffective conceptualisation, measurement, and analytical mechanisms are posited to be responsible for the ‘replication crisis’ in psychology and the broader social sciences (Chernov, 2025). The inefficiencies are evident with peacebuilding and humanitarian aid efforts (Horwood, 2025; Riemer &amp; Schmitz, 2021). This article proposes a transdisciplinary framework to overcome such challenges. This framework was informed via a cross-functional research synthesis, including 77 practice-partner identified texts representing international frameworks, indices, and organisational repositories associated with human need, manmade and natural systems, and humanitarian and peacebuilding tenets that inform global policy and intervention. The academic literature review identified current barriers that prevent effective conceptualisation, measurement, and analysis with wellbeing and peacebuilding, and was coded to develop a Universal Object Needs Framework (UONF). The tenets/areas of inquiry within the 77 texts were then coded against the UONF to confirm they were all effectively represented.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive conflict is a broad phenomenon ranging from classic stimulus-response incompatibility to moral dilemmas. Traditionally, cognitive control theories have focused on conflict detection and resolution as competition at the response level. Instead, the conflict between representations at the perceptual level has remained largely unexplored within this framework. Here, we call attention to the fact that perception itself necessarily involves conflict resolution. Is there a common ground to unify theories of cognitive conflict and control with the theories of perception? We propose that shifting the focus away from motor representations and considering conflict awareness could provide a new perspective for the integration of cognitive conflict across different levels of representation, including the case of perceptual conflict.",

          "authors": "Josue Garcia; Marc Sabio-Albert; Christoph W. Korn; Lluís Fuentemilla",
          "abstract": "Learning about the social expectations tied to upcoming social roles can prompt a strong drive for personal change, yet effective adaptation requires balancing this external pressure with the preservation of stable self-views. Here, we use computational models to provide a mechanistic account of how individuals at the onset of significant life transitions utilize their self-concept to modulate self-role dissonances during social role learning. We conducted two studies with distinct populations at the onset of important life transitions: first-year university students and pregnant women. Participants engaged in a learning task where they first provided self-ratings for different traits and then estimated how these traits would apply to an individual well-adapted to their forthcoming social role and received trial-by-trial feedback about their estimations of role-specific traits from reference groups (i.e., senior university students and experienced mothers). We hypothesized that individuals would employ strategies to minimize dissonances between their current self-concept and role expectations during the learning process. We formalized a series of computational models including strategies that straightforwardly integrate social expectations about new roles to more complex strategies that involve leveraging the current self-concept against the pure incorporation of role-related information. The best-performing computational model indicated that the self-concept acts as a modulatory mechanism, guiding the integration of incoming role information to minimize conflicts between existing identities and role-related expectations. Critically, comparative analysis of computational parameters indicated that this strategy was strongly accentuated in individuals learning about forthcoming social contexts. Our work provides a mechanistic perspective on role learning that could inform interventions to support individuals facing important life transitions.",

          "authors": "Jon Roozenbeek; Sushmeena Animesh Parihar; Trisha Harjani; Priyank Mathur; Sander van der Linden; Beth Goldberg",
          "abstract": "Misinformation poses a substantial societal challenge, including in the Global South. However, to date, the vast majority of research into understanding and countering misinformation has taken place in the Global North, and the practical, methodological, and financial complications of doing research with underrepresented groups in Global South countries pose substantial limitations. For this study, we developed five humorous, live-action “prebunking” videos starring a well-known influencer from India, each tackling a different manipulation technique often used on Indian social media: spoofing, decontextualization, the perfect solution fallacy, emotional manipulation, and scapegoating. We hypothesized that the videos would significantly improve people’s ability to correctly identify these techniques in news and social media content in an online pilot study (N1 = 547), two field studies (N2 = 4,272, N3 = 1,676), and a large-scale study on YouTube (N4 = 129,710). We find limited support for our main hypotheses, observing some significant but no consistent improvement in technique discernment. In a series of focus group discussions (N5 = 33) and an additional randomized controlled trial (N6 = 827), we explore why this is the case. We find that, while the videos were considered highly entertaining and useful by the majority of viewers, the item rating tasks we administered (evaluating a series of social media posts) were an unfamiliar method of efficacy assessment for our participants. We discuss how interventions can be best designed and measured in contexts where assumptions from the Global North may not apply.",

          "abstract": "In popular media, accurate climate information and climate disinformation often coexist and present competing narratives about climate change. As climate disinformation can undermine public support of climate policies and trust in climate science, it is crucial to understand what leads to exposure and acceptance of climate disinformation. Whereas previous research examined the effects of disinformation on climate beliefs, little is known about how people seek climate-related content (Pro- or Anti-climate) and how this varies between cross-cultural contexts. In a preregistered experiment, we studied how individuals sequentially sample and process climate-related information and disinformation. Participants from the U.S., China and Germany (Ntotal = 2226) freely sampled real-world climate related statements. Across 15 rounds, participants decided between two boxes containing Pro-climate or Anti-climate statements, respectively. Overall, reading a statement influenced climate concern in all countries. Participants preferred the box that was better aligned with their initial climate beliefs, and this confirmatory tendency intensified in later rounds. While climate concern was mostly stable, in the U.S., climate concern levels and box choices mutually reinforced each other, leading to greater polarization within the sample over time. The paradigm offers new perspectives on how people process and navigate conflicting narratives about climate change.",

          "abstract": "Researchers and laypeople alike have traditionally viewed personality as being highly stable across the lifespan. Although recent research has supported personality’s malleability, it is unclear how lifespan changes in personality traits compare to changes in other individual differences and how the public perceives this relative stability. Here, we investigate these perspectives using a multimethod, comparative approach across personality and other individual differences. In an online survey with a US-representative sample (n = 887), we found that laypeople believe personality traits change significantly less across the lifespan than other variables from domains like health and well-being. In contrast, using data from eight longitudinal panel studies (n = 166,971), we found that changes in personality were similar to many other commonly studied aspects of life, even surpassing lifespan changes in life satisfaction, self-esteem, subjective health, and church attendance, among others. Together, our results highlight that the durable view that personality traits are among the most stable aspects of life is at odds with the empirical reality. Given the implications of personality change and beliefs about personality change for future outcomes and successful interventions, it is crucial to effectively disseminate evidence to foster accurate beliefs about personality change.",

The current study delves into this contrast, seeking to understand how art is perceived and appreciated in museums and on a digital medium (like a computer screen). Across two experiments at the Barnes Foundation and Penn Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we explored how the aesthetic engagement of paintings and artifacts is influenced by the physical context in which an artwork is encountered and by the characteristics of the viewer. Our findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional impacts of artworks on viewers, as well as the viewers’ overall aesthetic experiences are comparable across physical museum spaces and digital platforms. However, participants reported gaining more understanding from art viewed in museums, compared to participants who viewed art in the lab. Art experience and openness to experience influenced aesthetic impacts and ratings differently in the museum and in the lab. Overall, routes to broader valuations of liking were more similar than different between the museum and lab contexts, whereas patterns of impacts that might lead to new knowledge or understanding gained differed between museum and lab contexts. As digital technologies are increasingly integrated into diverse processes in museums such as collections management, curation, exhibitions, and education and learning, our research highlights how museums can leverage digital expansion to achieve their missions as centers of learning and education.",

Whereas some people justify existing systems of power to maintain the status quo, others seek to challenge those systems, believing that existing systems distribute power inequitably across social groups. We aimed to establish a new psychological construct that reflects and accounts for how marginalized groups are not merely passive recipients of other people’s prejudice but form attitudes that resist and reconstrue status inequalities. In seven studies (N = 1,973), we developed and validated a measure to assess stigmatized groups’ attitudes toward dominant groups: the Upward Resistance Scale (URS). We examined LGBQ people’s attitudes toward heterosexual people, racial minorities’ attitudes toward white people, women’s attitudes toward men, poor people’s attitudes toward the wealthy, and fat people’s attitudes toward thin people. We found that the extent to which participants acknowledged status discrepancies between their ingroup and the dominant outgroup, they felt greater upward resistance toward the dominant outgroup. Our findings suggest that the 14-item URS is valid and reliable for detecting individual differences in beliefs about dominant groups and the status and privilege that they occupy.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup contact has been known to not only affect attitudes towards contacted and non-contacted outgroups, but also to affect people’s open and liberal thinking, which in turn affects a variety of human experiences, cognitions and behaviours outside the intergroup dimension (called cognitive liberalisation hypothesis or tertiary transfer effect, TTE). This manuscript explores one suggested TTE of intergroup contact affecting political attitudes and behaviours mediated via intergroup ideologies in a multi-verse approach combining several intergroup contact, intergroup ideologies and political attitudes and behaviours indicators. We used three waves of the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC), a representative large-scale annual survey (N = 2,863), and random-intercept cross-lagged panel models as advanced analytical methods. We found numerous stable between-person associations between intergroup contact, intergroup ideologies and political attitudes and behaviours.

We differentiate between various types of reinforcements, including external, non-external, and internal reinforcement, to understand their roles in shaping preferences. The chapter highlights the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying preference changes, emphasizing how internal reinforcement influences decision-making processes. This synthesis of literature aims to advance our understanding of how preferences can evolve in the absence of overt rewards, shedding light on the complexities of human decision-making and the underlying cognitive mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Continuous flow and evidence accumulation models have recently been combined to provide an integrated account of decision and motor mechanisms engaged in choice reaction time tasks. According to this account, muscle activation is essentially determined by the evidence accumulation decision variable through a continuous decision-to-motor transmission of information. However, it remains unclear whether and how this framework can be extended to situations that impose a time lag between the commitment to a choice and the expression of that choice through actions. Such situations have been studied using response signal (RS) decision tasks featuring a short delay between the offset of the stimulus and a signal to respond. The present work integrates recent developments in decision-making, working memory, and motor control research to extend models of immediate decision reports to delayed decision reports. We assumed that the evidence accumulation decision variable transitions to sustained activity after hitting a threshold to achieve the short-term maintenance of the selected choice. The level of sustained activity then constitutes the starting point for a second phase of accumulation, in which subjects sample evidence from the RS to activate the muscles. We tested predictions from the theory at the behavioral and muscle activation levels in three RS decision tasks featuring manipulations of stimulus duration, delay duration, and foreknowledge of the stimulus-response mapping. Muscle activation was measured using electromyography. The theory provided a unified account of empirical effects.",

          "authors": "Sophie Wilhelmina Berkhout; Noémi Katalin Schuurman; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.",

          "abstract": "Measuring insight is one of the biggest problems in the problem-solving field. Recent studies show that classic insight tasks can be solved through either insightful thinking or analytical thinking. The present work examined relationships between cognitive reasoning tasks, insight tasks and creative thinking. Additionally we explored differences in insight phenomenology when solving insight puzzles and when completing the Cognitive Reflection Test. We conducted two independent studies.  Study 1 was a conceptual replication of previously observed relationships between insight puzzles, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and the Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test (VCRT). Study 2 examined differences between analytical and insightful tasks using self-report insight scales. Five dimensions of insight were measured: suddenness, confidence, pleasure, the aha! experience, and arousal. \nResults showed a clear and positive correlation between insight puzzles and reflective tests (CRT, VCRT) in both studies, these supporting results from previous studies. Additionally, no differences in feelings of insight were observed between insight puzzles and the Cognitive Reflection Test. However, feelings of insight were greater for the VCRT than for insight puzzles. This suggests that the experience of insight may not be exclusively tied to a specific type of problem; rather, it may reflect a style of problem solving that can emerge in various task contexts.",

          "abstract": "Research and practice aimed at enhancing state motivation through job assignments that align with workers' trait motivations have demonstrated significant benefits. \"Occupational personality traits\" refer to Openness to experience (O), Extraversion (E), and Agreeableness (A) factors, which are associated with personality traits and occupational preferences. These traits facilitate the assessment of motivation and enable comparative analyses of the effectiveness of personality versus preference, as they share core semantics (i.e., O, E, or A) but differ in situational characteristics (i.e., broad everyday personalities versus occupation-specific preferences). This study examines occupational personality traits as indicators of an individual's trait-like motivation. We asked workers to rate both the person (i.e., their trait motivation for various jobs) and the environment (i.e., their actual occupation) using occupational personality traits and their current work motivation state. Polynomial regression with response surface analysis revealed that the motivational state was highest when person and job ratings aligned across the O, E, and A factors. This alignment effect was independently significant for O personality, E preference, and A preference, suggesting that specific factors dominate depending on the situation's breadth or occupational specificity. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing job assignments that align with employees' inherent motivational orientations, utilizing factor-specific constructs to foster a more motivated workforce.",

Results showed a trait-like TBRE: We found substantial individual differences in the TBRE, which were reliable and stable over time. The effect varied from being practically absent to being large, and we found no evidence for stable reversals; repetition did not meaningfully decrease believability among some individuals. Differences in the TBRE were modestly predicted by people’s Preference for Fluency. The results challenge the idea of a universal TBRE; Repetition increases the believability of information – but not for everyone, and more so for some than others.",

          "abstract": "AI-builders' preferences shape AI technologies throughout the development cycle, yet their demographic homogeneity raises concerns about misalignment with the more heterogeneous population of AI-users. To assess whether these demographic imbalances translate into systematically different moral and diversity preferences, we implemented a pseudo-experimental, cross-sectional design that gauged how demographic variables related to moral and diversity preferences among adults (N = 519, 20+ years) and adolescents (N = 395, 15-19 years) with varying AI engagement. Male adults scored higher on instrumental harm and showed lower diversity endorsement, with AI engagement linked to stronger utilitarianism but weaker diversity support. Given males greatly outnumber females in the AI workforce, our findings suggest that AI-builders are likely more utilitarian and less diversity-endorsing than -users. However, results from adolescents indicate that, particularly for utilitarianism, these differences may converge for future cohorts depending on the composition of the workforce. Our findings underscore that a more diverse AI workforce is crucial for aligning moral and diversity preferences with broader societal values.",

          "abstract": "Facial emotional expressions are interactive signals that communicate intentions. Previous research has shown that sending a facial emotional expression influences the evaluation of response expressions, but the mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear. In a preregistered experiment, 68 participants were asked to send an emoji (happy, neutral, angry) to a virtual agent in front of them, whereupon the agent reacted with either a smiling or frowning facial expression. Valence and arousal ratings were obtained and mimicry responses to the agent’s expression were measured via facial EMG of the Zygomaticus and Corrugator muscle. The results show that being smiled at is more pleasant and elicits greater Zygomaticus activation when the smile is received as a response to a happy emoji compared to an angry emoji. In contrast, being frowned at is less pleasant and increased Corrugator activity when the angry expression is received as a response to a happy compared to an angry emoji. Finally, we found that sending an emoji resulted in activation of facial muscles corresponding to the valence of the emoji. The results support the role of affiliative mechanisms in the exchange of facial expressions but also demonstrate that persons are sensitive to the congruency between emotional signals of sender and receiver. These effects might be driven by physiological feedback. By implementing digital emotional expressions the present study dissects the communicative act from the motor display of a facial expression and thus allows to probe mechanisms behind social interactions in real and digital worlds.",

This research investigates how economic status stereotypes affect competence judgments based on clothing cues across two cultural contexts. In studies conducted in Singapore (n=98) and the U.S. (n=208), participants judged the competence of individuals paired with expensive- or inexpensive-looking clothes. Participants’ economic status stereotypes were measured using questions about rich and poor people’s competence. In both studies, individuals with stronger economic status stereotypes showed a greater tendency to judge those in expensive-looking clothes as more competent. This effect manifested differently across cultures: in Singapore, it was driven by stereotypes about rich people’s competence, while in the U.S., it centered on stereotypes about poor people’s incompetence. These findings highlight how economic status stereotypes shape social perceptions universally and in culturally specific ways.",

In the present study, we surveyed 2149 participants in four Western countries, tracking their chatbot use and loneliness across 12 months. Using random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we modeled within-person changes in chatbot use and loneliness across four time points. We found evidence for a bi-directional relationship: Feeling lonelier predicted increased chatbot use, and increased chatbot use, in turn, predicted increased loneliness. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong causal conclusions; our findings are akin to a smoke alarm, providing an early warning signal of a potential problem, rather than direct evidence of fire.",

          "abstract": "Much of our understanding of language processing has been informed by controlled laboratory experiments abstracted from the real world demands of naturalistic communication. Interactive language use “in the wild” involves synchronizing numerous verbal and non-verbal behaviors between interlocutors. Conversation partners synchronize verbal production through modulations of rate, amplitude, lexical-semantic complexity, affective tone, and many other dimensions. Much remains to be learned about how to measure linguistic alignment in naturalistic interactions. We developed an open-source R package (ConversationAlign) capable of computing novel indices of alignment and main effects of language use between interlocutors across 30 psycholinguistic dimensions (e.g., valence, concreteness, frequency, word length). We describe operations of the ConversationAlign workflow, including its primary functions of cleaning transcripts and transforming raw language data to simultaneous time series objects aggregated by interlocutor, turn, and conversation. We present a use case of ConversationAlign applied to interview transcripts between American radio legend, Terry Gross, and her many guests over the span of 15 years (Fresh Air Archive, 2001). We identify caveats for use and potential sources of bias (e.g., polysemy, missing data, robustness to brief language samples). We close with a discussion of potential applications to better understand lexical alignment.

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had wide-reaching, global impacts on families that continue to be felt, particularly in education. Past research has documented changes in parents’ involvement in their children’s education during, as compared to before, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is often assumed that these changes are due to the increased burden placed on parents due to education being moved online in an effort to prevent disease spread. Despite this widely accepted assertation, the current study is the first to empirically investigate and support that the amount of time children were in online education predicted parents’ involvement in their children’s learning during the pandemic. This was done in the present preregistered study with data on 833 parents from across the United States with twin children in kindergarten through twelfth grade during the 2020-2021 school year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that parents of children who spent a higher percentage of the school year in online learning were more involved in providing schoolwork help to their children than parents of children who spent less of the school year in online education. Additionally, time spent in online education was associated with parents having less positive feelings towards their children’s school and teachers. These results held when controlling for parents’ education level and children’s grade level, each of which also predicted parental involvement. Thus, it appears that time spent in online education predicted parents’ involvement in their children’s education during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this differed by various factors of parental involvement.",

These are interventions aiming to increase uptake of or adherence to health protective behaviours. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics and effects of these interventions. Methods: For the review, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for studies on behavioural interventions. Out of 690 identified articles, 35 studies were considered relevant for this review. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) (Higgins et al., 2019). Results: The majority of studies researched the effects of interventions on social or physical distancing, handwashing, or face coverings. Many studies explored the effects of different types of messages, for example, promoting health protective behaviours. Message-based, online interventions were most common, but largely showed small to negligible effects. Some studies explored other intervention types such as coaching sessions and found moderate to large effects. Conclusion: While the results of these studies indicate that some interventions increase adherence, large heterogeneity in study and intervention design make it difficult to interpret and compare the effects of different interventions. Both an improvement of methodological rigour and standardisation efforts are needed to make behavioural research usable for policy design.",

          "abstract": "Imagine reading a shopping list: words such as apple, banana, and pear immediately create a strong sense of coherence, forming a predictable semantic context so that when the word orange appears, it is readily anticipated. In contrast, when the list begins with only apple followed by orange, the prediction is weaker despite semantic closeness. To capture this effect experimentally, participants (n = 20) performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one prime (short condition) or three semantically related primes (long condition). This design allowed us to examine how local semantic predictability accumulated across multiple primes. Our results showed that repeated exposure to semantically related primes substantially accelerated decision-making — an effect we attribute to faster evidence accumulation for semantically similar prime-target pairs, as quantified by a drift-diffusion model. Our results thus extend our understanding of language prediction to minimal contexts, demonstrating that top-down facilitation can emerge rapidly from just a few preceding items. This study advances our understanding of how prediction shapes language processing and demonstrates the relevance of hierarchical decision-making models in behavioral research.",

In this systematic review we investigated the extent to which cognition is related to older adults’ motor speech production.

Eligible studies involved healthy older adults, and/or those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with an average age of 60 or above. Study quality was formally evaluated and results presented via a narrative synthesis. In total, there were 22 eligible studies identified including 747 older adults. Ten of eighteen studies investigating attention/executive abilities reported significant relationships with motor speech subprocesses in 571 of 661 participants. Relationships between other cognitive abilities and motor speech outcomes were also reported, however, there were significant gaps in the literature and heterogeneity in the measurements used. In addition, only five studies contained the highest quality evidence. Cognition, and potentially executive abilities specifically, may affect speech articulation in healthy aging and in MCI. Further research implementing a range of tasks is required to better understand the trajectory of age-related changes to cognition and motor speech production.",

          "abstract": "To what degree might speech perception be affected by factors external to the speech signal? Here we consider whether listeners consider the value of individual talkers (e.g., a person that is important to the listener versus a passing stranger) when learning the idiosyncrasies of their speech, perhaps by directing their attention to the more “valuable” talker. In general, talker-specific phonetic recalibration has proven to be remarkably robust, leaving open how permeable it is to domain-general influences like attention and reward. The current study asked whether the magnitude of the talker-specific learning effect was modulated by an external reward intended to bias listeners to prioritize one talker over the other. Using an established paradigm, participants learned idiosyncratic pronunciations of the /s/ and /ʃ/ fricatives by two talkers—“Jane” and “Austin.” Over multiple experiments, participants were more likely to receive a few additional cents for one talker compared to the other following correct responses during exposure. We hypothesized that participants would show greater phonetic recalibration to the high-reward talker compared to the low-reward talker. Our results showed that participants did not show a difference in the degree of learning based on the value of each talker, suggesting that lexically guided perceptual learning is robust to external rewards. This finding opens discussions into the role of reward and attention in talker-specific phonetic recalibration, and how domain-general factors influence speech perception more broadly.",

          "abstract": "The warming of Earth’s surface temperatures poses a serious threat to the Earth’s ecosystem.  In 1996, world leaders agreed to limit this temperature rise to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while aiming to keep warming below 1.5°C. In order to achieve this, changes the consumption behaviours of households and individuals are needed. To encourage such change, websites have emerged which attempt to persuade individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviours.  This study explores twenty participants’ experiences using such websites.  The study employs a qualitative, longitudinal design, and utilises the think aloud method to examine the experience of using two web-based tools, Get-Greener and Climate Hero.  The study also investigates participants’ reflections on the sustainable behaviours recommended by these tools. During the two-week period, eight participants made small behavioural changes, six of which were recommended by the tools.  Key findings highlight the importance of persuasive design elements: feedback on current behaviour via footprint calculations, customised recommendations that consider personal circumstances, and ongoing support are valued by participants.  Participants preferred small, easy-to-implement ideas, highlighting barriers to larger-scale changes such as cost, limited access to sustainable alternatives, logistical issues, and a lack of clarity about what is sustainable.  Despite a general desire to adopt sustainable practices, intrinsic motivations such as convenience and financial considerations often outweighed pro-environmental intentions. Additionally, government leadership and social norms significantly influenced attitudes toward sustainability.  Participants expressed a need for clearer guidance and collective societal support to overcome these challenges.",

          "abstract": "In two pre-registered experiments (exp.1: n=44; exp.2: n=46), we investigated whether emotional inner speech has an effect on heart rate. Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: positive inner speech, negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed.",

          "abstract": "EEG studies show that stimuli requiring withholding a response (Nogo) elicit larger frontal N2 and frontocentral P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) than stimuli requiring a response (Go). However, the functional significance of these components remains debated due to overlapping neural processes and potential confounds in Go/Nogo tasks. One concern is that Nogo trials are typically less frequent than Go trials to induce a stronger response tendency. Since N2 and P3 are modulated by stimulus frequency, some argue that Nogo effects may reflect a response mismatch signal from infrequent Nogo trials. To test this, Eimer (1993) manipulated Go/Nogo trial frequency, using a 75/25 ratio in Experiment 1 and a 50/50 ratio in Experiment 2. While the N2 and P3 effects were numerically larger in Experiment 1, they remained robust in Experiment 2, with both components showing greater amplitudes for Nogo trials. These findings contradict the response mismatch hypothesis and emphasize the importance of equating trial frequency in Go/Nogo studies. Eimer (1993) also manipulated spatial attention to determine whether the N2 effect reflects an automatic (i.e., attention-independent) process. Results showed that N2 effects were modulated by attentional cues, ruling out a purely automatic process and highlighting the role of processes that affect initial stimulus detection and discrimination in these tasks. The present study replicates Eimer’s Experiment 2 from and assess the robustness of the results across analysis pipelines. Moreover, it will extend the original analyses by determining whether 50/50 Go/Nogo paradigms reliably induce prepotent response tendencies. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project, 5 labs will independently replicate the original study, ensuring high statistical power. Results will be integrated via meta-analysis, offering insights into the replicability of classic EEG findings and N2/P3 sensitivity to stimulus frequency and spatial attention in Go/Nogo tasks. The large dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future meta-analyses.",

          "abstract": "Background. Enduring mental health conditions typically begin in adolescence. Social adversity (e.g., discrimination, bullying, trauma) may disrupt the development of healthy social learning processes and self and other beliefs. We tested the impact of prior social adversity and current social exclusion on paranoia, self and other beliefs and latent social learning processes in UK adolescents (15-17 years, n=502), using pre-registered hypotheses (AsPredicted #154322), causal Bayesian models, and exploratory analyses. Study Design. An experimental design tested (a) whether social exclusion interacted with prior social adversity to increase paranoia, (b) whether this occurred due to activating negative self and other beliefs, and (c) whether this was moderated by cognitive flexibility (i.e., moderated-mediation). Cognitive flexibility, alongside computational processes of social information generalisation, were assessed using The Intentions Game (Barnby et al., 2024). Study Results. Social exclusion triggered paranoia, which was intensified by prior social adversity, and substantially reduced latent belief flexibility about the self and others, inhibiting learning and subduing other-to-self generalisation (social contagion). Negative self and other beliefs were a mechanism through which social adversities lead to paranoia in the context of exclusion. Prior exposure to discrimination amplified state paranoia irrespective of inclusion/exclusion. Conclusion. Social adversity enhances susceptibility to paranoia following a social exclusion manipulation, in part due to activating negative self and other beliefs. Failure to detect pro-sociality in others, impacted by the rigidly with which negative self and other beliefs are held, as well as by discrimination in particular, likely exacerbates and maintains paranoia. Findings directly inform likely profitable intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "We are witnessing exponential growth in the use of machine learning to create fake – yet indistinguishable - sexual media of others without their consent. Though there is an emerging understanding of the impact that deepfake sexual abuse (DSA) has on its victims and societal understanding thereof, this knowledge pertains entirely to individuals whose facial likeness has been used within said material, with little-to-no attention paid to those whose bodies are used as the canvas; individuals who are predominantly sex workers. Across 321 participants (Mage = 45.70 years, SD = 15.88; 48.9% female), vignettes were used to explore differences in societal judgements of DSA for victims whose face (versus body) was used to generate DSA material, and whether they were labelled as a sex worker. Though perceived criminality did not differ across conditions, participants allocated more blame and less anticipated harm to DSA victims whose body, relative to whose face, was used. This effect was enhanced in vignettes labelling them as sex workers. When exploring correlations using demographics, beliefs, and personality traits, being older, male, and viewing sex work as ‘a choice’ and/or ‘deviant’ predicted greater victim blame, lower perceived criminality, and less anticipated harm. High self-reported empathy was the only predictor of greater anticipated harm. Results indicate the importance of understanding broader impacts of DSA - regardless of the victim - for stakeholders within the criminal justice system, and a continued need to generate public awareness of DSA through international policy.",

However, its assessment in educational contexts remains fragmented, failing to comprehensively understand the diverse factors that shape students’ experiences.

The approach will uncover key patterns that influence well-being and academic performance, offering actionable insights to guide targeted interventions in educational settings.  \nMethods: The framework, developed through an extensive literature review and refined using the Delphi method, integrates three core components: physiological measures (e.g., heart rate variability and sleep data) to detect stress; self-reporting tools for qualitative insights; and survey instruments to capture psychological stressors and socio-economic influences. While broadly applicable, it emphasizes CSS-specific stressors. \nResults: We collect qualitative and quantitative data based on self-reports and physiological measures. Large language models are leveraged for sentiment analyses of qualitative data. Classic machine learning techniques analyze physiological data and integrate quantitative data from multiple modalities. This approach aims to identify patterns in stress and coping mechanisms, offering insights into broader dimensions of well-being.  \nConclusion: This research advances AI-driven educational tools, with an ethically grounded, data-driven approach to support student development, particularly for CSS.",

Pseudo-factor analysis is a data-less, model-based approach to evaluating aspects of a latent construct’s measurement model, such as dimensionality and the relations between factors and their indicators. Across two studies using Five and Six-factor personality frameworks, a variety of sentence transformer models, and three encoding approaches (i.e., atomic, atomic reversed, and macro), pseudo-factor analyses recovered theoretically expected structures. These pseudo-factor structures were strongly related to their established empirical factor structures based on factor analyses of human ratings in prior published research. We suggest that Pseudo-Factor Analysis is a viable method for checking and potentially modifying scale items after item generation and before item trialing.

          "abstract": "Background\n\nThere is an increasing rate of comorbidity with alcoholism and mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, especially among young adults, the demographic with the largest proportion of heavy drinkers. This study compares semaglutide, a GLP-1 drug, and naltrexone, which is FDA-approved for treating alcoholism, in treating comorbid alcoholism and anxiety using self-reported data from Reddit posts.\n\nMethods\n\nReddit API was used to extract Reddit posts relating either of the drugs (naltrexone and semaglutide) to either of the disorders (alcoholism and anxiety) as well as posts discussing the side effects of each drug. A script was created in Python to use Reddit API and automatically label the posts using a list of keywords, which was developed by running the script and manually checking portions of the data. For each drug, the effectiveness in treating a disorder was compared to ineffectiveness, and low/moderate side effects were compared to high side effects. The Chi-square test was applied to check for significance.\n\nResults\n\nAn analysis of 1,214 posts showed that Semaglutide was more effective than naltrexone at treating alcoholism as 100% of posts reported semaglutide to be effective compared to 75.67% of posts for naltrexone. Although the percentage of posts reporting the effectiveness of naltrexone for anxiety was greater at 68.97% compared to 63.83% for semaglutide, a chi-square test found that these differences were not statistically significant. Semaglutide had less intense side effects than naltrexone as 63.76% of the posts discussing semaglutide side effects found them to have a high intensity compared to 73.14% of posts discussing naltrexone side effects.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the rising comorbid condition of anxiety with alcoholism, semaglutide is a promising alternative to naltrexone for treating patients with alcoholism. It also appears to be a safer alternative, which could encourage more people to seek out treatment. Future studies can conduct clinical trials with treatment-seeking patients to affirm it, especially for comparing the two drugs for alcohol effectiveness. Other GLP-1 drugs and other mental health disorders in alcoholism comorbidities should also be explored.",

          "abstract": "Our earliest acquired words tend to reference concrete objects that can be seen, heard, touched, and felt. One hallmark of language maturation involves an ‘abstractness shift’ where language is used to convey intangible mental states, emotions, and ideas. Much of our understanding of the trajectory of concreteness in language development ends at early adolescence and is informed by studies of comprehension. We investigated concreteness effects in language production across the span of adulthood with a focus on conversation. We tested two competing hypotheses about abstract word use in conversation as a function of normal aging. The first hypothesis is that a steady accrual of vocabulary knowledge over the lifespan will confer a more expansive abstract lexicon and that older adults will in turn produce more abstract words in conversation. An alternative hypothesis is that aging gradually compromises executive resources that impact abstract word retrieval, leading to a concreteness bias in conversation. We analyzed distributions of abstract and concrete words and cross-speaker alignment within unscripted conversations between adults of different ages (N=1565 conversations, &gt;8 million words, age range 19-66) using a novel computational algorithm (ConversationAlign). Aging was associated with abstract word dropout, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that high processing demands of conversation (e.g., alignment, topic maintenance) bias lexical retrieval toward concrete word use. We discuss the significance of these results for understanding intergenerational communication and relationships between aging, executive functioning, and lexical retrieval in high-level discourse.",

          "authors": "Patrick C. Trettenbrein; Emiliano Zaccarella; Angela D. Friederici",
          "abstract": "The capacity for language constitutes a cornerstone of human cognition and distinguishes our species from other animals. Research in the cognitive sciences has demonstrated that this capacity is not bound to speech but can also be externalized in the form of sign language. Sign languages are the naturally occurring languages of the deaf and rely on movements and configurations of hands, arms, face, and torso in space. This chapter reviews the functional and structural organisation of the neural substrates of sign language as identified by neuroimaging research over the past decades. Most aspects of sign language processing in adult deaf signers markedly mirror the well-known functional left-lateralization of spoken and written language. However, both hemispheres exhibit a certain equipotentiality for processing linguistic information and the right hemisphere seems to specifically support processing of some constructions unique to the signed modality. Crucially, the so-called “core language network” in the left hemisphere constitutes a functional and structural asymmetry in typically developed deaf and hearing populations alike: This network is (i) pivotal for processing complex syntax independent of the modality of language use, (ii) matures in accordance with a genetically determined biological matrix, and (iii) may have constituted an evolutionary prerequisite for the emergence of the human capacity for language.",

          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "We encounter situations each day that require our auditory system to quickly interpret our surroundings. Auditory scene perception involves complex processes that allow us to identify both the setting and the objects within a scene, which are essential for decision-making, and situational awareness. While there is substantial evidence for distinct cortical regions and pathways supporting visual scene and object recognition, far less is known about how the brain processes complex auditory scenes and objects. This study aimed to determine whether distinct mechanisms underlie auditory setting and object identification and whether these mechanisms interact to aid perception. Participants listened to 200 natural auditory scenes of varying durations (1, 2, and 4 sec) and identified the setting (e.g., café) as well as the objects (e.g., talking, espresso machine, music) within each scene. Overall, performance was highest on the object identification task, and there was a significant interaction between task and scene duration, with a greater benefit of longer durations for the object identification task. Different low- and mid-level acoustic features of the scenes predicted performance on the two tasks. These results suggest that the auditory system employs distinct (and potentially interactive) computations for setting and object identification, allowing for quick interpretation of complex, real-world auditory scenes. The interaction between task performance and scene duration further suggests object and setting identification may operate on different temporal scales; objects might require more time for accurate individuation, while settings may be recognized more efficiently through global properties of scenes, such as openness or naturalness.",

Increasing studies examined the dynamic associations between momentary fluctuations of anxiety and well-being, primarily focusing on the severity of general anxiety. Scant research has explored the co-fluctuations between different anxiety symptoms and mental health outcomes. \nMethod: Using eight items selected from the Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) scale, the current study evaluated the multi-level factor structure and assessed the subclinical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), and panic disorder (PD) in a sample of non-clinical young adults (N = 271, Mage = 18 years, 72% female, 68% non-White) who participated in a 30-day daily diary study. This study also measured participants’ emotional and peer problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, and stress by the College Chronic Life Stress Survey.\nResults: Between persons, GAD, SP, and PD were positively correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, as well as emotional and peer problems. Within persons, both SP and PD were positively associated with stress, peer and emotional problems on the same day. Across days, there was positive reciprocal relation between PD and stress, whereas negative reciprocal link was observed between SP and emotional problems. \nConclusion: Current findings showed dynamic and distinct patterns in the associations between different anxiety symptoms and several mental health outcomes, which emphasizes the need to disentangle between- and within-person variation of anxiety symptoms with intensive longitudinal designs.",

          "abstract": "Impression formation is the process of learning about people—how a perceiver infers another person’s character traits, goals, and preferences and forms their own attitude toward that person. Emerging research shows that impressions are formed through a variety of mechanisms—a multimodal process rooted in different underlying systems of learning and memory. In this Perspective, I describe the roles of episodic, semantic, instrumental, and Pavlovian memory systems in impression formation and updating. By considering the unique and interactive functions of learning and memory mechanisms, this memory systems framework expands and clarifies understanding of how impressions are formed, changed, and expressed in behavior, relative to prior accounts based only on semantic memory models. This framework also illuminates longstanding debates on the nature of implicit social cognition and how social information is represented in the mind.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests there are sex differences in social cognitive abilities, with females typically performing better on tasks involving emotion recognition and mental state attribution. However, many prior studies have demonstrated limited replicability, perhaps due to differences in methods employed or samples studied. Given that social cognition is a key determinant of social functioning, and that social dysfunction represents a transdiagnostic issue in neuropsychiatric populations, understanding sex differences in social cognition among individuals with varying levels of social functioning should broaden our understanding of the etiology, expression, and treatment of psychopathology. The present study examined sex differences in gaze perception, perceptual theory of mind, and social inference abilities in a sample (n = 172; 66.8% female) of adolescents and young adults (ages 14 to 30) ranging from minimal to clinical levels of social dysfunction. Females performed better on tasks involving perceptual theory of mind and eye gaze perception, and these sex differences remained even after accounting for general cognition, age, and psychopathology. Our findings suggest that females may be more sensitive to social signals related to the eyes and may more accurately identify social signals when there is subtle or limited information available. Findings indicate the importance of recognizing sex differences in the presentation of social functioning and, by extension, socially relevant psychopathology. Such differences may have implications for tailoring treatments for social dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Background: Hue, saturation, and brightness are critical dimensions of color perception, and art students may experience color-related emotions differently from non-art students due to either their specialized training or innate artistic sensitivity. Despite this intriguing possibility, limited research has systematically examined these differences. This study aims to investigate how art and non-art students perceive and emotionally evaluate different colors.\nMethods: Using a questionnaire-based approach, participants rated the emotional valence of colors on a 7-point semantic differential scale, ranging from very negative to very positive. The colors were carefully selected from Munsell's color system, which enabled precise manipulation of hue, brightness, and saturation levels. The study included 36 art students and 36 non-art students, who evaluated colors under controlled experimental conditions.\nResults: The findings indicate that brightness and saturation significantly influence emotional responses to colors. Warmer colors, such as orange, elicited more positive emotional evaluations, whereas cooler colors, such as blue, received less positive ratings. Notably, art students differed from non-art students in their emotional responses, with the former group showing distinct sensitivity to variations in color dimensions.\nConclusion: This study highlights that art training shapes emotional color perception, as evidenced by the differing evaluations of art and non-art students. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how artistic training influences the emotional experience of color and underscore the role of education in enhancing perceptual and emotional sensitivity to visual stimuli.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the importance of estimating demographic biases in research has become apparent. Here we provide a systematic review of the CHILDES database, the major source of naturalistic recordings of children’s linguistic environment. We analyzed the database according to four dimensions considered central to language learning: SES, urbanization, family structure, and language. We present descriptive statistics of each dimension to assess whether naturalistic recordings were biased regarding the demographics of the countries and the families recorded within them. We find that CHILDES’s recordings overrepresented wealthier countries and higher parental education levels; urban settings; and smaller households. Middle- and higher-class participants were likewise over-represented. The corpora were not representative of their countries in terms of urbanization either - with a larger percentage of families residing in urban settings than is overall true for their respective countries. In terms of family structure, nuclear families were more prevalent than in the countries where the data was collected. Last, we found that corpora were linguistically diverse, but we estimate that these recordings underrepresent bilingual and multilingual households. We conclude that researchers should be careful when generalizing from naturalistic recordings of children's input and output obtained from CHILDES.",

Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos. However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time. We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (Ntotal = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms. We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions. Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.",

First, at an early stage of processing, it\nremains unclear whether this bias follows a static pattern (vigilance) or fluctuates between\nvigilance and avoidance. Second, methodological and theoretical concerns have been raised\nregarding the reliability of the dot-probe task in measuring threat-related attentional bias. The\npresent study aimed to test the hypothesis of a static early expression of attentional bias to\nthreat using both a classical dot-probe task and a novel eye-dot-probe task, in which responses\nwere made via ocular saccades. Additionally, we hypothesized that the relationship between\nattentional bias to threat and anxiety follows an exponential rather than linear trajectory. Non-\nclinical participants completed both tasks along with an anxiety questionnaire. Results\nshowed no consistent relationship between anxiety and either static or fluctuating attentional\nbias in the classical dot-probe task. However, in the eye-dot-probe task, an exponential\nrelationship emerged between anxiety and static attentional bias toward threat, with a\nsignificant bias observed in high-anxious individuals. These findings provide theoretical and\nmethodological insights, suggesting that early attentional bias toward threat is static, best\ncaptured using eye-movement responses, and follows a non-linear relationship with anxiety,\nemerging only beyond a critical threshold.",

Analysis of naming response times (RTs) showed that constraining contexts enable preplanning of both lexical-semantic and phonological representations (Experiment 1). Using a picture-word interference version of the same task (Experiment 2), we found that speakers preplan the phonological form of the whole word, however, only the subset of constraining trials with the shortest RTs indicated preplanning.

          "abstract": "Social video gaming has become an integral part of adolescent life, yet its impact on well-being remains unclear. This longitudinal study examines how social gaming relates to loneliness and depressive mood among adolescents, considering both within-person and between-person associations. Additionally, it explores the moderating roles of gender and age. Data were collected from a large sample of Czech adolescents across four waves, with social gaming assessed using an adapted version of the Social Interaction Potential Assessment (SIPA) tool. A random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was employed to distinguish stable between-person differences from within-person fluctuations over time. Findings revealed that while adolescents who generally played more social games reported higher loneliness at the between-person level, an increase in social gaming was associated with a decrease of loneliness at the within-person level. No direct link between social gaming and depressive mood was observed. Gender differences emerged, with social gaming reducing loneliness and depressive mood for boys but increasing both for girls at within-person level. Additionally, younger adolescents were more likely to increase social gaming in response to depressive mood, whereas older adolescents showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that while social gaming may provide temporary relief from loneliness, particularly for boys, it may also reflect underlying vulnerabilities, especially for girls. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of social gaming’s role in adolescent well-being, considering individual differences in gender and age.",

          "abstract": "There are large differences across individuals in the ability to perceive foreign-accented speech, and the sources of this variability are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in auditory processing help drive variability in accented speech perception. We asked L1 English speakers to perceive prosodic features in Mandarin-accented English. Individuals who could precisely discriminate pitch and accurately remember melodic sequences, and who placed more emphasis on pitch information during prosodic categorization, were better able to perceive accented speech. Individuals with more musical training also demonstrated enhanced accented speech perception. Finally, we found that better accented speech perception was linked to more robust neural encoding of speech harmonics. These findings suggest that the precision of sound perception and robustness of memory for sound sequences are major factors driving variability in accented speech perception, and so auditory training could potentially help remediate poor perception of accented speech.",

          "abstract": "To perceive speech listeners must decide how to prioritize information from multiple acoustic dimensions. Over the course of language learning, individuals form stable perceptual strategies which reflect the strength of the statistical relationship between values along particular acoustic dimensions and linguistic categories. However, despite this underlying stability, listeners respond to evidence about shifts in the reliability of acoustic dimensions as cues to categorization, changing their strategies. Here we show that such changes are maximally efficient: listeners will adjust after hearing just a single stimulus in which the relationship between acoustic cues diverges from the expected pattern. Furthermore, these shifts in strategy vanish as quickly as they appear, lasting only a single trial before returning to baseline. Finally, we show that shifts in cue weighting are resistant to distraction, occurring equally when speech is presented in quiet versus in informational masking. Speech perception strategies, therefore, are characterized by short-term fluctuation and long-term stability.",

While research has established that user beliefs, or an artificial agent’s appearance, can shape social outcomes with artificial agents, little is known about how these factors interact. We used virtual reality (VR) with eye- and motion-tracking, to examine the extent to which people attend to and use an agent’s gaze in a collaborative task. Participants initiated and responded to joint attention bids using hand gestures, while coordination could be implicitly facilitated by attending to the agent’s eye gaze. However, this did not result in any behavioural differences. Participants persistently used these gaze cues, reflected in coordination accuracy, face-looking frequency, and reaction times. Participants who *believed* their partner was human, rather than an AI system, subjectively reported more gaze-following and positive social experiences. When the agent *looked* like a human, rather than a robot, participants looked less frequently at the eyes, responded faster, and reported more negative social experiences. Our data suggests that social AI systems are approached more like humans than computers, irrespective of explicit beliefs about their humanness. Furthermore, when the artificial agent appeared in a non-human form, believing that it was human- rather than AI-controlled improved subjective experiences, highlighting how beliefs about AI systems may shape subjective social outcomes. This suggests that disclosure around the true intentional stance of artificial agents (e.g., in online VR contexts) may be important for shaping subjective social outcomes.",

Across two samples collected in separate countries (UK and Germany; N = 658 and 972 respectively), a large number of male and female names were rated on multiple social traits, with mean trait ratings for each name then being entered into a Principal Components Analysis. In both samples, and for both male and female names, the same four component structure was found: these included components corresponding with valence/warmth, dominance/competence, age, and familiarity.

          "authors": "Alfio Ventura; Christopher Starke; Francesca Righetti; Nils Köbis",
          "abstract": "Loneliness is a pressing global health issue, yet traditional interventions often fall short due to scalability limitations and the individualized experiences of loneliness. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled synthetic relationships (SRs)—ongoing associations with AI companions designed to simulate human-like social bonds. SRs offer, among other aspects, constant availability, adaptability, and emotional responsiveness, which potentially address loneliness. However, their growing integration into social life raises critical psychological, ethical, and societal questions. This paper examines the opportunities and risks of SRs through the lens of relationship science, psychology, and AI companionship research. We first highlight how existing loneliness interventions face the challenges of availability, scalability, and personalization. We then outline how SRs present a novel alternative to overcoming these challenges. Drawing mainly on social penetration, attachment, and interdependence theory, we analyze how SRs may foster companionship, reduce social anxiety, and improve interpersonal skills, potentially mitigating loneliness. However, we also identify significant risks, including emotional over-reliance, distorted social expectations, and privacy concerns. The widespread adoption of SRs may reshape human-human relationships, altering norms of intimacy and social connection. To navigate these challenges, we outline a research agenda promoting interdisciplinary theory development longitudinal studies, drawing on representative samples to address the ethical concerns of SRs. We argue that SRs hold promise as a social intervention when ensuring they complement rather than replace human relationships. By integrating interdisciplinary insights, this paper provides a foundation for understanding and guiding the responsible design of SRs for addressing loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Rationale\n\nSince the earliest LSD research, psychedelics have been claimed to enhance autobiographical memory. Revisiting and processing autobiographical memories has further been suggested to be a major component of the therapeutic action of psychedelics. However, modern psychedelic research has largely neglected autobiographical elements of psychedelic experiences, and many vital questions remain unanswered.\n\nObjectives\n\nWe present and discuss six open questions related to psychedelics and autobiographical memory: 1. Do psychedelics enhance autobiographical recall? 2. Is recall and processing of significant autobiographical (e.g., traumatic) memories a common part of psychedelic experiences? 3. Do psychedelics promote the development of false or inaccurate memories? 4. How do autobiographical memories change if they are recalled and reconsolidated under the effects of psychedelics? 5. What are memories of psychedelic experiences like? 6. Are autobiographical experiences under psychedelics of particular importance for their therapeutic effects?\n\nResults\n\nWe present the background and current limited state of evidence for each question and provide suggestions on how future studies could best address them. \n\nConclusions\n\nBesides advancing basic research, answering these pressing questions is highly relevant for the possible therapeutic use of psychedelics, both in terms of developing and optimizing new interventions and for avoiding iatrogenic harms. Ideally, future psychedelic-assisted interventions could harness the possible synergies between the effects of psychedelics and existing memory-based therapies.\n\nKeywords: Psychedelics, autobiographical memory, LSD, psilocybin",

          "abstract": "Effort is a critical component of daily goal pursuit, both as the work invested in achieving a goal and as the subjective experience that accompanies it. While the roles of work and reward have been extensively studied in decision-making, relatively little is known about the influence of other cognitive and motor contributors when selecting between actions. Progress feedback, i.e., information on one’s progress towards a goal, has been suggested to be intrinsically valuable. In this pre-registered study, we tested whether people preferred physical work involving progress feedback, even when it was accompanied by more work. We further examined whether preference for progress feedback could be explained by lower perceived effort, improved effort exertion characteristics, or mental health factors. Participants (n=114) performed an online effort-based decision-making task, choosing between options with progress feedback (PF+) or with no progress feedback (PF-). We recorded continuous movements during effort exertion with mouse-tracking. Overall, participants preferred to receive progress feedback. Preference for progress was positively associated with social motivation, as measured using the Apathy Motivation Index, but not with traits previously linked to information seeking. At a group-level, participants did not rate PF+ trials as less effortful compared to PF-. Progress feedback did not improve effort exertion efficiency, as movements in PF+ were more variable and less smooth than movements in PF-. These results suggest that progress feedback is innately valuable despite its potential costs. The correlation with social motivation highlights a potential link to external validation, which warrants testing in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation), cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism), and sometimes period effects (e.g., secular trends in mental health). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if we observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can we reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in our understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.",

It also showed that when division of labor does occur, men undertake more costly tasks than women. However, it is still unclear whether men always undertake high-cost tasks and women always avoid such tasks. Therefore, it was examined when men and women do and do not undertake a high-cost task. \n\nMethods \nUsing an online scenario experiment, 1247 participants from four countries were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (compete/choose) to determine whether participants differed in their likelihood of making a high-cost choice depending on the relationship with their imaginary opposite-sex partner. \n\nResults \nOverall, men were more likely than women to make a high-cost choice, and both men and women who participated in the compete condition (participant loved their imaginary opposite-sex partner) were more likely to make a high-cost choice than those who participated in the choose condition (participant was loved by their imaginary opposite-sex partner). In addition, all observed effects were consistent across the four countries. \n\nConclusion \nThe results of the current study support the mutual mate choice model in that women can be competitive to obtain a desirable mate, but also support the males-compete/females-choose model in that men overall have a greater tendency to compete for a potential mate.",

People vary in how they handle this uncertainty, with some experiencing greater discomfort in ambiguous situations. We propose that individuals with higher uncertainty avoidance process facial impressions in a more fine-grained manner, suggesting a specific cognitive strategy to manage this uncertainty. Across two studies, we found that both individuals (Study 1: N = 105) and cultures (Study 2: N = 10,552, 40 regions) with higher uncertainty avoidance formed more distinctly separated personality trait impressions from faces. The relationship between uncertainty avoidance and impression separation was mediated by the strength of trait concept dissociations that individuals held (Study 1). This tendency to separate different personality traits may help reduce the ambiguity of social judgments. Our findings reveal how even basic cognitive tendencies shape social perception at both individual and cultural levels.",

In this Perspective, we propose a computational framework for intention formation (Implementation vs. Goal vs. No Intention) and how it impacts goal pursuit. Our framework explains a broad range of findings within the intention formation literature including seemingly contradictory ones, while making novel empirically testable predictions. Importantly, it establishes normative conditions under which forming Implementation (vs. Goal) Intentions is an optimal strategy considering its benefits and costs. Finally, current formal models of value-based decision-making rarely consider ecological timescales of human intentions. Interfacing with this work, we lay the groundwork for a neurocognitive understanding of intention formation and its impact on goal pursuit.",

In the current research, we examined the extent to which measures of relationship quality and other important relationship constructs are empirically separable from one another. Across two studies of US census-matched participants (total N = 3,439), we applied latent variable techniques (e.g., exploratory bifactor analysis) on broad pools of items representing various prominent relationship-specific constructs. Results revealed robust evidence that a single general factor Q (representing global relationship sentiment) accounts for a vast majority of common variance across distinct relationship measures. Thus, respondents appear to draw primarily on their overall global relationship evaluations when reporting on an array of presumably-distinct relationship facets. This is consistent with a ‘sentiment override’ perspective. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence for a relationship-specific response bias that challenges prevailing assumptions and practice in the field, including the widespread use of self-report methods to capture meaningful aspects of relationship functioning.",

(1992) found that intense noise increased impulsive responses during a task in which college students chose between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) options to earn points exchangeable for money (SS – impulsive option; LL – self-control option). Furthermore, the removal of the aversive noise did not result in increments in LL responses, and vice versa (i.e., self-control preference continued when the noise was later introduced). Considering human physiological responses to pictures of human mutilation resemble those produced by aversive stimuli (e.g., heart rate changes), we explored if the disruptive effects of aversive stimuli on self-control behavior could be reproduced with images of mutilation. Matching-to-sample trials depicting the images of mutilation were interspersed between the choice trials with different probabilities (Random-Time 0 s, 20 s, and 30 s). A delay-discounting task was introduced before and after the choice task to obtain k and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, which were used to explore a relationship with performance during the choice task. A within-subjects design with 24 participants was implemented. Each probability of matching mutilation images was an experimental condition. Initial exposure to high probability of matching overall produced indifference (~ 50% LL responses). Proportion of LL responses increased when the probability of the images was reduced. Participants not initially exposed to the images developed preference for the self-control option and maintained it during subsequent conditions when probability of matching images changed. Delay-discounting measures were not related to performance during the choice task, possibly because of a magnitude effect (smaller reinforcers are discounted more steeply than larger reinforcers). Future studies must address the divergent results in this line of research, especially the fact that noise and visual stimulation produced mostly indifference, whereas cold water (Flora et al., 2003) is the only stimulus that has been shown to increase impulsive choice beyond indifference.",

Here we use multiple methods (N = 5,376) to test an intriguing claim entailed by this work: People think that women are morally superior to men. Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. Next, using a novel profile-generation task, we find that people are more likely to ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they are spontaneously thinking of a woman (vs. a man) and when they are assigned to do so. Further, using a large database of 1,864 normed behaviors, we find that behaviors associated with moral goodness are also stereotyped as feminine. Finally, we use a novel impression updating task to explore a potential consequence of this phenomenon. Specifically, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men. As a result, equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, these findings reveal that moral goodness is closely linked to gender concepts: people think women are morally superior to men.",

Such individuals are routinely referred to using labels such as “alien,” “foreigner,” and “noncitizen.” In this multimethod project relying on data from 5,437 U.S. citizens in experimental studies and 193,649 U.S. citizens in archival studies, we examine implicit (automatic) evaluations of non-Americans in the United States, their effects on impression formation, and their ecological correlates in the form of real-life outcomes. In Studies 1A–1C, the labels “alien,” “foreigner,” and “noncitizen” were found to be highly and similarly implicitly negative. In Studies 2A–2D, applying these labels to specific individuals created immediate implicit negativity toward them, irrespective of their gender or race. Finally, pro-American/anti-foreigner implicit evaluations predicted anti-immigrant policy positions at the level of individuals (Study 3A), and a conceptually and statistically related implicit White–American/Asian–foreign implicit stereotype predicted anti-immigrant voting patterns in 18 relevant ballot initiatives at the level of U.S. counties (Study 3B). Across studies, implicit anti-foreigner bias generalized across participant demographics but was somewhat stronger among men and political conservatives.

Here, we examine whether loneliness is characterized by altered expectations of emotion transitions for both oneself and others, which may contribute to these disruptions in socio-cognitive processes and pose challenges for social connection. Drawing on data from seven studies (total N = 1475) using a validated emotion transition task, we found that lonelier individuals hold atypical expectations about both their own and others’ likelihoods to transition between emotions and are less accurate at predicting others’ emotion transitions. While lonely participants relied less on their own emotion transition patterns when predicting others’ emotions, they were also less confident in their predictions, suggesting they use a less stable or altered strategy for predicting others. Furthermore, lonelier individuals perceived others as more volatile, expecting them to switch emotional valence states more frequently and be less likely to maintain the same emotional state. At the same time, they viewed themselves as more likely to shift away from positive states.

          "abstract": "Background:\nThe recent increase in online health information-seeking prompted extensive user appraisal of encountered content. Information consumption depends crucially on the quality of encountered information and the user’s ability to evaluate it; yet, within the context of online, organic search behavior, few studies take into account both these aspects simultaneously.\n\nObjectives:\nWe aimed to explore a method to bridge these two aspects and grant even consideration to both the stimulus (webpage content) and the user (ability to appraise encountered content). We examined novices and experts in information retrieval and appraisal to demonstrate a novel approach to studying Information Foraging Theory: Stimulus-Engagement Alignment (SEA).\n\nMethods:\nWe sampled from experts and novices in information retrieval and assessment, asking participants to conduct a 10-minute search task with a specific information goal. We employed an observational and a retrospective think-aloud protocol to collect data within the framework of an interview. Data from three streams (think-aloud, human-computer interaction, and screen content) were manually coded in the ROCK standard and subsequently aligned and represented in a tabularized format with the R package {rock}. SEA scores were derived from designated code co-occurrences in specific segments of data within the stimulus data stream versus the think-aloud and human-computer interaction data streams. \n\nResults:\nSEA scores represented a meaningful comparison of what participants encountered and what they engaged with. Operationalizing codes as either “present” or “absent” in a particular data stream allowed us to inspect not only which credibility cues participants engaged with the most frequency, but also whether participants noticed the absence of cues. Code co-occurrence frequencies could thus indicate case-, time-, and context-sensitive information appraisal that also takes into account the quality of information encountered.\n\nDiscussion:\nEmploying SEA allowed us to retain epistemic access to idiosyncratic manifestations of both stimuli and engagement, but also, via utilizing the same coding scheme and designated co-occurrences across participants, be able to pinpoint trends within our sample and subsamples. We believe our approach lends a powerful analysis encompassing the breadth and depth of data, both on par with each other in the feat of understanding organic, online search behavior.",

          "abstract": "Co-rumination, defined as when individuals perseverate on problems with each other, focus excessively on negative feelings, and cyclically discuss the causes and consequences of problems, is often examined from the perspective of the person seeking support about a problem or by averaging both dyad members’ individual ratings of co-rumination. This approach muddles how each dyad member contributes to the “co” of co-rumination and may have implications for understanding prior work that has shown associations between co-rumination and intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. We leveraged state space grids to examine co-rumination as a dyadic and dynamic system, as constituted by the temporal unfolding of each dyad member’s self-rated social rumination throughout their discussion. From 2019-2020, 85 primarily White and female college-aged close friend dyads engaged in a support discussion. After, friends viewed their recorded discussion and rated their individual contributions to the co-rumination process (i.e., social rumination) every 30 seconds across the eight-minute conversation. Results revealed that the more both dyad members got “stuck” engaging in mutually high social rumination (i.e., co-rumination), the more they perceived each other as responsive and supportive and viewed the problem as more solved. In contrast, the more that only the person disclosing the problem was stuck in high levels of social rumination or when dyads more flexibly engaged in social rumination, the more individuals with the problem benefited from the conversation, but responders benefited less. Examining co-rumination dyadically and dynamically can reveal when and for whom co-rumination processes are associated with costs and benefits.",

          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1) before and after non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and perceived groove. Following stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the left SMA may have disinhibited either the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions themselves. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA plays a critical role in embodied rhythm processing.",

          "abstract": "Defaults are powerful: whereas wisely set defaults increase prosocial choices, poorly set defaults promote self-serving decisions. We propose a distracted-from-doing-good hypothesis: compared with distraction-free environments, distracting environments lead people to rely more on the default options, particularly self-serving ones. In a preregistered experiment, participants made repeated allocation decisions involving monetary trade-offs between personal gain and charity donations. We manipulated the default type (prosocial vs. self-serving), the presence (vs. absence) of distractions and measured individual differences in mind wandering and social value orientation. Results did not support the hypothesis but offered valuable insights: On average, participants were more likely than chance to accept prosocial defaults, and they accept more prosocial than self-serving defaults. We found evidence that some individuals use self-serving defaults to justify selfish decisions, particularly those with a prosocial orientation. Interestingly, the aggregate effects were driven by 60 percent of participants; the remaining 40 percent were uninfluenced by defaults, acting according to their social preferences. Individual differences in mind wandering—how easily one is distracted—further moderate the default effects. We discuss how the results inform our understanding of prosocial behaviors in combination with individual heterogeneity and how defaults are a good tool to promote overall prosociality.",

However, substantial barriers impede engagement in traditional forms of these interventions. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. This paper examines the potential of a particular mobile health innovation – Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) – as a strategy to enhance the accessibility, acceptability, and efficacy of MBIs. Methods: We discuss the historical context, conceptual foundations, motivation for adoption, and empirical evidence supporting the potential of EMIs. Additionally, we explore the conceptual intersections between EMIs and both traditional contemplative sources and contemporary secular MBIs. Furthermore, we describe empirical studies integrating EMIs into MBIs (i.e., meditation-based [MB]-EMIs). Results: Studies have demonstrated diverse approaches to integrating EMIs into MBIs. These studies exhibit variability in key dimensions, including the MBI with which the EMI is integrated and the characteristics of the EMI itself. MB-EMIs have therapeutic potential, but there are many important scientific questions about them that have not yet been answered. Discussion: Future studies should continue to examine the impact and safety of meditation-based EMIs, leverage innovations in passive data collection, explore user experiences, develop these interventions for and with marginalized populations, and emphasize informal meditation practice.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

However, international students tend to underutilize and benefit less from traditional mental health services compared to their domestic counterparts. The current paper proposes digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) as a promising approach to bridge mental health inequities faced by international students. Methods: We explore the definition, types, and efficacy of DMHIs. We outline the unique promise of these interventions in reducing barriers to health service access encountered by international students. To illustrate these points, we discuss example studies of DMHIs for international students. Results: Recent studies have supported the potential benefits of DMHIs for improving international students’ psychological distress, well-being, and help-seeking outcomes. However, many scientific questions remain unsolved. Discussion: To optimize the potential of these interventions for international students, researchers should conduct well-powered randomized controlled trials, examine correlates of intervention use, design single-session interventions, co-develop interventions with the international student community, integrate interventions within the larger system, incorporate ecological momentary assessment and digital phenotyping, and leverage immersive and interactive digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Filtering is a cognitive mechanism that regulates how information is encoded into working memory. It minimizes the retention of irrelevant information while facilitating the maintenance of task-relevant information. While prior studies have examined the filtering of task-irrelevant distractors, it remains unclear whether information that needs to be briefly processed—but not maintained—can be partially filtered out. To address this, we developed a novel complex-span task involving three conditions: a pre-cue condition, where stimuli are identified as memory items or distractors before they are processed thus allowing for filtering; a retro-cue condition, where this information is given only after processing, preventing filtering; and a control condition without distractors. Across three experiments, memory performance in the pre-cue condition was comparable to the retro-cue condition but worse than the control condition. Additionally, using the Memory Measurement Model (Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019), we estimated the memory strength of distractors and found the same strength of distractors retained in working memory in both pre- and retro-cue conditions. These findings suggest that information requiring processing cannot be selectively filtered out during encoding into working memory.",

          "abstract": "Moral norms regulate social life in ways that can promote prosocial behavior. Not only directly involved individuals, but also uninvolved third parties judge and punish norm violators. The principles underlying third-party judgments however remain unclear, particularly since moral decisions often involve the interplay of multiple psychological processes. Here, we investigate the combined effects of two key moral motivations: Inequality aversion (equal outcomes are seen as more moral than unequal ones) and the common-is-moral heuristic (frequent actions are seen as more moral than rare ones). Study 1 participants provided third-party judgments of other players’ behavior in two economic games designed to engage each motivation separately. Results reveal distinct contributions of both motivations to moral judgments. In Study 2, participants completed a combined game designed to reveal the interplay between inequality aversion and the commonness effect. By manipulating both factors independently, we find clear evidence for their joint contribution. However, their weak association highlights how a combination of separable cognitive processes shapes moral norms. Lastly, we used agent-based simulations to show how the joint effect of the common-is-moral heuristic and inequality aversion can lead to the emergence of prosocial behavior in social groups. Results demonstrate that inequality aversion helps social systems overcome a selfish status quo by spurring the formation of prosocial states; the common-is-moral heuristic instead reinforced the selfish default state. Together, these findings disentangle the roles of fairness preferences and the common-is-moral heuristic, informing the principles underlying third-party moral judgments and prosocial behavior in social groups.",

Yet, it is to date unclear how precisely relevant factors are shaping referential choice and which of these are most important during discourse production across languages. Using computational modeling on a naturalistic corpus of spoken narratives across 16 diverse languages, we systematically investigated the predictability of 16 functional factors on referential choice. We moreover used a novel technique from explainable artificial intelligence to get precise insights into the decision making processes of our models, in order to draw inferences on the precise relationship of the factors with referential choice. We show that 1) referential choice is multifactorial, 2) anaphoric distance, referent salience in local discourse, and syntactic function a referent is allocated to, are most predictive of referential form, 3) many other factors discussed prominently in the literature, like referent competition, topic persistence or the presence of agreement, have little to no predictive power, 4) and that these factors are generally shared across languages, with large differences across languages mostly pertaining to idiosyncratic properties of languages, such as word order or the expression of nominal number. Our study is the first large-scale study of referential choice across diverse languages using naturalistic corpus data.",

Prior to the task, participants were exposed to positive or negative group stereotypes that were moral or nonmoral in content. Although players from each group were, on average, equally likely to provide reward feedback, participants formed choice preferences for players from positively-stereotyped over negatively-stereotyped groups. Importantly, this effect was stronger and more resistant to change when stereotypes contained moral content. Computational modeling indicated that moral stereotypes induced more extreme initial reward expectancies and influenced how reward associations were updated over time. Additionally, moral stereotypes generalized more strongly to subsequent evaluations of novel group members, suggesting that the biasing effect of moral stereotypes on learning contributed to group-level prejudice.",

These data are customizable—researchers can compare search volume across most of the world or zoom into specific geographic regions; access hourly data within the last week or look at monthly data since 2004. However, they have important limitations. We provide a comprehensive overview and tutorial, covering (a) how Google Trends data are calculated, how reliable they are, and why some results yield low-quality data, (b) how to create custom datasets beyond what Google Trends provides by default (creating long trends of daily data, creating datasets with many cross-sectional comparisons, creating panel data), (c) a list of potential promises and pitfalls of Google Trends data, and (d) recommendations to ensure data quality and sound interpretation.",

          "abstract": "Moral norms regulate social life in ways that can promote prosocial behavior. Not only directly involved individuals, but also uninvolved third parties judge and punish norm violators. The principles underlying third-party judgments however remain unclear, particularly since moral decisions often involve the interplay of multiple psychological processes. Here, we investigate the combined effects of two key moral motivations: Inequality aversion (equal outcomes are seen as more moral than unequal ones) and the common-is-moral heuristic (frequent actions are seen as more moral than rare ones). Study 1 participants provided third-party judgments of other players’ behavior in two economic games designed to engage each motivation separately. Results reveal distinct contributions of both motivations to moral judgments. In Study 2, participants completed a combined game designed to reveal the interplay between inequality aversion and the commonness effect. By manipulating both factors independently, we find clear evidence for their joint contribution. However, their weak association highlights how a combination of separable cognitive processes shapes moral norms. Lastly, we used agent-based simulations to show how the joint effect of the common-is-moral heuristic and inequality aversion can lead to the emergence of prosocial behavior in social groups. Results demonstrate that inequality aversion helps social systems overcome a selfish status quo by spurring the formation of prosocial states; the common-is-moral heuristic instead reinforced the selfish default state. Together, these findings disentangle the roles of fairness preferences and the common-is-moral heuristic, informing the principles underlying third-party moral judgments and prosocial behavior in social groups.",

          "abstract": "We have recently found that during naturalistic encoding (freely viewing images without knowing a memory test will follow) bigger images are remembered 1.5 times better than smaller images. These results supported our hypothesis that larger images recruit more visual system processing resources from earliest processing stages, and this leads to higher quality signals transferred downstream to higher visual- and memory-related areas resulting in better memory. It is unclear, however, if these results represent naturalistic vision outside the lab. Here in a more naturalistic-like and less-controlled online experiment (n=132) we successfully replicated our lab-based findings and consistently found that larger images were remembered more than 1.7 times better than smaller images. Our replication (performed on desktops and laptops) provides stronger evidence that bigger images are better remembered in more naturalistic-like environments outside the lab. These results provide initial insights on how visual physical salience affects cognitive performance during everyday visual behavior. Given the enormous increase in usage of handheld devices for multiple everyday purposes as communications with practitioners and education it is valuable to investigate in future studies how visual physical salience transferred through such communication channels influences perception, comprehension, learning, and memory.",

          "abstract": "The capacity for voluntary action is a distinctive feature of human minds. However, experimental studies of volition struggled to capture defining features of human voluntariness. Here we developed a competitive game which incentivised participants to innovate their action choices to find the right time to avoid a collision with an opponent who predicted the timing of the participant’s action choice. One group of participants received explicit information about the competitor’s action-selection rules, while a second group had no information about the competitor. Both groups showed increased behavioural stochasticity when adapting to a competitor who punished participant’s choice biases. However, the group who had no explicit information generated their action choices in a way that avoided the action that the competitor was likely to take. In contrast, the group who explicitly knew the competitor’s action-selection rules avoided the same action they took in preceding trials so that the competitor could not easily exploit the participant’s behavioural patterns. These findings suggest that people can develop beliefs about other agents in the social environment within which they work, and can adapt voluntary action choices accordingly. However, explicit explanations about the other agent facilitate model-based planning in the voluntary generation of novel action patterns.",

This is a well-replicated effect, demonstrated across a wide variety of task factors and age groups. However, it is not clear if individuals with symptoms of ADHD are able to do this effectively, as there is some evidence this group struggle to allocate attention in working memory tasks. Two experiments were conducted online to investigate this. Participants were presented with series of four coloured shapes, and asked to report the colour of each shape in a counterbalanced order following a brief delay. In some trials (equal value condition), all shapes were equally valuable with the correct recall of each shape gaining the participant 2 points. In other trials (differential value condition), the first item presented during the encoding phase was more valuable than the rest (5 point for the first item vs 1 point for the other items). Trial-by-trial feedback was either provided (Experiment 1) or omitted (Experiment 2). Across both experiments, there was a clear prioritization effect at the first (targeted) serial position, with higher accuracy in the differential value condition relative to the equal value condition. There were also clear costs at some of the less valuable serial positions. These effects did not differ as a function of ADHD symptoms. There were also no significant correlations between scores on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener and the prioritization effects. Taken together, this demonstrates that the ability to prioritize particularly valuable information in working memory is not impaired in individuals with symptoms of ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Joint attention is a pivotal mechanism of human social cognition. Traditionally, joint attention has been experimentally investigated by means of the gaze cueing task in screen-based settings. Recently, the gaze cueing task has been implemented in more naturalistic and interactive settings with the embodied iCub robot, allowing for the investigation of concurrent factors influencing joint attention. Previous studies found that a communicative gaze before the gaze cue (i.e., mutual or avoiding gaze with the participants) influenced the subsequent joint attention by eliciting the gaze-cueing effect only in the mutual gaze condition. In the present work, we first manipulated the attribution of the intentional stance toward the robot by letting participants share a familiar context. Subsequent to this shared experience, we integrated the gaze-cueing paradigm with the iCub robot, such that the robot cued participants’ attention after establishing either mutual or avoiding gaze with them. In contrast to previous studies where the adoption of the intentional stance was not manipulated, our current results show that when the robot was perceived as an intentional agent, a gaze-cueing effect was present for both mutual and avoiding gaze, thereby suggesting that participants might have interpreted both gaze conditions as intentional (and, thus as communicative signals).",

Eye contact and repeated averted gaze shifts are key cues for gaze-based communication and joint attention, but it remains unclear how the temporal and perceptual dynamics of these gaze cues combine to signal an interlocutor's intention to communicate. This study examines three key perceptual properties of dynamic eye gaze displays, and the extent to which they influence the perception of communicative intent. Both autistic (n = 126) and non-autistic (n = 118) participants completed a semi-interactive task with an on-screen agent that displayed dynamic eye movements on each trial searching for a target among three objects. Participants had to decide whether the agent was privately inspecting the objects or requesting the participant to ‘give’ them one of the blocks (i.e., attempting to communicate). Across trials, we manipulated whether the agent displayed eye contact and made repeated averted gaze shifts at the same object and the duration of gaze displays. We measured the frequency of ‘give’ responses (indexing perceived communicative intent) and reaction times (indexing response certainty). Participants were most likely to perceive communicative intent when the agent displayed eye contact and repeated averted gaze shifts. Gaze duration was a less potent signal of communicative intent. However, longer gaze durations increased perceptions of communicative intent in the absence of eye contact and repeated averted gaze displays. Autistic and non-autistic participants exhibited similar overall patterns, challenging the traditional view of autism as a condition in which people have a reduced tendency to understand the social meaning of gaze cues.",

          "abstract": "Music training is widely claimed to enhance nonmusical abilities, yet causal evidence remains inconclusive. Moreover, research tends to focus on cognitive over socioemotional outcomes. In two studies, we investigated whether music training improves emotion recognition in voices and faces among school-aged children. We also examined music-training effects on musical abilities, motor skills (fine and gross), broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory memory (short-term and working memory). Study 1 (N = 110) was a 2-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school setting, comparing music training to basketball training (active control) and no training (passive control). Music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory memory relative to controls, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Both music and basketball training improved gross-motor skills. Study 2 (N = 192) compared children without music training to peers attending a music school. Although music training correlated with better emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), this association disappeared after controlling for socioeconomic status, musical abilities, or short-term memory. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with emotion recognition in both prosody and faces, independently of training or other confounding variables. These findings suggest that music training enhances fine-motor skills and auditory memory, but it does not causally improve emotion recognition, cognitive abilities, or socioemotional functioning. Observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities and other confounding factors such as socioeconomic status.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual content is integrated as it unfolds in real-time within temporal windows. Understanding the dynamics of temporal integration requires understanding influences by an ongoing temporal context. Towards this goal, we developed a novel paradigm of temporal integration where two halves of a Kanizsa square are integrated together (seen as a full square) or segregated (not seen as a full square) as a function of temporal gap between them. The two halves are embedded within a preceding and succeeding context of rotating Kanizsa discs leading up to and trailing away from them. We wanted to investigate whether integration is subject to frames of interest or whether the dynamics of the context influence form-part integration. Through three experiments, we manipulated the nature of the rotation: (1) the context being temporally correlated or random in Experiment 1, (2) variance of the temporally correlated context in Experiment 2, and (3) mean of the temporally correlated context in Experiment 3. Our results showed that the sensitivity of seeing an integrated square was better when the context aided anticipation of the target frames, the effect being selective at different ISIs depending on the properties of the context. We interpret these results in the light of a probabilistic view of temporal windows of integration. Our results provide evidence for an inherent adaptiveness in the extent or window of temporal integration. The results also reinforce the general account of extended temporal processing and iterative updating and inform rough timescales of context effects on this process.",

Although dozens of experimental studies have argued that synchronised rhythms can promote bonding, methodological issues including publication bias, sample bias, experimenter effects, and appropriateness of experimental controls make it unclear whether synchronous singing reliably and generally enhances bonding relative to speaking. Here, we propose a Registered Report to overcome these issues through a global experiment in diverse languages aiming to collect data from 1800 participants across 60 sites. The social bonding hypothesis predicts that bonding will increase more after synchronous singing than after spoken (sequential) conversation or (simultaneous) recitation, while alternative hypotheses predict that song will not increase bonding relative to speech.

          "abstract": "Background\nMuch of the research on autistic ageing is framed by what is known about the developmental trajectory of autism throughout childhood and into middle age. There is also the risk that common negative stereotypes about ageing distract from exploring the potential for developmental gains in later life such as those seen in the non-autistic population and some other conditions. The research presented here is part of a broader body of work aimed at addressing these gaps. To do this we explored older autistic adults’ experiences of social and emotional changes over the lifespan and their concerns for the future.\nMethods\nIn semi-structured one-on-one interviews we explored changes in social and emotional functioning over the lifespan and into later life and concerns for the future from the perspectives of six male and four female older autistic adults (Mage = 63.30 years; age range 53-74 years). Using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted an iterative process of analysis and interpretation to identify and organise patterns and connections in the data into representative themes. \nResults\nParticipant interviews revealed a bittersweet but nonetheless positive outlook on life. Sub-themes of independence and autonomy, awareness and acceptance, positive reframing, family focus and humour supported an overarching theme of poignancy and positivity.\nConclusions\nParticipants’ positive outlook on life suggests the potential for developmental gains in autistic later life that parallel similar patterns in the general population. In the context of evidence from gerontological studies of social and emotional ageing, this work challenges existing negative expectations and stereotypes about old age and suggests opportunities to reframe future autism research and clinical practice to promote successful and healthy autistic ageing.",

Despite this intriguing possibility, limited research has systematically examined these differences. This study aims to investigate how art and non-art students perceive and emotionally evaluate different colors.\nMethods: Using a questionnaire-based approach, participants rated the emotional valence of colors on a 7-point semantic differential scale, ranging from very negative to very positive. The colors were carefully selected from Munsell's color system, which enabled precise manipulation of hue, brightness, and saturation levels. The study included 36 art students and 36 non-art students, who evaluated colors under controlled experimental conditions.\nResults: The findings indicate that brightness and saturation significantly influence emotional responses to colors. Warmer colors, such as orange, elicited more positive emotional evaluations, whereas cooler colors, such as blue, received less positive ratings. Notably, art students differed from non-art students in their emotional responses, with the former group showing distinct sensitivity to variations in color dimensions.\nConclusion: This study highlights that art training shapes emotional color perception, as evidenced by the differing evaluations of art and non-art students. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how artistic training influences the emotional experience of color and underscore the role of education in enhancing perceptual and emotional sensitivity to visual stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary size, lexical diversity, word class distribution) before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total word count increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett's formal diagnosis. These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.",

However, the relationship between ambiguity resolution and conscious access remains unclear, partially due to a lack of quantifiable measures of ambiguity. Here, we designed novel stimuli with quantifiable semantic ambiguity levels and tested whether more ambiguous stimuli enjoy preferential access to awareness, as indexed by the time it takes them to break interocular suppression in the breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm. In a series of three experiments, we found that stimuli’s visual symmetry levels, rather than semantic ambiguity, facilitated their access to awareness. We therefore propose that symmetrical patterns enjoy preferential access to awareness, and we speculate that this effect might be implemented by a process of evidence accumulation across multiple symmetry axes in parallel.",

For example, even if one has never seen a rambutan, it is possible to learn that “rambutan” is a kind of fruit just from hearing “I like sweet, juicy rambutans”. What processes unfold in the moment upon encountering a new word in context that lead to successful word learning? We conducted three experiments to evaluate the role of working memory, which may be critical for linking a new word to the meaning implied by its surrounding language context. In each experiment, we assessed word learning from sentences in which new words occurred either before or after an informative context. In Experiment 1, we tracked gaze during reading to gain insight into the real-time processing of the surrounding language context and the new word. Results highlighted the importance of working memory resources for holding the language context in mind while processing the new word, regardless of which was encountered first. Experiment 2 replicated the importance of working memory resources for learning new words heard in fluent speech, and Experiment 3 replicated this finding while controlling for overall engagement measured from performance on an unrelated task. Together, these findings support the conclusion that successful word learning from context depends on maintaining the context in working memory while linking it to a new word.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the psychosocial and community risk factors associated with financial exploitation is essential in developing prevention strategies. Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion also moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade trust in news sources has fallen globally, reflecting increasing public concern about misinformation. Inoculation theory is a pre-emptive cognitive approach to fighting misinformation, which in recent years has been a foundational theory for several serious games. While many game-based interventions have been found to be efficacious, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms which make them work. This review critically engages with the current state of gamified interventions for misinformation, identifies gaps in game design and research, and investigates the relationship between inoculation theory and game design. We find that homogeneity in design has left some areas of game design underexplored, and discussion surrounding game design decisions – particularly the integration of inoculation theory components – is often superficial. We call for deeper exploration of game design and the integration of inoculation theory components, proposing a hypothetical model of inoculation theory in gamified contexts.",

          "authors": "Connor Spiech; Mario Gómez Martínez; Giorgio Lazzari; Virginia Penhune",
          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1) before and after non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and perceived groove. Following stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the left SMA may have disinhibited either the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions themselves. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA plays a critical role in embodied rhythm processing.",

Using multilevel response surface analysis and ecological momentary assessment, we investigated relations between congruence of perceived affect and self-reported empathy during social interactions in a large sample of adults (N=526; total interactions=21,521; median=38 interactions per person). Data were collected in spring 2023. We found that while self-reported empathy is generally higher when there is congruence of perceived affect, empathy is highest when there is congruence in high positive affect. Further, people are least empathetic when they feel emotionally worse than they perceive the other person is feeling. These findings provide novel insights into the empathic processes.",

          "authors": "Vladimir Chituc",
          "abstract": "A recent article by Zheng and Meister [Neuron, 113(2), 192–204. (2025)] reveals what seems to be a surprising constraint on the capacity for the human mind to process information: a limit of 10 bits/s. In this short response, I aim to reconcile the compelling evidence presented by Zheng and Meister, with the no-less compelling demands of common sense: how could our minds possibly be that slow? My answer is twofold. First, this regularity is only counterintuitive insofar as we understand this throughput (as quantified by Shannon’s entropy, a theoretical construct describing un- certainty reduction in terms of the minimum amount of information required to encode some message) in comparison to everyday data transmission (as quantified by the literal number of bits being sent over some information channel). This claim becomes immediately more plausible when explicitly framed in the context of information theory. Second, this regularity is in fact more general than Zheng and Meister contend, since I demonstrate qualitatively similar (if not identical) throughputs in even the most advanced AI models (which I calculated using the same procedure Zheng and Meister applied to the throughput of human behavior). Even more, I report a striking convergence: the performance of machine intelligence (either in terms of success in competitive games or benchmark performance in Large Language Models) reliably improves as it approaches 10 bits/s, whether that means speeding up or slowing down. Though speculative, I believe this unexpected convergence raises an exciting theoretical possibility: the apparent constraint of 10 bits/s is not as much a speed limit as it is a solution to an optimization problem, involving e.g. the inherent tension between seeking new information (exploring) and pursuing a known reward (exploiting). I finally contextualize this finding in relation to one of the most widely known (but least well-understood) papers in the history of psychological science.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis:\nLanguage impairments are core symptoms of both schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders and have been linked to deficits in predictive language processing. While altered use of semantic predictions have been reported in both disorders, little is known whether semantic predictions are stable over time. We therefore investigated the temporal stability of semantic predictions in individuals with schizotypal and autistic traits.\n\nStudy Design:\n115 participants, assessed for schizotypal and autistic traits, completed an auditory stability paradigm across two time points. In the first session, participants listened to 240 sentence beginnings varying in predictability (e.g., low: “The swimmer jumped into the…”; high: “The child hid the toy under the…”) and provided a prediction for each sentence final word. In the follow-up sessions, 240 new sentences were intermixed. In addition to final-word predictions, sentence and prediction recall were assessed to examine the influence of memory on prediction stability.\n\nStudy Results:\nGeneralized linear mixed models revealed that higher predictability led to greater temporal stability of semantic predictions. Importantly, increasing schizotypal and autistic traits were associated with reduced stability, particularly in highly predictable contexts where stable predictions typically facilitate efficient language processing. While poorer sentence recall was linked to greater instability, especially in medium- and low-predictability contexts, it did not account for the reduced stability observed in relation to schizotypal and autistic traits. \n\nConclusions:\nThese findings suggest that individuals with higher schizotypal and autistic traits struggle to form stable, lasting semantic predictions, which may contribute to difficulties in efficient language processing.\n\nKey words: Language Processing, Predictive Processing, SSD, ASD",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia is a lack or loss of pleasure in daily life and is common across many mental health conditions. This is the first systematic review to investigate the following research questions: 1) How is anhedonia conceptualized and explicitly measured using experience sampling methodology (ESM) in mental health research?; 2) What is the experience of anhedonia in daily life at the between-person level and at the within-person level?; and 3) What is the quality of reporting in ESM studies assessing anhedonia in daily life? We searched PsychARTICLES, MEDLINE, Psychology Databases, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Europe PMC (last search 6th January 2025). We identified 113 unique articles that satisfied inclusion criteria. Anhedonia was typically conceptualized in terms of diminished pleasure, enjoyment, or liking, with emphasis on consummatory rather than anticipatory experiences. Anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia were present in samples that experienced different mental health conditions or symptoms (between-person) and varied across different daily contexts and across time (within-person). Most studies explored anhedonia in depression or psychotic disorders, although measurement was heterogeneous, and approaches differed across mental health conditions. Compliance with a composite reporting quality assessment tool for ESM studies was generally low. Exploring anhedonia in daily life from a transdiagnostic perspective is a critical gap in the literature, which will help to identify whether different components of anhedonia relate to one another in a similar way across disorders. Future research would benefit from standardized and validated ESM items of anhedonia, exploration of moment-to-moment changes over shorter time-scales, and increased transparency in methodological reporting.",

Both Crisis and Action framing (and negative and positive emotions, respectively) motivated reading and sharing, relative to the unaltered headlines. Crucially, consistent with theoretical predictions, we identified a trade-off: Crisis framing had the strongest effects on immediate engagement (increasing sharing and charitable donations), but Action framing enhanced future memory for news content. In a third study, we computationally classified content in &gt;25,000 news articles on social media; Action and Crisis framing were both associated with increased engagement. Overall, we demonstrate that the affective framing of news modulates reading, sharing, donations, and memory in laboratory and real-world settings.",

This study underscores the effectiveness and cost efficiency of NLP and machine learning models in understanding the public’s perception of sensitive topics. The findings indicate that online public sentiment towards psychedelics may be growing in acceptance of their therapeutic potential. However, limitations include potential selection bias from the Reddit sample and challenges in accurately interpreting nuanced language using NLP.

What are the psycho-social implications of this? Do people value human contact, and do they value it more when perceived as scarce, effectively turning it into a luxury good? We tested these questions in four pre-registered online studies (N=3521), using hypothetical scenarios encompassing four different domains (education, finance, mental health, and fitness) and a willingness to pay task, where we asked participants how much they were willing to pay for a service, offered either with human contact (e.g., a financial advisor), or fully digital (e.g., an app for financial advice). We found that services offering human contact are valued more than their digital equivalent, and people on higher income are willing to pay more for them, but not for digital; crucially, nudging people to perceive human contact as scarce increased its value, in that people were willing to pay more for it and considered it more important in most of the domains. The results were replicated within a UK and Italian sample, and could not be explained by differences in digital skills and accessibility. These findings support our intuition that the move towards digitalisation could introduce a new form of inequality, that of access to human contact.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs are widely considered resistant to factual correction, yet recent research shows that relatively brief, personalized “debunking” dialogues with a generative AI model can substantially reduce such beliefs. To identify the mechanisms driving this effect, we conducted an experiment spanning eight treatment arms that varied key features of participants’ interactions with GPT-4 during such debunking dialogues (N = 1,297). The debunking effect proved robust across most manipulations—including whether participants were explicitly told the AI aimed to change their minds, were asked to debate the AI, or whether the AI offered them factual information without otherwise seeking to persuade or was concise in its exposition. The only condition that undermined the debunking effect was prompting the AI to persuade participants without presenting any counterevidence, which yielded a null effect. Furthermore, analyses of the AI’s persuasive strategies identified reasoning-based tactics as the sole significant mediator of belief change. Participants who reported feeling persuaded overwhelmingly cited the AI’s rational, evidence-focused approach. Finally, participants higher in actively open-minded thinking showed larger treatment effects. These findings suggest that AI-driven interventions reduce conspiracy beliefs principally by providing factual, targeted counterarguments that address the specific reasons people hold these beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Understanding meaningful interpersonal moments in therapy and daily life remains a challenge for neuroscience. Various overlapping concepts—such as moments of meeting, mutuality, social closeness, intersubjectivity, and social connectedness—seek to capture the unique experience of interpresence, a shared psychological here and now. While these concepts are well-recognized, they have been difficult to study scientifically. Recent methodological advancements, including the 4E/MoBI framework and the ConNECT approach, provide new avenues for empirical investigation. A key question is how therapeutically informed practices can be applied in cross-disciplinary studies to explore experientially enhanced relational processes. This study examines the feasibility of studying therapeutic interventions in a laboratory setting by investigating experiences in therapist-therapist dyads engaging in Moment-to-Moment Tracking, a method designed to foster psychological closeness. Thematic analysis of participant experiences revealed that authenticity was largely preserved despite laboratory constraints. While factors such as the presence of fNIRS equipment and observational pressures influenced engagement, participants reported experiencing genuine moments of connection. These findings suggest that therapeutic interventions can be effectively studied in laboratory environments, opening new possibilities for neuroscientific research on interpersonal processes.",

The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the most widely used tool for measuring implicit bias, assessing response time in sorting stimuli into labeled categories. Most interpretations assume that IAT performance (D-scores) reflects conflicting associative memories or decision ease. We challenged this assumption by decomposing D-scores into additional cognitive processes that may influence results, particularly response caution—the tendency to trade speed for accuracy. Using Racing Diffusion Models across 39 topics (N = 115,601), we found that response caution explained significantly more variance in D-scores beyond decision ease. Response caution also best predicted explicitly reported biases. These findings challenge the traditional interpretation of D-scores as primarily reflecting associative memory activation and highlight the need to consider multiple cognitive processes when assessing implicit biases.",

Future research should explore the long-term reliability of VR-based assessments.",

          "abstract": "Developmental research often involves comparing cross-sectional or repeatedly measured means in small samples (e.g., N &lt; 100), commonly using ANOVA. Generalized estimating equations (GEE), multilevel modeling (MLM), and structural equation modeling (SEM) are advantageous alternatives, which we didactically explain and demonstrate on N = 42 adolescent boys’ (14–16) alcohol-use data using SPSS and R. To compare their robustness in practice, mixed-design data are simulated under conditions commonly reported in the journal Child Development. Researchers using ANOVA should prefer heteroskedasticity-robust t statistics or CIs to test individual contrasts, whereas MLM and SEM can provide safer omnibus tests, assuming small-sample adjustments are applied to maintain nominal Type I error rates. GEE should be avoided with small samples.",

          "authors": "Angelia Caparco; Genaro Lopez-Martin; Alejandro Galvez-Pol",
          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, particularly in how stimulus processing is influenced by concurrent cardiac phases (systole and diastole). However, definitions of these phases vary widely. Some studies follow biomedical conventions, defining systole as the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG), with diastole encompassing the remainder of the cycle. Others adopt a time-based heuristic approach, defining systole based on the estimated arrival of afferent cardiac signals in the brain. This approach assumes that baroreceptor activity plays a key role in cognition, though conclusive evidence for this is lacking. This variability leads to inconsistencies, where systole in one study may correspond partly or entirely to diastole in another. To address this, we first review studies examining how cardiac phases modulate stimulus perception. Second, we highlight methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases, particularly in time-based heuristic approaches. Third, we discuss additional sources of variability, such as differences in recording equipment and measures of interoceptive ability. Rather than focusing on specific findings, we highlight broader challenges in replicability and interpretation. Additionally, we introduce the HEARTS framework, a set of guidelines for standardising methodologies in interoception research. This consists of six recommendations: Harmonizing physiological terms across fields, Establishing clear nomenclature, Avoiding selective reporting, Refining mechanistic understanding, Tailoring methods for precision, and Standardizing study comparability. Implementing these recommendations can improve methodological consistency, cross-study reliability, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring a more accurate understanding of how interoceptive signals shape perception and cognition.",

          "abstract": "The ability to gauge the average of a number stream is a fundamental aspect of numeric cognition, information processing, and value-based decisions. Research on this ability has primarily focused on the integration of numerical information from a single source. Here, we examined the estimation of averages when competing sources of information are presented. We tested two theories of numeric value integration: the Compressed Mental Number Line (CMNL) predicts underestimation of averages independent of competing information; Selective Integration (SI) predicts that competing information interferes with the target information. Across three experiments, we found a significant underestimation of the averages, and a limited impact of competing information on estimation. Computational modeling shows that the CMNL (together with an explicit noise theory) provides the overall better account than SI to describe estimation behavior in our data. However, about one third of our participants were best described by SI. Among these participants, the computational mechanism of SI consisted of an underweighting of lower numbers in local sample comparisons. Overall, our findings clarify the role of competing information in average estimations, and shed light on the exact cognitive process and limitations of SI as a general theory of sequential information integration.",

This review discusses how punishment-oriented prison policies and rhetoric create a dehumanizing environment and contribute to patterns of correctional officer abuse. Using Bandura’s moral disengagement theory, we analyze how media representations normalize systemic prison abuses and shape public perception. Our findings indicate that attitudes in favor of a punitive prison system are a significant obstacle to passing public policies aimed at making prisons more rehabilitative, stressing the importance of new solutions to reduce moral disengagement and its harmful effects in media reporting for safer prisons.",

We then identify previously unreported examples of lexical elaboration, and analyze how lexical elaboration is influenced by ecological and cultural variables.

          "abstract": "The lexemes ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’ are known as the origins of the numeral classifiers for small round objects in many Tibeto-Burman languages. This paper employs a correlation-based network construction method to investigate the colexification networks of the two concepts in 58 + 68 Tibeto-Burman languages. A total of 104 concepts colexified with ‘fruit’ and 99 concepts colexified with ‘stone’ are organized into macro semantic classes. Semantic networks on the basis of the similarities in colexification patterns of concepts, as well as languages networks on the basis of the similarities in colexification patterns of languages, are constructed for ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’, respectively. The results indicate that classifiers for small round objects evolved from either ‘fruit’ or ‘stone’ are directly colexified with class terms in compound nouns denoting varieties of fruits/stones and the shape class of small round objects, indicating that they are diachronically related. However, ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’ differ significantly in their modes of deriving a classifier. Moreover, languages that have developed classifiers from ‘fruit’ are mostly from the Ngwi subgroup, whereas languages whose classifiers are colexified with ‘stone’ evolved independently.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research has traditionally relied on linear models to test scientific\nhypotheses. However, the emergence of machine learning (ML) algorithms has opened new opportunities for exploring variable relationships beyond linear constraints. To interpret the outcomes of these \"black-box\" algorithms, various tools for assessing feature importance have been developed. However, most of these tools are descriptive and do not facilitate statistical inference. To address this gap, our study introduces two versions of residual permutation tests (RPTs), designed to assess the significance of a target feature in predicting the label. The first variant, RPT on Y (RPT-Y ), permutes\nthe residuals of the label conditioned on features other than the target. The second variant, RPT on X (RPT-X), permutes the residuals of the target feature conditioned on the other features. Our simulation study demonstrates that RPT-X eﬀectively maintains empirical Type I error rates within acceptable bounds and exhibits appreciable power in both regression and classification tasks. These findings suggest the utility of RPT-X for hypothesis testing in ML applications.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study explores individual experiences during Floatation-REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Technique), focusing on the perception of silence, darkness, and gravity. In Floatation-REST, an individual lies on the surface of highly saline water in a dark and silent environment, which typically leads to profound physical and mental relaxation. Prior research on Floatation-REST highlighted its benefits for both physical and mental health in otherwise healthy individuals as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in people with a spectrum of anxiety and stress-related disorders.\nMethods: To delineate the float experience, a qualitative-empirical approach was employed engaging ten healthy participants, each of whom completed a 60-minute float session followed by a focused interview on the perception of silence, darkness, and gravity. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and MAXQDA software.\nResults: Silence was largely perceived as pleasant, evoking feelings of security, relaxation, and trust. Silence heightened sensitivity to auditory stimuli and deepened awareness of thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. Darkness, although generally experienced as less pleasant than silence, similarly facilitated enhanced introspection and mental-process awareness. Regarding gravity, sensations of weightlessness and the dissolution of body boundaries were associated with mental relaxation, security, and a feeling of lightness. \nConclusions: Floatation-REST is being employed in studies to induce altered states of consciousness (ASC), as well as in therapeutic contexts to treat mental disorders. Similar to our study, future work could selectively focus on exploring the impact of the three major aspects of the floatation experience we assessed on ASC and therapeutic success.",

We conducted a conjoint experiment (N = 1,500) to test Indians’ support for the 2070 goal depending on differences among possible policy features including economic programs, allocation of funds collected via coal taxes, policies to mitigate pollution, who participates in the policy-making process, and adaptation policy. We find that Indians express stronger support for the 2070 goal when it includes jobs programs for Indians who lose their job in a coal-fired power plant, policies to mitigate pollution, investment or redistribution of funds collected via coal taxes, and adaptation policies to protect the most vulnerable Indians and critical infrastructure. Support for certain policy features varies depending on income, education, and caste.",

          "authors": "Sara Molinero; Pablo Martínez-López; Joaquín Morís; María José Quintero; Pedro L. Cobos; Francisco J. López; David Luque",
          "abstract": "In experimental psychology and behavioral neuroscience, habits are considered stimulus-response (S-R) associations formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, habits are assessed using one of two tests: 1) Outcome devaluation, in which the value of the outcome (reward) is reduced, making it less desirable, and 2) Contingency degradation, in which the response-outcome association is reversed so that responding prevents the delivery of a reward. If a behavior is controlled by S-R links, then it should remain unaffected by these two manipulations. Animal research using the outcome devaluation test has shown that initially goal-directed actions can become habitual after extended operant training. However, replicating this transition in human research has proven challenging, representing a significant problem for translational research. Notably, the contingency degradation test has rarely been used in human research. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a shift from goal-directed to habitual control through three pre-registered experiments. Participants were trained in two S-R-O (stimulus-response-outcome) mappings for three days, with one condition (the ‘overtrained’) occurring four times more frequently than the other ('standard’). Importantly, we assessed the habitualization of both responses by using a degraded contingency test. Overall, we found no evidence of an overtraining effect — that is, the ‘overtrained’ condition did not lead to increased habitual responding. We discuss the theoretical and applied implications of these findings and explore further directions for studying habitual behavior.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of eight executive function (EF) tasks designed for use in infancy and early childhood. Modern measurement theory and item response theory (IRT) frameworks were applied to examine the underlying latent ability influencing children’s performance on EF tasks. Longitudinal assessments at 8 months, 2.5 years, and 5 years were conducted as part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, and 830 participants from the larger cohort were included in the present study. The results indicated that the tasks included in the study were effective in measuring children’s EF abilities with a certain level of discrimination power. The difficulty level of each task varied across time points. In 8-month-old children, the A-not-B task scores were the most informative for assessing above-average levels of EF ability. At 2.5 years of age, the two EF tasks (Spin the Pots and Snack Delay) provided the most informative assessments for children with low to moderate levels of EF ability. Among 5-year-old children, three EF tasks measured ability levels only below the sample mean, whereas two additional tasks captured a broader range of EF abilities. The discussion highlights the benefits of applying IRT analysis to EF measurements and emphasises the need for reliable and scalable tools to assess how executive function changes among individuals during early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Empathy allows us to infer the affective state of another individual and resonate with it. Accumulating evidence suggests that on a neural level, empathizing relies on ‘shared neural representations’, i.e., patterns of neural activation recruited both during the first-hand and the empathic experience of a specific affective state. Studies employing placebo analgesia have shown consistent reductions in behavioral ratings and neural activity for both first-hand and empathic pain. The mechanistic interpretation of such effects, however, remains elusive, as placebo analgesia could exert its effects on empathy either via pharmacological actions or via top-down cognitive processes on pain and empathy beliefs. To address this limitation, we conducted a double-blind, within-subjects study administering either an opioid antagonist (naltrexone) or an inactive placebo in two separate testing sessions (N=35 healthy, neurotypical individuals, 21 female), and participants experienced both pain first-hand and pain empathy. We predicted that naltrexone would similarly increase first-hand pain and empathy for pain. The results, however, show reduced ratings of first-hand pain and empathy for pain, and thus, unexpectedly, hypo- rather than hyperalgesic effects. However, the coherence in their directionality confirms the hypothesis of shared opioidergic mechanisms being involved in the first-hand experience of pain and empathy for pain.",

          "abstract": "Animal research has shown that repeatedly performing a rewarded action leads to its transition into a habit—an inflexible response controlled by stimulus-response associations. Efforts to reproduce this principle in human populations have yielded mixed results.  Only two laboratory paradigms have successfully demonstrated behavior habitualization following extensive instrumental training compared to minimal training conditions: the forced-response task and the ‘aliens’ outcome-devaluation task. Notably, these paradigms measure behavior habitualization through distinct measures. The forced-response task focuses on the persistence of a trained response when a reversal is required, whereas the outcome-devaluation task measures reaction time switch costs—slowdowns in goal-directed responses that conflict with the trained habit. Although both measures have produced results consistent with those expected from learning theory—showing stronger evidence of habits in overtrained conditions—their construct validity remains insufficiently established. In this study, participants completed four days of training in each paradigm. We then examined the reliability of each measure and evaluated their convergent validity. Habitual responses in the forced-response task and reaction time switch costs in the outcome-devaluation task demonstrated good reliability, allowing us to assess whether individual differences remained stable across measures.  However, the two measures were not associated, providing no evidence of convergent validity. This finding suggests that these measures capture distinct aspects of the balance between habitual and goal-directed control. Our results highlight the need for further evaluation of the validity and reliability of current measures used to investigate habit control in humans.",

          "abstract": "Habitual behaviour is commonly assumed to operate outside of conscious awareness, driven by stimulus-response (S-R) associations rather than goal-directed evaluation. However, whether habitual instrumental behaviours can be triggered by stimuli that are not consciously perceived remains an understudied question. In a preregistered within-subjects study (N after exclusions = 75), we examined this question by employing a symmetrical outcome revaluation task. Participants underwent extensive instrumental training, forming strong S-R associations, before completing two testing stages: a conscious stage with fully visible stimuli and an unconscious stage where stimuli were rendered subliminal via visual masking. In the conscious condition, participants exhibited habitual control, responding more accurately to habit-congruent (still-valuable, still-non-valuable) stimuli than to habit-incongruent (upvalued, devalued) stimuli, replicating prior findings. However, in the unconscious condition participants did not exhibit above-chance accuracy, and responses were not biased toward habitual actions, suggesting that subliminal stimuli were unable to elicit either habitual or goal-directed responses. These findings challenge the notion that habitual control of instrumental behaviour can function independently of stimulus awareness and suggest that conscious access to action-relevant cues may be necessary even for well-established S-R associations to guide behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition involving widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Evidence-based interventions for fibromyalgia, such as education and exercise, often require prolonged, cognitive and/or physical effort, involving immediate costs (effort) for delayed benefits (improved pain/function). Initiation of, and adherence to, these interventions is often difficult. While assumed to reflect low motivation, these difficulties may reflect pain-related alterations in an individual’s attitudes towards effortful and delayed rewards. Here we explored whether individuals with fibromyalgia differed from age- and sex-matched pain-free controls in such attitudes. In Study 1, individuals with fibromyalgia (N=19) and controls (N=19) completed tasks offering real rewards (raffle tickets) for performing actual physical or cognitive effort or enduring real delays. Despite individualising task difficulty to each participant’s unique capacity, those with fibromyalgia required higher incentives to engage in the physical effort task (treadmill walking), especially at higher effort intensities, but showed no differences in the cognitive effort task, indicating no general motivation deficit but rather a shift in attitudes toward physical exertion. Additionally, participants with fibromyalgia showed a greater willingness to wait for rewards, particularly at lower reward levels, suggesting an increased motivation driven by rewards. Study 2, conducted online (N=43 fibromyalgia, N=139 controls), replicated these findings, reinforcing that fibromyalgia does not involve a broad motivational deficit based on reward magnitude. Instead, we found specific changes in physical effort discounting and indications of heightened sensitivity to rewards in delay discounting. These insights may help inform tailored intervention strategies for individuals with fibromyalgia.",

In the latter disorders,\ndissociative symptoms like depersonalization, derealization, or gaps in awareness significantly\nburden patients’ wellbeing and functioning. Many efforts have been undertaken to better\nunderstand these debilitating symptoms. However, empirical findings have not yet converged\nin many areas (e.g., considering neurobiological correlates or effects of dissociative\npsychopathology on treatment outcome), which might partially be due to the heterogeneity and\nlimitations of employed methodology. Here, we critically review the current state-of-the-art\nmethodology in dissociation research, comparing methods to assess dissociative symptoms,\nprovoke dissociative symptoms in the laboratory, select the participant sample, and consider\ncritical sample characteristics. Discussing the informative value and limits of various standard\nand novel methodological approaches, we aim to provide information and nuanced guidance\nfor future research. By these means we aim to raise and harmonize standards in dissociation\nresearch and enable researchers of all career stages to enter, navigate, and make a significant\nand lasting contribution to research on dissociative symptoms in a broad range of mental\ndisorders, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of dissociative psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Engraved ochres and ostrich eggshells from the South African Blombos Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter are among the earliest expressions of human symbolic behaviour. They appear to document a continuous practice of non-figurative mark-making across ~40.000 years. During this time, the engraved markings change from simpler unstructured patterns to more complex, ordered and symmetric markings such as cross-hatchings. To inform discussions of the possible function of the engravings, we conducted a two-part experimental study. Based on the assumption that artifact use will motivate incremental adaptive refinements, we used a transmission chain experiment to reconstruct the cultural evolutionary trajectory of the engraved marking. Each transmission chain was seeded with drawings derived from the early Blombos and Diepkloof engravings. We then conducted five experiments to assess the cognitive implications of the changes to the drawings and compared these results to a similar analysis of the original engravings. The drawings became increasingly easier to discriminate and increased in their perceived intentionality over the experimental generations. There was no evidence of a systematic change in drawing saliency or memorability, and the drawings did not acquire stylistic properties over the experimental generations. Although we observe interesting qualitative similarities between the original engravings and the transmission chain drawings, our findings suggest that cognitive biases and working memory constraints are not sufficient to generate the patterns observed in the archaeological record, highlight the significance of social and functional contexts in shaping early symbolic artifacts. By integrating archaeological and experimental research we can better inform inferences on sparse records of early symbolic behaviour. Our study thus leads to a broader consideration of the role, strengths and potential limitations of the transmission chain approach in analysing trajectories of early symbolic behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Meta-regression is an essential meta-analytic tool for investigating sources of heterogeneity and assessing the impact of moderators. However, existing methods for meta-regression have limitations, such as inadequate consideration of model uncertainty and poor performance under publication bias. To overcome these limitations, we extend robust\nBayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA) to meta-regression (RoBMA-regression). RoBMA-regression allows for moderator analyses while simultaneously taking into account the uncertainty about the presence and impact of other factors (i.e., the main effect, heterogeneity, publication bias, and other potential moderators). The methodology presents a coherent way of assessing the evidence for and against the presence of both continuous and categorical moderators. We further employ a Savage-Dickey density ratio test to quantify the evidence for and against the presence of the effect at different levels of categorical moderators. We illustrate RoBMA-regression in an empirical example and demonstrate its performance in a simulation study. We implemented the methodology in the RoBMA R package. Overall, RoBMA-regression presents researchers with a powerful and flexible tool for conducting robust and informative meta-regression analyses.",

          "abstract": "Background. The experience sampling method (ESM), also known as ecological momentary assessment, is gaining popularity in physical activity research. This method involves assessing participants’ behaviors and experiences repeatedly over time. One key advantage of ESM is its ability to temporally separate the dependent and independent variable of interest, reducing the risk of reverse causality. However, temporal separation alone is insufficient for establishing causality. This methodology paper illustrates the importance of the identification phase in drawing causal conclusions from ESM data. In the identification phase the causal effect of interest (or estimand) is specified and the assumptions under which a statistical association can be considered as causal are visualized using causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Methods. We demonstrate how to define a causal estimand and construct a DAG for a specific ESM research question. The example focuses on the causal effect of physical activity performed in real-life on subsequent executive functioning among older adults. The DAG development process combines literature review and expert consultations to identify time-varying and time-invariant confounders. Results. The developed DAG shows multiple backdoor paths creating confounding bias, even with temporal separation of the exposure (physical activity) and outcome (executive functioning). Two approaches to address this confounding bias are illustrated: (1) physical control using the within-person encouragement design, where participants receive randomized prompts to perform physical activity in their natural environment, and (2) analytic control, involving assessing all confounding variables and adjusting for these variables in the analysis phase. Conclusions. Implementing the identification phase enables ESM researchers to make more informed decisions, thereby enhancing the validity of causal inferences in studies aimed at answering causal questions.",

          "authors": "Sara Molinero; Pablo Martínez-López; Joaquín Morís; María José Quintero; Pedro L. Cobos; Francisco J. López; David Luque",
          "abstract": "In experimental psychology and behavioral neuroscience, habits are considered stimulus-response (S-R) associations formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, habits are assessed using one of two tests: 1) Outcome devaluation, in which the value of the outcome (reward) is reduced, making it less desirable, and 2) Contingency degradation, in which the response-outcome association is reversed so that responding prevents the delivery of a reward. If a behavior is controlled by S-R links, then it should remain unaffected by these two manipulations. Animal research using the outcome devaluation test has shown that initially goal-directed actions can become habitual after extended operant training. However, replicating this transition in human research has proven challenging, representing a significant problem for translational research. Notably, the contingency degradation test has rarely been used in human research. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a shift from goal-directed to habitual control through three pre-registered experiments. Participants were trained in two S-R-O (stimulus-response-outcome) mappings for three days, with one condition (the ‘overtrained’) occurring four times more frequently than the other ('standard’). Importantly, we assessed the habitualization of both responses by using a degraded contingency test. Overall, we found no evidence of an overtraining effect — that is, the ‘overtrained’ condition did not lead to increased habitual responding. We discuss the theoretical and applied implications of these findings and explore further directions for studying habitual behavior.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway and perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

Contrary to our third hypothesis, we found no evidence that completing the CRT before eliciting BiG influenced BiG scores by priming reflective thinking.

          "abstract": "Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is a newly recognized diagnosis that is distinguished from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through additional symptom clusters beyond re-experiencing, avoidance, and a persistent sense of threat. In addition to these core PTSD symptoms, C-PTSD is characterized by disturbances in self-organization, including affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal difficulties. These disruptions often result in persistent emotional instability, deep-seated feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and challenges in forming and maintaining relationships. While PTSD often arises from discrete traumatic events, C-PTSD is more commonly associated with prolonged or repeated interpersonal trauma, such as childhood maltreatment, domestic violence, or prolonged captivity. Here, we propose a novel model that explains these differences, identifies their neural substrates, and outlines the potential role of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in C-PTSD treatment. Drawing on active inference theories of cognition, we apply the concept of self-modelling to elucidate the insula’s role in affective regulation and adaptation to adversity. This framework clarifies the insula’s involvement not only in C-PTSD but also in other conditions affecting self-awareness and emotional processing. By integrating insights from neuroscience and psychopharmacology, we discuss how MDMA-assisted therapy may recalibrate affective regulation and reinforce a more stable self-model, offering a promising avenue for treatment. Theoretical and clinical implications are explored, emphasizing the need for further empirical research into MDMA’s therapeutic potential for C-PTSD.",

Accordingly, we aimed to study its salutary and adverse effects on mental health. We conducted a preregistered prospective intervention study among 89 adults who registered for 6-day insight mindfulness meditation retreats and 46 matched controls (Mage(SDage) = 33.75(9.50), 56.3% female). Controls were selected from a pool of 543 people recruited from the same community of meditators as retreat participants and matched to retreat participants on age and lifetime meditation experience. Retreat participants demonstrated significant improvements in well-being, negative affect, perseverative thinking, brooding rumination, and depression symptoms at 2-week follow-up compared to matched controls (η² range = .04–.08, ps &lt; .05). Importantly, the % of participants exhibiting statistically reliable deterioration in mental health outcomes at 2-week follow-up were equal or lower among retreat participants than among matched controls in the entire sample, as well as in a sub-sample with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety (ORs &lt; 1). These findings suggest that a 6-day mindfulness meditation retreat can produce rapid improvements in mental health, comparable to effect sizes of much longer 8-week mindfulness-based programs. These findings also challenge concerns about adverse effects of intensive high-dose meditation training and suggest that it may be a safe and effective intervention modality, even for clinically vulnerable adults struggling with depression or anxiety.",

We compared addition and multiplication of Chinese-educated students to address this question. Chinese-educated students learn to memorize multiplication problems in the min  max order (e.g., 6  8, referred to as min-first). In contrast, for addition they are taught to decompose the smaller digit to make 10 (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4). We hypothesized that these learning experiences would be reflected in the preferred order of operands, that is, min-first for multiplication and max-first for addition. Forty-three Chinese-educated participants solved single-digit multiplication and addition problems. As anticipated, participants responded faster when addition and multiplication were presented in their preferred orders.

Previous research indicates that participants often base JOLs on perceptual fluency of the learning materials.

To address this issue, we developed a novel experimental paradigm that distorts participants' prior beliefs about memory tasks. This approach allows for manipulating JOLs without affecting the materials' perceptual fluency or lower-level properties. Our validation of this paradigm demonstrates that it effectively influences how participants allocate their study time across different conditions, reflecting varying levels of trial-by-trial JOLs.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the clinical utility of rhythmic digital markers (RDMs) in schizophrenia. RDMs are digital markers capturing behavioral rhythms over different timescales - within 24 hours span (ultradian), at a span of 24 hours (circadian), or over cycles of more than 24 hours (infradian). While previous research has explored digital markers for schizophrenia, the focus has primarily been on sensor data variability rather than rhythmic patterns. This study introduces two RDMs: an entropy RDM, which quantifies uncertainty in activity distribution over the infradian cycles, and a dynamic RDM, which is derived from models of transitions in entropy and psychotic symptom intensity using Markov chain analysis. Data were ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of 39 activities collected from 390 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and controls. We assessed associations between RDMs and symptom severity and whether participants could be differentiated based on these RDMs. We found that participants with schizophrenia significantly differed on dynamic RDMs, suggesting a potential diagnostic utility. However, dynamic RDMs were not associated with symptom severity, and entropy RDM had no significant clinical correlate. Our findings contribute to the growing evidence on digital markers in psychiatry and highlight the potential of rhythmic digital markers (RDMs) in characterizing digital phenotypes for schizophrenia.",

However, it is not straightforward how to set up a system to match the characteristics of the learning context and provide optimal tracking and parameter estimation. \nFirst, we studied the convergence properties of Urnings when the ability of the students is constant. Second, we tested how well the algorithm can track different types and amounts of change in the ability. \nUrnings algorithm proved to be successful at adapting to the various simulated learning contexts and capabilities to track changing abilities.

          "authors": "Amir Jahanian Najafabadi; Kayser Christoph",
          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that our perception of time is tied to the embodiment of space. In particular, they suggest that time intervals are perceived or reproduced differently for stimuli at different distances from our body, and that this interaction of space and time is altered when we interact with spatial distances using tools. To corroborate these findings, we performed a series of experiments in physical and virtual setups, testing 218 participants on a time reproduction task for stimuli presented at three distances from the body (60, 120 &amp; 240 cm). In between testing sessions participants performed tool-use training, whereby they either used physical or virtual tools to manipulate objects at distances between 120 and 200 cm from their body. Prior to training, the reproduced intervals were overall longer for stimuli at an intermediate distance (120cm) compared to near the body (60cm). Tool-use training significantly shortened the reproduced intervals for stimuli at 120 cm, hence the distance at which tool-use training was operated. Participants' sensitivity to the presented intervals did not differ between distances prior to training, but was significantly reduced by tool-use training systematically at all distances. We observed qualitatively similar results for experiments in physical and virtual setups. Yet, the effect sizes for individual experiments were small, pointing to systematic but weak effects. Overall, this supports previous claims that time perception is tied to space and our interaction with this, though further work is required to understand the robustness and specificity of these effects.  \n\nKeywords: Time perception, Peripersonal Space, Space Representation, Active Tool-use",

          "abstract": "Petitionary prayers—requests made to a deity for specific outcomes—are widely practiced across religious traditions. While their efficacy remains a subject of theological debate, they exhibit remarkable resilience to disconfirmation. In three pre-registered studies—a field study in China and two global surveys via Prolific (total n=1800)—we examined how religious believers (Christians, Muslims, local deity worshippers, and Hindus) update beliefs and behaviors in response to prayer successes or failures for both hypothetical co-religionists and themselves. Results indicate that belief updates generally follow a Bayesian pattern, with increases after prayer successes and decreases after failures, though with an asymmetry favoring belief reinforcement. Notably, participants from the Prolific sample exhibit sensitivity to the prior probability of prayed-for events, attributing greater belief increases to improbable outcomes. Muslims predict belief increases even after failed prayers, consistent with doctrines framing hardships as divine tests. Across traditions, believers estimate continued prayer regardless of past outcomes, with monotheists displaying stronger resilience. These findings illuminate the cognitive and cultural mechanisms that buffer religious beliefs against counter-evidence, contributing to debates on the evidential vulnerability of religious credence and its parallels with epistemically self-sealing belief systems.",

          "abstract": "Successful personalized treatment requires a thorough understanding of the complex dynamic processes underlying disorders. Intensive longitudinal methods (e.g., experience sampling) that ask patients to complete multiple-item questionnaires several times a day are ideally suited for this. However, collecting such data entails severe patient burden, especially for those with low energy and little concentration (e.g., patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue and/or psychological disorders such as Somatic Symptom Disorder). This burden is currently predominantly lightened with single-item measures, but these cannot validly capture complex conditions, leading to a catch-22 situation: Capturing complex dynamic processes and effective personalized treatment require intensive longitudinal patient data on multiple-item questionnaires, but patients cannot provide this type of data because it is too taxing. To solve this problem, we developed a personalized missingness design that presents an individualized and time-varying minimal subset of items on each occasion, thereby striking an optimal balance between thoroughly mapping patients’ symptoms and keeping the number of items a person needs to answer to a minimum. The design builds on multilevel factor analyses to determine which sets of items are most informative, which can change over time. Expert-informed simulations validated our new design. While the design can be universally applied to any measurement of (psychological) symptoms (e.g., to inform cognitive behavioral therapy), we tailored our simulations to patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue in collaboration with experts in Psycho-Oncology. In the near future, the design will be implemented in the widely used experience sampling app m-Path in collaboration with the developers.",

However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory. This model is the foundation of brain-inspired AI.",

          "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop — in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) — the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI. Here we present Focus on Visual Features (FoVF), a cognitive mode that demonstrates both activation and deactivation depending on the task context. The BOLD signal configurations associated with FoVF are modulated by a range of tasks, and here, we present six. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing FoVF from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with FoVF over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we playfully nicknamed the anatomical patterns specific to the FoVF cognitive mode as follows: (1) Stay Puff and (2) Old Blue Eyes. Evidence for the FoVF cognitive mode was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes elicited by the following types of tasks: working memory (verbal and spatial), thought generation, evidence integration, task switching, and handedness. This evidence consistently supported the FoVF cognitive mode as involving activation when there is focus on the features of the visual display to enhance task performance, and deactivation when features of the visual display are irrelevant to the task, or when attending to the features may detract from task performance.",

          "authors": "James B. Wyngaarden; Tania Giovannetti; Bart Krekelberg; David Victor Smith",
          "abstract": "Financial exploitation of older adults has become an increasingly urgent public health issue, with annual losses exceeding $10 billion in the US annually. This exploitation often stems from age-related cognitive deficits, such as impairments in working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are linked to deterioration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A critical yet understudied component of age-related cognitive decline is confirmation bias—the tendency to interpret new information in a way that conforms to one’s pre-existing beliefs. As older adults focus more on present-oriented goals related to social and emotional satisfaction, their ability to recognize and respond to exploitative situations may decrease. This problem worsens with the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, increasing vulnerability to fraud. Despite these links, little is known about how confirmation bias is associated with future cognitive decline and risk for fraud. Two main challenges impede progress: the lack of knowledge about the latent processes that shape confirmation bias in this population, and the reliance on correlations between brain responses and behavior that do not clarify causal mechanisms. To address these issues, this chapter provides an overview of confirmation bias and its connection to aging. It then addresses adverse effects of confirmation bias before highlighting strengths of noninvasive brain stimulation as a method of investigating these relationships further.",

          "abstract": "Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been shown to reduce self-injurious behavior and other maladaptive behaviors in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Much attention has been paid to changes in negative affect and behaviors. However, few studies have examined the impact of DBT on positive affect (PA). The current study investigates the temporal course of joy, as reported on daily diary cards, in adults with BPD receiving a 6-month course of comprehensive DBT (N=95). BPD severity was measured every four weeks. Results showed that joy increased significantly during treatment, whereas negative affect decreased. Semi-parametric time-varying effect models showed that increases in joy were steeper earlier in treatment and plateaued around month four of treatment. Additionally, within-person increases in joy during a given month predicted decreases in BPD severity at the end of that month. Our results suggest that PA may be an important treatment target deserving of further clinical attention in in DBT, given that it prospectively predicts reductions in BPD symptom severity. Our finding that joy increases during DBT, particularly in early stages of treatment, may be an important incentive to bolster treatment uptake and commitment.",

          "authors": "Hiroto Miyoshi",
          "abstract": "The population correlation coefficients are the indices of the correlational strength of two variables, X and Y. However, when asked what it means, people often suggest that a positive correlation means a higher value on variable X is coupled with a higher value on variable Y. Then, they implicitly and even explicitly expect that if sample A is higher on variable X than sample B, sample A's value on variable Y is also higher than that of sample B. But this inference is not always correct unless the correlation coefficient is one. The present study analyzed the triad relationship between the probability of such inferences' accuracy, the strength of the correlation, and the standardized distance between two X values of samples A and B. The conclusion is that such practice has very limited usefulness in realistic situations. The article proposes using a 95% range of variability of Y when one needs to expect the Y value based on the paired X value, or reporting the probability of dominance when comparing two samples is necessary.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that our perception of time is tied to the embodiment of space. In particular, they suggest that time intervals are perceived or reproduced differently for stimuli at different distances from our body, and that this interaction of space and time is altered when we interact with spatial distances using tools. To corroborate these findings, we performed a series of experiments in physical and virtual setups, testing 218 participants on a time reproduction task for stimuli presented at three distances from the body (60, 120 &amp; 240 cm). In between testing sessions participants performed tool-use training, whereby they either used physical or virtual tools to manipulate objects at distances between 120 and 200 cm from their body. Prior to training, the reproduced intervals were overall longer for stimuli at an intermediate distance (120cm) compared to near the body (60cm). Tool-use training significantly shortened the reproduced intervals for stimuli at 120 cm, hence the distance at which tool-use training was operated. Participants' sensitivity to the presented intervals did not differ between distances prior to training, but was significantly reduced by tool-use training systematically at all distances. We observed qualitatively similar results for experiments in physical and virtual setups. Yet, the effect sizes for individual experiments were small, pointing to systematic but weak effects. Overall, this supports previous claims that time perception is tied to space and our interaction with this, though further work is required to understand the robustness and specificity of these effects.  \n\nKeywords: Time perception, Peripersonal Space, Space Representation, Active Tool-use",

Identifying risk factors and resources for low back pain (LBP) and back health in everyday life is crucial for its prevention and management. This study examined moment-to-moment fluctuations in pain intensity and back health and their associations with fear of movement, pain self-efficacy, and leisure-time physical activity in individuals with (n=128) and without (n=94) cLBP. Data were collected five times per day for 14 days (nmeasurements=13,292). Participants with cLBP reported experiencing LBP in 45% of all measurements, with a mean intensity of 3.16 (range: 1–9), whereas participants without cLBP reported LBP in 6.9% of measurements (Mintensity=2.38). Multilevel analyses including participants with and without cLBP showed that greater momentary fear of movement, lower momentary pain self-efficacy, and higher momentary levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with higher pain intensity (β=.05, p=.042, β=–.15, p&lt;.001, and β=.04, p=.001). Greater momentary fear of movement and lower momentary pain self-efficacy were associated with poorer back health (β=–.07, p=.004 and β=.16, p&lt;.001). The observed within-person associations highlight the potential for ecological momentary interventions targeting modifiable psychological factors related to cLBP in daily life, particularly pain self-efficacy.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the semantic depth of grammatical number in Ukrainian through a distributional semantic approach. In Ukrainian, the number category is considered a morphological category with a semantic dominance (Vykhovanecj, 2004). This view suggests that some forms are semantically motivated, while others express number only formally. By utilizing the semantically annotated General Regionally Annotated Corpus of Ukrainian (GRAC) and word embeddings from the TenTen Corpus for Ukrainian, this research analyzes the distributional representations of grammatical number to uncover its semantic nuances. The observed patterns in the usage of singular and plural forms in Ukrainian nouns align with the heterogenity of the number category. As such, the distribution of singular and plural forms does not strictly follow grammatical patterns. Instead, semantic factors play a significant role in determining the choice between singular and plural forms in Ukrainian nouns. In Ukrainian, a language with a rich morphological system, the semantics of grammatical number extends beyond simple quantification, touching on nuances of meaning, cultural usage, and syntactic dependencies.",

          "abstract": "Background\nOne of the most prominent theories of drug addiction is the incentive sensitization model. Individual differences in the tendency to ascribe motivational salience to cues that predict reward, and their ability to promote reward-seeking behaviour have been identified as potentially important in understanding vulnerability to addiction and relapse. However, to date this behaviour has not been assessed in a treatment-seeking clinical population, highlighting a significant gap in the literature pertaining to incentive sensitization and drug addiction.\n\nMethods\nIndividuals accessing drug and alcohol services with alcohol as primary drug of concern were recruited to participate in an intervention study. At the baseline session, participants completed various self-report measures (including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; AUDIT) in addition to a visual search task measuring sign-tracking to cues predicting monetary reward. Self-reported abstinence at 3-month follow up was primary outcome measure. All analyses and hypotheses were pre-registered.\n\nResults\nAt baseline (49 participants), AUDIT scores correlated with sign-tracking to signals of monetary reward, a relationship that cannot be explained by overall response time in the task or demographic variables. Sign-tracking, gender and craving during the sessions predicted return to use at 3-month follow up (41 participants). \n\nConclusions\nOur work demonstrates that involuntary sign-tracking to cues signalling non-drug reward is associated with problematic alcohol use and return to use at 3-month FU, in a treatment-seeking sample. Whether this automatic prioritisation of cues signalling reward is a consequence or vulnerability for problematic drug use remains to be seen.",

          "abstract": "Background: Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), a laboratory representation of risky foraging, serves as mainstay of pre-clinical anxiety disorder research, motivated by an impact of anxiolytic drugs on cautious behaviour. While behavioural cautiousness appears to be a stable trait, growing evidence suggests that it is insufficiently explained by self-reported trait anxiety. \nMethods: Here, we ask which psychiatric symptom dimensions explain AAC behaviour, using an exploration-confirmation approach across two large online samples (N1 = 315; N2 = 690). In a previously validated task, participants chose whether, and when, to approach rewards under varying threat probability and magnitude. They then completed a comprehensive psychiatric questionnaire battery with a known three-factor structure. \nResults: A broad psychopathology factor, with little contribution from anxiety scales, was the best predictor of all behavioural readouts. Higher symptom scores predicted decreased passive avoidance, increased behavioural inhibition, and reduced sensitivity to threat features. It was also associated with an altered subjective model of threat and reward relations in the environment. Broad and unspecific associations with same directional patterns were found between individual questionnaire scores and behaviour, underscoring the status of transdiagnostic dimensions. Crucially, no associations were found between behaviour and transdiagnostic anxiety-depression or gender. \nConclusions: This study highlights that cautiousness in AAC tasks is comprised of two components, which are linked to transdiagnostic psychopathology but not specifically or particularly strongly to self-reported trait anxiety. This finding challenges a traditional understanding of AAC as anxiety test, and provides a new view on cautious behaviour in every-day situations.",

This study examined the individual temporal response to this ‘critical session’ to predict overall treatment outcome. Based on Dynamic Systems Theory, it was expected that patients who retained an improvement in negative beliefs after the critical session, benefitted more from the overall treatment. Method: Treatment-resistant patients with comorbid anxiety disorders who followed Metacognitive Therapy and showed a drop in negative beliefs about worry after the critical session were selected (N = 45, 73.3% women, M age = 44.5). Negative beliefs about worry up to two weeks after the critical session, measured with the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30, were used to determine response patterns. Anxiety symptoms were measured at start, end, and one year after treatment using the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Analyses were pre-registered. Results: Most patients (65.1%) were classified as persistent responder (retaining improvement after critical session), as opposed to reversed responders, but this dichotomous predictor did not predict treatment outcomes. In contrast, individual slopes of negative beliefs about worry after the critical session positively predicted anxiety symptoms and clinically relevant improvement posttreatment but not one year follow-up. Conclusions: Holding on longer to an improvement in negative beliefs about worry predicted better treatment outcomes. This predictor could provide insight into whether patients have mastered a theorized, critical element for symptom improvement in MCT, which could be used to implement adjustments to the treatment plan to improve individual treatment effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making behavior in economic tasks is increasingly widely adopted as a psychological individual difference variable of interest. However, such measures are known to be sensitive to many seemingly incidental factors, such as presentation format, framing, and various kinds of context. The field as yet does not have a consistent theoretical explanation of this construct-irrelevant variability. We examine the prevalence and extent of variability across laboratory psychology measurements of supposedly stable behavioral economic traits. We begin by reviewing how these traits are conceptualized in behavioral economics, and how different instruments for eliciting them lead to variability in their measurements. We then consider factors such as experiment structure, affect, and context, known to influence or correlate in some way with the inferred values of these constructs: from domain or “subject-level” influences to local influences. We further consider the idea that an important – and cognitively meaningful – source of potential variation in experimentally-inferred measures may come from temporal sequence or the influence of trial order. Finally, we discuss how some of these sources of variation may not ultimately all be brought under experimental or analytical control. Rather than discard these widely-used measures, we instead provide strong reason for  researchers to explicitly think about how endemic variability should instead be exposed and considered for its predictive value in different settings.",

          "abstract": "In some contexts, abstract stimulus representations can effectively promote the pursuit of reward, whereas in others, more detailed representations are needed to guide choice. Here, using a novel reinforcement-learning task, we asked how children, adolescents, and adults flexibly adjust the specificity of the representations used for learning based on experienced reward statistics, as well as how the specificity of these learning representations influences subsequent memory. Across two experiments (total N = 224), we found that children, adolescents, and adults flexibly up- and down-weighted more detailed versus broader stimulus representations, depending on the reward structure of the environment. The representations used for learning shaped mnemonic specificity; when participants placed greater weight on granular representations during value-guided learning, they demonstrated enhanced subsequent memory for stimulus details, whereas when they placed greater weight on broader, categorical representations, they showed enhanced memory only for categorical information. Moreover, the relation between learning and memory strengthened with age; relative to adults, children exhibited reduced coupling between the specificity of the representations used for value-based choice and the specificity of their subsequent memories. Our work demonstrates that from early in life, reward shapes the granularity with which the world is partitioned, which, increasingly with age, influences how experiences are remembered.",

Durante los mismos, un equipo interdisciplinario compuesto por docentes, directivos, audiologas, fonoaudiólogas y psicólogos, evaluaban la trayectoria de algunos alumnos para definir la promoción o permanencia en el nivel, es decir si pasaban del nivel inicial a primer grado, o si debieran permanecer un año más en el mismo nivel. Llamó particularmente mi atención el debate que se originó en torno a una niña de 5 años, a la cual se evaluaba; docentes y psicólogos no llegaban a un acuerdo acerca de qué le pasaba a esa niña. Mientras que las dos docentes de su sala proponían que no era una sorda pura (término utilizado habitualmente para referir que no hay otra patología agregada a la discapacidad de base), los psicólogos sostenían que ciertas conductas disruptivas de la niña tenían que ver con el entorno, por aburrimiento o falta de estímulos de refuerzo. Queda claro que ambos psicólogos seguían un marco referencial cognitivo conductual. Las conductas que describían eran que deambulaba permanentemente por la sala, todo el tiempo de acá para allá, que sólo lograba concentrarse cuando las intervenciones de la docente eran dirigidas exclusivamente a ella, que no lograba seguir consignas grupales, que no prestaba atención y que estaba como en su mundo la mayoría del tiempo. La sospecha de las docentes es que la niña padecía de Trastorno por déficit\nde atención con hiperactividad (TDAH) y que este no estaba debidamente diagnosticado. Los psicólogos rechazaban fervientemente tal hipótesis aludiendo que si bien algunos criterios podrían coincidir con tal diagnóstico, los mismos no eran concluyentes o suficientes.\nEsta breve presentación me hizo reflexionar por un lado que la cuestión diagnóstica (sea pertinente para esta niña o no), giraba exclusivamente en la categoría TDAH. Yo me preguntaba, siendo consciente de no tener mucha más información del caso, y sabiendo que no era mi rol el de intervenir clínicamente, si el caso de la niña no podría pensarse dentro de los trastornos narcisistas no psicóticos (Rodulfo, 1987).\nMe propongo entonces, en este ensayo breve, contextuar el marco teórico de donde surgen ambas categorías diagnósticas, para luego sistematizar las características principales de cada una: la del TDAH y la del trastorno narcisista no psicótico, para finalmente poder cruzarlas y determinar puntos de contacto y diferencias a la hora de pensar un posible diagnóstico.\nLa hipótesis que se toma como punto de partida es que más allá de que ambos diagnósticos se rigen por marcos teóricos referenciales distintos, no hay una coincidencia entre ambas situaciones clínicas por lo que debería hacerse un diagnóstico diferencial entre ambas categorías.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Low socioeconomic status (SES) during childhood is associated with higher levels of youth psychopathology. However, limited longitudinal work has examined the role of both household and neighborhood SES in shaping mental health trajectories over time using large population-based data. The goal of the present study was to characterize associations between SES and changes in mental health problems during early adolescence.\nMethods. We investigated independent and joint associations of household income-to-needs ratio, parent educational attainment, material hardship, and neighborhood disadvantage with internalizing, externalizing, and attention symptom trajectories using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Youth-reported mental health was assessed across six time-points from age 10 to 13 years (M=10.4, SD=0.63 years at T1, N=9,488) and SES was assessed six months prior to T1.\nResults. Main effects indicated that high SES was associated with lower mental health symptoms. However, longitudinally, higher SES was associated with greater increases in mental health problems over time. A higher income-to-needs ratio predicted greater increases in internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems. Two-way interactions between SES indicators predicting changes in symptoms were non-significant.\nConclusion. Our finding that youth from higher-SES backgrounds exhibited greater increases in mental health problems during early adolescence contrasts with findings from prior cross-sectional studies. However, mental health problems are on the rise and the landscape of risk for psychopathology is changing. More research is needed to understand how childhood SES contributes to risk and resilience for psychopathology during the transition to adolescence.",

          "authors": "Ryuzo Hirota; Hayato Saigo; Shigeru Taguchi",
          "abstract": "The concept of affordance, proposed by James J. Gibson as an opportunity for action offered by the environment to the organism, has been adopted in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and robotics. However, different interpretations exist as to whether it is a feature of a relation between the environment and the organism and therefore cannot exist independently of the organism, or a “resource\" that exists in the environment independent of the organism's presence and is waiting to be used, or both, or neither. In this paper, we defend the position that affordances are both relational and resources using a category-theoretic approach. This idea is formalized by the concept of “natural transformations\" in category theory, which are structure-preserving transformations between “functors\" – mathematical expressions representing “seeing from a particular perspective.\" We propose that formalizing the realism of affordance in terms of natural transformations offers a more rigorous and lucid understanding of this concept. Furthermore, our formalization enables us to relate the reality of affordances to a broader context, especially the shift in the meaning of “reality\" in modern physics. Our category-theoretic approach offers a potential solution to the problems and limitations associated with existing set theory-based frameworks for affordances, paving the way for a future theory that better accounts for the open-ended interplay between organisms and their environments.",

          "abstract": "We examined music perception by treating performance on the sub-tests of Profile of Music Perception Skills (Mini-PROMS) as feature-space variables. We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training. A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained with eastern instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained with western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. A groupwise Principle Component Analysis allowed us to investigate these effects of duration and nature of training highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

          "abstract": "We tested two competing hypotheses about the nature of multi-featured object representations in visual working memory (vWM). One is that all object features are integrated into an object file. The other is that locations are critical for maintaining the bindings of visual features of an object. We developed an experimental paradigm that bridges the vWM and object-file literatures. Several multi-featured objects were presented simultaneously, followed by a retention interval in which placeholders either moved or not. Participants were then given one feature of a randomly chosen object as a cue and prompted to report the other two features of the same object. Applying multinomial process tree (MPT) models to evaluate the competing accounts of how multi-featured objects are represented in memory, we found evidence supporting the object-file theory and challenging the location-binding hypothesis. We conclude that bindings of features within the object can be maintained after motion. Furthermore, pairwise bindings between color and shape are robust against motion, implying that location is not essential for visual feature bindings.",

          "abstract": "This is a personal reflection on why I believe the science of consciousness may be taking a pernicious turn. The primary issue lies in the continued conflation of our supposed target phenomenon—subjective experience—with general cognitive and perceptual processes. As a result, much of the current research is conceptually off-target and insufficiently constrained by the relevant empirical evidence. This confusion, about the supposed subject matter itself, allows for the overinterpretation of findings and promotion of one’s personal worldviews as being supported by science. Unlike in other disciplines, where hyperbolic media activity can be dismissed as mere ‘noise,’ in this field it significantly influences funding and editorial decisions—and, by extension, jobs, and also the peer review process. This has made meaningful research increasingly difficult, and the clarification of the said conceptual confusion increasingly unlikely. I am not optimistic that we can ever resolve these systemic issues. However, by laying out the situation in some detail, we might better navigate how to move the science of subjective experience forward.",

The data was analyzed using the Item Response Theory to explore the discrimination, difficulty, and information curve of the items. After selecting the items, the structural validity, reliability, and external validity of the short scales were evaluated and compared with the original scales. The results gave three items for core disgust, three for animal reminder and three for contamination. These dimensions had adequate structural validity, reliability and correlation with external variables.

          "abstract": "Prior research has highlighted that brain oscillations, particularly in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, are closely linked to the sense of ownership and agency in both physical and virtual environments. Building on this foundation, the present study aimed to investigate whether participants develop a sense of ownership and agency over a physical tool or a computer mouse (termed virtual tools) during a reaching and grasping task, utilizing a well-established tool-use paradigm employed in our prior research. Additionally, we explored whether higher ratings of ownership and agency could be predicted by resting-state brain oscillations at baseline and during the tool-use training task. Twenty young adult participants took part in both physical and virtual tool-use training, completed across two blocks of active training. After each training session, participants completed a questionnaire to subjectively assess their sense of ownership and agency over both, the physical tool and the computer mouse. EEG recordings were conducted before, during, and after each tool-use training block, allowing us to assess the neural correlates of these experiences. The results showed that patterns of resting-state and task-related brain activity were linked to participants' sense of ownership and agency during tool-use training. Specifically, higher resting-state beta power in the right temporal region and alpha power in frontal areas predicted stronger feelings of ownership, while higher agency ratings were associated with alpha and beta power in the occipital region. During the task, ownership was linked to theta, alpha, and beta power across multiple brain areas, whereas agency during physical tool-use training correlated with increased frontal alpha, central and occipital beta, and theta in frontotemporal, central, and parieto-occipital regions. In virtual tool-use training, agency was associated with frontal alpha, frontal theta, and beta power in the left temporal and occipital areas. These findings suggest that both ownership and agency rely on distinct but overlapping neural mechanisms, highlighting the role of widespread oscillatory activity in integrating tools into the sensorimotor system’s adaptation to tool use. \nKeywords: Resting-state EEG, task-related EEG, sense of ownership, agency, tool-use",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study aimed to account for heterotypic continuity of multiple dimensions of psychopathology by using developmental scaling to place ratings by multiple informants of children’s externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\n\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N = 231) development of three dimensions of psychopathology—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered psychopathology—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from different measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\n\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task. Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach.\n\nConclusion: Using (a) changing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link the scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying the development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Default Mode A (DMA), a task-negative cognitive mode. The BOLD signal configurations associated with DMA are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present four. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing DMA from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with DMA over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to DMA as follows: (1) Snowman Mouth, (2) Muted Medial Temporal Dots, (3) Penguin, (4) Kitten, and (5) You’re in Trouble. Evidence for DMA was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by phonological and semantic judgement tasks, lexical decision, and task switching. The DMA cognitive mode was inversely correlated with the language mode, and therefore showed greater deactivation when linguistic processing was required, but less deactivation when suppression of linguistic processes enhanced performance. We also provide an anatomical and functional comparison to Default Mode B (DMB).",

Mental disorders are diverse, complex and multifaceted, and co-morbidity is common. However, fragmentation across multiple services and sectors (health, mental health and human services) results in gaps in service provision. In the context of ongoing mental health service reform in Australia. Comprehensive evaluation of the whole care system is critical for shaping policy and ensuring efficient allocation of resources. In this paper we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study that involves evaluating patterns of health, mental health, and human service use among young people in Victoria, Australia with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs.\nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort is youth aged 12-25 years during the time period January 2018 to November 2023. Data for individuals aged 5-11 and 26-53 during this period will also be included, to allow for examination of early years factors and an older adult comparison group. The data sources and data linkage methodology are described. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical characteristics of young people, their broader health and human service use behaviour and typical pathways through care, that could not be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

          "abstract": "We introduce EMC2, an R package for Bayesian hierarchical analysis of cognitive models of choice. EMC2 bridges the gap between standard regression analyses and cognitive modeling through linear-model specifications for each type of cognitive model parameter. The flexible implementation of the linear modeling language allows users to map model parameters directly to complicated designs and hypotheses. EMC2 implements recent developments in Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, including powerful and efficient sampling and marginal likelihood estimation algorithms, making it computationally feasible to estimate many different cognitive models and perform inference among them. Using two leading evidence-accumulation models, we illustrate how EMC2 provides a workflow that makes it easy to specify diverse parameterizations and informative priors, and to evaluate, refine, compare, and interpret models.",

          "authors": "Katrin Firl; Nora Müller; Theresa Nutz",
          "abstract": "Preventing undesired pregnancies in different-sex relationships requires ongoing actions and decisions from both partners. However, the burden of contraception is not equally shared. Most modern contraceptive methods are designed for female bodies, and women are typically responsible for managing contraception, from obtaining prescriptions to dealing with side effects. This contraceptive labor encompasses financial, time, physical and emotional costs – forming an often-overlooked aspect of unpaid labor that parallels housework and childcare in its gendered distribution.\nUsing 2021 data from the German Family Demography Panel (FReDA), we build on the “ContraIndex” to quantify the costs and risks of different contraceptive methods. Situating contraception within the framework of the gendered division of labor, we examine how women’s relative resources and gender ideology shape their contraceptive labor using OLS-regression techniques. \nOur findings suggest that higher-educated women use contraception requiring more contraceptive labor, while those working equal or greater hours than their male partners perform less contraceptive labor. Traditional gender ideology is linked to higher contraceptive labor, also for women who inherit higher relative resources than their male partners. Our results highlight a complex interplay between within-couple predictors and contraceptive behavior, underscoring the need for further research on contraceptive labor as an overlooked dimension of gender inequality.",

          "abstract": "The data dissemination through social media platforms has become a key medium. Nevertheless, these platforms depend on intricate algorithmic systems to execute various analytical processes and functions, which are fundamental to algorithmic operations. Algorithms go through large chunks of user data and how users behave in order to maximize user engagement. On the other hand, this infrastructure is developed with the intention of keeping the users on the platform for prolonged periods by serving content, ads and videos that are in sync with a user’s interests or likely to get a response. The research looks into the algorithmic work of social media — specifically, how algorithms of social media curate, filter and prioritize a content based upon user data. This study builds on work that has begun to explore algorithmic processes on social media platforms, focusing on how algorithms combine user data to curate, filter, and frontage content. The analysis is based on textual analysis of the impacts and the influences.",

          "authors": "Sven Ulpts; Sheena F. Bartscherer; Sarahanne Miranda Field; Bart Penders",
          "abstract": "Since claims about a ‘replication crisis’ started to circulate, the concept and practice of replication have gained new momentum. Some communities have started to promote replication indiscriminately as a practice and criterion for research quality irrespective of the diverse research communities’ various conditions and ways of knowledge production. Others have identified a replication drive, which involves moving replication into various research communities. This drive is enacted by incentivizing or demanding replication and related Open Science practices, and forms part of a culture change strategy towards increased replicability. Here, we propose the two-dimensional social replication of replication framework. It describes the process of moving replication across epistemic communities and enables us to understand first how the diverse epistemic communities across the research landscape relate to replication as a concept, practice and evaluative criterion and, second, which changes it undergoes along the way. The framework’s two dimensions are adaptation and adoption. Moving replication into different research communities without sufficient adaptation may lead to a potentially problematic and inappropriate social replication of replication. We thus argue that sustainable and appropriate social replication of replication requires adaptation, or more precisely a process of co-adaptation between replication and a community’s already established technologies of accountability.",

          "authors": "MOBILE - Center of Excellence for Global Mobility Law; Irina Fehr",
          "abstract": "Crimmigration scholarship examines the intersection of criminal law and migration control, and has \nlargely focused on the excessive criminalization of people on the move and solidarity activists. This, \nhowever, captures only part of the story: While migration is increasingly criminalized, state-perpetrated crimes against people on the move are rarely penalized in criminal justice systems, despite widespread accounts of border violence and serious harms suffered by migrants at the hands of Western states. This perspective has not yet been thoroughly addressed within the crimmigration \ndebate – a gap that is filled in this paper. Drawing on critical criminology and the concept of ‘criminal \nselectivity’, this article unveils state-perpetrated crimes against migrants as another face of \ncrimmigration. It illustrates how Western states use criminal law both excessively against migrants \nand solidarians, and sparingly against public officials, in the pursuit of controlling migration. These \ninterrelated mechanisms – conceptualized as over- and under-criminalization – form two sides of the \nsame coin, and capture the instrumentalization of criminal law in Western migration governance. By \nunpacking this selective criminalization, the paper contributes to a more holistic crimmigration \ndebate, developing a counter story to the predominant crime-migration nexus by shifting the focus \naway from migrant criminality towards criminal state conduct. This reframing not only challenges \nthe selective focus of crimmigration scholarship, but also lays the theoretical groundwork for \nreducing impunity around harmful migration control practices through the application of criminal \nlaw.",

          "abstract": "While the fundamental link between place and inequality is well investigated, causal studies on neighborhood effects are limited. Using nationwide administrative data from Germany and a quasi-experimental identification approach, we investigate how employed network ties and role models in the residential neighborhood shape individual-level employment. In exploiting variation over time, within cities and between 1x1 kilometer grid cells, we provide a causal estimate of gendered neighborhood employment effects on refugee women's employment probability. Results support direct job referral effects of full-time employed female neighbors, which is most potent for other neighborhood women from refugee countries. Analyses of locally prevalent female work norms show a positive one-off effect of higher part-time employment shares of native neighbors indicating that neighbors serve as role models only before other structures are settled. In analyzing neighborhood effects by sex and nationality, our study reveals that even weak neighborhood ties can provide valuable resources for disadvantaged social groups in the labor market. Hence, the study stresses the necessity to break down dichotomies such as gender and ethnicity when not only explaining but also finding alternative pathways for circumventing combined hurdles of intersectionality.",

          "abstract": "This comment aims to clarify trends in the percentage of men in the United States who are childfree (i.e., do not have and do not want children). Bozick (2023) used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to examine trends in the percentage of men who are childfree during the first two decades of the 2000s, concluding that there was a considerable increase. However, these percentages were computed incorrectly. Data from the NSFG are re-analyzed, ensuring comparable sample universes by age, correctly applying sampling weights, and including data from 2002. Following a small decline between 2006 and 2015 (10.7%-12.1%), the percent of men who were childfree between 2015 and 2019 (14.2%-15.7%) returned to the levels observed in 2002 (14.3%). Bozick's (2023) original conclusion, that the percentage of men who are childfree has grown considerably, is inconsistent with these revised analyses. Childfree men, and childfree adults in general, are a large and understudied demographic group that warrants greater attention, but researchers should exercise caution when studying trends in childfree prevalence.",

          "authors": "Yuhan Fang; Kohei Kawaguchi",
          "abstract": "In response to growing privacy concerns, many browsers have implemented restrictions on third-party cookies and cross-site tracking in online advertising. Advertisers are concerned that such retargeting prohibition policies could lead to a reduction in ads' click probability, thereby affecting the bid values. This paper investigates the economic consequences of prohibiting retargeting in online advertising by analyzing data from a demand-side platform (DSP). Our analysis shows that the DSP's bid values for non-retargeted impressions on Google Chrome are more than 60\\% lower than those for retargeted impressions. Yet this difference understates the true disparity in bid values, as retargeting status is observable only for internal auction winners. By modeling the internal auction process and estimating advertisers' valuations, we identify even larger differences between retargeted and non-retargeted impressions: 76.04% for Android and 71.40% for Windows. Our counterfactual simulations indicate that a complete ban on retargeting would substantially reduce expected bid values—by 30.06% for Android and 49.84% for Windows users. These results underscore the significant economic tradeoff between enhancing privacy protection and maintaining advertising market efficiency.",

          "authors": "Kripa Rajshekhar; Wlodek Zadrozny",
          "abstract": "This commentary critically examines Jesper Sørensen’s Why Cultures Persist: Toward a Cultural Immunology, which applies a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective to cultural persistence and transformation. Sørensen introduces the metaphor of a \"cultural immune system,\" paralleling biological immunity to processes of cultural regulation, resilience, and adaptation. While this metaphor provides an interesting lens for understanding social dynamics, we argue that it lacks structural precision, empirical support, and integration with other complex systems frameworks.\n\nThe book's strengths lie in its emphasis on distributed biological metaphors, the CAS framework, the Free Energy Principle, and the notion of ritual as a key constitutive element. However, it falls short by inadequately considering the interlocking effects between metabolism, reproduction, and immunity, failing to provide a theoretically usable definition of \"interaction sphere,\" and insufficiently connecting to relevant complex systems research across various fields. Moreover, it risks overextending a limited metaphor, leading to potential misapplications. Sørensen’s work would benefit from incorporating network theory, systems theory, and game theory to provide a more rigorous explanatory framework.\n\nWe question whether \"cultural immunology\" offers substantial conceptual breakthroughs or merely repackages existing insights under a novel terminology. The absence of precise models and empirical validation further limits its theoretical utility. Additionally, cultural persistence likely depends on multiple biological and social analogies—metabolic, reproductive, and nervous system models may be more relevant than immunity alone.\nUltimately, while Sørensen’s work is ambitious and thought-provoking, it falls short as a comprehensive model of cultural evolution. Future research should seek greater precision and empirical grounding, avoiding the pitfalls of overly broad metaphors in explaining cultural dynamics.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the movement against “progressive” prosecutors in the United States. Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovement efforts – such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions – challenging these prosecutors’ discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and extra-electoral challenges, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that extra-electoral challenges disproportionately target women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occur in Republican-controlled states, and have nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that extra-electoral challenges constitute a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",

We call for a) greater acknowledgement of the disparities in school resources and digital infrastructures that enable and constrain the possible applications of EdTech in secondary school classrooms, and the risk that these disparities will work to exacerbate inequities in SEND student experiences across the country; b) interrogation of the underpinning logic and pedagogies of EdTech and their claims to ‘personalise’ learning for SEND students; and c) a broader evidence base of efficacy or suitability of products for learners with additional needs. Finally, we argue for improved support for teachers and school leaders in developing the skills and knowledge they need to decide which technologies to use in their classrooms, and how best to effectively use them to support SEND students.",

As much of relevant data is now in the hands of the private sector, governments increasingly resort to purchasing data from private sources. There is, however, scant empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of how governments go about data purchasing. Therefore, we develop a new conceptual-analytical framework to analyze three models of data purchasing by governments: purchasing raw or aggregated data, data analyses, and data-based services. Next, based on Dutch data purchases, we explore the utility of our framework and create an evidence base detailing what data, data analyses, and data-based services Dutch governments purchase from whom, how, and for what purposes in the context of societal challenges. Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains. We expose a serious lack of transparency in government reporting on data purchasing. We further discuss our results in view of possible archetypes of data purchases and what purchasing strategy implications they have. Lastly, we propose several recommendations to practitioners and a research agenda for academics.",

Over five days and using a structured multi-stage process, six interdisciplinary teams developed prototype solutions to improve outbreak surveillance, vaccine deployment, data quality monitoring, and health workforce estimation. This paper reflects on the hackathon’s structure, participant experiences, and project outcomes, highlighting key lessons for future knowledge translation initiatives. Our findings suggest that hackathons can serve as effective platforms for accelerating interdisciplinary research impact, fostering engagement between policymakers and researchers, and promoting the development of public health solutions.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Listyg; David Nathan Lang; Brennah Ross; Anna Vinals Musquera; Zeve Sanderson",
          "abstract": "In January 2023, Louisiana enacted Act 440, requiring websites containing substantial adult content to verify users’ ages through government-issued identification or commercial verification services. Since the passing of this legislation, 17 additional states have adopted similar laws. Using Google Trends data and a preregistered synthetic control design, this paper examines the impact of these age verification requirements on digital behavior across four key dimensions: searches for the largest compliant website, the largest non-compliant website, VPN services, and adult content generally. Our analysis reveals a 46.6% reduction in searches for the dominant compliant platform, accompanied by significant increases in searches for both the dominant non-compliant platform (48.1%) and VPN services (34.2%). Through multiverse analyses that incorporate multiple specifications and control group constructions, we demonstrate the robustness of these behavioral changes. Our point estimates remain\nconsistent with our pre-registered hypotheses across 3,200 point estimates. Our findings highlight that while these regulation efforts reduce traffic to compliant firms and likely a net reduction overall to this type of content, individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification. Our methodological approach offers a framework for real-time policy evaluation in contexts with staggered treatment adoption.

          "abstract": "This paper explores speculative sonic futures and examines entanglements through which sonic bodies and sonic thinking intra-actively materialise in an increasingly posthuman city. It poses the question: How can we cultivate affirmative, empowering, and transformative relationships in the city through active listening—by tuning into what is unseen, erased, or no longer apparent? Drawing on sonic workshops and research-creation experiments conducted in Montréal in collaboration with the PULSE Lab at Concordia University, we are particularly interested in exploring and speculating with non-human sonorous materialities, including hidden algorithms and shaping forces operating beyond the human sensorium. This is especially relevant within the context of the sentient city, where data flows and algorithmic tracking of human activities and behaviours are increasingly central to contemporary urban economies. We conclude by advocating for posthuman modes of listening, embedding speculative and experimental approaches to revealing and following the city’s unseen disruptions and materialities.",

          "abstract": "Graphic narratives, with their interplay of visual and textual elements, offer a powerful\nmedium for storytelling, engaging readers on both cognitive and emotional levels. Amruta\nPatil’s Kari exemplifies this through its intricate use of visual intelligence, where metaphors,\nsymbols, and artistic choices shape the reader’s perception of the protagonist’s identity\nstruggle and survival in a heteronormative society. However, despite the increasing scholarly\ninterest in graphic narratives, there remains a gap in understanding how visual storytelling\ninfluences reader reception, particularly in terms of emotional and cognitive engagement.\nThis study seeks to address this gap by analyzing Kari through the lens of Graphic Narrative\nTheory and Neil Cohn’s Visual Language Theory (VLT), investigating how readers interpret\nand respond to its visual and textual elements.\nThis research employs sentiment analysis as a methodological tool to assess emotional\npolarity and subjectivity in reader responses, providing a computational approach to under-\nstanding the novel’s reception. The findings reveal that while Kari elicits predominantly\npositive sentiments, there exists a duality in interpretation—some readers deeply connect\nwith its artistic and metaphorical depth, while others find its abstract narrative challenging\nto decipher. This highlights the crucial role of visual literacy in decoding graphic narratives,\ndemonstrating that comprehension of visual storytelling significantly impacts the perception\nof the protagonist’s journey.\nUltimately, this study contributes to the broader discourse on graphic novels as a complex and evolving literary form, emphasizing their potential to serve as cognitive-emotional\nlandscapes that challenge traditional storytelling structures. By examining how visual intelligence in Kari shapes reader engagement, this research underscores the necessity of fostering\nvisual literacy to enhance the reception and appreciation of graphic novels, further advocating for their recognition in contemporary literary and academic discourse.",

Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and challenges of maintaining scientific rigour that were uncovered in these responses. While the prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews, it also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in selecting and presenting articles and responses.

          "abstract": "This research identifies the causality between entrepreneurial behaviour and informal institutions of social trust within the context of China’s development. Revisiting the Polanyi-Schumpeter theoretical framework, entrepreneurship embedded in social relations interlinked by trust is a dynamo of sustainable socioeconomic progress. The institutionalised trust, however, was not clarified. With micro-individual data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2011–2021, our research employs the instrumental variable approach rooted in historical rice farming to tackle endogeneity. The results demonstrate that social trust elevates entrepreneurial engagement by 32.65 and 10.37 percentage points in self-employment and business incorporation, respectively. Increased trust paradoxically hampers self-employment in the central due to insular networks and structural disparities. The findings uncover the nuanced role of social trust in facilitating and constraining entrepreneurship with contextually regional determinants. The research contributes to knowledge and evidence of institutional endowments that mediate entrepreneurial agency and argues for synchronising formal and informal institutions in development.",

          "abstract": "The research looks at user impressions of large language model (LLM) DeepSeek through a dual analytical framework encompassing sentiment and thematic analysis. The study aims to find user responses' predominant moods and repeated themes. The bifocal approach enhances perceptions of user satisfaction, concerns, and expectations by including sentiments and themes. A mixed-methods approach combining rule-based VADER sentiment analysis and thematic evaluation was used to analyze user feedback to elucidate platform-specific advantages and systemic challenges. Results indicate DeepSeek was perceived as highly positive overall by users (+0.80 aggregate sentiment) as well as high scores for Accessibility (+0.93) and Intelligence &amp; Reasoning (+0.88). Nevertheless, emerging criticism revolved around its Censorship and Content policies (-0.20). The users applauded analytical accuracy through free access but criticized the interface navigation issues. Thematic analysis pinpoints DeepSeek as affluent with analytically driven users while emphasizing its highly tenacious capacity towards domain-specific problems. However, Cross-cutting challenges include latency, stability, and the inherent tension between content moderation and user autonomy. The AI evaluation frameworks are methodologically advanced by adding computational sentiment tools and qualitative perceptions. The intuitions from these findings allow for a better understanding of the user experience and have profound implications for the current development and practical usability of DeepSeek. The relationship between functional specialty and user expectations equates the competitiveness of AI platforms with DeepSeek, seen as a robust, free analytical tool while signaling possible areas for strategic enhancements.",

          "abstract": "Normative fertility reflects broader societal trends but curiously changed little despite shifts in families. Changes in general ideal fertility, however, may be hidden by omitting nonnumeric ideals. Using GSS data, I analyze trends in and predictors of nonnumeric fertility ideals between 1975-2022. I further examine ideals for a subset nudged for numeric responses. Findings underscore a spike in nonnumeric ideals (9% in 1975 to 23% in 2022) paralleled by a waning two-child ideal. Shifts to web-surveys account for some of the growth, but nonnumeric ideals increased even when only examining interviewer-surveys (9% to 15%). Notably, when nudged, nonnumeric respondents offer nonnormatively high or low numeric ideals. Nonnumeric predictors also point towards two groups likely to give opposed extreme ideals (e.g., high and low gender role and sexuality attitudes, frequent religious attenders and non-attenders). Over time, those with large-family ideals may have initially drove nonnumeric responses, with a bifurcated pattern emerging later. The high and increasing proportion of nonnumeric ideals may suggest a shift from broadly held two-child norms toward bespoke smaller families that facilitate self-actualization emerging alongside a continuing counterweight favoring large families. Like work on nonnumeric personal fertility preferences, attention to nonnumeric normative ideals offers insights into fertility decision-making.",

As much of relevant data is now in the hands of the private sector, governments increasingly resort to purchasing data from private sources. There is, however, scant empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of how governments go about data purchasing. Therefore, we develop a new conceptual-analytical framework to analyze three models of data purchasing by governments: purchasing raw or aggregated data, data analyses, and data-based services. Next, based on Dutch data purchases, we explore the utility of our framework and create an evidence base detailing what data, data analyses, and data-based services Dutch governments purchase from whom, how, and for what purposes in the context of societal challenges. Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains. We expose a serious lack of transparency in government reporting on data purchasing. We further discuss our results in view of possible archetypes of data purchases and what purchasing strategy implications they have. Lastly, we propose several recommendations to practitioners and a research agenda for academics.",

          "authors": "Amy Nivette; Isabelle W. J. van der Vegt",
          "abstract": "Increasingly researchers are assessing the causal effects of procedurally just treatment by police on public attitudes using experimental vignettes across the world. However, there are two key limitations to this body of research, particularly when drawing causal conclusions about theoretical mechanisms. The first is that most research on procedural justice, and particularly using experimental vignettes, has been conducted in countries with similar roots in policing (i.e., Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking countries). The second limitation is that research on procedural justice theory using vignettes often fails to closely assess the mechanisms and potential confounds linking experiences of treatment and subsequent attitudes. The current study aims to address both of these gaps by replicating US experimental vignettes among a representative sample of Dutch residents. Specifically, we field a 3x2x2 between-subjects vignette to assess different components of procedurally just treatment by police on individual attitudes during a traffic stop. We assess causal assumptions using a series of follow-up questions about placebo characteristics, and investigate underlying mechanisms by analysing open-text responses following each police legitimacy item. The results from the current study show that, while procedurally just treatment by police was statistically related to perceptions of encounter-specific police legitimacy, the strength of the causal effect and underlying mechanisms were not so clear. Not only was a key causal assumption violated, indicating that the effect does not run only through the treatment, but respondents suggested that they would comply and trust police in the situation based on broader societal norms and expectations, not necessarily because of police behavior. Methodologically, our study suggests that researchers using experimental vignettes need to pay more attention to causal assumptions. Theoretically, our study shows that those interested in testing procedural justice theory (and criminological theories more broadly) must think critically about identifying and evaluating competing mechanisms in different societal and institutional contexts.",

          "abstract": "Despite strong evidence supporting sexual education, the Dutch national week of primary school-based sexual education sparked online controversy in 2023. This study examines the discourse surrounding this debate by analyzing social media posts (2022–2023) and newspaper articles (2005–2024) using topic modeling. Topic modeling is a machine-learning method that identifies patterns and themes in large text corpora. Among 2,095 newspaper articles, we identified five topics, revealing that while sexual education in Dutch primary schools has consistently been portrayed as beneficial, it has become increasingly contested over time. Newspaper coverage grew rapidly in 2023, with opposing viewpoints receiving more attention since 2018. The 10 topics identified in the analysis of 3,091 social media posts reflected this trend, highlighting polarization between conservative and progressive groups. Debates centered on age-appropriateness, the inclusion of controversial topics such as pleasure and LGBTQ+ issues, and the role of schools in sex education. We conclude that to increase public support for primary school-based sexual education, schools should prioritize transparent communication and direct engagement with parents to address concerns and counter misinformation circulating on social media.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper explores the musical dimensions of early infant vocal expressions—crying, cooing, and babbling—and their role in shaping secure attachment through the lens of Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the ritornello. Building on Bowlby’s attachment theory, which emphasizes the infant’s innate signaling behaviors and the caregiver’s responsive attunement, the discussion foregrounds how repeated vocal exchanges create a sonic “territory” that fosters a sense of emotional safety. Drawing on studies of mother–infant interactions, the paper examines how rhythmic and melodic qualities of cries and babbles elicit complementary parental responses, forming protoconversations integral to a child’s emerging self-regulation. The theory of communicative musicality is invoked to illustrate how these interactive “songs” precede formal language yet convey complex affective states. Deleuze and Guattari’s refrains framework highlights the creative, organizing power of repeated sound patterns in stabilizing early relational life. Incorporating insights from Kristeva, Trevarthen, and Stern, the paper argues that the preverbal “song before speech” establishes a foundation for later linguistic and psychosocial development. Finally, clinical perspectives show how voicework and expressive therapies can re-access and re-configure these preverbal sonic territories in adulthood, offering corrective emotional experiences for individuals with disrupted attachments. Through this approach, the paper reaffirms the important  impact of musicality in infancy, underscoring how repeated vocal refrains not only forge secure bonds but also endure as vital resources for therapeutic healing.",

          "abstract": "Food waste generates a substantial amount of carbon emissions. One type of food waste – uneaten food left behind on plates at the end of a meal – is unnecessary because it does not improve the dining experience. This study explores two enjoyment-based interventions aimed at reducing plate waste at hotel buffets. The first intervention (“sweet delight”) offers guests a chance to win a luxury dessert for finishing all the food on their plate. The second intervention (“flipper”) involves giving away to hotel guests who leave no plate waste a token for a game of flipper (pinball). In a manipulation check survey experiment, we test whether the two interventions increase positive emotional engagement (i.e., enjoyment, enthusiasm, excitement) and compare stated behavioural intentions to a control condition (no intervention). The “sweet delight” condition passes the manipulation check but does not increase intentions to leave no plate waste. The “flipper” intervention did not pass the manipulation check. A field study at a Slovenian hotel showed that “sweet delight” significantly reduced plate waste generated per hotel guest at dinner. The “flipper” intervention failed to change plate waste behaviour significantly. Findings point to enjoyment-based incentives as a promising avenue for behaviour change interventions aiming to trigger pro-environmental consumer behaviour. The “sweet delight” intervention tested in this study is available for immediate deployment by hotels that wish to reduce plate waste.",

          "authors": "Renato Fakhoury; Adam B. Lerner; Jarrod Hayes",
          "abstract": "Climate change represents a profound theoretical challenge for IR and adjacent disciplines. It consists simultaneously of a series of disasters, in need of repair and redress, and a creeping unjust structural condition—a new normal with growing pernicious effects that transcend borders, recur over time, and disproportionately burden marginalized communities. Though scholars have developed frameworks for assessing both the episodic and structural aspects of climate change, they have failed to grasp their entangled, compounding effects. To address this gap, we theorize dual vulnerability to climate change as a unique position in debates over climate justice. We do so by drawing on Iris Marion Young’s dichotomy between interactional and structural injustice, but integrating her models to highlight how distinct forms of injustice reinforce and compound each other. The dually vulnerable, we argue, are not merely victims of catastrophic climate events, but also the most disadvantaged by the uneven global playing field climate change creates. The concept of dual vulnerability contributes to IR by highlighting the complex entanglement of discrete environmental damages and structural climate injustice, as well as how the dually vulnerable face a temporal challenge of simultaneously pursuing backward-facing compensation and forward-facing collective reparation action. To highlight our concept’s utility, we apply it to analysis of the UNFCCC’s recently created Loss and Damage Fund.",

One broad strand of research characterises how risk emerges from the complex global system, using concepts like systemic risk, Anthropocene risk, synchronous failure, negative social tipping points, and polycrisis. Another strand focuses on possible worst-case outcomes, using concepts like global catastrophic risk (GCR), existential risk, and extinction risk. Despite their clear relevance to each other, only limited connections have been made between these two strands. Here we provide a framework which synthesises the two and shows how emergent properties of the global system contribute to the risk of global catastrophic outcomes. Specifically, the global system generates hazards, amplification, vulnerability, and latent risk, as well as challenges for GCR assessment and mitigation. This systemic lens helps us understand the origins of GCR, provides a useful interface between two deeply related but infrequently connected bodies of work, and provides important insights for risk reduction.",

          "authors": "Barbara Turk Niskac",
          "abstract": "The litter-raking stands of Bela Krajina in Slovenia are taken as a reference point to examine the entanglements of human and more-than-human worlds through the concept of work as an activity that places humans in a relationship with other living beings. In the domestic agricultural economy of the past, the litter-raking stands were used as pastures for livestock in the spring and summer. In the fall, people gathered litter and cut bracken for bedding the livestock that returned to the barns before winter. The practice led to soil degradation and acidification, so that only sparsely growing birch, pine, and undergrowth of bracken, spring heath, and common heather grew on these lands. In the process of modernization and de-agrarization these activities have been abandoned since the 1960s, and the most litter-raking stands have since become overgrown. Today, some of these stands are protected as natural heritage under Natura 2000. They are home to various birds, butterflies, insects, fungi and orchids and are cut only to preserve biotic diversity. Fast reforestation in this context thus points to the importance of moderate human disturbances for biodiversity conservation. Based on a case study of litter-raking stands, this paper acknowledges the ethic of care as inherent to work as a life-sustaining practice where human and non-human well-being are entangled (Krzywoszynska 2020). Furthermore, it explores whether it is possible to consider work as a life-sustaining practice embedded in a more-than-human relationality, reciprocity, and care that recognizes “work of nature” (Battistoni 2017) for ecosystem maintenance as well.",

We illustrate how to use structural causal models to conduct causal inference using regression models based on simulated data of a hypothetical structural causal model of Open Science. The graphical representation of structural causal models allows researchers to clearly communicate their assumptions and findings, thereby fostering further discussion.

This novel approach offers a comprehensive evaluation of childcare arrangements, revealing, under a potential outcome framework, their overall relevance and the specific channels driving social disparities: unequal exposure (prevalence), heterogeneous effects, and selection (within-group treatment propensity) Using the newborn cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS - SC1), we assess the impact of early childhood education and care (ECEC), family day-care, grandparental care, and exclusive parental care on children’s competencies in mathematics and vocabulary at ages 4 and 5. Findings reveal center-based ECEC as the most effective in reducing social disparities, benefiting children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Conversely, exclusive parental care and family day-care widen disparities, favoring higher socio-economic groups while negatively affecting those from lower ones. This approach proved highly useful in identifying both beneficial and detrimental impacts, offering valuable insights into the nuanced role of childcare arrangements in shaping early social inequalities in children’s competencies.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "This essay provides an overview of statistical methods in public policy, focused primarily on the United States. I trace the historical development of quantitative approaches in policy research, from early ad hoc applications through the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the full institutionalization of statistical analysis in federal, state, local, and nonprofit agencies by the late 20th century. I then outline three core methodological approaches to policy-centered statistical research across social science disciplines: description, explanation, and prediction, framing each in terms of the focus of the analysis. In descriptive work, researchers explore *what exists* and examine any variable of interest to understand their different distributions and relationships. In explanatory work, researchers ask *why does it exist* and *how can it be influenced*. The focus of the analysis is on explanatory variables (X) to either (1) accurately estimate their relationship with an outcome variable (Y), or (2) causally attribute the effect of specific explanatory variables on outcomes. In predictive work, researchers as *what will happen next* and focus on the outcome variable (Y) and on generating accurate forecasts, classifications, and predictions from new data. For each approach, I examine key techniques, their applications in policy contexts, and important methodological considerations. I then consider critical perspectives on quantitative policy analysis framed around issues related to a three-part \"data imperative\" where governments are driven to count, gather, and learn from data. Each of these imperatives entail substantial issues related to privacy, accountability, democratic participation, and epistemic inequalities—issues at odds with public sector values of transparency and openness. I conclude by identifying some emerging trends in public sector-focused data science, inclusive ethical guidelines, open research practices, and future directions for the field.",

          "title": "Improving Functionalist Arguments",
          "authors": "Andrés Castro Araújo; Nicolas Restrepo Restrepo Ochoa",
          "abstract": "Contemporary sociology finds itself in an awkward position. Despite having declared the death of functionalism, some form of functionalist argument still remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that this inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this article has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction. This allows us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. This framework enables us to better evaluate, challenge, and improve upon much of the sociological research that currently relies on these forms of argument. Importantly, these forms of argument are not burdened with the problems associated with the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they think of functionalism.",

          "abstract": "Current research funding systems are subject to structural imbalances, where formal criteria such as the H-index and the number of publications dominate over the potential and actual scientific prospects of researchers. This leads to the suppression of potential breakthrough research directions and limited access to grants for stochastic (innovative) researchers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic agent-based model of research grant redistribution that takes into account the adaptive mechanism of funding redistribution on the basis of the quality of stochastic research.\n\tThe simulation was conducted on a sample of 21,534 Kazakhstani researchers with 30 iterations, during which the growth of the formal features of stochastic scientists was analyzed under different grant distribution scenarios. A grant redistribution parameter λ was introduced, which controls adaptive funding. The results showed that at λ=0.15, stochastic scientists begin to catch up with formal scientists in terms of productivity without destabilizing the scientific system.\n\tOn the basis of the data obtained, a principle called the Haderach principle was proposed. It consists of a dynamic balance between formal (stable) and stochastic (informal) science. The developed approach can be used to optimize grant systems, allowing the elimination of barriers to new scientific directions and potential achievements without losing the stability of traditional schools.\n\tNew concepts and terms of scientific vocabulary are introduced: the Haderach principle, excluded science, supplemented science, grant monopoly, and so on.\n\tArticle structured V new IRPAS (Induction, Related Works, Processing, Analysis, Synthesis) notations.",

          "authors": "Dianyi Yang",
          "abstract": "Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",

          "abstract": "Malaysia has been one of the oldest and most unwavering allies of China in South East Asia.\nIt was the first country to diplomatically recognize China in the region and continues to\nmaintain a close diplomatic and economic relationship with China. Chinese territorial claims\nover the potentially resource-rich South China Sea waters and its islands have caused great\nunrest among the littoral countries, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. The problem is\ncompounded by the multitude of claims made by these same countries over each other’s\nterritory. The parties to this dispute, with the exception of China, happen to be members of\nASEAN. Chinese claims, based on their own interpretation of historical and jurisdictional\nevidences; challenge the territorial integrity of these states. Malaysia, as one of the founding\nmembers of ASEAN and one of the largest economies in the region, wields significant\ninfluence over her fellow members-states and could have emerged as a crucial mediator and\npeacekeeper between the China and the South East Asian countries. However, Malaysia has\nadopted a cautious approach in dealing with the South China Sea issue, refraining from\nopenly condemning Chinese actions and lodging protests only when her own territorial\nintegrity is repeatedly challenged. Such caution has ensured Malaysia bountiful trade with\nChina, along with cordial diplomatic and even military relations which have brought the two\ncountries very close. However, recent events of Chinese aggression have led Malaysian\nleaders and the public to question their country’s stance. Ethnic Malays bear grudges for the\nethnic Chinese minority in Malaysia, considered disproportionately rich. Malaysian\ngovernment will also be fearful of Chinese incursions in their territories which are rich in\npetroleum resources. It can therefore be assumed that although Malaysia will tolerate Chinese\nactions for reasons of trade and security, she will not abandon the other ASEAN states and\nopenly side with China. Malaysia’s policy in the South China Sea issue had been and in all\nprobability, will continue to be one of diplomatic tightrope walking.",

          "authors": "An Trinh",
          "abstract": "This paper seeks to identify the common characteristics of socialist thoughts. Using “A history of socialist thought from the precursors to the present” by Mukherjee and Ramaswamy (2000) as data, this paper utilizes qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method to find the combination of characteristics that make up socialist thoughts, and political compass to visualize the positions of socialist thoughts. These common characteristics are categorized into groups of Goal and implementation, International view, Politics, Economy, Society, Democratic institution, Revolutionary action, and Revolutionary forces. Among them, Politics, Society, and Revolutionary action groups can be considered to have causal relationship with socialist thoughts. Most socialist thoughts are on the Libertarian left quadrant of the political compass. The methods in this paper have the potential to combine the strengths and limit the weakness of both qualitative and quantitative methods in more comprehensive research of socialist thoughts, for better application of socialism in practice in the future.",

However, there is little attention on oriental practice of democracy or viable alternative to western democracy. In this paper, a study is made on ancient Chinese thinking and practice of democracy. It is found that the first democracy was born in China more than 4,000 years ago. As a result of the discovery, a practical framework called Yao-Shunism is formulated and presented. Yao-Shunism offers non-partisan politics and participatory governance. It is backed by major Chinese philosophies and provides a viable alternative to existing political practice. It is shown that the entire world can benefit from Yao-Shunism if implemented. We demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of Yao-Shunism through George Washington.",

          "abstract": "This is an essay on comparative constitutional history and comparative revolution. In it, I will consider the development of the rule of law as a phase of state building, paying particular attention to representative institutions. I will compare the constitutional histories of England, France, Russia, Germany and the United States from their origins to the point in each nation’s history which I consider the end of that country’s revolution. It is my thesis that all revolutions are about law and constitutional arrangement and that continuity is a characteristic of the political and constitutional arrangements which exist before and after revolutions.  Revolutions answer the question: Who makes law? Where in the state does the legislative authority reside? I hope to show that the outcome of a revolution, the constitutional arrangements that result from it, is largely determined by the system of government that existed before the revolution. That is, however much revolutionaries might want to make a clean break with the past and create a totally new political system, the ultimate revolutionary outcome will have some continuity with the prerevolutionary system.",

          "abstract": "This article considers how \"self-imposed term limits,\" voluntary pledges by candidates for elected office to step down at the end of their term if elected or reelected, can arise endogenously within a formal model of electoral accountability. To this end, I extend a standard two-period political agency model with adverse selection by appending an election campaign during which two candidates compete with the option to commit not to seek reelection. I show that term limit pledges can emerge in equilibrium without commitment power, revealing their relationship with informative cheap talk. The subsequent analysis considers scenarios where commitment power is necessary for upholding term limit pledges. In these cases, self-imposed term limits allow strong candidates to signal their private type to voters, giving them an electoral advantage over those seeking reelection. However, these candidates' appeal comes not from the informational content of their pledges but from their ability to make policy decisions free from career considerations. I characterize the equilibria of a model specification in which politicians have differing policy preferences, identifying conditions under which term limit pledges are simultaneously informative and improve voter welfare.",
