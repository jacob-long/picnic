          "title": "Critiplot: A Comprehensive Python Package and Web Tool for Visualizing Risk-of-Bias Assessments in Evidence Synthesis",
          "authors": "Vihaan Sahu",
          "abstract": "Objective: Risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment is a critical component of evidence synthesis, yet visualization of these assessments remains challenging due to the diversity of assessment tools and a lack of standardized visualization approaches. This study aimed to develop Critiplot, a comprehensive solution comprising a Python package and a web tool that supports visualization of multiple RoB assessment frameworks including the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), ROBIS, JBI checklists for case reports and case series, and GRADE – a combination not comprehensively supported by any existing single tool. Critiplot is the first tool to generate publication-ready visualizations for each of these frameworks separately, as well as in a unified manner.\n\nMethods: Critiplot was developed using Python 3.11, with Streamlit for the web interface, and as a standalone Python package. The tool supports five major RoB assessment tools: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), GRADE, ROBIS, JBI Case Report, and JBI Case Series. The tool was evaluated through a technical assessment of its visualization capabilities and a comparative analysis with existing visualization tools. Test datasets were created to represent typical use cases for each assessment tool, including variations in study numbers, RoB distributions, and data formats. Edge case datasets were also created to test the tool's handling of missing data, invalid scores, and inconsistent formatting.\n\nResults: Critiplot successfully generates publication-ready traffic light plots and weighted bar plots for all supported assessment tools. The tool offers multiple visualization themes and supports various output formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS). Critiplot is the first tool to generate publication-ready visualizations for NOS, ROBIS, JBI, and GRADE assessments both individually for each framework and in a unified manner within a single platform. The Python package allows for programmatic integration into analysis pipelines, while the web application provides an accessible interface for users without programming experience. Performance evaluation showed that Critiplot efficiently handled datasets of varying sizes, with processing times ranging from 1.5 seconds for 3 studies to 3.8 seconds for 10 studies. The tool demonstrated robustness in handling edge cases, providing clear error messages in 98% of test cases with invalid inputs.\n\nConclusion: Critiplot addresses a significant gap in evidence synthesis methodologies by providing a unified, reproducible approach to RoB visualization across multiple assessment frameworks. Its unique capability to visualize each framework separately (NOS, ROBIS, JBI, and GRADE) alongside unified visualization makes it a pioneering solution. Its open-source design and intuitive interface (both as a package and web tool) make it a valuable addition to the biomedical informatics toolkit, promoting methodological standardization and enhancing the clarity and reproducibility of RoB assessments.",

          "authors": "Rebecca Fischer; Marie Alavi; Julia Priess-Buchheit; Timothy M. Errington",
          "abstract": "On 1 July 2025, the Center for Open Science (COS) and the Horizon Europe project IP4OS – Unpacking the possibilities of Intellectual Property for Open Science convened a Small Circle Meetup on Intellectual Property (IP) and Open Science (OS) in London, held alongside the Metascience Conference. The session brought together a select group of nine experts, including representatives from researchers, research funders, research policy experts, research knowledge brokers, scientific publishers, and representatives from OS infrastructures.\nThe gathering was designed to foster open and candid dialogue on the evolving relationship between IP frameworks and OS practices in a rapidly transforming research environment. Building on the Small Circle methodology piloted by the Path2Integrity project in 2022, the format created a safe and confidential setting in which experts could critically reflect on shared challenges and opportunities.\nThe Small Circle Meetup in London focused on how IP and OS can move from perceived tensions to genuine synergies. Central questions guiding the discussion included: (1) When and how “open by default” can be realised, and what qualifies as legitimate exceptions; (2) The sequencing of patenting and open release in practice, and how hybrid models can be managed; (3) Institutional infrastructures and capacities needed to enable both protection of innovation and open dissemination.\nThrough this lens, the session aimed to explore how IP and OS can be positioned not as competing imperatives but as complementary drivers of sustainable, trustworthy, and impactful research.",

          "authors": "Andrew Horman",
          "abstract": "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence into mental health practice has generated ethical\nconcerns, yet individual practitioners lack clear guidance on responsible AI use. This manuscript\nproposes a clinical framework grounding ethical AI interaction in established therapeutic\nboundary principles—concepts mental health professionals already possess through training and\npractice. Drawing from clinical training (therapeutic boundaries, informed consent, scope of\npractice), law enforcement principles (documentation, threat assessment), disability justice\nperspectives (accommodation vs. replacement), and cross-domain skill transfer, six core\nprinciples emerge: (1) clear role definition, (2) context provision without therapy, (3)\nprofessional boundaries, (4) informed consent and data security (including HIPAA compliance\nfor clinical practice), (5) decision-making authority, and (6) dependency monitoring. This praxis-\nbased framework addresses the literature gap regarding individual practitioner guidance and\ndisability perspectives in AI ethics. The framework demonstrates that existing professional ethics\ncodes already provide AI guidance through transferable skills, requiring no entirely new\nframeworks but rather application of boundary management expertise to technological tools. A\nself-assessment tool enables practitioners to evaluate their AI interactions systematically. This\nwork contributes theoretical understanding of how clinical training translates to technological\ncontexts while offering practical implementation guidance for mental health professionals\nnavigating AI integration responsibly",

          "abstract": "Aims: Many children and young people with social work involvement (CYPwSW) experience a higher prevalence of mental health difficulties with an increased likelihood of referral to mental health services than their peers. Yet little is known about their likelihood of accessing mental health support following referral. This observational study aims to address this gap, examining how social work status is associated with service access. \n\nMethods: Data were extracted from young people’s first referral to mental health services in South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust between 2007 to 2023 and included social work and sociodemographic characteristics. Multilevel logistic regression modelling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and to estimate the associations between social work status (no involvement; other current social work involvement without a formal recorded intervention; past social work involvement; child protection plan; being looked after) and service access. \n\nResults: A total of N=71,740 referrals were extracted. Children with current or past social work involvement had significantly higher adjusted odds of not accessing mental health services compared to their peers. The highest adjusted odds were observed among children with other current social work involvement (OR=2.65 [95% CI=2.43, 2.88]) and on child protection plans (OR=2.03, [95% CI=1.88, 2.20]). Past social work involvement (OR=1.14 [95% CI=1.07, 1.23]) and being looked after (OR=1.13 [95% CI=1.04, 1.22]) were also associated with higher adjusted odds, though to a lesser extent.\n\nConclusions: Findings from this study suggest that children with current and past social work involvement experience disparities in accessing mental health services. The underlying reasons for this are yet to be confirmed, but overall, mental health inequities in social work experienced populations may be amplified at the point of access to mental health support.",

          "abstract": "Motif mapping is a disability-informed counseling modality that integrates trauma-informed\ncare, narrative therapy, strengths-based theory, and disability justice to support symbolic healing\nand narrative sovereignty. Developed through lived experience and clinical training, the modality\ninvites clients to define and evolve personal motifs—such as tattoos, metaphors, or visual\nemblems—as anchors for emotional regulation, identity reconstruction, and systemic resistance.\nThe therapist’s role is collaborative and non-interpretive, protecting symbolic autonomy and\ncultural integrity across diverse client populations. Motif mapping is adaptable for disabled and\nneurodivergent individuals, and its structure accommodates expressive barriers, sensory\nsensitivities, and mobility-related needs. The modality’s applications span individual therapy,\nsupervision, curriculum design, and telehealth, with ethical integration of AI tools to enhance\naccess without compromising authorship.

          "authors": "Christine Lee",
          "abstract": "This mini-review examines how dual-process theory, which distinguishes fast, intuitive (System 1) and slow, reflective (System 2) processes, shapes decision-making in criminal and legal contexts. Specifically, offender behavior often relies on rapid, heuristic-driven responses, particularly under stress, time pressure, or emotionally charged situations. Moreover, individual traits such as self-control further influence the balance between intuition and deliberation. Similarly, judges and jurors are affected by cognitive strain, narrative-driven reasoning, and emotional cues, leading them to rely on intuition despite analytical experience. Consequently, these patterns contribute to systematic cognitive biases, including anchoring, confirmation, and availability effects, across investigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative stages. By synthesizing evidence from offender studies, judicial and jury research, and analyses of wrongful convictions, this review demonstrates that intuitive dominance can override reflective reasoning, leading to real-world errors. Finally, the review highlights interventions such as structured evidence evaluation, cognitive bias training, and reflective decision-making strategies, which aim to mitigate errors and improve outcomes in the criminal justice system.\nKeywords: dual-process theory, system 1, system 2, cognitive bias, criminal decision-making, legal decision-making",

This study explores how binge-watching behavior relates to shifts in cognition, behavior, identity, and worldview among young adults. Using a custom-designed survey administered to 90 participants, ten mindset subscales were developed to assess dimensions such as cognitive shifts, parasocial attachment, escapism, and algorithmic influence. Responses were coded on a 5-point Likert scale, with binge-watching hours self-reported. Correlational analysis revealed that greater hours spent binge-watching were positively associated with stronger mindset shifts, particularly in the domains of Behavioral Shifts &amp; Lifestyle (r = .58) and Identity &amp; Self-Perception (r = .53). These findings highlight the psychological implications of binge culture for Gen Z, while raising critical questions about long-term impacts.",

          "authors": "Kathryn Kemp; Abhishek Saxena; Ivy Fei Tso; Aubrey M Moe",
          "abstract": "The cognitive model of schizophrenia posits that people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) experience a range of cognitive deficits that lead to the development of dysfunctional attitudes, which then impact long-term functioning. Negative expectancy appraisals represent one relevant, yet understudied, type of dysfunctional attitude that may explain the relationship between cognitive impairment and functioning in SSD. The current study examined whether negative expectancy appraisals mediate the relationship between cognitive ability and both role and social functioning. Participants with SSD (n=41) and non-clinical controls (n=42) completed a neurocognitive assessment battery, a questionnaire examining negative expectancy appraisals, and clinician-administered measures of role and social functioning. Mediation analyses indicated that greater levels of cognitive ability were associated with better role and social functioning, in part through lower levels of negative expectancy. The indirect effect accounted for 33% of the variance in predicting role functioning and 43% of the variance in predicting social functioning. Importantly, these results were not simply driven by group status, suggesting that both clinical and nonclinical participants exhibited a similar pattern of associations among cognitive ability, negative expectancies, and functioning. Thus, general conceptualizations of the relationship between cognitive ability and dysfunctional attitudes, as well as associated interventions, might be usefully applied toward people with SSD who exhibit cognitive and real-world functional deficits. Negative expectancy appraisals could offer another treatment target to improve the everyday experiences of individuals with SSD.",

          "abstract": "Age-related changes in hearing and cognition affect how the brain adapts to perceptual challenge. Alpha-band oscillatory activity may be functionally important for adaptive listening, but whether these oscillations can be causally and selectively modulated in the ageing brain is unknown. Here, for the first time, we combine individualised alpha-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (alpha-TMS) with electrophysiological and behavioural measures to test state-dependent entrainment of auditory and parietal alpha oscillators during listening. Younger and older adults completed an irrelevant speech paradigm, during which they received alpha-TMS to task-relevant brain regions. Data show that individualised alpha-TMS preferentially entrains alpha oscillations in auditory cortex in older, but not younger, listeners. In contrast, alpha entrainment in parietal cortex relates to hearing sensitivity and listening performance. These findings provide the first evidence for individualised, state-dependent entrainment of auditory alpha oscillations during listening, and demonstrate age- and sensory-related effects on the modulation of neural rhythms for perception.",

          "abstract": "Achieving a complete understanding of our internal thought processes requires us to understand the behavioral and neural distinctions underpinning controlled thoughts (internal attention) and spontaneous thoughts (mind-wandering). One unexplored question is whether thought content differs with differing levels of thought control. We had participants in an online study perform a mind-wandering task, report the content of their thoughts in their own words and categorize their thoughts based on content, where their thoughts were directed (externally or internally) and whether their thoughts were under their control. We computed sentence similarity of thought content through pre-trained sentence similarity models and found within-subject task-unrelated thought content was less similar than within other thought categories. We also found within-subject internally generated spontaneous thoughts were less similar than internally generated controlled thoughts, even when analyses were restricted to task-unrelated thoughts. Validation of sentence embeddings found thought content naturally clusters based on thought category. We finally found the number of task-unrelated internal spontaneous trials, but not controlled trials, correlated with mind-wandering survey measures. Overall, we find evidence for a meaningful distinction between controlled internal attention and spontaneous mind-wandering based on thought content.",

          "abstract": "Before they even talk, infants become sensitive to the speech sounds of their native language and recognize the auditory form of an increasing number of words. Traditionally, these early perceptual changes are attributed to an emerging knowledge of linguistic categories such as phonemes or words. However, there is growing skepticism surrounding this interpretation due to limited evidence of category knowledge in infants. Previous modeling work has shown that a distributional learning algorithm could reproduce perceptual changes in infants’ early phonetic learning without acquiring phonetic categories. Taking this inquiry further, we propose that linguistic categories may not be needed for early word learning. We introduce STELA, a predictive coding algorithm designed to extract statistical patterns from continuous raw speech data. Our findings demonstrate that STELA can reproduce some developmental patterns of phonetic and word form learning without relying on linguistic categories such as phonemes or words nor requiring explicit word segmentation. Through an analysis of the learned representations, we show evidence that linguistic categories may emerge as an end product of learning rather than being prerequisites during early language acquisition.",

          "authors": "Sixu Cai; Henrico van Roekel; Lars Tummers; Rens van de Schoot",
          "abstract": "Human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly embedded in decision-making tasks, including systematic reviewing workflows such as title and abstract screening. Yet humans as final arbiters remain susceptible to influence from peripheral cues, leaving these hybrid workflows vulnerable to new forms of bias. This paper examined how two authority cues influence screening judgements: AI appraisals and journal prestige. Using preregistered experiments, we investigated how these cues shape inclusion decisions in a realistic abstract-screening task. We employed a 3 × 3 mixed design. Participants were randomly assigned to receive AI recommendations, AI disapprovals, or no AI input. Across trials, each participant evaluated abstracts that appeared with all three journal cues: prestigious labels, non-prestigious labels, and no journal information. Across Western graduate students, Asian bachelor’s-degree holders, and Western professionals (total N = 977), AI appraisals functioned as a strong and consistent authority cue, systematically biasing screening decisions. Journal prestige produced limited influence, emerging primarily when irrelevant abstracts were paired with prestigious journals, which increased incorrect inclusion. These findings demonstrate that AI-generated cues can introduce powerful new authority biases in human-AI collaborative screening. Implications for designing and governing (AI-aided) reviewing systems to ensure accurate, unbiased decision making are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Any choice of words simultaneously conveys information about the world and, at the same time, conveys information about the speaker, revealing aspects of their social identity. In this paper, we investigate how speakers strategically modify referential language to signal group membership. Across four experiments using a minimal referential communication paradigm, we find that speakers with the explicit goal of signaling social affiliation (1) choose more concise utterances, (2) preferentially select group-specific referents and descriptions, and (3) resist the otherwise strong tendency to be understood by everyone in the audience. Standard models of referential communication that focus on the trade-off between informativity and efficiency cannot explain these patterns; we argue instead for a model where speakers trade off the referential utility of being understood against the social utility of being identified as an in-group member.",

This study examined how adolescents’ ER repertoire, maladaptive ratio, and between- and within-strategy variability were associated with negative and positive emotions, and with internalizing and externalizing symptoms.\nMethod\nUsing daily diaries (mean reports = 61.87), adolescents (N = 52; mean age = 13; 76.92% female) reported how they felt each day and how they regulated their emotions. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed before and after the diary period. We used multiple regression and multilevel modeling to analyze the data.\nResults\nThe number of strategies adolescents used mattered less than which strategies they used and how they used them. More frequent use of rumination, non-acceptance, and suppression relative to other strategies was associated with more internalizing symptoms, more negative emotions, and fewer positive emotions. Greater within-strategy variability was associated with more negative emotions and more externalizing symptoms. Specifically, greater variability in attention and suppression were associated with more negative emotions, while greater variability in rumination, distraction, and suppression were associated with externalizing symptoms. Between-strategy variability showed no significant associations.\nConclusion\nFindings highlight the importance of how adolescents apply ER strategies in daily life.

Parents reported on lying behaviour to their own children and parental control strategies. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that instrumental, but not child-oriented or parent-oriented, lying was related to higher levels of behavioural control. Our findings suggest that instrumental lying is more common in parents with a more demanding and strict parenting style.

          "authors": "Manoj Kumar Mallick",
          "abstract": "This review employs a comparative integrative methodology to redefine digital burnout. It views the condition not as a behavioural issue, but as a structural failure of attention caused by hyper-connectivity. The study synthesises Kaplan’s Attention Restoration Theory (ART) with Indian metaphysical concepts of the Trigunas (Three Modes of Nature) and Chitta (Mind-stuff). A novel taxonomy maps executive depletion to the loss of Tejas (mental fire) and Prana (vital energy). The paper proposes a three-phase model of cognitive collapse. Phase I begins with Rajasic hyper-arousal. Here, algorithmic rewards trigger dopamine loops, mimicking mental agitation of Vikshepa. Phase II marks a critical transition point. Rapid context switching drains cognitive resources, destroying Sattvic quality of clarity. Phase III terminates in Tamasic inertia. This state represents a defensive neurological shutdown. Behaviourally, this manifests as social indifference. The brain deactivates empathy to conserve scarce metabolic energy. Consequently, the review argues that abstinence-based digital detox is insufficient. It often fails to address internal mental fluctuations. Instead, recovery requires Sensory Gating (Pratyahara) to actively filter inputs. The study proposes a restorative protocol combining passive nature exposure with active meditation (Dhyana). This restores cognitive vitality, offering a robust framework for understanding the erosion of civic duty in the digital age.",

Latent class growth analyses revealed three trajectories: High-achieving, Average-achieving, and Struggling. Track placement and school prestige predicted trajectory membership, with work-bound tracking and lowered prestige increasing the likelihood of following Average-achieving and Struggling trajectories. Achievement trajectories mediated the link between tracking and Baccalaureate results. Work-bound tracks coupled with lower achievement trajectories were associated with decreased Baccalaureate performance. These findings suggest that not securing a place in prestigious schools or university-bound tracks may create barriers later for adolescents aspiring to pursue higher education.",

The vast majority of developmental psychology studies collect information from one parent about their child. The purpose of this study was to determine what, if any, parental features affect ratings of their child’s social and communicative behaviors. In a study of n=600 parents of toddlers between 22 and 36 months of age, we found substantial agreement for the total number of words produced, but lower agreement for a measure of reciprocal social behavior. Of the demographic and personality features studied, only the parent’s personality features affected both ratings, otherwise, mother and fathers and primary and secondary caregivers gave statistically equivalent ratings.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have documented that overshadowing weakens when a CS-US trace is inserted, and we have interpreted such effect in terms of differential generalization in trace versus delay procedures, but direct evidence in humans is lacking. Two online experiments investigated whether the weakening of cue-outcome temporal contiguity impacts generalization gradients. Participants experienced strong temporal contiguity (the offset of a cue coincides with the onset an outcome) or weak temporal contiguity (there is a temporal gap between the offset of a cue and the onset of an outcome) in a continuous predictive learning task. Initial training involved a double negative discrimination, in which there was one reinforced cue (aqua-color rectangle) and two non-reinforced cues (one greener and one bluer than the reinforced cue), and participants had to make a response whenever they predicted the outcome. After training, in the generalization test phase, outcome expectancy in presence of several stimuli along the full green-blue dimension was tested. Outcome expectancy was assessed with discrete ratings in Experiment 1 (n=252) and a behavioral dependent measure (button presses, similar to the training phase) in Experiment 2 (n=250). Regardless the type of measure, when participants experienced weak cue-outcome temporal contiguity showed a broader generalization response, although differences were more prominent in the green side of the color dimension. Furthermore, no significant differences emerged between two groups experiencing strong temporal contiguity but differing in cue duration (controlling stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA), suggesting that cue-outcome temporal contiguity plays a more critical role than cue duration in shaping generalization. Overall, this result advances our understanding of the role of temporal contiguity at a basic level, while opening the possibility to study it as a critical factor in more applied settings.",

Because orientation in time is intimately related to autobiographical episodic memory, most amnesic patients suffer from temporal disorientation. Patients with severe anterograde amnesia have been described as \"stuck in time\"; their mental time travel abilities are altered, and they seem to live in the present. Here, we look at the very special situation of complete temporal disorientation, to the point where the patient seems to have no sense of the passage of time. A famous case illustrating this phenomenon was that of Clive Wearing who repeatedly wrote “I am now awake” in his diary, showing his recurrent belief that he had just awakened from an unconscious state. This unique cognitive phenomenon has not been specifically studied. We report cases involving three patients who described similar experiences. All three patients suffer from autoimmune encephalitis and show massive bilateral hippocampal inflammation causing severe anterograde amnesia. We propose to call this phenomenon “Stream of Consciousness Impairment”, a reference to William James’s theory according to which, normally, there is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness. This condition could be added to the spectrum of neurological disorders that contribute to the study of consciousness in humans.",

          "abstract": "Evidence suggests that impulsivity is characterised by impairments in attentional control, which is required to regulate negative emotions such as stress. Given that elevated stress levels can impair attentional control even further, it was predicted that trait impulsivity and stress would interact. Whereby high stress levels would amplify the impairment in attentional control in high impulsive individuals, who are less able to regulate this stress. To test this, the levels of attentional capture and unintentional mind-wandering were assessed at different levels of stress and impulsivity. Unexpectedly, however, across 3 Studies (N = 108; 290; 157) there was no evidence supporting this amplification hypothesis. The findings revealed that stress and impulsivity were related to attenuated processing of target-matching external distractors, consistent with inattention (Study 1 &amp; 3); and though they did significantly interact in Study 1, this was more reflective of the trait-impulsivity obscuring the additional influence of high stress on attention. Further, stress and impulsivity also independently predicted elevated unintentional mind-wandering without interacting, both when self-reported (Study 2) and assessed during the attentional capture task (Study 3). The unexpected lack of interaction across multiple measures is discussed, and implications of the independent effects for existing models considered.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of the present review is to consider and integrate research that has examined the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH) in the contextual regulation of both Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors. To do so, we selectively review research that has examined the role of the VH in the extinction and renewal of Pavlovian fear conditioning, along with research exploring how the VH contributes to the learning and performance of appetitive instrumental responding. We emphasize that “contexts” can function in several ways to control behavior. Our review suggests that, across both paradigms, the VH contributes to at least two forms of contextual regulation. In the first, the VH appears to contribute to the contextual retrieval of both Pavlovian and instrumental learning. In the second, the VH regulates the impact of associations between the context and the unconditioned stimulus or reinforcing outcome on either Pavlovian or instrumental performance. Evidence across paradigms further indicates that these context effects depend on interactions between the VH and medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting a shared hippocampal-prefrontal circuit that supports contextual control. We also consider how these functions relate to broader hippocampal organization, drawing on evidence that while the dorsal hippocampus preferentially encodes discrete spatial information, the VH may be especially important for integrating salient contextual information across experience, particularly under conditions of ambiguity. Together, the evidence suggests that the VH plays a common and essential role in enabling contextual information to guide both Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors.",

Robust alternatives like robust linear regression do not hinge on assumptions like normally distributed errors with equal variances or the inconsequentiality of extreme values and outliers. Tests with these broad robustness features act agains nonreplication that occurs solely because data anomalies arise differently across studies. Using them from the outset sidesteps the pitfalls of making a data-based decision about whether a standard test is applicable. The common practice of conducting them in addition, commonly in response to data inspection, yields multiple test results. I argue that these should be avoided when a binary decision must be reached, for example, conducting further research on the basis on the assumption that an effect exists. Practically, using a single test simplifies analysis. While R offers numerous robust methods, the ones that provide broad robustness are largely restricted to linear models.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objective. The network approach to psychopathology views mental disorders as dynamic interactions between symptoms, challenging traditional latent-cause models. We applied this approach to individuals with PTSD, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to build personalized contemporaneous and directed symptom networks. Our primary aim was to assess whether these network-derived formulations aligned with clinician-generated cognitive formulations. We also tested whether cognitive variables predicted affective variables over time, consistent with the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of PTSD. \nMethod. Five participants completed 14-21 days of EMA (response rate=90.2+5.48%), yielding 348 observations total. Items were tailored to each patient’s lived experience and mapped to Ehlers and Clark components. Written formulations from patients and clinicians were compared to EMA-based networks generated by three network algorithms.\nResults. Network-derived formulations shared some features with patient and clinician-derived formulations but often diverged in complexity and specific predictions. Data-driven networks had good precision (0.64-0.86) but low sensitivity (0.31-0.35), showing better agreement with patient self-formulations than with clinician models. Evidence for lead-lag effects between cognitive and affective variables was limited. Trauma memory emerged as the most central component, with its association to sense of current threat and matching triggers being the most prominent. \nConclusion. Network analysis may refine clinical hypotheses but has limitations in replicating comprehensive formulations. Instead, we recommend its use for clinical hypothesis testing of specific predictions. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to test its clinical utility and contribution to treatment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Identifying shared and distinct profiles, whether in symptom combinations, personality traits, or cognitive abilities, is essential for understanding psychological phenomena, yet doing so requires navigating interrelated theoretical, conceptual, and technical complexities. First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Evaluating and, if necessary, revising factor-analytic latent measurement models is a challenging task. By now, researchers can select from a toolbox of traditional and novel methods to evaluate global and local model fit. However, this toolbox lacks a method to evaluate model fit at an intermediate level facilitating a thoughtful revision process. In this study, we fill this gap with a machine learning (ML) approach to model fit evaluation. Specifically, we introduce an ML pipeline to classify the type and severity of misspecifications in multi-factorial measurement models. To build this pipeline, we trained three ML models that predict a) if the measurement model is correctly specified or if a latent factor, cross-loadings, factor correlations, or residual correlations have been neglected, b) if any, how many cross-loadings have been neglected, and c) if any, how many residual correlations have been neglected. All three ML models performed well overall, with performance drops mainly resulting from misclassifications by ± 1 cross-loading and ± 1–2 residual correlations, respectively. Consequently, the feedback of the ML pipeline must not be implemented in an exact manner. Instead, it points the user to the most likely source of misfit and indicates if the measurement model is not, mildly, moderately, or severely misspecified. This information provides helpful guidance in deciding if and how to revise the measurement model, the measurement instrument, or its underlying theory. We provide an open-access R implementation of the ML pipeline, discuss how to use it within a multi-method approach, and make recommendations on how to use its feedback for the next revision steps.",

We concluded a successful replication of all three studies, with support for their findings showing that: 1) people who are more willing to be organ donors are more likely to hold views that others should as well, and to think that enrollment should be the default, and that in turn: 2) people make inferences from policymaker’s set defaults (Study 2: organ donations; Study 3: retirement plans) regarding the policymakers’ own preferences regarding enrollment, and their views regarding whether others should enroll. In our extension we added a control condition with no defaults, finding that 1) people still make inferences about choice architects’ attitudes, even when defaults were not set, and 2) that setting defaults to not act (not enroll) is perceived as closer to no defaults than setting defaults to act (to enroll).

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, the ability to adapt behavior based on feedback is a crucial skill. Although this process is assumed to decline with age, initial evidence suggests that emotional information processing may help buffer against these age-related impairments. We therefore conducted a probabilistic learning task with emotional faces in two varying emotional intensities (weak vs. strong) to investigate whether healthy younger and older adults would benefit from strong emotional feedback during learning and whether these processes are reflected in feedback-related event related potentials (ERPs). N = 26 younger adults (mean age = 22.6, SD = 2.67 years) and n = 23 older adults (mean age = 71.9, SD = 3.60 years) took part in our study. Behavioral results showed that both age groups showed improved learning over time, but older adults particularly benefited from strong emotional feedback. ERPs revealed that the detection of unexpected events, reflected in the peak-to-peak FRN, was generally enhanced in older as compared to younger adults, possibly due to a generally enhanced motivational significance of socio-emotional stimuli. However, we could not find an effect of feedback condition for neither group. Moreover, working memory updating, reflected in the P3b, was modulated by emotional intensity in older adults, showing increased updating after strong emotional negative feedback, whereas younger adults did not use strong emotional, but rather negative feedback to update their working memory.",

Yet a unified computational account explaining how these processes jointly shape eye movements and comprehension has remained elusive. Here we show that human reading behavior emerges from a resource-rational control mechanism in which readers allocate fixations to maximize expected gains in understanding while minimizing effort and time. We develop a hierarchical control model that formalizes reading as sequential information sampling under limited visual and memory resources. Implemented as a multi-level partially observable Markov decision process trained with deep reinforcement learning, the model links high-level comprehension with low-level eye-movement control within a single optimization framework. Across independent datasets and a new experiment involving time pressure, the model reproduces canonical behavioral patterns—including effects of word length, frequency, predictability, skipping, regressions, and coherence—while capturing adaptive changes in gaze and comprehension. These findings demonstrate that many canonical properties of reading arise from boundedly optimal information gathering and support a computationally unified account in which memory, perception, and control interact to guide intelligent behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience faces a measurement problem: core features of the human mind cannot be directly observed in the brain. For example, intentions are efficacious in behavior generation yet cannot be reduced to the sub-personal quantities of neural activity without losing their purpose-driven, normative character. This instrumental limitation is fundamental yet remains insufficiently recognized. To bring this issue to the forefront and reorient the field toward a solution, this brief commentary argues that theories of the mind-brain relation must meet the “Participation Criterion”: they must specify what measurable difference the presence of mental efficacy produces compared to its absence. When the Participation Criterion is accepted alongside the measurement problem, a feasible solution arises: the dynamical relevance of unobservable mental efficacy may manifest indirectly as increased unpredictability of observable brain activity, quantifiable via information-theoretic entropy. The concept of “irruption” is introduced to specifically formalize this efficacy-derived part of unexplained variability, thereby reframing context-dependent “noise” in the brain as a key signature of the intentional mind at work. The theoretical proposal offers new avenues for research in cognitive science and clinical interventions.",

Compared to those without likely general PD, participants with likely general PD endorsed more polysubstance use. Conversely, ASPD-specific personality functioning was linked to higher rates of methamphetamine, alcohol, and sedative use disorders, and polysubstance use. Elevated early maladaptive schemas (e.g., 53% endorsing insufficient self-control) and antisocial attitudes were endorsed across the sample. Over half (59%) reported a prior arrest, with 23% reporting ten or more arrests. Findings highlight the relationship between personality functioning and SUD, as well as the high prevalence of psychological and behavioural complexities endorsed by youth accessing residential SUD treatment. Conclusions: Implications include the need for routine personality screening, potential benefit of schema-focused treatment, and interventions targeting antisocial cognition and behaviour alongside SUD treatment for this population. Embedding such interventions may improve engagement, reduce relapse and offending, and provide a developmentally informed pathway to improve outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Two studies test an alternative to the traditional perspective of Inhibition of Return (IOR), the notion that the reorientation of attention to a previously attended location is inhibited. The proposed Attention-Related Inhibition (ARI) Model links this effect with inhibition that is necessary for executive attention. Study 1 demonstrated that ARI provides a benefit only when responses require discrimination, but not when simple detection is involved. In Study 2, the benefit for ARI emerged more quickly with predictive cues than with nonpredictive cues. Together, these findings provide preliminary support for the ARI model, demonstrating that 1) inhibition reflects the presence, not the absence of attention, and that 2) the benefits of ARI are related to slow, purposeful processing, and not rapid, automatic reactions.",

          "abstract": "Operational definitions have long been a core approach to measuring and relating observed data to theoretical constructs in psychological science. However, many contemporary modeling approaches violate basic assumptions of operational definitions and operationalism more generally -- foregoing assumptions about objectivity, repeatability, independence, and fixed elicitation procedures. Counterintuitively, these departures imbue model-based definitions of constructs with superior measurement properties, such as improved reliability and validity, when compared to their operational counterparts. Instead of relying on operational definitions of constructs, we instead suggest that psychology can adapt relational definitions, representing constructs as latent variables in a multilevel generative model of behavior, self-report, or neuroimaging data. These model-based metrics can better reflect measurement error at multiple levels, account for the interactions between measurement devices (tasks, scales) and measurement objects (participants, processes), provide a holistic account of latent constructs and how they manifest across different measurements, facilitate convergence or discrimination tests among different tasks seeking to measure the same construct, and improve scientific communication by clarifying core psychological concepts. Relational definitions of important constructs should naturally emerge as we apply models more regularly, and these definitions and models will improve as we discover mathematical approaches that are suited to describing psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Oral nicotine pouches are rapidly proliferating in the market. While pouches may be a harm reduction option, these products may appeal to adolescents and may elicit greater nicotine exposure. Behavioral economics provides a framework for studying the reinforcing value of these products; however, there are no validated measures for assessing demand for nicotine pouches.\nAims and Methods: This study evaluated behavioral economic purchase tasks for nicotine pouches. Crowdsourced data were collected from 228 adult pouch consumers (40% women; age, M(SD)=31.1(11.9); past-month pouch use, M(SD)= 15.4(8.1) days; Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence-Smokeless Tobacco Version, M(SD)=4.7(2.4). Participants completed two hypothetical purchase tasks with the products available as individual pouches (free—$5/pouch) or tins containing 20 pouches each (free—$100/tin). \nResults: Task responding was prototypical with a similar percentage of nonsystematic data across versions. Participants consumed approximately 35 tins or 73 pouches when products were free (intensity), spent a total of $206 on tins or $43 on pouches (Omax), and had a breakpoint of $4/pouch or $56/tin. Observed and derived metrics exhibited expected within-task intercorrelations. Demand for tins was significantly correlated with dependence (rs =.29-46, ps&lt;.005), while correlations for pouches were less consistent. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study provides initial validation of two versions of nicotine pouch purchase tasks. Data preliminarily indicate that a tins version may be more sensitive to dependence severity. In contrast, the pouch version may be important for studies of state-based influences on demand.",

The present study tests the capacity of cognitive models to assess latent motives in real-time by evaluating different deep neural networks trained to infer a human player's intent during a continuous control task. These networks were trained by (a) directly using observable information or (b) selecting important features by estimating the parameters of a generative model of movement behavior inspired by approach-avoidance theory. Comparisons of classifier accuracy suggest that latent model parameters predict a participant's intent at a level exceeding human performance. Furthermore, classifier performance was best when model-based inferences were combined with summary statistics about behavior, yielding faster and more stable network training compared to networks that had no manual feature extraction. Equipping AI with cognitive models is a promising avenue for developing explainable, accurate, and trustworthy systems.",

Evidence on the sources of and remedies for this trust deficit is scarce and rarely tailored to political science. Using a representative survey of the Czech public (N = 1,530) and a parallel survey of Czech political scientists (N = 113), we examine the levels and sources of trust in the discipline from the perspectives of both the public and experts. Overall, trust is moderate and distrust is strongest among older, lower-income, and anti-Western respondents. Trust, however, is only weakly associated with ideology and perceptions of bias. In an embedded experiment, we show that open-science practices and methodological rigor significantly increase the perceived trustworthiness of political science research. Our findings underscore the need to build perceptions of competence, rigor, and transparency, and suggest that ideological bias may be a less central driver of distrust.",

          "abstract": "Stigmatised groups tend to suffer worse mental health. One problem faced by members of stigmatised groups is self-stigma, the internalisation of negative stereotypes. Research has shown that increased empowerment and a positive group identity can reduce self-stigma and its consequences. Research on the mental health consequences of collective action, or activism, suggests that participation in activism can improve wellbeing by providing empowerment and social identification. No review to date has looked specifically at the wellbeing effects of activism for stigmatised groups. A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted which sought to identify the consequences of participation in activism for the mental health of individuals facing stigma on the basis of race, sexuality, gender, and health status. The literature search identified 36 articles: 24 quantitative, 10 qualitative, and one using mixed methods. A convergent integrated approach was utilised and eight synthesised themes were generated covering direct associations, buffering and exacerbating effects, positive and negative mechanisms, and moderating factors. The most commonly reported beneficial effects of activism were enhanced empowerment, wellbeing, and buffering against the impact of discrimination. The most commonly reported detrimental effects of activism were burnout and increased depression. A number of promising directions for future research are identified.",

          "abstract": "Assent is an individual’s agreement to participate in educational and clinical interventions. Some practitioners have argued opportunities for assent (and dissent) should be presented and reinforced with all individuals across all contexts, irrespective of circumstance or benefit. Yet as verbal behavior, assent is constrained by contingencies of reinforcement and the individual’s ability to appraise benefits and risks of a treatment decision, or capacity. Some opportunities for assent may be necessary and beneficial for the individual, whereas others may conflict with their learning goals, the preferences of their caregivers, and the ethical obligations of professionals who support them. We are concerned a newly proposed approach, “assent-based ABA,” departs from a humanistic, behavior-analytic account of assent, diminishing therapeutic learning opportunities. In this paper, we examine assent in ABA programming, addressing issues of capacity, assent and dissent, autonomy and the best interest standard, voluntariness versus coercion, and social validity. We outline our concerns with “assent-based ABA” and conclude with practical considerations for assent in ABA programming.",

This article reviews key models of empathy, focusing on three core components and their neural bases. One central aspect is shared neural representations, i.e., similar brain activation during one’s own emotional experiences and while empathizing. In BPD, this is marked by hyperactivation of the amygdala and insula, indicating heightened affective resonance. Second, cognitive regulation mechanisms are central but impaired in BPD. The third component, self-other distinction, which is supported by the temporo-parietal junction, also shows altered activity patterns in BPD. Research in this field is hindered by conceptual and methodological inconsistencies and by the heterogeneity of BPD, underscoring the need for clearer theoretical frameworks and stronger interdisciplinary integration with clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "The ‘attraction effect’ or ‘asymmetric dominance effect’ is a widely studied phenomenon in decision-making, challenging the principle of regularity in rational choice theory. It posits that the introduction of a third option, similar but inferior to one of the available options in a binary choice set, increases the choice share of the dominating option. While the standard attraction effect is pervasive, recent studies have found inconsistent results. Some researchers attribute these inconsistencies to boundary conditions that constrain the effect, suggesting that studies failing to meet these criteria unsurprisingly report inconsistent effects. This paper aims to clarify the presence, strength, and direction of the attraction effect through two approaches: first, by analyzing contemporary metrics for measuring context effects and demonstrating their susceptibility to false positives and negatives; and second, by examining the boundary condition of strong prior trade-off—a biased preference for one choice in the baseline set—and its impact on metric vulnerability.",

The reported action set for a given user is moderately stable over time. Users reported easily repeatable actions most frequently, such as walking or turning off lights, which tend to have modest impacts on greenhouse gas emissions. We found no strong evidence linking the frequency of reported actions to the users' annual self-reported carbon footprints, except in the food domain, or psychological factors such as climate concern. Although apps facilitate the large-scale monitoring of climate actions, challenges remain in evaluating their effectiveness in behavioural change studies.

          "abstract": "Structural brain plasticity has traditionally been viewed as a gradual process developing over days to weeks of training or experience. Recent neuroimaging evidence, however, demonstrates that measurable micro- and macrostructural changes can occur within hours of behavioral or physiological manipulation, a phenomenon referred to as rapid structural plasticity. This systematic review synthesizes evidence for such short-interval (&lt;2 h) structural alterations across magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities in humans. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria, assessing diffusion-weighted imaging (DW-MRI) and T1-weighted MRI measures including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness (CT). Interventions included motor and spatial learning, perceptual and language training, stress, exercise, and pharmacological challenges. Across paradigms, DW-MRI studies consistently reported rapid decreases in mean diffusivity within task-relevant regions such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, and primary motor cortex. Similarly, studies using T1W-MRI revealed short-term increases in CT or gray matter volume (GMV), typically within one hour. However, the duration of tasks and timing of post-learning imaging varied across studies, complicating direct comparisons. Research combining perfusion-sensitive measures, including arterial spin labeling (ASL) and functional MRI (fMRI), further indicated that some apparent GMV changes may reflect transient shifts in cerebral blood flow or extracellular fluid. Together, these findings suggest that rapid, region-specific structural modulations can occur within hours of experience. Future research combining multimodal MRI, dense temporal sampling, and physiological control measures will be essential to disentangle genuine structural plasticity from transient hemodynamic, fluid or metabolic effects, thereby refining the temporal and mechanistic characterization of rapid brain plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Many scientific theories predict not just whether an effect exists, but also how multiple parameters relate—for example, that one mean exceeds another or that several effects follow a specific order. Such expectations can be formulated as directional hypotheses with equality and order constraints. Yet, researchers often test these indirectly through post-hoc analyses of individual parameters, which (1) provide only indirect evidence for the theory, (2) require multiplicity corrections that lower power, and (3) can lead to selective emphasis on statistically significant results. The goal of the current tutorial paper is two-fold. First, it introduces the BFpack module in JASP for testing directional hypotheses in a direct manner using Bayes factors. BFpack offers default Bayesian procedures for common designs—$t$ tests, (M)AN(C)OVA, regression, and multi-group correlations—without the need for manual prior specification. By evaluating theory-based hypotheses jointly, the method avoids multiplicity, increases power, and discourages selective reporting.\nThrough three worked examples, we demonstrate how BFpack simplifies directional hypothesis testing in practice and helps researchers move beyond traditional post-hoc testing toward theory-driven inference.",

We concentrate on fine-grained differences in the marking of three focus types (broad, narrow, and corrective). Thus, we examine effects of prosodic strengthening between pitch-accented words with varying degrees of prominence, rather than comparing focused/accented to unfocused/unaccented words. The results indicate that even within this subtle range of prominence degrees, speakers adjust parameters of the labial and lingual subsystems when articulating /ɑ/. Bayesian regression provides strong evidence for differences across focus types, most consistent between broad and corrective focus, while narrow focus generally falls in between the two conditions (and tends toward corrective focus). Directly comparing corrective to broad focus, we find an increase in magnitudes of displacement and higher peak velocities in the vertical (high-low) and horizontal (front-back) movement dimensions of the tongue body, as well as the lip aperture. In addition, the vertical dimension of the tongue and the lip aperture show longer movement durations. Only the lip aperture has longer time-to-peak-velocity intervals. We interpret the findings through the lens of the gestural model of Articulatory Phonology by explaining movement differences as arising from changes in the dynamical parameters of the gestures.",

The present study investigates whether social attunement (SA) plays a role in higher alcohol use in adolescence as well as a lower alcohol use when aging. \nMethods: This online study included an international sample of 683 alcohol users (16 – 81yrs). Participants completed a SA Questionnaire, an Implicit SA task (ISAT), and measures of alcohol use. The ISAT measured SA as the change in willingness to drink in response to peer feedback between two blocks of images representing social alcohol, social non-alcohol, and social non-drinking settings. Linear regressions were conducted to assess the association between SA and alcohol use, and the role of age and gender in these associations. \nResults: Unlike expected, interactions between age and SA did not predict alcohol use across social situations regardless of feedback condition. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses using the total SA score per social condition showed significant interactions between age and SA in predicting alcohol use in social situations involving non-alcoholic or no drinks. In social non-alcohol drinking settings, SA was positively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became negative in older individuals. Contrastingly, in the social non-drinking condition, SA was negatively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became positive in older individuals.\nDiscussion: Depending on age and social setting, SA can both be a risk- or protective factor for alcohol use.",

Emerging evidence suggests that caregivers’ use of CDS-like features when reading to their child, known as caregiver oral reading prosody, plays an important role in supporting preschoolers’ storybook comprehension. Do associations between caregiver oral reading prosody and preschoolers’ language extend beyond real-time listening comprehension to broader language skills? Forty-one caregivers read a children’s book to their child (ages: 4–5 years) as they normally would at home. The caregivers’ oral reading prosody (i.e., intonation and timing features) was examined in relation to children’s receptive vocabulary and core language skills. Moderated mediation models then investigated possible impacts of caregiver reading skills and shared reading time on these associations. Caregiver intonation range positively related to child vocabulary and caregiver inappropriate (i.e., ungrammatical) pausing negatively related to child core language skills. Mediation models revealed that caregiver reading skills indirectly related to child language through oral reading prosody measures. Notably, the indirect effect linking caregiver reading skills to child vocabulary via caregiver intonation range was moderated by shared reading time, with the strongest effects among dyads reporting less shared reading engagement. Findings illuminate caregiver oral reading prosody as one factor linking caregiver reading skills to child language, with particular relevance among families of caregivers with reading difficulties and for those with limited shared reading opportunities.",

Trait PC has previously been shown to predict some experimental measures of changes in experience when demand characteristics are not controlled. Here, we investigated the reach of PC as a demand effect by contrasting relationships between Phenomenological Control Scale scores (PCS; a test of direct imaginative suggestion) and effects presumed to either be sensitive to beliefs (visually evoked auditory response or vEAR; tingling in the scalp or ASMR) or insensitive to beliefs (the Müller Lyer illusion; the vertical-horizontal illusion). PC accounted for much of the effect for the posited belief-sensitive effects but not for the classic visual illusions (Study 1). This pattern of results remained after controlling for context effects (Study 2) and measurement differences across procedures (Study 3). Finally, we present the first causal evidence that two established psychological effects which are predicted by PC (vEAR and ASMR) can be modulated by participants high in PC in accordance with demand characteristics delivered by direct suggestion (Study 4). PC may account for the effects of psychological experiments when an effect is sensitive to belief, but not where it is not. This presents a previously unrecognised threat to validity in psychology experiments analogous to that of placebo effects in medicine.",

Thus, it is important to investigate whether and how recovery training affects the multiple distinct recovery experiences (i.e., psychological detachment, relaxation, control, and mastery). However, typical variable-centered approaches cannot detect training effects on the co-occurrence of multiple recovery experiences. By contrast, person-centered approaches, which focus on how individuals encounter different combinations (i.e., profiles) of recovery experiences, show promise for evaluating recovery training. We used data from a randomized controlled trial (N = 393) to examine the impact of training designed to enhance recovery in everyday life by investigating (a) how the number and shapes of profiles changed, (b) whether individuals transitioned between profiles of recovery experiences, and (c) whether these transitions were associated with changes in well-being-related outcomes (i.e., sleep quality and perceived stress). Recovery profiles changed in structure from pre- to post-training, and most participants, particularly those who received training, transitioned to a profile with improved recovery experiences.

          "abstract": "Research suggests that interoception – the ability to sense internal bodily signals – plays a role in anxiety, though the specific interoceptive processes involved are unclear. Some studies suggest anxiety is linked to improved detection of bodily signals (interoceptive accuracy), while others highlight impairments in higher-order thinking about these signals (interoceptive metacognition). Here, we employed the newly developed Heart Rate Discrimination task to address how anxiety symptoms relate to interoceptive accuracy and metacognition. Participants judged whether feedback tones were faster or slower than their heart rate, with a Bayesian psychophysical staircase calculating two metrics of interoceptive accuracy: heart rate estimation and uncertainty. Using a signal detection approach, trial-by-trial confidence ratings allowed us to quantify metacognitive bias (overall confidence) and metacognitive efficiency (the accuracy-confidence relationship). We predicted that individuals with higher anxiety symptoms would demonstrate greater accuracy in their heart rate estimations (H1) yet reduced metacognitive insight (H2). Using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), we distinguished between state and trait anxiety symptoms in relation to interoceptive processing. Results revealed no significant differences in interoceptive accuracy across anxiety levels, but distinct metacognitive patterns in relation to bodily processing. Higher state anxiety was associated with greater interoceptive metacognitive efficiency, while higher trait anxiety was linked to lower confidence in these interoceptive judgements. These findings advance our understanding of cognitive models of state-trait anxiety and suggest that targeted diagnostic tools and interventions could be developed based on these distinct interoceptive metacognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "Learning how actions change the environment is crucial for goal-directed actions and skill acquisition. Here we applied a process dissociation approach to investigate the contribution of explicit and implicit memory to the learning of action-effect relations across four experiments. Participants produced object images by pressing one of two keys, with each action-effect episode experienced three times. Learning was either incidental (Experiments 1-2) or intentional (Experiments 2-4) and occurred under full (Experiments 1-4) or divided (Experiments 3-4) attention. In a test phase, participants were re-presented the effect images and asked to either reproduce or alternate the action that had produced them. Results obtained through cognitive modeling revealed that action-effect relations are primarily represented in explicit memory, with minimal contributions of implicit memory. Intentional learning enhanced memory compared to incidental learning, while divided attention during encoding reduced it, with these factors mainly affecting explicit memory. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying skill acquisition and provide insights into the representational nature of action-effect relations.",

          "abstract": "Learning can shape attention in complex and sometimes counterintuitive ways. Here we report a novel form of implicit learning in visual attention that challenges current models of experience-driven attentional control. Across seven experiments, we demonstrate that mere imbalance in visual stimulation across space - independent of task relevance, awareness and even out of the focus of attention - can induce lasting and selective enhancements in target processing. These effects can be paradoxical and stimulus specific: stimuli initially processed as distractors improve subsequent target processing at implicitly learned locations. This happens without changing attentional capture by distractors presented at the same locations. The phenomenon occurs even under passive viewing conditions and is driven solely by the unequal frequency of visual stimulation across space. Crucially, the effect is distinct from typical selection history modulations of attention, generally affecting both targets and distractors in a consistent manner, which is assumed to reflect changes at the level of priority maps of space. These results suggest that the visual system is able to learn spatial contingencies through diverse mechanisms. They show that attentional systems can encode regularities independently of attentional allocation or task relevance and exploit them in a stimulus-selective manner through a previously undocumented implicit learning mechanism. This has implications for models of selective attention, perceptual learning, habituation and statistical learning.",

          "abstract": "How are motor activities linked to their perceptual outcomes? We here test the idea that the storage and retrieval of action-effect linkages is subject to constraints of associative memory. Specifically, we argue that mutual interference between such linkages should favor the storage and retrieval of unique (one-to-one) action-effect linkages as compared to overlapping (one-to-many) action-effect linkages (uniqueness effect). Moreover, we assume that increasing the number of repetitions of action-effect episodes facilitates learning and is modulated by this uniqueness effect. In three experiments, participants first produced certain visual effects through motor activities, and were later asked to retrieve the activity that had produced a certain probed visual effect before. For the most part, retrieval performance increased with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages and with increasing number of action-effect repetitions, while repetition had a slightly larger influence with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages. We discuss these results against the backdrop of associative and episodic retrieval accounts of learning.",

To address this issue, this study examines how people make sense of their evening social media use across different life stages. Using a one-week diary combined with semi-structured interviews (N = 56; ages 14–87), data were analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Evening social media use emerged as a distinct practice during the transition between day and night, with outcomes shaped less by duration or timing than by users’ situational appraisals and emotional goals. Ambivalence was common: Routines could soothe and connect—yet also evoke obligation, time loss, or guilt—often reflecting cultural norms surrounding healthy use. Patterns varied across life stages, though age itself did not determine experience. The findings highlight evening media use as a contextual and interpretive process grounded in everyday meaning-making.",

In this study, participants provided a definition of rape before and after categorising sexual violence vignettes as either rape or not rape. In our sample (N = 312), ~3% defined rape accurately, with the most common definition of rape including most forms of genital stimulation and penetration.

          "abstract": "Background: Altered neural reward prediction error (RPE)-encoding during learning from drug reinforcers compared to non-drug rewards is at the core of learning theories of addiction. They predict higher RPE-related fronto-striatal activation when responding for alcohol-related compared to natural rewards, particularly in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, research in AUD has largely relied on paradigms that used monetary reinforcers or did not include a learning component. \nMethods: We developed an instrumental learning task (ILT) where correct choices were reinforced by alcohol or juice taste in separate blocks. Twenty-eight individuals with predominantly mild to moderate AUD and 28 healthy control participants (HC) performed the ILT during functional magnetic resonance imaging. \nResults: Alcohol taste was perceived as less pleasant and elicited less craving than juice taste across groups, and this was driven by HC. Both groups, but particularly individuals with AUD, successfully learned to respond for both reinforcer types, and individuals with AUD, but not HC, became faster over time in alcohol blocks. However, we found no differences in fronto-striatal RPE-encoding between groups and reinforcer types in the expected direction, but instead an opposite effect in superior parietal cortex.\nConclusions: While we demonstrate that instrumental learning from alcohol taste elicits RPE-correlated fronto-striatal activation in AUD and HC, our findings do not support stronger fronto-striatal RPE-encoding when learning from alcohol-related compared to natural reinforcers in individuals with AUD than HC. Future learning research in addiction should take further steps to increase ecological validity by considering the context-dependence of drug-related reinforcers’ rewarding properties.",

Results of the tested dynamic structural equation models revealed a considerable amount of bi-directional interplay in which momentary increases in narcissism were related to subsequent increases in how participants perceived situations. Furthermore, using the dynamic latent class analysis we explored how these situations are perceived during specific narcissism modes. We distinguished four types of narcissism modes: (1) non-narcissistic, (2) agentic, (3) neurotic, (4) antagonistic, and demonstrate how they differ in terms of situation perception. All narcissism modes were characterized of seeing situation as more deceptive when compared to non-narcissistic mode. We also found specific patterns of perceiving situations for each mode. These results, on the one hand support claims on the default nature of agentic, and on the other, neurotic narcissism and highlight the reactive nature of antagonistic narcissism.",

          "abstract": "Language disorders, whether following stroke, neurodegenerative disease or altered neurodevelopment, markedly impair communication and quality of life. Despite advances in behavioural and neuromodulation therapies, treatment outcomes remain modest. Attempts to modulate local excitability in single brain regions have yielded limited benefits, in part because focal stimulation induces widespread network level changes that challenge models based on local, sequential processing within specialised cortical areas.\nWe argue for a shift in neuromodulation for language, from interventions that target isolated regions to approaches that modulate distributed neural networks. To support this shift, we introduce the Interacting Language Network (ILN), a theoretical framework that integrates evidence for local functional specialisation with evidence for distributed processing. The ILN extends existing models by formalising how dynamic interaction between sensorimotor and heteromodal language circuits enables flexible communication. The ILN is grounded in evolutionary, neurobiological and clinical work showing that complex language abilities depend on the disproportionate expansion of association cortices and white matter pathways in humans, which enable long range communication between specialised regions. Converging findings from neurotypical and clinical populations, including stroke, neurodegeneration and developmental disorders, demonstrate that although specific regions make distinct contributions to language, their function depends critically on dynamic interactions, particularly between frontal and temporo-parietal areas. \nBy integrating these strands of evidence, the ILN bridges the divide between localised and distributed processing accounts and provides a translational scaffold for network-based neuromodulation. It delineates current knowledge about the architecture and interaction principles of the language network and identifies gaps that impede progress. We outline concrete avenues to advance network-based neuromodulation for language disorders. Ultimately, interventions that target interacting language networks have the potential to deliver more effective and personalised treatments for individuals with language impairment.",

In four experiments with a moving window paradigm, young adults read sentences in three masked conditions, where all letters except for three letters to the left and 12, 14, or 16 letters to the right of the fixation point were replaced with a mask, and a control condition. In Experiment 1, which explored word length span, all letters outside the window, including spaces, were replaced with Xs. In Experiments 2 and 3, which explored letter feature span, letters were replaced with Xs, but the spaces were preserved. In Experiment 4, which explored letter identity span, we substituted letters outside the window with visually similar ones. Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted on an LED monitor, while Experiments 3 and 4 were conducted on a CRT monitor. Our results showed that parafoveal letter replacement and spacing affected saccade targeting and slowed down reading rate, which was highest in word length span and lowest in letter identity span. These effects might be attributed to the leftward boundary: we found that three letters to the left of fixation are not sufficient for undisturbed reading in Russian-speaking adults.",

Drawing on the responses obtained through direct interviews with 45 experienced practitioners, we utilized thematic analysis to identify a distinctive pattern of existential attitudes shaped by long-term contemplative practice. The most common view (40%) was that consciousness persists beyond physical death, an inference often grounded in direct meditative experiences of awareness as a non-physical and enduring presence. A significant proportion (28.9%) viewed death as a natural and inevitable process to be accepted without fear or attachment, reflecting the psychological mechanism of decentering cultivated through mindfulness practices. Compared to general population data, AMs were significantly less likely to endorse materialist views of consciousness cessation (6.7% vs. 23%), suggesting that advanced contemplative training may shift existential beliefs in measurable ways. The findings suggest a nuanced and non-dogmatic approach to mortality among AMs, characterized by an openness to mystery and equanimity. This study offers novel insights into how sustained contemplative practice may fundamentally alter one's relationship with death, with implications for psychology, spiritual care, and consciousness studies.",

For easier learning, recognition, and recall, Icono links related words to one another. In English, for example, “eye”, “sight”, “vision”, and “perspective” look unrelated. In Icono, they all share an eye icon. As another example, “bitterness” combines the words for “taste” (a tongue sticking out of a mouth) and “poison” (a flask featuring a skull); “however” (which introduces a contrasting statement) combines “language” (a speech blurb) and “contrast” (a half-light, half-dark sun). I have previously argued that hieroglyphs evolved into letters to accommodate writers at the expense of readers. Yet, people typically read much more than they write, and—using modern technology—today’s icons can be written faster than their alphabetic equivalents can be spelled.

To achieve this, we employed the Heart Rate Discrimination task (two-alternative forced choice task requiring comparing of perceived heartrate to a subsequent series of auditory beeps), and psychometric survey of PLEs, mystical experiences and interoception in a counterbalanced within-subject intervention study. 26 participants were assigned to practice a meditation with high or low body focus for two weeks at home using audio guidance. We did not find any significant differences between the low vs high body focused technique intervention for task-based or questionnaire measures for interoception, PLEs or mystical experiences. Further analysis suggested that on the group level, participants’ trial-wise responses were only influenced by the auditory external cue and not their heart rate.  This suggests that heart rate perception at rest is very difficult for participants, even after undergoing a body-focused meditation training.

Only a few studies have differentiated between the body parts and the amount of physical activity associated with a word (i.e., actionality) when investigating action language in PD. Additionally, an engaging lifestyle contributing to higher Cognitive Reserve (CR) may mitigate cognitive decline in PD, but its impact on action language impairments is unclear. This study aimed to investigate upper-limb action-word finding abilities in individuals with and without PD, considering word actionality and the impact of CR. Forty native-British speakers with idiopathic PD and forty matched older adults without PD participated. Action-word finding was assessed via picture-naming and verbal fluency tasks. Upper-limb motor ability was assessed through a keyboard-tapping task. CR was measured through years of education, occupational attainment, and questionnaires concerning the frequency of engagement in cognitive, leisure, and physical activities. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that in both groups, participants with better motor ability named pictures faster. Multiple linear regression revealed a similar relationship between motor ability and the number of generated words on the verbal fluency task. Thus, across both groups, motor ability predicted faster naming and greater fluency, suggesting shared neuronal motor–language circuitry. No reliable PD-specific deficit for upper-limb action words was observed under medication and current task demands. CR showed minimal influence, with only a weak effect on picture naming accuracy. The relationship between motor and action word-finding abilities is discussed.",

Traditionally, these early perceptual changes are attributed to an emerging knowledge of linguistic categories such as phonemes or words. However, there is growing skepticism surrounding this interpretation due to limited evidence of category knowledge in infants. Previous modeling work has shown that a distributional learning algorithm could reproduce perceptual changes in infants’ early phonetic learning without acquiring phonetic categories. Taking this inquiry further, we propose that linguistic categories may not be needed for early word learning. We introduce STELA, a predictive coding algorithm designed to extract statistical patterns from continuous raw speech data. Our findings demonstrate that STELA can reproduce some developmental patterns of phonetic and word form learning without relying on linguistic categories such as phonemes or words nor requiring explicit word segmentation. Through an analysis of the learned representations, we show evidence that linguistic categories may emerge as an end product of learning rather than being prerequisites during early language acquisition.",

First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "The impacts of poverty and material scarcity on human decision making appear paradoxical. One set of findings associates poverty with risk aversion, whilst another set associates it with risk taking. We present an idealized general model, the ‘desperation threshold model’ (DTM), that explains how both these accounts can be correct. The DTM assumes a utility function with two features: a threshold or ‘cliff’, a point where utility declines steeply with a small loss of resources because basic needs can no longer be met; and a ‘rock bottom’, a point where utility is not made any worse by further loss of resources because basic needs are not being met anyway. Just above the threshold, people’s main concern is not falling below, and they are predicted to avoid risk. Below the threshold, they have little left to lose, their most important concern is jumping above, and they are predicted to take risks that would otherwise be avoided. Versions of the DTM have been proposed under various names across biology, anthropology, economics and psychology. We review a broad range of relevant empirical evidence from a variety of societal contexts. Though the model primarily concerns individual decision making, it connects to a range of population-scale and societal issues such as: the consequences of economic inequality; the deterrence of crime; and the optimal design and behavioural consequences of the welfare state. We discuss a number of interpretative issues and offer an agenda for future DTM research that bridges disciplines.",

          "abstract": "Understanding human decision-making under risk and uncertainty is a central challenge in cog-nitive science, behavioral economics, and artificial intelligence. While most prior research hasexamined choices between lotteries described numerically, real-world decisions are often com-municated through natural language, and people do not necessarily react to verbal descriptionsin the same way they do to numeric ones.This work introducesTextualChoices-1K, a corpus of 1,000 one-shot binary choice tasksdescribed in natural language. The dataset enables two complementary lines of analysis. First,a behavioral investigation shows that some well-documented regularities, such as risk aversion ingains and risk seeking in losses, are preserved under verbal framing, whereas other phenomena,including loss aversion and reflection effects with rare events, appear weaker or inconsistent.Sentiment analysis further reveals that linguistic framing strongly predicts choice: participantssystematically preferred positively worded options, and differences in sentiment scores explainedsubstantial variance in behavior.Second, we evaluate multiple computational approaches, including fine-tuning large languagemodels (LLMs), leveraging embedding vectors, and integrating behavioral theories of choiceunder risk. Results indicate that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, outperform both hy-brid approaches and behavioral-theory-based models when applied to verbal tasks, challengingmethods developed for numerical settings. However, we also find that hybrid models combiningmachine learning and behavioral theory remain superior in predicting choice between numericlotteries.Together, these findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs as modelsof human choice. Whereas theory-based models remain essential for structured numeric tasks,data-driven language models excel in naturalistic verbal settings. The thesis concludes with im-plications for cognitive modeling, the role of language in shaping decision-making, and directionsfor hybrid approaches that integrate theory and modern AI",

This study examined diversity in terminology preferences, in part through clustering, in a United States sample of 3181 non-autistic parents and 2098 autistic people (including 451 autistic parents of autistic children). The study also examined a particularly wide range of language issues: participants rated terms for autism, subgroups within autism, autistic people, autism likelihood, and autistic characteristics. Terminology ratings differed between non-autistic parents, autistic parents, and autistic non-parents, but these differences were generally modest. Clusters revealed greater variability. Almost half of both autistic and non-autistic participants were grouped in the Open Cluster, characterised by liking or neutrality towards most terms. Others, especially among autistic participants, were grouped in the Identity-First Cluster, characterised by support for identity-first language, strong opposition to terms for autism subgroups, and rejection of many pathologising terms. Still others, including many non-autistic but also many autistic participants, were in the Person-First Cluster, characterised by support for person-first language, yet still some skepticism towards autism subgroup terms. These results suggest that there is presently no consensus regarding autism terminology preferences in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Romantic partners’ emotions are interdependent, yet it remains unclear whether their emotion regulation behaviours also influence each other over time. This study investigated bidirectional associations between intrinsic emotion regulation (regulating one’s own emotions) and extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating a partner’s emotions) in 387 heterosexual couples assessed across seven waves over two years from August 2021 to August 2023 (1,699 observations). At each wave, both partners reported their use of six pairs of intrinsic-extrinsic strategies: expressive suppression, humor, reappraisal, distraction, direct action, and sharing. Couples showed limited temporal influence on each other (within-dyad effects), but robust trait level associations of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation (between-dyad effects). Individuals tended to use similar strategies to regulate their own and their partner’s emotions. Partner effects varied by strategy: Men who used more humor to regulate their emotions received less humor from women whereas men who used more distraction to regulate their emotions received more distraction from women. Direct action and sharing showed bidirectional partner effects. Men’s use of direct action to regulate their emotions predicted (and was predicted by) less direct action received from women. Men’s use of sharing to regulate their own emotions predicted (and was predicted by) more sharing received from women. Overall, our findings support that emotion regulation in romantic relationships is inherently interpersonal, with interdependence operating primarily through stable trait-level patterns rather than temporal influences. Generalizability is limited by the relatively homogeneous sample (predominantly Caucasian, English-speaking, and highly educated).",

In this study, we propose a model for simultaneously estimating the relationships between RT and item discrimination at the person, item, and person-by-item (residual) levels and illustrate our approach through an item-level meta-analysis of 40 empirical datasets comprising 1.84 million item responses. We find no evidence of average differences in item discrimination between items of different time intensity or persons of different average RT, while residual RT strongly and negatively predicts item discrimination (pooled coef. = -.27% per 1% difference in RT, SE = .04, \\tau = .17). While heterogeneity is high, we find little evidence of moderation by overall dataset characteristics. Flexible generalized additive models show that the relationship between residual RT and item discrimination is generally curvilinear, with discrimination maximized just below average RT and minimized at the extremes. Our results suggest that RT data can provide insights into the measurement properties of educational and psychological assessments, but that the relationships between RT and item discrimination are highly variable.",

Although traditionally assumed to reflect a unified automaticity process, their relationship remains largely untested. Using a novel dual-task paradigm designed to jointly capture motor automaticity and habit formation, and three generalization datasets, we found a counterintuitive inverse relationship: individuals with greater motor automaticity showed reduced habit expression. Additionally, we provide a window into habit consolidation, showing that motor automaticity during habitual errors is preserved after extensive training but disrupted after limited training. Our findings dissociate execution from selection automaticity, challenging prevailing assumptions in neurocognitive accounts of learning. They revise our understanding of how practice shapes behavior, with critical implications for distinguishing adaptive skill from maladaptive rigidity in healthy and clinical populations.",

In a three-wave longitudinal study, 469 diverse undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution repeatedly forecasted how pleasant they expected aggression to feel, perpetrated an aggressive act, and then reported how pleasant it felt. Longitudinal growth in both forecasted and felt aggressive pleasure over time was positively correlated with corresponding growth in aggressive behavior. Further, the better that aggression felt on one wave, the more aggressive participants were on the next. Suggesting that these effects contribute to broader patterns of aggressive tendencies, dispositionally-aggressive participants forecasted and felt more aggressive pleasure over time. Forecasts of aggressive pleasure were broadly inaccurate, though this inaccuracy had few implications for aggression. These results highlight the complex ways that forecasted and felt positive affect reinforce aggression over time.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing interest in psychological tasks that closely correspond to specific neural computations for studying brain-behavior associations across development and in disease. The psychometric properties of such tasks, particularly their reliability, are critical when designing correlational research in longitudinal, clinical, or other studies. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) is a widely used paradigm for assessing the ability to discriminate between similar memory representations. Given its reliance on hippocampal pattern separation, the MST has been increasingly employed as an index of hippocampal function in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Here, we evaluate the reliability of the Lure Discrimination Index–the most common performance metric of the MST–to determine its suitability for these research contexts. First, in a sample of 96 younger (20–31 years) and 109 older (66–83 years) participants, we estimate the consistency reliability of the MST using permutation-based methods. Our findings indicate that while consistency reliability estimates range from moderate to high, they are contingent on sample heterogeneity, and the resulting effect size attenuation is dependent on the study context. Second, using a subsample of 49 participants (13 younger and 36 older adults) who completed the MST twice with a one-year interval, we calculated the absolute agreement reliability with intraclass correlations. We found low to moderate stability of individual scores over time and tentative evidence for the presence of practice effects in the younger sample. We discuss the implications for correlational research and studies where score stability is important. Further, we provide tools to inform future research design.",

We included peer-reviewed, empirical studies of transformer-based LLMs used to deliver, augment, or analyze mental health support. We extracted data on sample composition, study design, the adoption of responsible evaluation practices, and model and dataset choices.\n\nWe identified 132 studies. Of 36 client-facing studies with human participants, most were small (median n = 42), uncontrolled (26/36), and recruited participants without a diagnosed mental disorder (35/36) using user experience metrics (23/36) rather than clinical outcomes (12/36). Responsible evaluation practices were generally not implemented, including safety protocols for risk detection (18%) and potentially harmful content (16%); real-world implementation was rarely addressed (7%). Across the two highest-quality controlled clinical studies, effect sizes ranged from d = .44 to .90 in symptom reduction.\n\nThis gap between widespread public adoption and the limited evidence base stresses the need for robust methodological standards, including rigorous clinical trials, a focus on safety and implementation, and standardized, clinically meaningful benchmarks.

          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) - the experience of controlling one’s actions and, through them, events in the external world - is a cornerstone of cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy, underpinning autonomy and responsibility. Yet research on SoA has overwhelmingly focused on Outcome-level Agency (control over external effects) and, to a lesser extent, Action-level Agency (control over bodily movements). A third and more foundational dimension - Decision-level Agency, defined as the experience of initiating one’s own decisions or intentions irrespective of overt action - has remained largely neglected. This omission leaves current accounts of agency and autonomy theoretically incomplete. Drawing on philosophical analysis and converging neuroscientific evidence, this paper argues that deciding and intending constitute mental actions in their own right, as the brain actively selects, commits to, revises, or withholds intentions. I propose a three-level framework - Decision, Action, and Outcome - that explicitly incorporates Decision-level Agency as a distinct yet hierarchically integrated component of SoA. This reconceptualization is not only theoretically necessary but ethically urgent in the era of generative artificial intelligence, where external systems increasingly shape human autonomy upstream at the level of decision formation rather than action execution. By outlining testable predictions and experimental paradigms, this work establishes Decision-level Agency as a measurable dimension of human volition and provides a framework for understanding and safeguarding autonomy in AI-mediated environments.",

While this work has yielded important insights, there is clear evidence from empirically validated psychotherapeutic interventions to suggest that these lower-level cognitive processes are often intact. Here, we argue that etiological and maintaining factors for internalizing disorders may be more appropriately situated in higher level cognitive processes such as goal-selection. We further suggest that future research should incorporate behavioral tasks and models that allow for participant-defined goals to reveal higher-level mechanistic targets.

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and informs computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about motor output combination: whether learning processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope still depends on the covariance structure of the learning processes, which is not constrained by additivity. For this reason, there is no regression slope benchmark for diagnosing additivity. Moreover, the regression slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by shared-error models where implicit and explicit systems are driven by the same error signals, which adhere to the additivity assumption. Regression slopes only tell us whether learning processes covary, not whether they violate additivity.",

          "abstract": "Structural descriptions of qualitative aspects of conscious experience (qualia) offer a rigorous empirical approach to study consciousness. An important outcome of this approach is that structural descriptions of qualia are formalized as mathematical objects. Mathematical structures describing qualia can be mapped to mathematical structures derived from brain activity and its underlying neuronal connectivity. That is, rather than merely identifying the co-occurrence of specific neuronal activity patterns with specific qualia — correlates of consciousness — we can aim to derive general mathematical mappings that map between qualia and neuronal mechanisms. Such mathematical mappings between neuronal mechanisms and qualia seem consistent with other laws of nature, such as how E=mc² maps mass to energy. Here, we survey key literature that led up to, or follows this structural approach, to assess the current state of the field. We first explicate the historic arc from psychophysics and the neuroscience of consciousness toward structural approaches to qualia. We then critically examine classical attempts of formalizing qualia structure, such as the textbook model of musical chroma (Shepard's pitch helix) and visual color space. We then explore what is known about the structure of their neuronal correlates. We then extend this analysis to visual similarity spaces, including face space and more general image spaces. Finally, we consider ongoing efforts, suggesting that exact experimental comparisons between qualia, analyzed with rigorous mathematics result in an “enriched psychophysics” that expands single-valued measures to much richer scientific exploration.",

However, despite women’s invaluable and essential contribution to the farming sector, studies examining how the unique farming lifestyle shapes women's experiences remain limited. This study, therefore, explores the role of women in the UK farming community. It examined how farming influences women’s roles and its positive and negative effects on their well-being and social connections. \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted between January and March 2023 with 30 women from the UK farming community, including farmers, wives, and daughters (Mage = 41.23 years, SD = 12.9). Data were analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis.\nAn overarching theme, “The Farm Comes First,” was supported by three subordinate themes: “Navigating Traditional Family Dynamics,” “Balancing On- and Off-Farm Commitments,” and “Understanding Connections: People, Place &amp; Purpose.” Participants encountered multiple challenges, including restricted autonomy and role incongruence. However, findings also indicated that a deep sense of belonging was experienced through family, work, community, and farmland. \nWe explored how belonging is a dynamic and subjective experience that provides both connection and frustration, depending on individual circumstances. For many, belonging fostered a sense of identity, competence, and contribution; for others, disconnection created tension. Interventions should prioritise strengthening sources of belonging while addressing forms of exclusion. Future research should explore differences in connectedness among women in various farming roles. This paper contributes to psychological and agricultural literature by proposing a conceptual model of belonging among women in farming that reflects the complexity of their experiences.",

We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience.

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel idiographic approach to mapping the lived experience of endurance athletes by integrating narrative self-reports with Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), a novel method for capturing the temporal dynamics of subjective experience. Two competitive cyclists were followed over eleven consecutive days, providing daily audio narratives and reconstructing their experiences across physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social contextual dimensions. The combined analyses revealed rich interindividual variability in attentional focus, emotional tone, and narrative style, despite comparable training levels and routines. TET trajectories exhibited clear temporal structures linked to session type and context, with competition days marked by peaks in effort, motivation, and flow. Coherence analyses demonstrated strong alignment between narrative descriptions and TET profiles, confirming that subjective dimensions manifest consistently across verbal and graphical modalities. Data driven regression analyses indicated weak correspondence between subjective dynamics, power output and heart rate, suggesting that lived experience might not simply parallel physiological and performance indicators. This methodological synthesis shows that integrating temporal and narrative data provides a multidimensional representation of endurance sport experience, revealing patterns and meanings that conventional metrics obscure.

          "authors": "Sabrina Hansmann-Roth",
          "abstract": "Gloss perception depends on several surface properties, but most studies measure these effects only one or two at a time. Here, we test whether a three-dimensional version of Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement (3D-MLCM) can be used to capture the combined influence of multiple cues on gloss. Observers judged which of two surfaces looked glossier while specular reflectance, albedo, and bumpiness were varied together. The additive model showed clear and reliable contributions of both albedo and bumpiness in addition to specular reflectance, and model comparisons confirmed that these cues significantly affected gloss judgments. The full model further revealed that these effects change with gloss level: bumpiness strongly influenced perceived gloss at low specular reflectance but had little effect at high gloss levels. These results show that 3D-MLCM provides stable, interpretable measurements and is a practical method for studying complex interactions between visual features that influence visual appearance.",

          "abstract": "Simulation studies are commonly used to improve understanding of psychometric models. For many common models, an essential feature of the simulation is the relative (to variation in person parameters) variation in item difficulties. A common practice has been to generate both item difficulty parameters and person parameters directly from a standard normal distribution or to otherwise stipulate distributions for both parameters at the outset of the simulation. This approach implicitly assumes that these distributions can adequately represent empirical data—an assumption that warrants careful examination. In this paper, leveraging 73 datasets from the Item Response Warehouse (Domingue et al., 2023), we examine the variability of item difficulty distributions in real-world datasets and investigate how this variation influences estimation and simulation. We identify key distributional characteristics (e.g., variance and skewness) and propose a new method for simulating realistic item difficulties based on empirical data. This method enhances the realism and applicability of simulation results, making them more reflective of real-world measurement conditions and improving the robustness of psychometric model evaluation",

          "abstract": "The Speed-Accuracy Trade-off (SAT) is one of the most well-established examples of the adaptability of human decision-making, where faster decisions can come at the expense of accuracy. The threshold-based account, which says that individuals gather less evidence when responding quickly, is widely accepted. Here we propose a fundamentally different mechanism: evidence accumulation becomes more self-excitatory when speed is emphasized. A comprehensive switchboard analysis revealed that self-excitation was the only feature consistently supported across six datasets, whereas adjustments to thresholds, drift rates, or non-decision time received little or no support. We demonstrate that this model better captures key behavioral patterns than the traditional evidence-threshold model. We also present new experimental data which shows that, consistent with a self-excitation model, early evidence is weighted more than late evidence, and that this is especially true when fast responses are encouraged. Overall, our results suggest an exciting new explanation for a long- standing behavioural phenomenon",

Study 1 examined the psychometric properties of the pool, revealing that the CRRQ comprises five factors, each focused on a distinct crying context (relationship discomfort, relationship comfort, other-oriented concern, emotion regulation, and manipulation). The results also supported the reliability and validity of the scale. Study 2 provided additional evidence for the 5-dimensional structure of the CRRQ and its good psychometric properties.

          "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Functional difficulties are hallmark signs of incident cognitive decline and progression to dementia, but are challenging to measure in clinic. Passive smartphone monitoring enables continuous tracking of everyday behaviors and may improve the status quo of dementia risk assessment, but acceptability is understudied. This study evaluated older adults’ attitudes toward personal smartphone monitoring for dementia risk and identified barriers and facilitators to acceptability.\n\nResearch Design and Methods: Seventeen older adults completed a semi-structured interview followed by a Likert-rating to measure acceptability. Transcripts were analyzed using hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis. Exploratory correlations examined associations between acceptability ratings and participant features.\n\nResults: Participants identified unique benefits of smartphone monitoring including enhanced scope of measurement, greater ecological validity and personalization, and improved accessibility. Potential disadvantages were confounding variables that threaten validity and concerns about privacy/data security. Preferences for clinical implementation that may improve acceptability included options for extended monitoring, assurances of privacy safeguards, control over data, and continued face-to-face interactions with one’s medical team. Most participants (13/17) were likely or extremely likely to participate in future smartphone monitoring research; higher likelihood was associated with lower depression (r=-.49, p=.046) and White vs. non-White race (U=57.50, n1=10, n2=7 p=.025).\n\nDiscussion and Implications: Findings offer insights to enhance acceptability of smartphone monitoring including transparent review of procedures, privacy safeguards, and existing evidence. Outstanding requirements for clinical implementation include streamlining results to minimize physician burden and accounting for confounders that threaten data integrity. Our small, research-savvy cohort necessitates follow-up in other settings.",

          "abstract": "The co-activation of two incompatible responses leads to the experience of cognitive conflict, which is thought to be aversive and hence, generally avoided.

In contrast, here, across two experiments (N = 100 each), participants freely chose the level of cognitive conflict they wanted to engage in the Simon and Stroop tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) with no external reward. In both experiments, we found that participants chose to freely engage in high levels of cognitive conflict, evaluated it as effortful yet enjoyable, and reported feeling surprised and enthusiastic after experiencing high cognitive conflict. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive conflict is valued and functions as an intrinsic reward, despite the effort associated with it. These results broaden the neuroeconomic approach to cognitive control theories by integrating a hedonic perspective on the subjective experience of cognitive conflict.",

          "abstract": "Peer exclusion is linked to adverse outcomes, including reduced mood and unmet psychological needs. While the 2D Cyberball paradigm is widely used to simulate peer exclusion, its limited ecological validity has raised concerns. Therefore, this study compared the 2D Cyberball paradigm with a newly developed 3D Virtual Reality (VR) paradigm simulating peer exclusion in a classroom conversation.\nSeventy-six children (aged 8–12) and seventy-four adolescents (aged 13–16) participated in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Participants experienced both paradigms in two separate sessions. Mood and psychological needs were assessed before and after each paradigm. Moderator variables included paradigm features, social support, and previous rejection experiences. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted.\nBoth paradigms led to a decrease in positive mood and psychological needs and an increase in negative mood. However, stronger negative effects emerged after the 2D Cyberball paradigm. The 3D VR paradigm was perceived as more realistic and immersive, and its effects remained consistent across levels of the moderator variables, indicating robustness in responses. Adolescents showed stronger emotional and motivational reactions than children in the 3D VR condition, but not in the 2D Cyberball condition, suggesting greater developmental sensitivity of the immersive simulation.\nOverall, results confirm that the 3D VR paradigm effectively simulates peer exclusion while offering higher ecological validity than the 2D version. Although the 2D Cyberball paradigm elicited more intense negative effects, the 3D VR paradigm better captured naturalistic and age-related differences in peer exclusion experiences, thereby providing a more developmentally appropriate and ecologically valid research tool.",

          "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading difficulty (RD) frequently co-occur, yet it is unclear whether their co-occurrence and cognitive profiles remain stable across the lifespan. This review examined whether the rates and cognitive manifestations of ADHD+RD change from childhood to adulthood. Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PubMed were searched. Studies were included if they reported the proportion of children or adults with ADHD+RD, or assessed cognitive performance in at least one of the following domains: attention, cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibition, general memory, planning, problem-solving, processing speed, or vocabulary. Random-effects proportional meta-analyses synthesised co-occurrence rates across child and adult studies, which were compared using a z-test. Random-effects meta-analyses of standardised mean differences synthesised pooled effect estimates across cognitive domains for children and adults, which were compared using an independent samples t-test. This review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (number: CRD42023463062). Of the 3,981 records identified, 153 studies were eligible: 98 examined prevalence, and 69 examined cognition. Pooled ADHD+RD prevalence was 0.23 (95% CI [0.20, 0.27]) in children, and 0.23 (95% CI [0.12, 0.40]) in adults. Pooled cognitive performance was -1.11 (SE = 0.09, 95% CI [-1.28, -0.95]) for children, and -0.70 (SE = 0.11, 95% CI [-0.91, -0.49]) for adults, with no significant child-adult differences across domains. Heterogeneity remained high across all syntheses (I2 &gt; 75%). The findings indicate comparable ADHD+RD co-occurrence rates and cognitive performance across development, have implications for the assessment, diagnosis and support of ADHD+RD, and highlight several methodological considerations for future research.",

However, current understandings of the public concept of science are too limited to yield definitive predictions about which scientists, and which scientific work, are perceived as more sciency than others. Here, we analyse patterns of linguistic associations in over 100 billion words to characterise the semantics of the public concept of science. These analyses show that sources, occupations, institutions, and social outcomes vary systematically in the strength of their association with science, and that this variation reliably predicts the extent to which they are associated with trust. These results shed light on the public concept of science, confirm sciency exemplars of science are more trusted, and help understand why the public trust science in general but also reject scientists and their work.",

We observed increases in nocturnal HR and decreases in HRV over time independent of microstressor exposure or concurrent mental health changes. Within-person increases in daily stress predicted higher following-morning negative affect, 28.5% of which was explained by rumination, a modifiable target for intervention.

          "abstract": "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird's (2002) Visual Imagery Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and typical imagers completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction times and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002), demonstrating robust evidence of a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to spatial and control ones in typical imagers. This effect was inconclusive in aphantasics, along with the difference between the groups. More in-depth analyses distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia suggested that the latter group was more affected by visual problems. Finally, our OSIVQ classification-based analyses revealed a meaningful slowdown in reasoning for the visualiser cluster, pointing to a possible influence of cognitive style on performance. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive styles in theories of reasoning.",

Researchers who employ deception sometimes administer post-experiment suspicion probes and exclude participants from analysis if their responses indicate that they were not successfully deceived. However, several studies have found that their suspicious participants behave as if they were deceived as intended. One explanation is that participants infer that they were deceived upon being presented with a suspicion probe, which biases them to overreport being suspicious. We tested whether post-experiment beliefs about deception can indeed induce such biases by manipulating whether we admitted to using deception before administering suspicion probes. Admitting to deception did not increase the amount of suspicion reported (Experiment 1), nor did the content of participants’ suspicions reflect the content of our admission (Experiment 2). Results suggest that it is unlikely that suspicion probes ‘tip off’ participants in a way that causes them to overreport suspicion.",

While much progress has been made using traditional laboratory-based methods of stress induction, we suggest that there is great potential in applying virtual reality (VR) since it enables a diverse range of stressors to be consistently delivered in the form of rich and immersive experiences. \n\nTo validate these VR stressors, however, we must assess their psychophysiological impact and compare them to established lab-based paradigms. In the current study, we recorded the subjective responses to two virtual reality stressors (“Spiders” and “Horror”). Using a repeated measures design, levels of VR-induced stress were compared to a speeded arithmetic task with negative evaluative feedback (a modified version of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST)) in healthy participants. For a subset of participants, basic physiological data (mean heart rate (HR) and respiratory frequency) are available.  \n\nBoth MIST and VR produced significant increases in subjective ratings of stress, desire for avoidance, negative affect, and perceived threat, as well as in respiratory frequency. Sizes of effect were comparable across the stressors, apart from negative affect and perceived threat, which were greater for the MIST. \n\nOverall, VR allows effective stress induction in healthy participants. Moreover, it was associated with a number of advantages, including convenience, and a lack of need for participant deception. These findings support the use of VR for inducing and exploring patterns of stress responses in humans.",

In both tasks, participants heard continuous auditory streams containing trisyllabic or three-tone “words”. Learning was measured via reaction time acceleration to predictable items and by neural responses to structured versus random streams within language regions identified via an independent story-listening task. Children showed faster learning than adults only in the linguistic learning task. fMRI revealed earlier and stronger learning-induced plasticity in children’s language network than adults. Greater neural sensitivity was further associated with faster linguistic learning in children, but not in adults.

          "abstract": "Social gaze is a fundamental cue regulating approach and avoidance in social interactions, yet it remains unclear how repeated gaze exchanges give rise to enduring social preferences and closeness. Here, we propose a computational learning account in which gaze-contingent feedback generates prediction errors that update latent social values, thereby shaping social closeness over time. According to this account, direct and averted gaze function as socially rewarding or non-rewarding outcomes whose impact depends on individual reward calibration. We tested this account using a gaze-interaction paradigm in which participants repeatedly chose between two interaction partners that predominantly (70%) responded with direct or averted gaze and rated their perceived social closeness toward each partner. Consistent with the model, participants increasingly preferred and felt closer to the partner who more frequently returned direct gaze. Computational modeling revealed that gaze direction elicited prediction errors that updated the latent value of the interaction partner. Crucially, these learning signals were calibrated by individual differences in the subjective reward value of direct gaze. Initial attractiveness and valence of the interaction partner predicted this calibration, indicating that pre-existing impressions shape how gaze feedback is valued. In turn, reward calibration was reflected in participants’ post-interaction social evaluations, demonstrating how learning experiences contributed to impression formation. Together, these findings provide a computational account of how minimal gaze interactions can give rise to social preference and closeness through reinforcement learning mechanisms. More broadly, they suggest that eye contact functions as a powerful but individually calibrated social signal that dynamically shapes social affiliation.",

We leveraged unidimensional item response theory graded response models and a sample of 735 children to analyze the differential item functioning (DIF) of items within ADOS Module 3. Three items showed significant signs of racial bias: A1 (overall language level), A5 (offers information), and D5 (compulsions and rituals). On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0-48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children, and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. This analysis suggests a small but detectable amount of bias in several specific ADOS items, but not in items central to informing an autism diagnosis. Thus, bias appears statistically, but not clinically, significant. This contributes to examinations of racial bias in the ADOS as the first analysis of Asian children, and the first in-depth look at all items in the most commonly used version among school-aged children.",

Specifically, we expect that voluntary movers will change or maintain travel behaviour in line with previous attitudes due to higher control and that involuntary movers will adapt more strongly to their new built environment due to lower control levels. We test this using longitudinal panel survey data of individuals expecting (n=1,234) and later realising a move (n=411). Using a novel, subjective voluntariness measure, we find that voluntary movers show improved well-being (i.e. mental health, life satisfaction, residential satisfaction, place attachment), while involuntary movers show similar but non-significant changes. Neither group shows changed travel attitude-behaviour consistencies, suggesting that subjective voluntariness does not directly translate into distinct travel behaviour change pathways. However, involuntary movers showed consistently weaker car orientations and lower mobility needs fulfilment, hinting at stable differences in travel characteristics of mover groups. Despite similar demographics, involuntary movers report lower perceived control, earlier moving stages, and higher future-location uncertainty. Our suggested subjective measure provides different well-being and travel insights than previous objective approaches. We suggest conceptual and methodological refinements, e.g. in terms of dimensionality, time-variability, reliability, and possible relations to personality/trait variables.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are popular tools for explaining speeded decisions because their parameters capture different aspects of the decision process. While researchers increasingly use Bayesian methods for estimating EAM parameters, computational costs and the necessity of tractable model likelihoods still pose obstacles for traditional methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Neural posterior estimation (NPE) addresses these obstacles by training a neural network to approximate the joint posterior distribution from simulated data, which only requires a generative model and amortizes computational costs at inference time. However, the quality of the approximation can suffer when the test data at inference time differs from the training data. Both test and training data stem from data-generating contexts and, for EAMs, these are influenced by the experimental design. Using the Racing Diffusion Model as a test case, we investigated how well NPE can generalize across changes in two types of experimental design contexts: number of trials and data-generating prior contexts that affect the error rate. Using MCMC as a reference, we showed in two simulation studies that NPE generalized well across changes in trial numbers but less well across error rates. We applied NPE to empirical datasets from reasoning tasks and found that the patterns observed in our simulation studies held. We discuss challenges and future directions to assess and improve the generalization for neural estimators for EAMs.",

          "authors": "Ummul Haseena Muskan; Deepa Marina Raquinha",
          "abstract": "Play has always been a natural part of childhood, not only as a source of joy, but also as a powerful way through which children learn, express themselves, and build relationships. However, in today’s screen-driven world, non-digital play is slowly being pushed aside, even though its role in children’s cognitive, emotional, social, and physical development is well established (Ginsburg, 2007). This scoping review was undertaken to understand what existing research tells us about the effectiveness of non-digital play-based learning environments among children.\nFollowing the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, this review mapped peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2024. A total of 17 studies involving children aged 2 to 12 years were included. The reviewed literature covered a wide range of non-digital play forms such as pretend play, board games, outdoor and physical play, traditional games, and free play, implemented across school and community settings. Overall, the findings suggest that non-digital play-based learning environments are associated with positive outcomes in executive functioning, emotional regulation, creativity, social interaction, self-regulation, and motor development (Rao &amp; Gibson, 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Colliver et al., 2022; Jaggy et al., 2023).\nThe effectiveness of these play-based environments was commonly assessed using pre- and post-intervention measures, observational tools, and qualitative inputs from teachers and caregivers, reflecting both measurable developmental changes and lived classroom experiences. Taken together, the evidence supports the view that non-digital play is not separate from learning, but deeply embedded within it, aligning with classic developmental theories that emphasise learning through interaction, imagination, and social engagement (Piaget; Vygotsky; Erikson). This review highlights the continuing relevance of non-digital play in contemporary childhoods and points to the need for more longitudinal and culturally diverse research to better understand its long-term impact on children’s development.\nKeywords: non-digital play, play-based learning, child development, pretend play, scoping review",

          "abstract": "There is growing concern that smartphones and social media (S/SM) disrupt adolescent sleep, wellbeing and cognition, yet causal evidence from robust interventions is limited. To assess the acceptability of a total 21-day S/SM detox we conducted a preregistered (https://osf.io/79zd2) pilot randomised control trial with eighty-two adolescents aged 13-18 years from UK schools. Participants were randomly assigned to a total S/SM ban (N=26), total S/SM ban with access to a basic “brick” phone (N=26) or a business-as-usual control (N=30). Pre-and post-intervention measures of sleep, wellbeing, and cognition were collected using surveys, wearables, and cognitive tasks.  Retention was high, with 13% attrition across groups. At 21-days, both ban conditions showed tentative improvements in sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and working memory relative to the controls, however these changes were not maintained at a two-month follow-up. Open-ended responses indicated mixed or negative experiences for 50% of participants, including boredom, functional reliance on smartphones, and fear of missing out, although 83% endorsed the need for government action. Digital detoxes appear feasible for generating causal evidence however, complete abstinence can pose challenges. Fully powered trials should ascertain whether more targeted interventions (e.g., limiting bed-time use) are as effective.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Managing mood, cognition, and fatigue are top unmet needs reported by stroke survivors, which impact quality of life. There is currently no standardised UK care pathway to support post-stroke psychological outcomes. The Enhanced Reviews for Psychological Changes (ENRICH) programme, an intervention co-designed with stroke survivors, carers, and healthcare professionals, aims to fill this gap. Here, we describe the protocol for evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of ENRICH. \n\nMethods and Analysis: ENRICH reviews comprise cognition, mood, and fatigue assessment, personalised psychoeducation and tools to communicate results and discuss self-management strategies, delivered at 1, 3, and 6-months post-stroke. N=140 participants (N=80 stroke patients, N=45 carers, N=15 Health care professionals) will be recruited to a single arm multicentre feasibility study.\nStroke patients and carers will complete questionnaires of quality of life, mood, and healthcare resource use at 6- and 9-months post-stroke, and an optional interview on experiences of ENRICH. Process evaluation will include fidelity assessment via audio recordings. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for study outcomes. Key qualitative acceptability outcomes are sought on intervention delivery by clinicians, patients and carers. Key intervention delivery feasibility outcomes are training clinicians, competency and fidelity delivering ENRICH, and review completion rates. Study feasibility outcomes will include site and participant recruitment and retention rates and completion of candidate primary outcomes measures on quality of life. \n\nEthics and Dissemination: The ENRICH study was approved by a UK Research Ethics Committee (reference: 24/LO/0341). Consent procedures include a waiver of consent to the intervention itself due ENRICH’s service-level design and written informed consent/consultee advice for participants providing research data. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and lay summaries for study participants and healthcare professionals. Results will inform whether ENRICH is acceptable to delivering clinicians and receiving stroke patients and carers, and provide key insights to inform a future randomised trial to determine effectiveness. \nTrial Registration: ISRCTN16018388 (Protocol version 1.3)",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories, from initial hesitation to sustained participation, offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

          "authors": "Harriet J Smith; Emma Holmes",
          "abstract": "Do we learn better from a broad range of variable examples, or a narrow set of consistent ones? While higher-variability training is often assumed to generate more robust category learning, it remains unclear how different types of variability affect task performance, and whether variability affects all tasks equally. We examined how different forms of variability influence learning by manipulating pitch variation (but equating average pitch) across shorter and longer timescales when participants learned to identify new voices. To examine task-specific differences, we tested performance on a voice identification in noise task and a speech intelligibility task. The nature of variability during training produced distinct outcomes for subsequent voice recognition in noise: exposure to fine-grained, moment-to-moment pitch variability during learning affected performance more than exposure to broader, between-sentence pitch variability. In contrast, neither form of variability affected speech intelligibility: participants showed a comparable benefit to speech intelligibility when listening to trained voices compared to novel voices, regardless of their previous exposure to pitch variation within trained voices. These findings demonstrate that variability is not uniformly beneficial, but instead interacts with the type of variability and the task. These results challenge current theories of perception and learning, which either propose that variability is stripped away during learning or treat variability as a single construct. Instead, our results demonstrate that at least some types of variability are maintained during learning—but not all types of variability are treated equally, and different types are utilised in distinct ways for different tasks.",

          "abstract": "In controversial ethical issues professional obligations may conflict with personal values. Actors may assume roles that do not correspond with their personal values.  We examined actors in the theater play \"Gott\" by Ferdinand von Schirach dealing with assisted suicide. We investigated how actors perceive the arguments, identify with their roles, and deal with role conflicts. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the complete cast of a production of “Gott” in Switzerland and used qualitative content analysis to answer our research questions. Articulating arguments positively influenced actors' perceived attitudes toward assisted suicide, aiding in the formation of their own stance, and shifting their perceptions of affected individuals. In contrast, one actress whose role did not produce arguments had difficulties forming her attitude. Being unable to form an attitude can lead to moral distress. Identification with the roles was highly individual, but most actors identified with their roles. Unlike prior work that assumed negative effects of complete role identification on actors, we demonstrated that experienced actors can maintain psychological boundaries while engaging deeply with complex moral narratives.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety is widely recognized as a barrier to mathematical learning; however, its causal relationship with performance remains a topic of debate. The present study examined whether math anxiety predicts poor arithmetic fluency or vice versa by applying both a traditional Cross-Lagged Panel Model (CLPM) and a Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) to longitudinal data from 866 students in grades 4–6 across six measurement points. The CLPM revealed a reciprocal relationship between math anxiety and arithmetic fluency, suggesting that the two influence each other over time. In contrast, the RI-CLPM indicated a unidirectional effect, where math anxiety predicted subsequent declines in arithmetic fluency, supporting the debilitating hypothesis. Although both models fit the data, the RI-CLPM demonstrated superior fit indices. When stable between-person differences are accounted for, the model reveals that within-person increases in math anxiety predict subsequent declines in arithmetic fluency, supporting the debilitating hypothesis. These findings highlight the importance of model selection in developmental research and underscore the role of math anxiety as a critical target for early interventions aimed at improving mathematical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Feedback learning supports flexible behavior in changing environmental contexts, but declines with age. Motivational aging theories, however, suggest that socio-emotional feedback can reduce these deficits, though it is unclear whether this effect depends on the social, emotional or communicative information in feedback. Participants from two age groups, n= 24 older adults (M = 72.37 years; SD=3.37) and n = 22 younger adults (M = 22.63 years; SD=1.78), therefore completed a probabilistic learning task in which stimulus–response associations had to be learned via unfamiliar social (hand gestures) or non-social (abstract shapes) feedback. To capture neural correlates of feedback processing, two ERP components were investigated; the feedback-related negativity (FRN), associated with the detection of unexpected events, and the P3b component, linked to working memory updating. Results revealed that younger and older adults learned more effectively from social than non-social feedback, with older adults benefitting most. The FRN was enhanced after social feedback in older adults, but after non-social feedback in younger adults. The P3b was more pronounced for social feedback, primarily driven by larger valence-related differences. In contrast, non-social feedback elicited increased frontal activation, indicating higher processing effort irrespective of participants’ age. These findings reveal a processing advantage for social feedback that appears biologically rooted rather than primarily explained by motivational aging theories, which may require additional facets such as emotional or communicative information.",

          "abstract": "Understanding habit formation in humans remains a fundamental challenge, partly due to the constraints of laboratory-based studies. Thus, this study investigated whether prolonged, real-world engagement with a novel smartphone-based task could induce habitual behavior. Across five pilot experiments (n=27-43; total N = 177), participants were randomly assigned to either a short (ST) or extended training (ET) condition using a gamified button-press task delivered via a custom web application. Habit formation was assessed through three complementary tests targeting hallmark features of habitual behavior: automaticity, inflexibility, and insensitivity to outcome devaluation. While the ET group showed improved performance on dual-task measures (suggestive of increased automaticity), neither the devaluation nor the inflexibility tests yielded conclusive evidence of habit induction across experiments. Bayesian analysis supported the absence of robust group differences in insensitivity to outcome devaluation. Our findings highlight the difficulty of inducing measurable habits in humans, even under prolonged and ecologically valid training. Crucially, they also call into question the utility of outcome devaluation as a definitive measure of habit, regardless of training duration or setting. We argue that this widely used paradigm may miss important aspects of stimulus–response learning and suggest the need for alternative or refined tools to capture the complexity of human habit formation. Our null results, provide methodological insights for future research and suggest that smartphone-based paradigms, while scalable and flexible, require further refinement to elicit and detect true habitual behavior. All code and data are openly shared to promote replication and advancement in habit research.",

          "abstract": "Identifying shared and distinct profiles, whether in symptom combinations, personality traits, or cognitive abilities, is essential for understanding psychological phenomena, yet doing so requires navigating interrelated theoretical, conceptual, and technical complexities. First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

Across 13 studies (N = 5,650), public relations responses yielded a small to medium-sized negative effect on belief in misinformation (d = −0.24), a medium-sized positive effect on belief in the organization’s corrective communication (d = 0.44), and a small positive effect on pro-organization attitudes and intentions (d = 0.19). Among the specific strategies examined, prebunking emerged as a particularly promising approach. The findings suggest that while current public relations interventions are preferable to inaction, they are often insufficient for fully addressing the growing threat of false claims. By integrating disparate experimental data, this study offers robust quantitative evidence to guide future public relations theory building and evidence-based practice.",

This paper introduces a novel approach to understand why these behaviors occur, reconciling these observed \"irrationalities\" with a simple rational objective. Here we propose that the human nervous system, faced with limited cognitive capacity (a finite representational precision for the representation of reward value), optimally selects a task-appropriate utility function to either maximize long-run average earnings or to minimize errors. We argue that the utility functions we have measured are tools, sculpted by knowledge of the choice environment's probabilistic structure and the decision-maker's precision level, for optimally achieving a rational objective. Our results show that almost every experimentally observed utility function can be described as a near-optimal tool for achieving a maximization of objective earnings (a goal abandoned since Bernoulli) or for minimizing errors. We quantify the specific gains that result from adding cognitive capacity and find that these gains are quite small as long as the utility function is correctly adjusted to cognitive capacity. Our research provides a novel framework that offers a testable and foundational explanation for why human and animal decision-makers evolved the puzzling range of utility functions and risk attitudes that have been widely observed.",

Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "Intrinsic work motivation is important for workers’ performance and well-being across all ages. Ongoing demographic change makes it particular important to study the work motivation of ageing workers, not the least because it may affect their later retirement decisions. The changing world of work, cohort differences in personality and health, as well as changing labor and pension policies may lead to historical differences in intrinsic work motivation, However, such effects have seldom been studied. In the present study, we examined historical differences in workers aged between 50 and 52 in either 2011 or 2022/23, based on two samples of the population-based German lidA survey. We found that those interviewed in 2022/23 showed slightly lower intrinsic work motivation (d = 0.11) than their earlier counterparts. Analyses also showed that opportunities for development and social support showed a stronger association with work motivation in the later-born sample, compared to the earlier cohort. Our results suggest that historical changes may affect work attitudes and that job demands and resources are possible targets to address workers’ work motivation.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory flexibility, defined as the ability to use strategies in accordance with contextual demands, is thought to be central to psychological health. In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point. Overall, these findings suggest that having the ability to use strategies flexibly has no apparent downside.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI drafts emails, summarizes medical results, and shapes social feeds, psychological science faces two questions: What does AI do to human behavior, judgment, and wellbeing? What does it reveal about the theories we use to explain them? This article examines emerging findings on trust and the dehumanization of AI users, literacy-dependent fear and awe, and large-scale persuasion, advice, and delegation. Across these domains, familiar mechanisms—source credibility, mind perception, ownership, control—operate in new environments where content generation is effortless, interaction is seamless, and influence scales invisibly. AI is less a synthetic mind than a stress test on three clusters of human functioning: epistemic (how people handle evidence and uncertainty), social-evaluative (how they perceive and judge others), and motivational (how they pursue goals and maintain identity). When current theories fail to predict behavior around AI—when people simultaneously overtrust hidden AI advice and distrust visible AI users—those failures reveal where core constructs remain underspecified. This framing clarifies what changes in the age of AI (scale, speed, opacity), what does not (the underlying psychological processes), and where theory must be sharpened to accommodate minds operating in AI-saturated environments.",

The MoCA was included for comparative purposes. Impairment was defined as failing any OCS-AU cognitive domain, scoring below 26 on the MoCA, or failing at least two domains on the neuropsychological test battery.\nResults: To detect impairment within individual cognitive domains, most OCS-AU scores had low sensitivity, ranging from 0.12 (Executive) to 0.92 (Spatial Attention). Specificity was higher, ranging from 0.80 (Spatial Attention) to 0.96 (Praxis). Regarding the detection of multi-domain cognitive impairments, MoCA scores showed high sensitivity (0.81) but low specificity (0.42), compared with OCS-AU lower sensitivity (0.70) but higher specificity (0.58).\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the OCS-AU has strong domain-level specificity, but may miss some individuals with mild to moderate memory and executive impairments, while the MoCA appears more sensitive to domain-general impairment, but may misclassify individuals without post-stroke cognitive impairment. Thus, the OCS-AU and MoCA could be utilised for different purposes, to leverage their strengths when addressing specific clinical needs.",

Behavioural Activation (BA), an intervention that encourages engagement in positively reinforcing activities, shows promise. Here, we conduct a process evaluation of two group-based BA interventions for adults with ABI. \nMethods: Adults (≥18 years) recruited from local ABI services, charities, and self-referral via social media were randomised to receive either “Traditional” BA (scheduling and engaging in positively reinforcing activities combined with cognitive management strategies) or “Experiential” BA (participating in reinforcing activities within-session but without explicit attempts to plan between-session activities). Interventions were delivered once weekly over 8 weeks. A semi-structured interview at 1-month follow-up focused on participants’ perspectives of intervention benefits and processes associated with mood and activity levels. Data were collected in-person and, due to COVID-19, remotely. \nResults: N=49 participants completed interviews (Traditional BA n=25, Experiential BA n=24). A positive therapeutic milieu, a sense of group cohesion and being able to share common ABI-related experiences were felt to foster psychological safety, reduce social isolation and underlie mood/activity improvements by participants in both groups. Processes more strongly linked to Traditional BA included developing their skillset in coping with low mood, avoidance and cognitive barriers to activity engagement, aligning scheduled activities to values, and challenging negative thinking patterns. Conversely, processes more strongly linked to Experiential BA were increased in-session enjoyment, participating in activities in sessions enhancing present-mindedness, and having choice and control into selecting within-session activities. \nConclusions: Positive group processes may enhance outcomes associated with group-based BA delivered to adults with ABI. Specific methods of delivering group-based BA may have differing underlying mechanisms that should be captured and maximised in BA intervention delivery in ABI, including value-based activity scheduling and promoting autonomy in session content. \nTrial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03874650.

          "abstract": "Background: Transition from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) represents a vulnerable period for transitional age youth (TAY), with high risk of disengagement and unmet mental health needs. Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., auditory and motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on features stemming from the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipation of reading a word aloud is sufficient to improve its memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting this effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

These include pausing, trusting the unclear edge, supporting fresh description, and fostering client agency. Therapists described experimenting with these skills in ways that sometimes reduced their own sense of pressure and, in their accounts, were linked with clients engaging differently.

However, whether the JSE is better explained by non-social mechanisms remains an open question. The present meta-analytic review sought to provide an overview of the JSE literature and to evaluate its suitability as a measure of self-other integration. Our meta-analysis of 274 JSEs from 80 studies (7042 participants across 186 samples) revealed a significant overall effect of gD = .60. Analysis of 52 canonical JSEs (reflecting the seminal study) revealed a larger JSE of gD =.72. Finally, moderation by study characteristics suggested that JSEs at least partly reflect social representations of one’s co-actor.

Prior laboratory work suggests that this design feature may influence game experience, facilitate immersion, increase arousal, and promote riskier decision making, but whether this generalizes to realistic gambling products remains unclear. In this pre-registered study, we used a realistic slot machine simulator, deployed online, to evaluate effects of win-accompanying sensory feedback (SF) on gambling experience and behavior. Method: Participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk and stratified as online active gamblers (AG) or non-gamblers (NG). Participants were randomly assigned to complete 200 spins on an online slot machine that featured either enhanced or diminished SF. Results: Enhanced SF reduced time to initiate spins (i.e. faster speed of play) but did not affect bet size or self-reported experience. Relative to NG, AG reported greater game immersion and positive affect during the game, and these variables were also predicted across all participants by greater problem gambling severity, and monetary gains in the gambling session. In addition, self-reported immersion and affect were predicted by ADHD and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Faster gambling under SF may incur greater losses over time, raising concerns about harm potential. By contrast, game experience was influenced by monetary outcomes and personal characteristics rather than SF. Overall, these findings support the notion that both product and personal characteristics confer risk of harm.",

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and informs computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about motor output combination: whether learning processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope still depends on the covariance structure of the learning processes, which is not constrained by additivity. For this reason, there is no regression slope benchmark for diagnosing additivity. Moreover, the regression slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by shared-error models where implicit and explicit systems are driven by the same error signals, which adhere to the additivity assumption. Regression slopes only tell us whether learning processes covary, not whether they violate additivity.",

Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

          "abstract": "The implementation of Partially Automated Driving (PAD) systems is increasingly common in consumer vehicles. While these systems support longitudinal and lateral vehicle control, they still require drivers to monitor the environment and intervene when necessary. Therefore, drivers must continue to allocate their visual attention effectively and remain aware of potential hazards. However, increased engagement in non-driving-related activities (NDRAs) has been observed during PAD. While the detrimental effects of visual-manual NDRAs on drivers’ visual attention during PAD is well-established, the impact of cognitively demanding NDRAs that take drivers’ mind off but allow their eyes to remain on the roadway is poorly understood. It is also unclear how the effects of cognitive load vary across automation levels. A driving simulator study was conducted to examine drivers’ visual attention under cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, during both manual driving and PAD. An urban section of road, with a range of vehicles and other road users as potential hazards, was used to study drivers’ allocation of attention. Results indicated that, during PAD, drivers adopted a broader visual search strategy, directing more attention to the peripheral driving environment. However, drivers’ visual search was more restricted under cognitive load, with attention concentrated on the road ahead, accompanied by fewer and shorter glances to the periphery, regardless of driving mode. These findings add knowledge on how cognitively demanding NDRAs affects drivers’ visual attention, under different driving automation levels, and highlight the need for targeted countermeasures to ensure drivers safely monitor PAD and the driving environment.",

          "abstract": "Making judgments of learning (JOLs) can directly affect learning outcomes. The present study investigated whether providing JOLs during inductive learning tasks improves learning of new material (forward effect) and whether feedback moderates these effects. Participants learned the painting styles of different artists (Experiment 1) or different rock types (Experiment 2) across two study phases separated by an interim learning task, and then completed a transfer posttest (classifying new exemplars) and memory posttest (classifying previously-studied exemplars). In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect. Our results suggest that cue-only JOLs, but not cue–target JOLs, enhancing future inductive learning of natural visual categories, likely through metacognitively controlled, covert retrieval processes.",

          "authors": "Satoshi Usami",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers have shown an interest in disaggregating within-person variability from between-person differences. Especially for inferring reciprocal relations among variables at the within-person level, applications of the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) with stable trait factors has increased rapidly. This paper provides a tutorial, simulation, and illustrative example of another recent approach proposed by Usami (2023).  This approach consists of a two-step procedure: within-person variability scores (WPVS) for each person, which are disaggregated from the stable traits of that person, are predicted using structural equation modeling, and causal parameters are then estimated via a potential outcome approach, such as by using structural nested mean models (SNMMs). This method assumes a data-generating process similar to that in RI-CLPM, and has several advantages: (i) the flexible inclusion of curvilinear and interaction effects for WPVS as latent variables in treatment and outcome models, (ii) more accurate estimates of causal parameters for reciprocal relations can be obtained under certain conditions owing to them being doubly robust, even if unobserved time-varying confounders and model misspecifications exist, (iii) no models for (the distributions of) observed time-varying confounders are needed for estimation, and (iv) the risk of obtaining improper solutions is reduced. After explaining the data-generating process and the analysis procedure using the R package DTRreg for SNMMs, estimation performances are compared with RI-CLPM through large-scale simulations. We show that the proposed approach works well in many conditions if longitudinal data with T≧4 are available, and that the accuracy increases as T becomes larger. An analytic example using data regarding sleep habits and mental health statuses from the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) study is also provided.",

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and shapes computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about output combination: whether processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between the learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope depends on the correlation and variance ratio between processes. Neither condition is constrained by additivity, and therefore there is no benchmark. The empirical slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by competitive models where implicit and explicit systems share error signals, which are built on the additivity assumption. Thus, regression slopes only tell us that learning processes covary, not that they violate additivity.",

          "abstract": "Negative affect has been shown, in both humans and non-human animals, to bias decision-making under ambiguity away from so-called ‘optimistic’ responses that can yield higher rewards but also risk greater losses. The judgement bias task, a cognitive task that uses ambiguous stimuli to measure such decisions as indicators of affective state, has successfully been translated from humans to animals and back again. However, questions remain regarding how exactly affect influences ‘optimistic’ or ‘pessimistic’ decisions, and the extent to which dispositional pessimism also influences these decisions. To further understand links between affect and decision-making, we carried out a judgement bias task in humans and measured self-reported affect and dispositional pessimism. In a pre-registered online experiment, participants completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, and pessimism, and undertook a judgement bias task. Our results mirrored previous findings showing that self-reported negative affect is associated with negatively-biased decision-making under ambiguity; individuals who reported higher anxiety and depression made a significantly lower proportion of ‘optimistic’ responses to ambiguous stimuli in the judgement bias task. However, we found no evidence that self-reported dispositional pessimism is associated with ‘pessimistic’ responses in the task. Drift-diffusion modelling revealed that the more negative (less ‘optimistic’) judgement bias associated with self-reported anxiety and depression, can be explained by a bias generated during the decision-making process, represented by a lower drift rate. But due to high comorbidity, we were unable to determine whether negative judgement bias is driven primarily by anxiety or depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Transition from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) represents a vulnerable period for transitional age youth (TAY), with high risk of disengagement and unmet mental health needs. Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory flexibility, defined as the ability to use strategies in accordance with contextual demands, is thought to be central to psychological health. In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only report less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point. Overall, these findings suggest that having the ability to use strategies flexibly has no apparent downside.",

          "abstract": "Social relationships are central to well-being because they fulfill basic affiliation needs. To describe how these needs are regulated, theories connect daily-life processes of social contact, social desire, and affect. Still, such processes remain empirically underexplored because of their complexity. In this study, we estimated multivariate associations of social desire and affect with social contact across different modalities (in-person, digital), time scales (hourly, daily), and levels of analysis (between-person, contemporaneous, temporally lagged). Participants from two age-heterogeneous samples answered experience sampling questions and contributed data through unobtrusive smartphone sensing, with roughly hourly assessments across 2 days (N = 303) and daily assessments across 14 days (N = 377). Multi-level vector autoregressive network models revealed associations between social contact, social desire, and affect across levels of analysis. Results were highly specific to the examined time scale. When measured at an hourly timescale, people desired more social contact than usual when they engaged in more in-person contact, and higher social desire predicted more future social contact in both experience sampling and smartphone sensing. In contrast, at a daily timescale, social desire did not predict future contact. Bidirectional linkages of affect and social contact were also much denser hourly (vs. daily). Compared to in-person contact, calls and communication app usage generally showed distinct associations with affect. We discuss theoretical implications for the dynamic regulation of social needs, especially regarding temporal processes and the role of positive affect in predicting social contact. Finally, we delineate future directions of multi-method research into daily-life social dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Even as concepts like emotion and emotion regulation are emphasized as central to psychological health and functioning, the affective field remains rife with debates on how to conceptualize emotion and related constructs like affect or mood. In this paper, I identify two key features that pervade and characterize affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the theoretical assumption of innate valence, i.e., an innate and universal neurophysiological capacity to distinguish good from bad that underlies hedonic tone and (b) a conceptual approach that involves grouping sets of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often believed to be hereditary patterns with aims corresponding to the situation or its appraisal. I interrogate the assumption of valence as an innate process and expose the pitfalls of grouping seemingly correlated responses into higher level emotion constructs. I suggest that affective concepts can obscure critical and more meaningful treatment targets in clinical settings. This can lead to neglect of physical health and poor treatment efficacy, overinterpretation of physiological changes, misdirection in decision making, and issues of social control and justice, with ultimately adverse social and clinical implications.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. This may be because researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our results suggest that findings from past studies should be interpreted with caution as they did not distinguish excellencism from perfectionistic standards.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

Building upon the work of Abraham Maslow, this article rejects the pyramid of needs as an ideologically rooted, sanitized, and stripped-down version of Maslow’s nascent Eupsychian Theory. Instead, the article proposes an Indigenous-rooted Circle of Seven Essential needs as the core of a sophisticated and integrative theory of human development, human potential, and human flourishing, a theory that Maslow was in the process of developing before his untimely death and that, given his known interest in Indigenous communities, more in line with the direction of Maslow’s early thinking.",

Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

          "abstract": "Making an informed decision often depends on observing sequential outcomes, which may be temporally spaced across a sequence of immediate decisions or decisions made over weeks or months. Making decisions based on multiple observed sequential outcomes is the cornerstone of optimal stopping theory. Here, we review and describe four optimal stopping problems: The Secretary Problem, The Burglar Problem, The Devil’s Task, and the Game of Pigs. We outline their respective optimal policies and draw comparisons between these problems. Simulations of the standard Secretary Problem highlight the generalizability of its optimal policy across several different set sizes and show that with larger set sizes, the optimal policy stabilizes. Conversely, simulating the Burglar Problem illustrates how the outcome of pseudo-optimal policies can be directly tied to assumptions of the choice environment. A brief discussion of the usefulness of optimal stopping policies in the real world is also outlined. Using sequential decision tasks with optimal policies may provide a better understanding of how people make decisions, deviate from optimality, and help inform how to make people more accurately engage in optimality.",

In both tasks, participants heard continuous auditory streams containing trisyllabic or three-tone “words”. Learning was measured via reaction time acceleration to predictable items and by neural responses to structured versus random streams within language regions identified via an independent story-listening task. Children showed faster learning than adults only in the linguistic learning task. fMRI revealed earlier and stronger learning-induced plasticity in children’s language network than adults. Greater neural sensitivity was further associated with faster linguistic learning in children, but not in adults.

Participants received the inoculation or no intervention, then rated their belief in accurate and misleading headlines, half of which were accompanied by a supporting graph. Graphs consistently boosted belief in misleading headlines but had inconsistent effects on accurate headlines. An inoculation focusing on multiple misleading visualisation techniques was ineffective at reducing the impact of misleading graphs, instead inducing general scepticism. A single-technique inoculation focusing on dual axes reduced the influence of misleading graphs using that technique; this benefit did not, however, transfer to graphs using cherry-picking.

          "abstract": "The scope of knowledge is constantly evolving, due to such factors as environmental changes, cultural evolution, and scientific discovery. Consequently, we are frequently confronted with gaps in our knowledge, compelling us to seek information from available sources. Sometimes the information we seek is easy to find; other times it has yet to be established by others, requiring us to creatively come up with an original perspective. Yet, little is known about how our foraging strategies change depending on the ease with which the information we seek is readily available. We investigated how the need to generate new ideas influences the rate at which individuals explore or exploit existing information. Participants (N = 138)   answered questions either fully answerable (low-creativity condition) or not fully answerable (high-creativity condition) with information they foraged for on Wikipedia. We created knowledge networks from the foraged information, wherein Wikipedia pages were nodes. The edges linked pairs of Wikipedia pages when they were visited by the participant either sequentially or within the same condition, and were weighted based on the semantic similarity between the pair of pages. This approach allowed us to measure exploration (jumping between disparate pages) and exploitation (viewing closely related pages). In the high-creativity condition, participants were more likely to trade-off between exploration (lower average edge weights) and exploitation  (higher average clustering coefficients). This trade-off was associated with responses that were more novel, diverging further from the Wikipedia text, compared to less novel responses. These findings reveal how foraging strategies differ in creative versus non-creative contexts, and provide insight into the processes that underlie learning and scientific discovery.",

          "abstract": "Religious and sexual identities are often perceived as conflicting, creating challenges for religious lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. This study examined how risk (perceived in-group rejection, discrimination) and protective (in-group identification, social support) factors are associated with identity integration, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. A total of 306 LGB-religious individuals participated in this study. Perceived rejection from the religious in-group – reflecting the belief that religious communities view LGB and religious identities as incompatible – was significantly associated with lower identity integration. It was also linked to lower life satisfaction, particularly when discrimination was high. Social support related to being both LGB and religious was a consistent protective factor of identity integration and life satisfaction. In-group identification showed a more complex pattern: religious identification was positively related to identity integration but intensified the negative association between religious rejection and life satisfaction. In contrast, strong identification with the LGB in-group buffered against this negative effect. No significant correlates emerged for psychological distress, suggesting it may be shaped by broader factors unrelated to identity. Findings underscore the importance of creating and promoting inclusive in-group norms, particularly within religious communities, and fostering support for individuals navigating both LGB and religious identities.",

Confronting the inefficiencies of artificial intelligence (AI), investigators have turned to the remarkable learning capacities, robustness, and energy efficiency of living cognitive systems as biocomputers and organic controllers. Here, we consider the design, assembly, and programmability of synthetic biological intelligences as well as their utility as platforms to study minimal cognition within a cybernetics framework.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Qualitative methods offer rich insights into human experience, yet the expanding volume of textual data presents analytic challenges. Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), may help researchers organize and interpret qualitative data while maintaining depth and accuracy. It is important to assess the validity and practical suitability of LLMs for qualitative analysis. This systematic review evaluated the extent to which LLMs, specifically generative transformer models such as ChatGPT, can identify themes and patterns consistent with human analysts. Methods: Studies published up to June 2025 were retrieved from PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies directly compared LLM- and human-generated outputs derived from thematic, narrative, or discourse analyses. Results: Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Most used versions of ChatGPT (70.8%), while others utilized Gemini (8.3%), Claude (4.2%), among others. Comparative analyses spanned diverse disciplines, though standardized protocols for conducting LLM-assisted qualitative analysis were lacking. Overall, LLM performance relative to human analysts was rated as moderate to high. Among those studies reporting quantitative indexes, the median % agreement score was 0.80 (range: 0.19-1.00), median Cohen’s Kappa was 0.74 (range 0.38-0.82), and median Cosine coefficient was 0.58 (range: 0.47-0.80), with stronger alignment for semantic or descriptive themes and lower accuracy for interpretive, context-dependent themes. Discussion: Findings provide support for LLMs as complementary tools in qualitative data analysis. Rather than replacing human interpretation, LLMs may serve as efficient aids for data organization and inter-rater comparison to support, but not substitute, qualitative engagement.",

          "abstract": "Recognizing the importance of affect to well-being, a growing number of low-barrier online interventions aim to reduce negative affect and promote positive mood. This broad class of interventions, named positive activity interventions (PAIs), was developed with the intent to enhance positive emotions, meaning, and connectedness, among other positive states. Recent reviews of the PAI literature highlight that many studies are underpowered and lack pre-registration, raising concerns about the validity of their findings. Furthermore, existing research has focused primarily on self-focused PAIs and assumes treatment effect homogeneity, despite research on happiness and well-being highlighting the importance of social connection and person-activity fit. In the current study, we extend past research by conducting a pre-registered field experiment with a large sample (n = 6,411) to compare the mood-boosting effects of five social PAIs and an active control. We found that four of the five PAIs improved mood valence compared to the active control, but there were no differences between the five activities in terms of change to mood intensity or bearability. We found support for the person-fit hypothesis but not for the person-activity fit moderation hypothesis, suggesting that PAI delivery for mood improvement can be standardized and more cost-effective than previously assumed.",

Because psychometric models produce numeric quantities that are typically assigned to persons for some purpose, psychometrics is sometimes characterized as a scientific discipline concerned with the practice of psychological measurement. The historical roots of psychometrics come from an interest in the quantitative study of individual differences. Technological advance through the first quarter of the 21st century has led to the development and evaluation of increasingly complex and specialized mathematical models. There can be significant syntactical barriers to understanding these models, making it easy to lose sight of philosophical questions and debates about the meaning and interpretation of the latent variables these models contain.

Directly before and following the outcome of the vote, Leave voters reported relatively higher wellbeing compared to Remain voters, with this wellbeing advantage being especially prominent after the formal implementation of the referendum in 2020. Differences are observed across indicators of both psychological and economic wellbeing. The effects are particularly pronounced among men, older adults, low-income individuals, the self-employed, and those with local minority political views.

          "abstract": "Academia suffers from various equity issues. One such issue is gender inequality in authorship, where many studies show that women are less represented compared to men. Due to authorship differences across disciplines, the goal of this study is to provide a current overview of the gender distribution of authorship within music psychology. A total of 3,373 papers published between 2000 and 2025 across five core music psychology journals were analysed with respect to author gender and authorship role (first, last, solo, and coauthor). In addition, we explored gender patterns related to citations, open-access publishing, and keywords. Overall, women authors were in the minority, accounting for 40.2% of all authors. However, the distribution of authorship roles diverged notably from this overall proportion: women were more likely to be first authors (odds ratio, OR = 1.41), equally likely to be solo authors (OR = 1.11) or coauthors (OR = 1.00), but less likely to be last authors (OR = 0.73). These patterns have become more pronounced over the past 15 years. No substantial gender differences in citation counts were observed. Analyses of geographical variation revealed clear country and continental differences, potentially reflecting both the status of women and the historical development of the discipline in particular regions. Finally, an examination of keywords suggested broad thematic preferences differing by gender. Although this work overall shows that the field of music psychology is more balanced than some other (STEM) fields, it provides a picture to inspire discussions and initiatives to further promote fairness and equity in academia.",

          "authors": "Athulya Aravind; Karissa A Sanchez; Kristen Syrett",
          "abstract": "When asked to count using basic-level noun descriptions (e.g. fork), children often count both whole objects and 'partial objects' (e.g., a broken fork-piece) as one unit, diverging systematically from adults. We test one class of explanations for this ‘over-counting’ behavior: that children apply nouns to objects more permissively than adults, and then count those objects they have labeled with the noun. In a two-task study, we examined how categorization of a partial object under a count noun related to numerical evaluations of sets that included that object, including cases where the numerical expressions involved fractions. Adults categorized and counted partial objects conservatively, often excluding them from the category and counting them, at most, for a fractional share (1/2). Children were more permissive in both tasks: they frequently accepted partial objects as noun category members and counted them on par with wholes (as |1|). Strikingly, children’s numerical judgments were often incongruous with their categorization: they sometimes rejected a partial object as a category member, but still counted it as |1|. We argue that while children are indeed more flexible in their noun application, their counting behavior calls for a different account. We propose that children lack the numerical capacities to represent and reason over fractional amounts, and default to a natural number scale even when adults use a finer-grained measurement scale. Children may recognize that the partial fork contributes some non-zero amount to a sum, but the only way they can add it to that sum is as |1|.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, the testing community has striven to ensure fairness in tests and test items. Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and  demonstrate how our approach differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study. We further illustrate its application to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam and a real dataset from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, concluding with broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate whether pre-stroke cognitive reserve moderates the relationship between executive dysfunction and depressive symptoms in long-term stroke survivors. We hypothesized that higher post-stroke executive dysfunction scores would be associated with higher depressive symptom scores, and that greater pre-stroke cognitive reserve would attenuate this association. \n\nMethod: This study utilized data from the OX-CHRONIC study, involving 105 remotely-assessed long-term stroke survivors at approximately 4.57 years post-stroke. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and executive dysfunction was assessed using the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS), OCS-Plus, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Hayling Sentence Completion Test, and Backwards Digit Span. Cognitive Reserve was measured using the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), including education, working activity, and leisure activity subscales. Multiple regression models evaluated the moderating effect of Cognitive Reserve on executive dysfunction and depressive symptoms.\n\nResults: Higher executive dysfunction scores were significantly associated with higher depressive symptom scores (ρ = -.32, p = .003). Cognitive Reserve moderated this relationship, with higher levels of pre-stroke Cognitive Reserve strengthening the relationship between executive functioning and depressive symptoms (interaction term: β = -0.04, p = .01). Exploratory analyses revealed that the education subscale of CRIq significantly moderated this relationship (β = -0.06, p = .002), while working and leisure activities did not.\n\nConclusions: Pre-stroke Cognitive Reserve, particularly educational attainment, may strengthen executive function’s protective effect on depressive symptoms in long-term stroke. This underscores the importance of fostering cognitively stimulating activities throughout the lifespan to enhance resilience against post-stroke cognitive and emotional challenges.",

To stave off disaster, individuals must address polarizing climate issues across deep social and ideological divides to take collective action. Drawing on social perspective taking theory, we investigate the effects of a “common ground” strategy–i.e., first acknowledging compelling aspects of respondents’ opinions on a proposed climate solution before disagreeing. Across four online experiments (N=1,839), participants exposed to this strategy reported enhanced relationship-relevant outcomes—including greater perceived similarity, fairness, and mutual perspective taking—compared to those who faced immediate disagreement. These findings demonstrate the power of perspective-taking communication and suggest a practical, scalable strategy for fostering constructive engagement across ideological divides. Effortfully taking another’s perspective appears promising as a strategy to establish a sense of common ground with those holding opposing points of view. The resulting relational benefits enhance the prospects for continued collaboration across differences—precisely what will be required to address the climate crisis.",

          "abstract": "Background \nAdolescents are a notoriously hard-to-engage audience in digital health communication. Many strategies have aimed to increase communication effectiveness by personalising what is said, but have largely neglected how it is said. Addressing this gap, we introduce an innovative approach to personalised health communication: automated AI-based linguistic tailoring. Using large language model style transfer, we mimic adolescents’ individual communication style to test if linguistically tailored health messages promote attitude change and healthier dietary behaviour. \n\nMethods \nWe conducted a preregistered 2-week randomised controlled trial with 587 adolescents (aged 13–16) in the UK and Ireland. Participants were allocated to one of four arms: no health messages (passive control), non-tailored health messages (active control), tailored health messages, or both message types presented in counterbalanced order in weeks 1 and 2. This enabled between-subject and within-subject comparisons. The primary outcome was plant-based lunch choice  (yes/no); secondary outcomes assessed evaluations of the messages and their source. \n\nFindings \nAdolescents receiving health messages (tailored or not) increasingly chose plant-based lunches more often over time than those receiving no messages (OR = 1.06, 95% CrI [1.02, 1.09]; pd = 1.000; BF₁₀ = 35.39). This effect was similar for tailored and non-tailored conditions (OR = 1.01, 95% CrI [0.98, 1.05]; pd = .731; BF₁₀ = 0.12). However, exploratory analyses indicated higher ratings of relevance (BF₁₀ = 3.50), personalisation (BF₁₀ = 4.93), and source liking (BF₁₀ = 3.38) for linguistic tailoring in the second week of the intervention. \n\nInterpretation \nFact-based dietary health messages effectively promoted plant-based lunch choices, although this behavioural effect seemed driven more by content than by style. However, with repeated exposure, linguistic tailoring enhanced several message and source evaluations, indicating promise for future AI-driven personalised health campaigns and youth communication.",

This study conceptualized life satisfaction/quality as subjective global evaluations of one’s life, including perceived quality, satisfaction, and happiness. This conceptualization allowed life satisfaction/quality to vary over time for a broader range of individuals (including differently-abled individuals). An online sample of 2271 individuals completed a survey and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses were used to create the 10-item and 5-item SQLS scales. The IRT findings demonstrated that the SQLS offered markedly higher information for discriminating individual differences than existing scales, translating into higher precision and power (larger effect sizes) for detecting between-group differences. EFA and CFA analyses in separate sample halves supported the single factor structure of the SQLS. IRT parameter invariance analyses and CFA-based measurement invariance analyses suggested stringent invariance of the SQLS across gender, age, sexual orientation, race, education level, and income groups, outperforming the SWLS. Furthermore, the SQLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency of the across 37 more focused demographic groups. The SQLS scales demonstrated robust convergent validity and discriminant validity with 22 conceptual boundary constructs. Bifactor models highlighted the advantages of the SQLS at an item level, with all of its items showing strong trait loadings on a global factor and markedly lower divergent loadings on a scale-specific factor. Finally, the SQLS demonstrated significantly larger Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) effect sizes for detecting improvement in life satisfaction than existing scales, suggesting that it is markedly more responsive to detecting improvement over time. Implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Morphological knowledge serves as a powerful heuristic for vocabulary growth and contributes significantly to the speed and efficiency of reading. While research has long sought to explain how the knowledge of derivational morphology is acquired, previous approaches have struggled to capture the nuanced and complex ways in which derivational morphemes are used in written language, particularly that these morphemes contribute to meaning in a graded manner and that noise introduced by misleading forms (e.g., deliver) can impede learning. Our approach builds on earlier insights but moves beyond them by combining a large-scale analysis of vocabulary used in 1,200 popular books with computational modelling to explore how learning of derivational affixes may occur from text containing naturally occurring noise. We use a compositional distributional semantic model to investigate what can be learned about the meanings of individual English prefixes and suffixes through reading and evaluate the model’s performance against data from 120 adults in a lexical processing task. Our findings demonstrate that, despite the presence of noise, natural text contains sufficient structure to support the extraction of core affix semantics, and that readers are attuned to the complex patterns that shape affix use in the wild. This work contributes a new dimension to a more principled and psychologically grounded account of morpheme learning, and we discuss both this contribution and the broader insights it offers for language research.",

          "authors": "Reiner Vinicius Perozzo; Felipe Flores Kupske",
          "abstract": "This article aims to present a historiographic reflection on the trajectory of speech sounds in linguistic studies, from the earliest systematic records to more\ncontemporary approaches. The starting point is the work of Panini, whose Sanskrit grammar represents one of the earliest known attempts at a systematic description of linguistic sounds. The analysis continues with the 19th-century Neogrammarians, who established a scientific model of sound change and laying the groundwork for what is now recognized as historical phonology. At the turn of the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure’s contribution redefined the role of sound in linguistic theory by integrating it into the linguistic sign within a relational and structural system. The article then examines the contributions of Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle, who introduced the notion of acoustically based distinctive features, developing a phonological model strongly supported by the spectrographic analysis of speech. This model was reinterpreted by Chomsky and Halle from an articulatory perspective, within the framework of generative phonology. This way, sound came to be conceived as a set of abstract articulatory features capable of explaining both phonological regularities and constraints in natural languages. This paper also considers contributions from speech perception schools, such as the psychoacoustic theory, the motor theory, and the direct realist theory. These perspectives investigate speech sounds based on mental, motor, and gestural dimensions, emphasizing the relationship between perceived sounds, the articulatory movements that generate them, and the sensory mechanisms involved in their decoding. The final part of the text highlights gestural proposals that conceptualize the speech sound as an acoustic-articulatory gesture and seek to overcome traditional divisions between phonetics and phonology. The discussion emphasizes the role of gestural borders in\nthe symbolic projection of sounds, the importance of the auditory-acoustic link, and the processes of gestural realignment and reconfiguration through which phonological regularities become grammaticalized. As a major contribution, the article also introduces a perspective that incorporates pragmatic and contextual elements into the perception of sounds, proposing a view of speech sounds as embodied indices, socially situated and symbolically charged. Ultimately, sound is portrayed as a omplex phenomenon that articulates physical, social, perceptual, and indexical dimensions of verbal language.",

          "abstract": "Organizational support theory suggests that human resource practices are important antecedents of perceived organizational support which, in turn, influences employees’ orientation toward their organization and their work behavior, including further engagement with human resource practices. Based on organizational support theory and social exchange theory, we hypothesized positive and reciprocal within-person relations between work flexibilization and perceived organizational support. We tested these hypotheses using 30 waves of longitudinal data collected between July 2020 and December 2022 from n = 1,000 full-time employees in Germany. Using an autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR), results suggest that higher levels of work flexibilization are associated with subsequently higher levels of perceived organizational support, and vice versa. These results suggest a dynamic and reciprocal within- person process wherein positive deviations from one’s average trajectory of work flexibilization (perceived organizational support) are subsequently related to higher levels of perceived organizational support (work flexibilization). These findings imply a virtuous cycle where work flexibilization leads to more favorable perceptions of organizational support which, in turn, leads to an increase in employees’ use of work flexibilization. However, such positive effects may be short-lived (i.e., lasting between approximately 15- and 20-months), likely diminishing in strength over time.",

To synthesize the evidence, we convened over 120 researchers with diverse perspectives to evaluate 26 commonly cited claims using a Delphi process. A large majority agree that: Adolescent mental health has declined in several Western countries; heavy smartphone and social media use can cause sleep problems; such use correlates with attention problems and behavioural addiction; among girls, social media use may be associated with body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, exposure to mental disorders, harassment and predation. Most other claims were judged to have insufficient evidence due to limited, inconsistent, or non-causal data. Researchers also raised broader concerns, including challenges in measuring mental health and establishing causality, geographic bias in existing evidence, and the need for policies that account for diverse risks and avoid unintended harms. This collective review offers a foundation for future research and policy.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is typically defined as the production of ideas or artifacts that are both novel and appropriate, yet there is still no simple formalism that specifies how generative, evaluative, integrative, and metacognitive processes combine over time to yield creative outcomes. This article proposes a compact “geometry” of creative cognition expressed by the equation E = (G R I M)^T, where E denotes Eureka-level creative effectiveness, G wide stochastic generation, R focused reflection and evaluation, I multimodal integration and iteration between intuitive and analytic codes, M metacontrol via implicit and explicit metacognition, and T temporal consistency across episodes. To make E empirically tractable, creative effectiveness is operationalized through novelty, usefulness, and diversity (NUD), which mirror evolutionary tactics of variation, selection, and maintenance of variation. The article maps each equation factor onto behavioral and neural indices, highlights the central role of metacontrol in balancing persistence and flexibility, and situates the framework within developmental, individual-difference, and evolutionary perspectives. It then derives implications for the assessment and training of creativity, emphasizing creative metacognition as a key leverage point, and extends the geometry to artificial architectures and human–AI co creation. The resulting formulation provides testable predictions about how measures of generation, evaluation, integration, metacognition, and practice should interact to shape NUD profiles over time, and offers a principled bridge between human and artificial creativity.",

          "abstract": "Science has long struggled with unsuccessful replications and reproductions, a challenge that raises questions about the robustness and credibility of research findings. One potential contributing factor is selective reporting or nonpublication of certain results based on their direction or strength, leading to publication bias. To better understand its extent and risk factors, we examined 178 successful study submissions to two German probabilistic panels (GESIS Panel, SOEP-IS), fielded between 2013 and 2021, and compared the hypotheses and exploratory analyses stated in the original study submissions with their presentation in subsequent publications. Using a coding scheme, we extracted information on the submissions, publications, and authors, and investigated which characteristics are associated with publication bias. Experimental study design, third-party funding, preregistration of hypotheses, and economic studies were the strongest and most stable predictors of lower risk of publication bias across multiple outcomes: publication likelihood, test and hit rate of hypotheses. The study highlights the complexity and multi-faceted nature of publication bias in the social, economic, and behavioral sciences, and shows that researchers (e.g., preregistration), funding agencies (e.g., incentives), and journals (e.g., peer review) play distinct roles in shaping publication bias. It thereby points to areas for reform in the research and publication process.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in cognitive science is whether cognitive control recruits domain-general or domain-specific processes. A useful paradigm to study this is the congruency sequence effect, which reflects the reduced impact of congruency after an incongruent trial. Many studies examined the congruency sequence effect across task in order to investigate domain generality. However, differences in how task dissimilarity was manipulated led to different conclusions about the nature of adaptive control. Therefore, we conducted a systematic, preregistered meta-analysis of 174 experiments (229 effect sizes). On average, the cross-task congruency sequence effect (Hedges’ gz = 0.252) decreased as task dissimilarity increased, with some factors influencing adaptive control more than others. Especially when tasks used a different response modality or conflict arose from different irrelevant stimulus dimensions, we observed a decreased cross-task congruency sequence effect, suggesting adaptive control is both action-oriented and involves distractor suppression. Notably, however, when tasks shared the same conflict type, larger congruency sequence effects were observed when stimulus and response sets were distinct rather than partially overlapping. Together, these findings refine current theories by pointing to a central role for the different motor modalities, distractor suppression, and shared versus separate task representations, moving beyond a simple domain-general versus domain-specific distinction.\n\nKeywords: meta analysis, conflict adaptation, congruency sequence effect, domain generality, cognitive control",

          "abstract": "Observing others’ actions and imagining oneself performing the same actions (motor imagery) have been linked in the literature in several ways. They have been shown to have overlapping neural representations, both seem to relate to one's ability to move, and both have been shown to positively affect movement rehabilitation. Whether these overlaps reflect a direct functional relationship between motor imagery and the ability to derive relevant information from observed kinematics (action understanding) has not yet been investigated. A previous study found that individuals with low self-reported motor imagery vividness exhibit weaker motor system engagement during action observation than those with typical imagery vividness. The present study provides the first behavioural test of the relationships between motor and general visual imagery vividness and a quantifiable behavioural measure of action understanding - specifically, the ability to judge the weight of objects based on observing someone else lift them. To test the research question across the full imagery spectrum, our recruitment strategy included a high proportion of individuals with very low imagery vividness (often referred to as ‘aphantasia’).  An online sample (N = 392) completed a weight judgement task alongside a matched speed judgement control task. Neither motor imagery vividness (Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2) nor general visual imagery vividness (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) predicted action understanding, with a Bayesian analysis suggesting moderate to strong evidence against any relationship. Overall, our findings suggest that self-reported motor and general visual imagery vividness are functionally independent from action understanding of manual interactions.",

          "abstract": "Prior research on cultural models of agency suggests that intrinsic motivation, such as passion, is a stronger predictor of performance in individualistic contexts (e.g., the United States) than in collectivistic contexts (e.g., China). Much less is known, however, about cultural differences in the perceived value of intrinsic motivation, which may more directly shape daily social processes surrounding motivation. The present research examined cross-cultural differences in the perceived importance of intrinsic motivation for both predicting others’ behavior and influencing others’ behavior. Counterintuitive patterns emerged. Faculty members in Chinese and Japanese higher education institutions ranked passion as a more important evaluative criterion in student selection than did their counterparts in American institutions; across 24 societies, country-level individualism negatively predicted teachers’ self-reported practices of upregulating their students’ intrinsic motivation, as indexed by self-efficacy, value, and interest. These findings suggest that, despite its lower observed value in predicting performance in collectivistic than in individualistic contexts, intrinsic motivation is nevertheless perceived to be more important for both predicting and influencing others’ behavior in collectivistic contexts. Rather than negating previous evidence on cultural differences in the predictive value of intrinsic motivation, our results offer a complementary picture of cultural differences in its perceived value and call for more nuanced interpretations of the roles that passion, interest, and other forms of intrinsic motivation play in collectivistic societies.",

          "abstract": "Although skilled readers make use of information about words adjacent to the fixated word, developing readers are limited in their uptake of parafoveal information, leading to the expectation that they may be entirely insensitive to the presence of adjacent stimuli. However, lack of benefit from nearby items does not imply that those items cannot negatively impact the recognition process. Here we report two experiments with 62 Norwegian children attending Grade 2 and 141 in Grade 5 using a modified version of the visual world paradigm with masked flanked visual word targets. Compared to a baseline condition with no flankers, we found that the presence of flanking words or unfamiliar-font strings strongly interfered with lexical activation of the foveated target word; in contrast, strings of repeated symbols had no effect. The results were very similar for the two grades, except that the more advanced readers also exhibited an interaction of flanking condition with target word frequency, specifically, smaller frequency effects when flanked by words. The findings indicate that adjacent stimuli are to some extent simultaneously processed along with the foveated word and strongly interfere with it, from the earliest stages and throughout reading development. We propose that management of interference from adjacent words is a major factor modulating the development and expression of reading skill.",

Cognitive Bias Modification for Appraisals (CBM-APP) aims to train patients to make more functional trauma-related appraisals and has been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms. However, little is known about how this training affects the functional interrelations among symptoms and cognitive appraisals. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial involving 77 adult patients diagnosed with PTSD (CBM-APP: n = 37; control training: n = 40), we applied cross-sectional network analysis to examine changes in the structure and centrality of associations among PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognition and mood, hyperarousal) and trauma-related cognitive measures. To capture multiple levels of cognitive processing, we included responses during a scenario task (reflective, idiosyncratic, spontaneous appraisals) and the Implicit Association Test (automatic self-associations). Four Gaussian Graphical Models were estimated (pre-/post-training × CBM-APP vs. control group). While overall network connectivity did not differ significantly across networks, descriptive patterns indicated that Alterations in Cognition and Mood emerged as the most central node in both groups at post-training assessment. Further, in the CBM-APP group, the centrality of implicit trauma-related associations decreased pre- to post-training, suggesting potential decoupling of automatic negative self-associations from symptom activation. Given the small sample and moderate network stability, findings are preliminary but suggest that CBM-APP may influence the relational structure of PTSD symptoms and cognitions, offering insight into putative mechanisms of cognitive therapeutic change.",

          "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) is a highly influential modeling framework for studying decisions under uncertainty, allowing researchers to disentangle two central components of judgment: Discriminability, the ability to accurately distinguish signal from noise, and response bias, the tendency to favor one type of judgment over the other. The present work compares two approaches for analyzing hierarchically-structured SDT data: The commonly-used two-step approach, which is based on independent individual-level SDT estimates, and a maximum likelihood mixed-effects SDT approach, which uses generalized linear mixed models to estimate individual-level parameters based on a joint population distribution. Across three simulation studies, we demonstrate that the two-step approach produces substantial distortions in both single- and multilevel estimates of discriminability, response criterion and differences therein. These distortions depend in complex ways on the true population means, true population differences, the numbers of trials and participants, and dependencies among individual parameters. Crucially, they also lead to inflated Type I error rates for tests of condition differences in both SDT parameters. In contrast, mixed-effects SDT models yielded effectively unbiased parameter recovery, maintained nominal Type I error rates across a broad range of simulated conditions, and provided higher statistical power for detecting differences in discriminability and response criterion. To facilitate the adoption of this approach,we provide an easy-to-use R package called mesdt and an accompanying tutorial.",

We explicate the potential of Principal-Agent Theory for the case of short-video apps (e.g., TikTok). Using dyadic agent-based modeling, we examine two widely discussed phenomena: perceptions of responsive algorithms that ‘know’ users, and users’ attempts to curate content by ‘training’ recommenders. By combining a rational choice perspective with computational modeling, we offer a blueprint for critically examining the dynamics of agency in algorithmic media, with implications for further domains such as well-being, privacy, and media governance.",

We develop the counterfactual replacement model, which runs simulations of alternative scenarios to determine the probability that the outcome would have differed if the person of interest had been replaced. The model predicts that a person is held more responsible, the more difficult it would have been to replace them. To test the model's predictions, we design a paradigm that quantitatively varies replaceability by manipulating the number of replacements and the probability with which each replacement would have been available. Across three experiments featuring increasingly complex scenarios, we show that the model explains participants' responsibility judgments well in both social and physical settings, and better than alternative models that rely only on features of what actually happened.",

          "abstract": "Museums are increasingly shifting from passive spaces of display to active sites of learning where knowledge is co-created through material and social engagement. This chapter examines how models and modelling can serve as powerful mediators of understanding in museum education, bridging conceptual knowledge and embodied experience. We first synthesise key theoretical traditions, i.e. experience-based learning, constructionism, tinkering, makerspaces, object-based, model-based learning, etc., to clarify how these approaches conceptualise modelling as a form of “learning by making.” Despite widespread assumptions about its benefits, empirical research on modelling in museums remains largely qualitative, case-based, and fragmented, leaving causal mechanisms underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a Factorial Mixed methods (FM) paradigm, an interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental design with qualitative inquiry “in the wild” of real museum contexts. This paradigm allows for controlled, systematic testing of educational variables while preserving ecological validity. We illustrate the FM approach through a field experiment at Steno Museum involving 152 eighth-grade students participating in astronomy workshops. Using a 2×2 factorial design, we varied two key factors, physical modelling and social interaction, to examine their individual and combined effects on learning, engagement, and enjoyment. The results showed that both factors independently enhanced learning and that their combination produced an additive effect, yielding greater outcomes than either factor alone. Qualitative observations further revealed how collaborative model-building fostered deeper conceptual reflection, creativity, and embodied understanding. Together, these findings provide rare causal evidence that modelling and social collaboration jointly enhance learning in museum settings. The chapter concludes by outlining how the FM paradigm can advance a more generalisable, experimentally grounded science of modelling across museums and disciplines.",

          "authors": "Ryuhei Yasuda; Kyoshiro Sasaki",
          "abstract": "Sense of agency (SoA) refers to the feeling that one’s actions cause environmental changes. A previous study showed that SoA is enhanced when keypress-triggered motion stimuli move faster, suggesting that SoA depends on the extent of action outcomes. We examined whether the numerical magnitude of action outcomes similarly affects SoA. Participants pressed a key, which triggered the presentation of dots (Experiments 1–2) or digit values (Experiment 3), and then rated their SoA on a 10-point scale. Results showed that SoA ratings increased with greater numerical magnitude. However, Experiment 4, using an intentional binding paradigm, found that the interval between the keypress and dot onset was perceived as longer when more dots were presented. This contradicts Experiments 1–3 and suggests the observed SoA enhancement might stem from response bias (e.g., higher numerical magnitude of the outcomes leading to higher values in the rating/estimating phase). To test this, Experiment 5 replicated Experiment 2 with a reversed rating scale (1 = strongest, 10 = weakest) and again found higher scores with greater magnitude, supporting the response bias account. In contrast, the effect of motion speed was unaffected by rating direction, suggesting a genuine influence on SoA. These findings highlight the importance of carefully distinguishing true effects from mere response biases when evaluating how outcome magnitude influences SoA.",

Responses were coded on a 5-point Likert scale, with binge-watching hours self-reported. Correlational analysis revealed that greater hours spent binge-watching were positively associated with stronger mindset shifts, particularly in the domains of Behavioral Shifts &amp; Lifestyle (r = .58) and Identity &amp; Self-Perception (r = .53).

          "authors": "Milan Andrejević; Jakob Hohwy; Linda Barclay",
          "abstract": "Dignity is central to how we treat each other. Whereas philosophical theories argue that violating someone’s dignity distinctively involves humiliation, it is unknown how people actually identify violations of dignity, casting doubt on whether dignity is a distinct value that can meaningfully guide action. Here, we propose a new hypothesis, where violations are recognised as dignity-related when they target attributes that are stigmatised and that victims plausibly and immutably hold. Participants (N = 277) performed a novel task; they rated a set of textual vignettes describing a ‘perpetrator’ making offensive remarks to a ‘victim’ on how well each offensive remark corresponds to a dignity violation as opposed to a respect violation. Before rating, participants were informed (across 3 within-subject conditions) whether the attribute targeted by the offence was immutable, improvable, or absent. After completing the main ratings, participants also reported how stigmatised the offence-targeted attributes are in their society. Our hypotheses, methods, and analyses were preregistered. Comparing across within-subject conditions, we found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that the plausibility and immutability increase how much the violations relate to dignity. Using Bayesian general linear mixed models, we also found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that perceptions of the offence-targeted attributes as stigmatised predict increases in dignity-relatedness. These findings are first to provide empirical anchors for a distinct ethics of dignity. Our implications include evidence-based actionable guidelines for treating people with dignity that can be used to promote ethical practice in organisations and service industries.",

          "authors": "Sepehrdad Rahimian",
          "abstract": "Despite notable empirical advances, the science of consciousness lacks firm conceptual footing. Competing theories not only disagree on mechanisms but also define consciousness in mutually incompatible ways, and criteria for evaluating theoretical success remain vague. I argue that this situation arises from a lack of pragmatic pressure within the field. Theories are rewarded for offering ever more elaborate explanations of “consciousness-as-such” rather than for solving concrete, real-world problems. This paper proposes a pragmatic shift. Rather than beginning with metaphysical commitments about what consciousness truly is, scientific inquiry should focus on developing models that demonstrably advance well-defined objectives. Such an approach does not deny the possibility that consciousness includes aspects beyond scientific access; it takes a neutral stance toward that possibility, holding that scientific practice must be guided by problems with pragmatic relevance and clear criteria of success. Drawing on analogies from stock-market trading and examples from the history of science, I suggest that scientific progress does not require a single, final ontology. Newtonian mechanics and relativity, for instance, present incompatible pictures of space and time, yet both function effectively within their domains. Likewise, consciousness research can proceed under an ontologically pluralist framework, enabling genuine scientific progress rather than endless theoretical disputes.",

          "authors": "Daryl Cameron; Paige Amormino; Joel Segel",
          "abstract": "Health policy is motivated by a variety of factors including moral concerns, values and convictions. Policymakers are motivated to consider how constituents and those directly impacted by policies will react to the policies they enact. Thus, it is advantageous for policymakers to understand the psychological processes that shape constituents’ reactions toward health policies. We outline how and when policymakers and constituents are motivated to empathize, moralize, and compromise on divisive health policies, such as opioid-related policies, by considering the motivational frameworks of empathy and the plurality of moral values that inform attitudes. We offer insight for policymakers balancing tradeoffs between different moral values and concerns, suggesting that policymakers should consider cultivating an active dialogue around the relevant moral emotions felt by both supporters and opponents. For example, when considering syringe services programs, supporters and opponents may both be motivated by the moral concern of harm––as supporters may see services as preventing infections and keeping people healthy, while opponents may see services as promoting drug use and in turn, harmful health outcomes. We suggest that such a morally pluralistic effort will (1) highlight moral alignment amongst supporters to cultivate collective resolve and (2) acknowledge the competing moral concerns of opponents so that they feel understood and in turn, feel more willing to understand competing perspectives. While leaning into moral emotions may feel like a turn toward divisiveness, we suggest that acknowledging the plurality of moral values at stake sets the foundation for support and compromise.",

          "authors": "Daniel Thayer; Thomas C Sprague",
          "abstract": "Prominent theories of visual search state that goal-relevant information is maintained in working memory (WM) to guide attention to relevant, searched-for items. Prioritization from WM is sufficiently strong to direct attention towards items that are irrelevant to current search goals. These ‘incidental capture’ results have typically been observed when remembering color or shape stimuli, but, in principle, should similarly occur using other strong guiding features such as motion. However, recent work suggests that neural representations of remembered motion directions are transformed into spatial coordinates. If so, then remembered stimuli which can easily be spatially recoded (e.g., remembered motion direction) should not interfere with visual search when feature-matching distractors are present any more than interference caused by a salient distractor that does not match the contents of WM. We replicated the traditional incidental capture finding for color: distractors matching the remembered color captured attention more than feature singletons. In contrast, when participants were required to remember a motion direction, capture was equal across distractor conditions: salient distractors captured attention, but no additional capture was observed when the remembered motion direction matched the distracting motion direction. Intriguingly, responses were faster when the search target was at a location that neural studies predict would be prioritized if remembered motion was spatially recoded. Our results indicate that some features in WM are more likely to impact attentional processing than others and that this difference in attentional capture between feature dimensions may emerge due to the ability to reformat memory representations.",

          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are a marker of deficient socioemotional processing linked to severe conduct problems. Although resting-state studies implicate altered large-scale network organization in CU traits, few have comprehensively examined connectivity both within and between the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks and none have done so across development in large samples. Methods. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 11,868, 48% female), we examined associations between CU traits and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within and between the DMN, FPN, and SN with repeated timepoints (4) across youth spanning 9 to 18 years-old. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess main effects of CU traits along with moderators of age and sex, and sensitivity analyses included covariates for co-occurring psychopathology. Results. CU traits were associated with reduced within-DMN rsFC. No interactions between CU traits and sex were found, but an interaction between CU traits and age emerged, showing a negative association between CU traits and DMN-SN rsFC was evident in mid-to-late adolescence, with higher-CU youth showing an age-related decline in DMN-SN rsFC. Conclusions. These findings suggest youth with elevated CU traits exhibit atypical development of resting-state connectivity in networks crucial for empathy and salience processing. Specifically, youth with elevated CU traits showed persistent DMN hypoconnectivity and a later-emerging but accelerated age-related segregation of DMN-SN connectivity during adolescence. This pattern may reflect delayed yet ultimately exaggerated differentiation of socioaffective networks, highlighting adolescence as a developmental window for interventions targeting socioemotional functioning.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically examines the proposed regulatory changes by the College of Psychologists and Behaviour Analysts of Ontario (CPBAO), which seek to modernize entry-to-practice standards for psychologists and psychological associates in the province. The analysis places Ontario’s changing regulatory environment within the broader Canadian context, comparing provincial standards, training pathways, and workforce availability. Using empirical data, stakeholder feedback, and consensus reports, this manuscript examines evidence to test three implied hypotheses of the proposed changes: 1) they will increase the number of psychologists in Ontario, 2) they will improve access to psychological services, and 3) they will not elevate the risk to public safety as practitioner competence will remain the same. Findings suggest that lowering entry standards and shifting from external accreditation to a college-approved process are unlikely to significantly increase access to psychologists. Evidence does not support the view that competence will remain unchanged among trainees from programs that substantially deviate from accredited models. Removing evaluative regulations may allow some less-prepared individuals into practice. An evidence-based, data-driven approach grounded in transparent consultation and continuous evaluation is recommended to ensure that regulatory changes genuinely improve access to competent psychological care across both Ontario and Canada.",

          "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains limited by reliance on cognitive symptoms that appear only after significant neurodegeneration has occurred. Although the traditional memory-first model assumes that early pathology begins in medial temporal lobe structures, growing evidence shows that initial decline often emerges in distributed association cortices that support sensory processing, perceptual integration, motor planning, timing precision, executive control, and affective regulation. These findings motivate the AD Spectrum Hypothesis, which proposes that early AD manifests through heterogeneous combinations of sensory, perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional changes rather than a uniform trajectory of episodic memory loss. To evaluate whether existing behavioral tasks capture this multidomain variability, we reviewed studies comparing healthy controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with early AD using the Sensation, Perception, Action, Cognition, Emotion (SPACE) framework. Across modalities, MCI and early AD showed graded impairments in anticipatory motor control, gait dynamics, speech acoustics, visuomotor organization, fine-motor timing, perceptual stability, and emotional modulation. These findings indicate that early AD affects multiple functional systems and is most sensitively detected by tasks that engage several SPACE domains simultaneously. Based on this evidence, we propose a multidomain behavioral battery as a promising noninvasive approach for improving early detection of AD.",

In this study, we systematically compared eight CST: sleep² with Polar Verity Sense (VS) and Polar H10, Oura Ring 3, Apple Watch Series 9, Fitbit Charge 6,  Garmin  Vivoactive  6  &amp;  Venu  3,  WHOOP  4,  and  Circul+,  against  home-based ambulatory PSG. Eighteen participants completed five consecutive nights (Monday  to  Friday)  of  home  PSG  while  wearing  two  paired  devices  of  each CST. Controlled sleep manipulations, such as restricted and extended sleep, were included in the protocol to challenge the devices’ algorithms under varied levels of difficulty. Performance evaluation followed a standardised framework incorporating both epoch-by-epoch and discrepancy analyses to assess multi-class sleep-staging performance and agreement across key sleep parameters. Epoch-by-epoch accuracy  and  Cohen’s κ  were  as  follows:  sleep² -Polar  VS  =  83.7%  (κ  =  0.76), sleep²-Polar H10 = 84.04% (κ = 0.76), Oura Ring 3 = 72.5% (κ = 0.59), Apple Watch Series 9 = 72.3% (κ = 0.56), Fitbit Charge 6 = 66.16% (κ = 0.47), Garmin Vivoactive 6 &amp; Venu 3 = 63.4% (κ = 0.41), WHOOP 4 = 65.15% (κ = 0.48), and Circul+ = 55.59% (κ = 0.33). Discrepancy analysis revealed systematic and proportional biases across CST devices: most wrist-worn devices overestimated sleep time and underestimated wake after sleep onset, with error magnitude increasing drastically in atypical nights characterised by fragmented, restricted, or extended sleep. Cardiac-derived arm- and chest-band sleep² derived sleep metrics showed minor deviation from PSG, whereas Oura devices exhibited moderate but variable levels of bias. Overall, these findings reveal substantial variability across CST and highlight the importance of standardised bench marking to support the scientific and clinical use of wearable-derived sleep macrostructure.",

We evaluated probability nomograms and machine learning (ML) algorithms (logistic regression, LASSO, SVM, random forest) on accuracy, calibration, and generalizability for predicting current ODD or CD diagnoses. \n\nMethod: Youth aged 5–18 receiving outpatient care were recruited from academic (n=622) and community (n=506) clinics. Predictors included demographics, comorbid diagnoses, mood and behavioral indicators. The criterion was K-SADS diagnoses of ODD/CD. Models were trained in the academic sample, using the community sample for external validation. AUC quantified accuracy, Spiegelhalter's z indexed calibration, and cross-site performance measured generalizability. \n\nResults: For ODD prediction, the nomogram selected CBCL Aggression as the strongest predictor and reached AUC≈.70 in both samples. ML models achieved good discrimination (AUC≈.86) with good-to-moderate calibration in the academic sample, deteriorating to fair accuracy with severe miscalibration in the community setting. For CD prediction, the nomogram built on CBCL Rule-Breaking showed good accuracy (AUC≈.82) in both samples. ML models showed near-excellent accuracy (AUC≈.88) in the academic sample but underperformed in the community sample (AUC=.73-.76), though LASSO, SVM, and random forest maintained good calibration. \n\nConclusion: Across both disorders, nomograms demonstrated lower accuracy but strong cross-site stability, while ML using more predictors achieved superior accuracy that did not generalize. The nomogram offers a low-cost and parsimonious tool. Machine learning is best suited for well-resourced clinics where model training data closely resemble the new cases encountered in practice.",

In these experiments, participants learned object images through either drawing a copy of the image, writing a description of the image, tracing the image, or simply studying the image. Subsequently, participants had an old/new recognition test and a test of object feature binding (indicating where the object was located and what color the object was). This experiment was conducted with younger adults and older adults. For the younger adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for both object recognition and object feature binding. For the older adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for object recognition, while studying and describing were the best strategies for object feature binding. For both groups, tracing was not beneficial for feature binding.

          "authors": "Hynek Cígler",
          "abstract": "Reversed publication bias—the idea that politically sensitive findings may be selectively suppressed in favor of null effects—has recently gained attention in public and online discussions. Roth et al.’s (2015) meta-analysis of the association between intelligence and school grades (ρ = .54) has been frequently cited as supposed evidence, because its funnel plots appear to show larger correlations in studies with smaller sampling error. However, this study demonstrates that the pattern is entirely spurious. Reanalysis of the original data reveals that the asymmetry arises from the use of the conditional standard error of the correlation coefficient, which depends on the observed value of r and mechanically induces funnel-plot skew. When more appropriate methods, such as Fisher’s z-transformation with unconditional standard errors, are applied, the asymmetry disappears and Egger’s test becomes nonsignificant, t(238) = −1.41, p = .160. A complementary simulation study further confirms that conditional-error weighting can generate strong false signals of reversed publication bias and inflate total effect-size estimates even when no bias is present. Overall, these findings provide no evidence for reversed publication bias in research on intelligence and school grades. Using conditional standard errors of raw correlation coefficients in meta-analyses should be completely avoided.",

          "abstract": "Introduced in 2014 and revised in 2018, the entropic brain hypothesis has accrued a wealth of supportive evidence. The hypothesis states that— along a dimension of breadth of conscious experience— ‘expansive states’ reliably exhibit increased brain entropy whereas the inverse applies for states of no or reduced consciousness. Examples of expansive states include those of expert meditation, flicker light stimulation, the near-death experience, atypical breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep, the pre-ictal aura, unmedicated early psychosis and psychedelic drug states. Example states of no or reduced consciousness with low brain entropy, include disorders of consciousness, deep sleep, the anesthetized state, seizure, post-stroke, ageing, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative disorders. It is shown here that the entropic brain has convergent, correlative, predictive, discriminative and external validity. Regarding its predictive validity, increased brain entropy under psilocybin predicts subsequent improvements in mental health (improved well-being 1-month post-dose). Regarding its discriminative validity, changes in brain entropy selectively index the breadth of subjective experience versus alternative dimensions, such as arousal. Regarding portability/external validity, an entropy (temperature) function is used in generative artificial intelligence. In conclusion, the entropic brain is proving to be a useful model of conscious states.",

          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making—where users retain responsibility for the final decision but receive input from algorithms prior to or during the judgment process—has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

Here we report a preregistered [osf.io/md2ek], randomized experiment (N=404 adolescents aged 13-17) to compare the quality of relationship advice from parents against that generated by LLMs. In a within-subjects, repeated-measures design, participants read three realistic dating conflict scenarios, each drawn from a popular relationship advice application, and then read advice about how to respond. The advice was randomly assigned (and counter-balanced) to either an LLM or a parent. The LLM-provided advice was split into two sources: a fine-tuned LLM (AskElle) that was trained to provide relationship advice or an off-the-shelf LLM (either ChatGPT or Gemini). Participants then rated the responses for help with coping, likelihood of implementation, and trustworthiness. Data were analyzed using a random-intercept model estimated with a Bayesian, machine-learning method (stochtree). The LLMs outperformed parents’ advice by approximately 0.3 standard deviations across the primary outcomes, all pr(ATE&gt;0)&gt;.99. The fine-tuned LLM was just as effective as the off-the-shelf LLMs, when averaging across the three trials. Secondary analyses (see Figure 1) showed that participants preferred the off-the-shelf LLMs when they were the first piece of advice they saw, pr(Diff)&gt;.99. But they strongly preferred the fine-tuned LLM when it was third or after repeated exposure. Once participants could directly compare all three sources, they overwhelmingly preferred the fine-tuned LLM’s advice, pr(Diff)&gt;.99 over both parents and off-the-shelf LLMs. Thus in real-world contexts, with repeated consultation of an AI tool, generic advice from an LLM is likely to become less effective with adolescents seeking more attuned relationship advice. Qualitative, natural-language analyses identified elements of the advice that were most and least successful. Parents’ language tended to diminish adolescents’ feelings, dismissing their relationship problems as temporary and superficial. Off-the-shelf LLMs were overly accommodating and affirming, sometimes reinforcing more extreme appraisals and possibly entrenching young people in harmful patterns of rumination. The highest-performing answers validated participants’ feelings while challenging their appraisals of the situation, leading teens to a more optimistic appraisal, accompanied by clear action steps with example scripts.",

          "abstract": "Higher education is widely believed to have a liberalizing effect on students, yet empirical findings are mixed. In two studies (total N = 483,885), we investigated the “diploma divide” in the United States. In the past half-century, we found that adults with more education have consistently held more left-leaning views on social but not economic issues. Before the 2010s, however, there were no meaningful, educational differences in the degree to which people identified as liberal versus conservative. In the years since, college graduates have increasingly identified as liberal, while those with some or no college education remained steady. Moreover, in the mid-1990s, students did not come to identify as more left-leaning during their time in higher education. However, they have increasingly done so in the years since. Such within-person changes differ across fields of study, demographics, and other individual characteristics, but are minimally related to the kinds of institutions that students attend. Overall, these findings reveal a striking change in the relationship between higher education and political identity. They also undermine sweeping claims about liberalizing effects of education, calling instead for fine-grained theories about how, when, and for whom attending higher education affects which aspects of ideology.",

          "abstract": "Conversation requires rapid and efficient language processing, which in turn depends on a high degree of automatization. Yet, it remains unclear how such automatization develops in languages that are typically not used for spoken communication, such as Latin. In an online learning experiment, we examined how time pressure and strict linear reading influence sentence processing in Latin. Two groups of participants received identical training materials but differed in these two factors during the learning phase. The results showed that time pressure facilitated automatization in the retrieval and evaluation of linguistic cues (subject animacy and argument order), but it also made it more difficult to override automatized routines when processing semantically unacceptable sentences containing animacy violations. In addition, strict linear reading enhanced incremental and predictive processing, particularly for verb initial sentences. These findings indicate that time pressure and linear reading support the development of efficient processing routines in Latin, highlighting their potential role in optimizing second language learning strategies even for non spoken languages.",

          "abstract": "Theories of political belief systems and inter-attitude structure predict that central attitudes in a belief system will be more resistant to change than peripheral attitudes. The theories hold that by way of their interconnections to many other attitudes, central attitudes in political belief systems are more likely to be held in place by their connections than peripheral attitudes. We formalize this prediction using simulations (Studies 1 and 2). Methodological challenges have previously prevented empirical tests of the prediction at the appropriate, individual level of analysis. We conduct such empirical tests using panel (Studies 3-5, combined N = 2,731) and experimental studies (Studies 4 &amp; 5, combined N = 2,195) of U.S. Americans. We find that central attitudes in political belief systems are more stable over time (Studies 3-5), and elicit more negative cognitions, emotions, and evaluations of argument quality when targeted with a persuasive message (Studies 4 &amp; 5). These results are consistent with the prediction that central attitudes are more resistant to change than peripheral attitudes. Notably, central attitudes were similarly persuadable as peripheral attitudes. These findings both confirm the importance of attitude position in the belief system for attitude stability and highlight the possible need for theory revisions to capture the full pattern of results.",

Specifically, utilizing data from 443 bilingual participants from 11 diverse L1 backgrounds reading 12 English (L2) texts, we investigated 1) the stability of individual reading strategies across texts, 2) cross-linguistic influences of the first language (L1), 3) correspondences between L1 and L2 eye-movement behavior, and 4) the relationship between global reading strategies, L2 comprehension, and L2 proficiency. The analyses that employed the scasim method to quantify scanpath (dis)similarity, that is, how similar global reading strategies are within and between participants and across languages, revealed that individual L2 reading behavior was consistent across L2 texts, but L1 scanpaths did not reliably predict L2 scanpaths. L1 background left a weak but detectable imprint on L2 scanpaths. Finally, global L2 reading behavior was significantly associated with L2 comprehension accuracy and proficiency, with more typical scanpaths linked to better comprehension and higher proficiency. We discuss the results in relation to traditional word-level analyses in L2 reading and emphasize the added value of a scanpath-based approach for assessing global reading behavior cross-linguistically.",

          "abstract": "Self-conscious emotions are a group of emotions related to the social self and navigating the social world. These emotions are theorized to originate from the interplay between early parent-infant interactions and personal temperamental predisposition. However, little is known about their early ontogeny. In this preregistered longitudinal study, we examined the developmental and socialization factors contributing to the emergence of self-conscious emotions: focusing on infants’ reactions to social exposure, a known elicitor of these emotions. Infants participated in a social exposure task, in which they were lavishly complimented in four situations at six-months (N=103) and 15-months (N=77). At the six-month measurement, mother–infant dyads also engaged in two interaction tasks coded for mind-mindedness and positive affective synchrony, and mothers reported on infant temperament. Self-conscious emotional reactions were indexed through coy smiling – a smile accompanied by head and/or gaze aversion. Results showed strong evidence for an effect of time, with six-month-olds displaying more coy smiles than 15-month-olds. Higher negative temperament predicted fewer coy smiles across both measurements. No effects of mind-mindedness or positive affective synchrony were found. These findings suggest that the first self-conscious emotions emerge early in infancy and may be initially shaped primarily by temperamental predispositions, rather than socialization.",

          "authors": "Johanna Funk; Florian Hintz",
          "abstract": "Adults acquire new words, including written and spoken forms across the lifespan. Learning novel words is a dynamic process that progresses from initial familiarization through consolidation towards lexicalization. These processes exhibit substantial interindividual variability. In this study, we leverage this variability to investigate the mechanisms that characterize different learning stages, focusing on the distinct contributions of domain-specific linguistic and domain-general skills.\nAcross three sessions distributed over three weeks, 140 native German participants learned Mandarin Chinese spoken and written (Pinyin) word forms and were tested on the retention of the new knowledge. Additionally, participants completed nine tests assessing linguistic experience, processing speed, auditory and visual short-term memory, and nonverbal reasoning.\nStructural equation modeling, including latent growth curve analysis, revealed that the acquisition and linking of word forms was primarily shaped by domain-general skills: Processing speed supported word form learning at all stages, while auditory short-term memory supported initial but not later learning. A weaker association to linguistic experience was observed in exploratory network analyses with links between receptive vocabulary at all and spelling at initial stages of learning.\nThese findings highlight that learning is conditioned by how fast and efficient incoming information are processed, and that initial learning is constrained by short-term memory capacity. Consistent with the Complementary Learning Systems account, this points towards distinct stages of learning with effortful and controlled processing at early familiarization stages, and more automatic processing at later consolidation-associated stages. The findings suggest that learners may benefit from tailoring initial input to individual memory capacity.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) provide deaf individuals with access to auditory feedback from their own voice when speaking. This experiment investigated whether typical hearing participants can use CI simulated speech feedback for perceptual learning and sensorimotor control of speech. CI simulation was achieved via real-time noise vocoding, a technique that degrades the spectral detail in a speech signal in a manner similar to a CI. 32 participants took part in the experiment. First, participants were tested on their recognition of noise vocoded sentences before and after a training task; either perception training, during which participants listened to noise vocoded sentences while reading matching text; or production training, during which participants read aloud sentences whilst hearing their own voice noise-vocoded in real-time. Both perception and production training tasks resulted in significant improvements in recognition of noise vocoded sentences, with no effect of training type. Both groups then underwent a speech motor adaptation paradigm in which formants were perturbed in real-time noise vocoded speech auditory feedback. Speech motor adaptation however was not significant at the group level in response to the formant perturbations. This suggests that successful perceptual learning of degraded speech is not sufficient for successful sensorimotor learning with degraded auditory feedback.",

This illusory shift can be as large as the distance the frame moves, making it one of the most significant position shift illusions. The frame effect persists under many variations of the frame’s shape and motion trajectories, suggesting a position encoding mechanism that relies on relative location rather than motion. With one exception (the double-drift), motion-induced position shifts produce similar effects on saccadic eye movements and perception. Here, we compare the effect of a moving frame on perception and on saccades across spatial and temporal variations of the frame and the probe. The first experiment showed that saccades targeting the probes were displaced by only about a third of the shift seen for the perception of the probe. A second experiment showed that this difference was constant across a large range of frame speeds. These results add novel evidence in support of dissociable position representations for perception and action.",

          "authors": "Daniel Spinoza-Martín; Gordon Pennycook",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of research on human reasoning, a deceptively simple question remains empirically underexplored: what makes us reason? Classical Dual Process Theories (DPTs) struggle with this question because they posit an intuitive System 1 whose outputs are monitored and sometimes overridden by a deliberative System 2. This creates a theoretical paradox: System 2 would need to both detect the need for additional processing and perform that processing, behaving like a system that triggers itself. In contrast, “hybrid” DPTs resolve the paradoxical tension by proposing that conflict between competing (System 1 generated) intuitions serves as the cue that triggers analytic engagement. Although this view has become dominant, little empirical work has attempted to manipulate the strength differential of competing intuitions to test the core prediction that, by doing so, deliberation should be triggered. We test this prediction by modifying the classic base-rate neglect paradigm in a within-participant experiment with six counterbalanced conditions (N=263). Our design extends the classic base-rate–versus–stereotype conflict by introducing a novel source of conflict: within-stereotype conflict. We systematically vary whether the stereotypical descriptions by themselves evoke one or two competing intuitions—and manipulate whether the base-rate supports one or another stereotype-derived intuition. Increasing conflict between intuitions in this manner led to probability judgments that “neglect” the base-rate less, are less confident, and (suggesting increased deliberation) take more time to be generated. Thus, our results provide empirical support for hybrid DPTs.",

In Experiment 1, participants generated positive and negative behaviors related to either morality or ability and then evaluated each behavior on the other dimension. Negative moral behaviors led to stronger inferences of low ability than negative ability behaviors led to inferences of immorality (i.e., asymmetric Horn effect). No asymmetry emerged for positive behaviors (i.e., symmetric Halo effects). Experiments 2a-2b confirmed the asymmetric Horn effect and showed it was stronger for extreme versus moderate negative behaviors. Experiment 3 showed that immoral behaviors elicited more perceived threat than unable behaviors, which partly explained the asymmetric horn effect. These findings complement and extend prior models of impression formation by highlighting the primacy of morality in influencing judgments on other fundamental content dimensions.",

Cognitive Control Training (CCT), particularly the internet-delivered adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (aPASAT), has shown promise in preventing relapse, yet its health economic value has not been evaluated. This study assessed the cost-utility of adding aPASAT to treatment as usual (TAU) for adults in remission from major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nMethods\n\nA Markov state-transition model simulated a hypothetical cohort of Belgian adults aged 18-65 years in remission from MDD over a five-year time horizon from a healthcare payer perspective. Model parameters were mainly derived from published literature. Outcomes included incremental costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and incremental monetary benefit (INMB). Uncertainty was evaluated using one-way sensitivity, two-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (5,000 simulations), and multiple deterministic scenario analyses.\n\nResults\n\nIn the base case, aPASAT + TAU dominated TAU alone, yielding additional QALYs (Δ = 2192) and lower healthcare costs (Δ = –€77.38M), resulting in an INMB of €182.6M at a €48,000 per QALY threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 99.9% probability of cost-effectiveness. Scenario analyses varying adherence, coverage, remission prevalence, and time horizon consistently confirmed cost savings and improved health outcomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nInternet-delivered CCT using the aPASAT appears to be a cost-effective strategy for preventing MDD relapse. Its low-cost and fully unguided format supports scalable integration into stepped, prevention-oriented mental healthcare systems.",

Despite this, quantitative research on this population remains extremely scarce, with less than a handful of studies looking at the impact of post-migration stressors. This critical review examines the existing literature to identify a methodological gap where current quantitative approaches fail to capture the structural and psychosocial hardships documented in qualitative research, such as retraumatizing asylum processes, intersectional discrimination, and exclusion from both home and host communities. To address this, the article proposes a comprehensive conceptual model integrating Minority Stress Theory with the taxonomy of Social Identity Threat. This model delineates both distal and proximal stressors mapped with SOGIE refugee experiences. It concludes by outlining measurable domains aligned with best practices for scale development, providing a foundational framework for future quantitative research to validate these stressors and improve culturally sensitive mental health care for SOGIE refugees.",

          "abstract": "Often, causal effects of interest in psychological research involve causes that cannot be randomly assigned. Instrumental variables (IV) regression, a cornerstone of the econometric literature on causal inference with nonrandom causes, allows for unbiased causal inference in the face of several threats to the validity of causal inference using ordinary least squares regression. IV is enabled by an instrument – a third variable that affects the outcome only through its influence on the hypothesized cause. One way to study causal effects in psychology is thus the random assignment of an intervention that drives change in the cause of interest but is otherwise unrelated to the outcome, followed by IV analysis to produce a valid causal effect. Moreover, IV regression models can be estimated straightforwardly as structural equation models (SEMs). Based on open data from a recently published study in the economics literature, this tutorial outlines the use of SEM to estimate the causal effect of a behavior of interest, exercise, on an outcome of interest, academic performance, enabled by an instrument –  a randomly-distributed free gym card – that constitutes a random, non-binding manipulation of exercise. The role of covariates in IV is discussed, and R code is provided for all analyses.",

The present study analyses the factors influencing AI acceptance in adults. A quantitative synthesis based on Kelly et al. (2023) was conducted using one-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling (OSMASEM; Jak et al., 2021).\nA total of 40 studies comprising 36,403 subjects were included, yielding 43 correlation matrices and 110 correlation coefficients. The OSMASEM results support a dual-pathway model to AI acceptance: perceived usefulness (PU) is a strong predictor of trust in AI (TR) (β31 = .75, p &lt; .001), which in turn predicts behavioral intention (BI) (β53 = .43, p &lt; .001). Concurrently, performance expectancy (PE) predicts attitudes towards AI (ATT) (β42 = .75, p &lt; .001), which also predicts BI (β54 = .40, p &lt; .001). TR and ATT mediate positive relationships between PU (β51 = .32, p &lt; .001) and BI, and between PE (β52 = .30, p &lt; .001) and BI.\nThis review contributes to understanding the factors influencing AI acceptance. In practical terms, these findings emphasize the importance of internal factors such as TR and ATT, alongside conventional acceptance factors (PU, PE). The need for further research in this area is highlighted, with the recommendation to employ specific AI acceptance models.\nThese results suggest that while core cognitive evaluations (PU, PE) remain crucial, their influence is channeled through more proximal affective and relational constructs (TR, ATT) indicating a potential evolution from traditional technology acceptance frameworks when applied to AI.",

          "abstract": "This preregistered experiment examined the feasibility of administering psychological scales in two novel dichotomous touchscreen-focused response formats inspired by the swipe-based interface known from dating apps: the textual Swipe scale and the Swipe-Video scale using short AI-avatar videos. We compared them to a standard dichotomous Likert scale in an online US sample (N = 602). A strict measurement invariance was established across all the administration methods. The influence of the administration methods on internal consistency, criterion validity, and nonresponse rates was nonsignificant. Swipe-Video was much slower than both other methods; the textual Swipe scale was only slightly slower than the Likert format. Respondents’ ratings of enjoyment, ease-of-use, and intention-to-use did not differ significantly across methods. Overall, swipe-based dichotomous formats – including the AI video-based administration – appear viable alternatives to a standard dichotomous Likert scale leading to equivalent scale scores, albeit with longer completion times, particularly for video administration.",

We begin by showing that the biopsychosocial model is a systems model and that\ncollaboration with researchers studying systems in other disciplines will, therefore, afford insight\ninto the nature, etiology, and treatment of mental disorders. We then illustrate how biological,\npsychological, social, and environmental systems all contribute to mental health and argue that\nadvancing our understanding of mental health will, therefore, require collaborative integration of\nwork from across domains of science.

          "abstract": "Adult aging is associated with a decline in memory for the specific details of past experiences, but the reasons for these declines remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we consider the potential of computational process models of memory to reveal mechanisms underlying age-related changes in memory specificity. We define empirical benchmarks in the most widely used tasks for studying age differences in memory -- recognition and free recall. We then systematically review two broad classes of process models -- global matching and retrieved context models -- that are well-suited to explaining these benchmarks. We discuss and at times illustrate through simulations how age differences in memory specificity can arise from different mechanisms in these models, such as reductions in encoding fidelity, cue-selectivity of retrieval, contextual reinstatement, or retrieval monitoring. These models hold great promise for uncovering the latent mechanisms of age-related memory change, but several explanatory shortcomings must be addressed for a more comprehensive theory to emerge. Because process models often incorporate simplifying shortcuts, they risk advancing descriptive rather than mechanistic explanations for age differences in memory. Furthermore, models that have identified multiple processes of age-related memory impairment have left unaddressed the ways in which these processes affect each other.  By illuminating these and other challenges in current process models, our review aims to stimulate future advances that can dramatically reshape our understanding of the processes of age-related changes in memory specificity.",

Guided by theories of femmephobia and dirty femininity, we explored cisgender men’s perceptions of menstruation in the workplace in three European countries: Croatia, Germany, and Italy. Semi-structured interviews with 21 cisgender men workers were thematically analyzed, uncovering pervasive beliefs and attitudes that sustain and reproduce menstrual stigma. Participants mostly characterized menstruation as taboo and irrelevant to the workplace. They felt disinterested and even uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed that it should remain private and hidden, especially at work. They acknowledged that menstruating colleagues were framed as emotionally unstable, weak, and less competent, reinforcing misogynist and femmephobic stereotypes. Our findings extend applications of femmephobia to the devaluation and regulation of menstruating bodies in the workplace, and broaden the concept of dirty femininity to include menstruation.

          "abstract": "Research on the underrepresentation of women in academia and other professions indicates that women may be underrepresented in fields associated with intrinsic aptitude (or “brilliance”) because women are stereotyped as not possessing brilliance. At the same time, women may be less likely to pursue careers in such fields because few women are in them, highlighting the importance of understanding the role of gender representation. Across four studies (N = 1680), we found that people have knowledge of the male-female breakdown of employees for a broad range of occupations (Study 1) and that current gender demographics predict interest and belonging in hypothetical advertised employment (Studies 2-4). The effect of gender demographics was robust, even prioritized over messaging about ability, particularly among women (Study 2 &amp; 3), and scaling parametrically according to the ratio of male and female employees (Study 4). Especially among women, professions with more females elicited greater interest and feelings of belonging than those with more males, even when those professions were associated with brilliance. These findings suggest that altering beliefs about brilliance for success in specific professions, though important, may be insufficient for increasing female representation in fields where women are underrepresented. Instead, increasing future female representation may benefit from increasing the presence of more women now.",

          "abstract": "Most parents lie to their children. Parental lying has been linked to parent-child relationship quality and children’s social and moral development, underscoring the importance of accurately measuring this behavior. Existing instruments primarily assess prevalence, rely on a narrow conceptualization of parental lying, and their psychometric properties remain understudied. This study therefore introduces the Parental Lying Scenarios Scale (PLSS), a 40 item self-report instrument measure of parental lying prevalence and frequency across a broad range of parental lies. We assess its test-retest reliability, convergent and predictive validity, and factor structure. \nData were collected from Dutch parents of children aged 5-12 years (n = 247 for test-retest reliability and factor analysis; n = 316 for validity analyses). The PLSS demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and evidence for convergent and predictive validity. Exploratory Factor Analyses at two timepoints consistently identified two distinct factors: lying to influence children’s behavior and lying to shape children’s knowledge or emotions.\nThis study provides initial support for the PLSS as a reliable and conceptually meaningful instrument for capturing a broader range of parental lying. The PLSS thereby offers a promising methodological foundation for future research on the antecedents and socio-moral implications of parental lying for both parents and children.",

          "abstract": "Background: Phantom Phone Signals (PPS) are false perceptions that a smartphone has vibrated or made a sound. PPS are typically non-distressing, non-disruptive hallucinations. Increased PPS likelihood is linked to frequent and problematic phone use, mood, anxiety and hallucination-proneness. This study aimed to investigate the role of resilience, delusion-proneness, and metacognition on PPS.\nMethod: This online, self-report, questionnaire study included 265 participants (mean age: 19.74; 84.2% female, no experience of psychosis). Participants completed the Phantom Phone Experiences and Appraisal Scale (PPEAS) to assess PPS, along with the Problematic Use of Mobile Phone Scale (PUMP), Resilience Scale (RS-14), Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ), Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI-21), and Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale (MSAS).\nResults: PPS were prevalent, with 86.8% of participants reporting at least one phantom phone experience. These experiences were generally infrequent, non-distressing, and non-disruptive, as reflected in low PPEAS Composite Impact Scores (M = 4.25, SD = 3.66). PPS were significantly correlated with Problematic phone use (r = .345), hallucination-proneness (r = .321) and delusional ideation (r =.226), but not resilience or metacognition. Regression analyses indicated that higher MUSEQ and higher PUMP scores were associated with higher odds of experiencing more PPS and explained 18% variance in PPEAS Composite Impact Scores. This direct relationship was not mediated or moderated by resilience or metacognition.\nConclusion: PPS are highly prevalent amongst university students and are primarily a benign experience influenced by problematic phone use and hallucination-proneness. Behavioural interventions may be the most effective approach for reducing PPS where required.",

Yet, given the complexity of environmental challenges, voluntary “green” behaviors of employees play a crucial complementary role. These behaviors can be considered as organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE), defined as discretionary, unrewarded individual behaviors contributing to organizations’ environmental management. Empirical research over the past 15 years has addressed the conceptualization, antecedents, and outcomes of OCBE, however, a systematic integration of these findings is still lacking. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review synthesizes evidence from 151 articles across seven databases, offering a comprehensive overview of conceptual and methodological approaches to OCBE. We further summarize extant evidence on antecedents, mediators, moderators, and consequences of OCBE at the individual, team, leadership, organizational, and societal level. Where possible, we meta-analytically aggregate empirical findings. This review culminates in an integrative OCBE framework, outlines future research avenues, discusses methodological limitations, and provides practical recommendations for employees, supervisors, and human resource managers.",

Employing two large scale, preregistered online surveys in Germany and the UK, the credibility judgments about 16 conspiracy theories (eight plausible, eight implausible) were analyzed. Results showed that news media knowledge structures and actively open-minded thinking were consistently associated with participants’ discernment. Conspiracy mentality, in turn, was a key determinant of participants’ response bias. The framework presented clarifies why rational and irrational elements of conspiracy belief ought to be distinguished - as differences in belief content also relate to differences in citizens information processing capabilities.\n\n\tKey words: conspiracy theories, plausibility, signal detection theory",

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in extended reality (XR) and data modelling present new opportunities for adaptive simulation solutions, which can measure and respond to individual neuropsychological states. However, questions remain about the optimal metrics for real-time data capture and the applicability of these solutions for enhancing user experiences. The present research examined a novel form of adaptive XR, called “prediction-based attention computing” (PbAC), which tailors simulations based on computational models of the brain and, thus, the dynamic sensorimotor processes theorised to underpin human perception and learning. Specifically, this study aimed to demonstrate whether PbAC can adaptively capture users’ internal state predictions and modulate associated neuropsychological responses. To test this, we used an XR-based racquetball paradigm, in which participants were tasked with intercepting virtual balls that emerged from different starting locations. For PbAC conditions, in-situ eye tracking data assessments were utilised to index participant’s prior beliefs and manipulate levels of expectedness (i.e., prediction error) on each trial. Various measures of predictive sensorimotor behaviour were then extracted and compared with data from probability-controlled and matched-order control conditions. Results showed that sensorimotor responses were affected by the expectedness of XR stimuli, and that clear, prediction-related biases emerged within PbAC conditions. The novel computing software also provoked marked surprisal responses on trials designed to elicit high levels of prediction error, and these surprisal effects were similar, or even greater than, those in our comparison conditions. Together, the findings provide proof of concept for PbAC and support its development within future research and technology innovations.",

          "abstract": "Depending on how information is conveyed, people show different risk preferences. Odds and outcomes could be described (e.g., Option A [90%: £20, 10%: £8] and Option B [certain £18]), where people often overweight rare outcomes [10%: £8]. However, when odds and outcomes are learned through experience (sampling), people tend to underweight rare outcomes, a phenomenon known as the Description-Experience Gap. Previous studies demonstrating these effects have relied on numerical risk representations. However, risk communication could also be visual, using pictographs, which may lead to different preferences due to the integration of elements from both description- and experience-based paradigms and pattern recognition processes. Across two pre-registered experiments, we examined the D-E Gap across numerical and visual risk representations. Participants made risky choices under four within-subjects conditions: (1) Numeric Description—full numeric summary of each lottery; (2) Pictograph Description—lotteries represented with arranged icon arrays; (3) Numeric Sampling—numeric outcomes sampled sequentially; and (4) Pictograph Sampling—outcomes sampled sequentially from icon arrays. We observed a reduced D-E Gap with visual formats—primarily driven by the Pictograph Description. In Experiment 2, we further tested how variations in these conditions, related to attenuating memory reliance (via a visible history of past samples) and sampling effort (via automated sampling), accounted for the between-condition differences. Our results persisted despite these changes—providing new insights into how distinct cognitive processes relate to this risk preference behaviour. Exploratory analyses indicate that observing of all outcomes during sampling had a substantial effect on the magnitude of the D-E gap.",

          "authors": "Corinna Lorenz; Nicola Kristina Ferdinand",
          "abstract": "Understanding why some individuals are more prone to problematic risk-taking requires examining how they process feedback during escalating risk scenarios. Traditional laboratory paradigms fail to capture two critical\naspects of real-world risky behavior: the dynamic nature of risk escalation and the orthogonal manipulation of risk parameters. We addressed these limitations using an ERP-adapted Columbia Card Task (CCT), enabling precise temporal analysis of neural responses as risks accumulate within decision episodes. Twenty-five participants completed the CCT while we recorded EEG, measuring early outcome detection (FRN/RewP, 240-340ms) and later evaluative processing (P3b, 300-500ms). We systematically manipulated gain amounts, loss amounts, and loss probability while examining how individual risk propensity—measured through actual task behavior—predicted neural feedback processing patterns. Critically, rather risk-averse and rather riskprone individuals employed fundamentally different temporal adaptation strategies that emerged dynamically as risks escalated. During early outcome detection, risk-prone participants showed progressive sensitization to negative outcomes across feedback sequences, while risk-averse participants showed habituation. These opposing patterns reversed for positive outcomes. During later evaluation, risk-prone individuals selectively maintained working memory updating for positive outcomes despite accumulating losses, while risk-averse participants enhanced negative outcome processing. These context-dependent effects were most pronounced under specific high-stakes conditions: smaller gains and larger losses amplified group differences in early processing, while probability information revealed that risk-prone individuals showed enhanced neural responses to improbable positive outcomes—providing a mechanism for persistent risk engagement despite unfavorable\nodds. Behavioral results revealed that risk-prone individuals achieved higher efficiency without performance costs, suggesting these neural patterns reflect adaptive individual differences rather than pathological dysfunction. Our findings fundamentally reframe risk propensity as a dynamic regulatory process triggered by escalating risk, with direct implications for identifying vulnerable individuals before maladaptive patterns crystallize.",

Following the analytic template for outcome-wide designs, we conducted a series of country-specific weighted multivariate regression analyses where each Wave 2 outcome was regressed on Wave 1 forgivingness (controlling for Wave 1 sociodemographic and retrospectively recalled childhood variables). Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool country-specific estimates of association for the 56 main outcomes covering psychological, social, physical, volitional, and material dimensions of well-being. We found some evidence of association between forgivingness and higher well-being for both composite well-being indicators and numerous specific indicators across different domains of functioning (observed associations were mostly very small in magnitude). Associations were generally stronger and more consistent for some domains (e.g., psychological well-being) compared to others (e.g., physical health &amp; health behavior). Meta-analyzed estimates of association generally attenuated after using a more conservative analytic approach that additionally adjusted for principal components extracted from the Wave 1 outcomes treated as covariates. Country-specific results showed some cross-national variation. Our findings contribute novel population-level evidence on the potential benefits of forgivingness for different aspects of well-being.",

Neural systems must therefore integrate temporal with representational structure, linking the evolving input with the hierarchical units it instantiates. These operations give rise to two fundamental statistical dependencies in linguistic and neural data: covariance, the instantaneous shared structure across features or recording sites, and temporal dependence, the influence of past states on the present state. As experiments become more naturalistic, neuroimaging and electrophysiological data increasingly express both forms of structure, producing correlated variables and continuous temporal dependencies that complicate interpretation. Because statistical models handle covariance and temporal dependence differently, they support distinct kinds of inference about language-brain mapping. We introduce a Dual-Dependency Taxonomy that classifies modelling approaches by the dependencies they represent. This framework clarifies the linguistic-neural relationships each model family can reveal, the questions they cannot address, and the methodological implications that follow.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nArts on Prescription (AoP) programmes occur within primary care and community settings. The current study extended this to examine the impact of AoP, in secondary care, on patient wellbeing, social connection, and experiences of care.\nMethods:\nA mixed methods design was used. Quantitative data were collected with 61 patients referred to AoP at a UK Hospital, where they received outpatient treatment for cancer, chronic pain, weight management, breathlessness or neuromuscular conditions. Programme-level outcomes assessed wellbeing and loneliness. The immediate wellbeing impact of art workshops was assessed by tracking mood and loneliness. Qualitative data focused on experiences of AoP and were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups (n = 12) and analysed using thematic analysis.\nResults:\nWellbeing scores significantly increased across the programme, alongside reductions in loneliness. Art workshops increased relaxation, contentment, and social connection. The thematic analysis led to four themes: (1) Connection to others – feeling supported, inspired and understood; (2) Making space – providing calm, protected time, and mental respite; (3) Becoming – renewed confidence, and opening to new opportunities; and (4) Clinical implications – reframing relationships with the hospital, validating referrals, and supporting the management of health conditions.\nConclusions:\nAoP in secondary care demonstrates potential as an effective approach, replicating effects in primary care, including improved wellbeing and social connection. However, additional merits in the context of secondary care relate to the ‘hospital-patient’ relationship, and using art to manage health conditions. Embedding AoP within hospital settings may reduce burden on secondary services by supporting psychosocial needs alongside medical care.",

The authors transcribed a large database of psychological experiments and fine-tuned a large language model to predict human responses on a trial-by-trial basis. This model, Centaur, outperformed domain-specific state-of-the-art cognitive models. We highlight several major problems with Centaur. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the model is not subject to basic cognitive constraints and that its behaviour is best characterised as a form of role-playing. More generally, we discuss the inferential fallacy of mistaking predictive power for explanatory power and the importance of subjecting models to experimental manipulations to test specific hypotheses. These critical points are often overlooked in NeuroAI, but need to be addressed if the field is to progress.",

          "authors": "Jil Zippelius; Andreas Czaplicki; Ulrich Hegerl; Gerd Dieter Willmund; Hanna Reich",
          "abstract": "Background\nDepression remains a critical mental health issue in military contexts, where timely recognition and appropriate treatment are essential. Military general practitioners (GPs) in the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) serve as primary gatekeepers for mental health concerns. To strengthen depression management and suicide prevention, the community-based 4-level approach was adapted to the Bundeswehr context and implemented at eight military garrisons. This study explores military GPs’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of the 4-level approach.\nMethods\nSemistructured interviews were conducted with 17 military GPs across eight intervention garrisons, following a 4-hour training on depression recognition, treatment, and the use of digital tools. The interviews were based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF), combining deductive coding and inductive belief statement synthesis. Intercoder reliability was high (Cohen’s kappa = 0.96).\nResults\nEleven of fourteen TDF domains were relevant for implementation. The most significant domain was social influence, particularly concerning the stigma surrounding mental illness. Other key domains included environmental context and resources and professional identity. The key facilitators were a perceived reduction in stigma, active involvement of commanding officers, high clinical relevance of depression and a strong intention to apply the intervention content. The key barriers included persistent stigmatization, time constraints, work-related causes of depression and the variability in perceived relevance of depression across units. \nConclusion\nImplementation of the 4-level approach within the Bundeswehr is shaped by organizational, cultural, and contextual factors. Persistent stigma, high workload, and military-specific stressors impede effective implementation, whereas leadership engagement and the perceived clinical relevance of depression facilitate it. Despite training, some GPs appeared to hold a simplified view of the development of depression, which highlights the need for more tailored training to address misconceptions about depression and to improve diagnostic accuracy. Digital tools are seen as very useful but require better integration into routine clinical practice.",

Here we investigate the influences of external and internal factors on lay audiences' belief updating based on scientific evidence with a diverse sample of U.S. residents from which data was collected in May 2023. Participants were presented a series of fictitious hypotheses. For each hypothesis, we assessed their initial beliefs and subjective expertise, presented them fictitious study outcomes, and then assessed their beliefs again. Importantly, the outcomes' presentation format and ordering were manipulated. Participants exhibited more belief updating when study outcomes were presented simultaneously (all on one page) instead of sequentially (split up across different pages). While chronologically ordering outcomes given sequential presentation did not affect belief updating, participants weighted more recently presented outcomes more strongly. We further found that belief updating was less pronounced with increasing subjective expertise, and more pronounced with increasing trust in science and scientific literacy. These results provide practical implications for science communication and the consumption of scientific evidence.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian hypothesis testing via Bayes factors offers a principled alternative to classical p-value methods in meta-analysis, particularly suited to its cumulative and sequential nature. Unlike the commonly reported p-values in standard null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors naturally allow for quantifying support both for and against the existence of an effect, facilitate ongoing evidence monitoring, and maintain coherent long-run behavior as additional studies are incorporated. Recent theoretical developments further show how Bayes factors can flexibly control Type I error rates through connections to e-value theory. Despite these advantages, their use remains limited in the meta-analytic literature. This paper provides a critical overview of their theoretical properties, methodological considerations—such as prior sensitivity—and practical advantages for evidence synthesis. Two illustrative applications are provided: one on statistical learning in individuals with language impairments, and another on seroma incidence following post-operative exercise in breast cancer patients. New tools supporting these methods are available in the open-source R package BFpack.",

Although CLT has argued for a relationship between an episode’s proximity and the degree to which it is represented concretely, and level of detail within visual imagery is an important manifestation of concreteness, research within CLT has not considered level of detail of mental images as a key outcome variable. We adapted a methodological approach advanced by RMT to examine memories to the realm of imagined scenarios. In Studies 1 to 5, participants evaluated the level of detail of proximal and distal episodes. In Study 6 participants imagined episodes with high or low level of detail and rated their perceived psychological distance. We found that distance influences meta-cognitive assessments of level of detail and is influenced by a level of detail manipulation. We discuss the relevance of these findings for CLT, RMT, and prior work on meta-cognition, and consider the findings’ practical implications.",

Using longitudinal data from 911 infants in the Little in Norway study, cognitive and language abilities were assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Longitudinal latent class analysis identified three subgroups: “Rapid learners” (23.5%), “Typical learners” (64.3%), and “Delayed learners” (12.2%). Multinomial logistic regressions tested whether early-life factors reflecting prenatal growth, parental socioeconomic status, parental mental health and stress, and mother-infant interactional quality predicted class membership. As expected, higher paternal education increased the likelihood of belonging to the “Rapid learners” class relative to the “Typical learners”, whereas better mother-child interactional quality distinguished “Rapid learners” from “Delayed learners”. By examining diverse prenatal, family, and social influences, including paternal characteristics often overlooked in prior research, this study provides new insights into the origins of individual differences in early cognitive and language development.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold growing potential for scaling the analysis of qualitative\ndata in the learning sciences. One essential step in qualitative analysis is coding verbal data.\nAlthough several approaches have been proposed for automating coding with LLMs, few\nappear well-suited to the needs of the learning sciences, where coding requires identifying\ndescriptive content categories and pedagogical functions of utterances, often implicit and\ndifficult to detect. To address this challenge, we provide the Theory–Prompt–Validation\n(TPV) approach, a three-step process comprising theory modeling, prompt engineering, and\nvalidation. This approach provides a blueprint for evidence-based application of LLMs for\ncontext-sensitive coding of verbal data. The TPV approach builds on existing methods while\nincorporating requirements specific to the learning sciences. We emphasize a theory-driven,\nevidence-based process, including validation analyses to verify that pragmatic functions are\naccurately captured in coding. To illustrate the TPV approach, we applied it to AI-student\ntutoring dialogues. We developed a theory-driven codebook and implemented it in a Python-\nbased script leveraging GPT-4o to segment utterances and assign codes automatically.\nIntercoder agreement between the LLM and a human coder was substantial (κ = .73, 95% CI\n[0.69,0.76]) and descriptively higher than between two human coders (κ = .69, 95% CI [0.66,\n0.73]). Validity analyses revealed theoretically meaningful patterns, such as positive effects\nwhen the code feedback was assigned more frequently.

Yet Autistic people with complex support needs (CSN) – including those who are minimally- or non-speaking, use augmentative and alternative communication, or require intensive daily support – remain disproportionately excluded from both neurodiversity discourse and participatory research. In this commentary, we clarify the relationship between the neurodiversity paradigm and Autistic people with CSN, addressing persistent misconceptions that the movement overlooks disability or minimizes support needs. Drawing on theoretical analysis, empirical evidence, and recent research experiences involving Autistic people with CSN, we argue that when applied rigorously, the neurodiversity paradigm offers a powerful framework for advancing autonomy, dignity, and inclusion for those with the most complex support needs. We examine structural, attitudinal, and methodological barriers that limit participation, and highlight emerging studies demonstrating that inclusive, co-produced research with Autistic people with CSN is both possible and beneficial. Finally, we offer four actionable recommendations to guide researchers in creating conditions that support meaningful involvement of Autistic people with CSN throughout the research process. Ensuring that participatory approaches include those historically excluded is not only an ethical imperative but essential for producing accurate, responsive, and socially just autism research.",

          "authors": "Daniel Spinoza-Martín; Gordon Pennycook",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of research on human reasoning, a deceptively simple question remains empirically underexplored: what makes us reason? Classical Dual Process Theories (DPTs) struggle with this question because they posit an intuitive System 1 whose outputs are monitored and sometimes overridden by a deliberative System 2. This creates a theoretical paradox: System 2 would need to both detect the need for additional processing and perform that processing, behaving like a system that triggers itself. In contrast, “hybrid” DPTs resolve the paradoxical tension by proposing that conflict between competing (System 1 generated) intuitions serves as the cue that triggers analytic engagement. Although this view has become dominant, little empirical work has attempted to manipulate the strength differential of competing intuitions to test the core prediction that, by doing so, deliberation should be triggered. We test this prediction by modifying the classic base-rate neglect paradigm in a within-participant experiment with six counterbalanced conditions (N=263). Our design extends the classic base-rate–versus–stereotype conflict by introducing a novel source of conflict: within-stereotype conflict. We systematically vary whether the stereotypical descriptions by themselves evoke one or two competing intuitions—and manipulate whether the base-rate supports one or another stereotype-derived intuition. Increasing conflict between intuitions in this manner led to probability judgments that “neglect” the base-rate less, are less confident, and (suggesting increased deliberation) take more time to be generated. Thus, our results provide empirical support for hybrid DPTs.",

          "authors": "Benedict King",
          "abstract": "Bayesian phylogenetics has become a standard tool in historical linguistics, and for the most part implements models borrowed from evolutionary biology. Not enough work has been done to validate the analysis set-up that has become standardised in phylolinguistics, which consists of binary data with ascertainment bias,  data partitions with correlated site number and rate, the binary covarion substitution model, and the uncorrelated lognormal branch rate model. Here I perform a set of simulation-based calibration studies to test a typical phylolinguistic analysis in the software BEAST2. Although the analysis can correctly recover the parameters of the substitution model, complications arise due to the combination of ascertainment bias and partitions of unequal length and rate. Reweighting the partition-specific rates by the number of sites, as is the default behaviour, leads to poorly calibrated posteriors. An alternative approach, where each meaning is assumed to come from an alignment of equal length, behaves correctly in simulations and is found to fit better to empirical data. I also assess the adequacy of the covarion substitution model through posterior predictive simulations. The covarion is found to fall short of approximating the true process of lexical evolution, likely due to the prevalence of semantic shift and the non-independence of cognate substitutions in real data. This work highlights the importance of thorough testing of models and their implementation in phylolinguistics, as well as the need for further research on improving models of lexical evolution.",

This paper introduces a neurodiversity-native theory of management that redefines cognitive variance not as a challenge to be accommodated, but as a core system property to be architected for. We argue that \"inclusion\" frameworks, while well-intentioned, function as retrofits to inherently exclusionary systems and fail to unlock the full potential of heterogeneous cognition. Drawing on interdisciplinary research across cognitive science, organizational theory, and critical disability studies, we propose a paradigm shift: Neuromanagement by Default (NbD). This model replaces compliance-driven accommodation with participatory design principles, modular work systems, and leadership practices grounded in cognitive pluralism. We synthesize emerging evidence that shows how reimagining work environments to center neurodivergence fosters innovation, resilience, and collective intelligence. Rather than assimilating difference into dominant norms, NbD designs for difference from the outset. The paper concludes with a call to reengineer the epistemology of management itself, treating neurodiversity not as a demographic feature, but as the infrastructure of organizational adaptability in a complex world.",

A scalable, machine-learning-based text classification pipeline is introduced to map the prevalence of Open Access (OA), Open Data (OD), Open Materials (OM), and Preregistration (PR). The analysis is based on publication metadata and a year-stratified sample of full texts from the top 100 journals in Criminology &amp; Penology, Law, and Psychology (2013-2023). After identifying articles containing statistical inference (SI) via a high-performing classifier, the author utilized GPT-assisted coding and supervised learning to train specific classifiers for OD, OM, and PR. OA was classified using publicly available metadata. Among 1,763 SI articles with usable full text, design-based estimates reveal a significant disparity in OSP adoption. OA is relatively common (40.9%, 95% CI: 38.8-43.1) and has steadily increased from approximately 20% in 2013 to 50% in 2023. By sharp contrast, trends for OD, OM, and PR cannot be reliably quantified. Extreme class imbalance and the minimal number of positive cases indicate a very low underlying true prevalence for these practices in the assessed field. Methodologically, the study confirms that GPT-assisted coding supports accurate SI detection, but robust prevalence estimation for extremely low-frequency OSPs remains challenging for downstream classifiers. Overall, this project establishes a transparent and reproducible pipeline and provides critical baseline estimates for future, larger-scale assessments of research transparency in crime-related fields.",

Feeling thermometers for partisan- and issue-based groups are complemented by precise measures of discrete emotions. This enables the validation of thermometer scores, as well as the study of the emotional foundations of political conflicts and a wide range of related outcomes, including collective action, trust, and coping strategies. Its longitudinal design allows examining within-person changes in polarization and the effects of politically salient events such as elections and crises.

          "abstract": "The protest paradigm has been a central concept in research on media and social movements, documenting systematic patterns of protest marginalization through emphasis on violence, disruption, and official authority. Yet existing studies vary in how they operationalize the paradigm, raising a critical empirical question: do measures designed to capture media attention, the selection and salience of textual elements, converge with measures designed to capture framing, the interpretive structures that construct meaning? This study disentangles these dimensions by comparing two computational approaches: (1) document-level frame identification using a generative large language model (LLM), producing both content and framing scores, and (2) a sentence-level classifier to identify the same categories and aggregated via article structure and attention metrics into a weighted composite measure at the document level. Using news wire data from Latin America and Southern Europe (2000–2025), we examine nine protest-paradigm categories. Results reveal strong convergence for lexically concrete, recurrent frames (e.g., Violence, Law and Order, Decay of Morals) and weak or inconsistent alignment for interpretive or context-dependent frames (e.g., Troublemakers, Nuisance, Righteous Struggle). These findings highlight systematic methodological differences: LLMs capture implicit, cross-sentence framing, while sentence-level classifiers can validate only structurally explicit frames. The study underscores the importance of transparent aggregation procedures and human validation, and demonstrates that conclusions about protest coverage, media bias, and framing are contingent on the operationalization employed. By clarifying the boundary between attention and framing, this research contributes both to computational media analysis and to the conceptual refinement of the protest paradigm.",

          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage-point higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed theirs in early 2023. We assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension claiming using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. Those who had the opportunity to benefit from the extraordinary index adjustment were approximately 8 percentage points more likely to claim the partial old-age pension in the first month of eligibility, with a relative effect as high as 79%. The effect arises because individuals advance their pension claims in response to the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "abstract": "Why does repression generate long-term resentment in some contexts but not others? Existing research focuses on how contemporary political context moderates the effects of repression; I emphasize factors that predated the repressive regime. I argue that prior socio-economic development shapes the legacies of political violence. In more developed areas, repression is harder to justify and more likely to provoke enduring backlash. Where development was limited, however, the promise of modernization may temper resentment. I explore two mechanisms – temporal comparisons and the role of education – and test the argument using novel census, archival, and survey data from Moldova. Combining historical records with contemporary public opinion surveys, I show that the relationship between Soviet-era repression and attitudes toward Moldova’s communist successor party varies systematically with prior development. These findings contribute to research on political violence by highlighting the importance of preexisting conditions in shaping long-term public responses to repression.",

          "abstract": "Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) use population data from 35 countries where rural areas were flooded by dam and reservoir construction. They compare historical population counts prior to flooding with estimates from global gridded population datasets and report that gridded population data underestimate people in these areas by more than 50%. Based on this, they claim that gridded population data systematically undercount rural populations around the world and suggest that rural census data are also flawed. \nWe appreciate the authors’ interest in gridded population data accuracy but believe they misunderstood how these datasets are constructed and try to validate them by their performance in representing historical population changes around very local and rare flooding events, that are not representative for the quality of global, gridded population data measuring contemporary rural population distributions.\nGlobal, gridded population data rely on models that redistribute census-based population counts using geospatial data on water bodies and built-up areas, and other factors related to population presence and density. These models assume water bodies to be static over time and do not measure buildings that existed in the past but have since been dismantled, demolished, destroyed, or flooded. They are not designed to capture rare events like villages flooded by newly built water reservoirs. This is a known limitation, not a flaw, that has been clearly described by gridded population data producers. \nLáng-Ritter et al. (2025) measure effects of these limitations and exaggerate the scale of the problem. The total number of people displaced by dam construction in the analyzed data is small - less than 0.05% of the world’s population - yet they use relative error metrics that grossly inflate their results. They also avoid assessing if gridded population data overestimate post-flooding population in areas where the data on water bodies are out of date, which would invalidate their claim of “systematic underrepresentation”. Moreover, they confuse “missing data” with “misplaced data” - in many cases, the population is still represented in the gridded population data, just in slightly different locations. We estimate that population displacement due to reservoir construction causes such slight misplacements in global gridded population datasets affecting less than 2% of the global rural population, significantly lower than the claim by Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) of over 50% missing rural population globally. \nIn this response, members of the POPGRID data collaborative explain why the conclusions by Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) are incorrect and not supported by the data or methods used. Moreover, we call for awareness of the limitations and fitness for use of global gridded population data.",

          "abstract": "Communities around the world rely on networks of resource sharing to buffer households against hardship. Yet, under such informal insurance schemes, some needy families can be systematically left out. By modeling sharing and reputational spread on a network, we show how generosity can be sustained when reputational benefits spread across a community’s communication network, but also how network density and position shape who receives transfers---well-connected households become priority receivers due to their ability to spread givers' reputation more effectively. Our analysis, combining mathematical modeling with food sharing data from an Inuit community, reveals that communication network sparsity incentivizes broader sharing, but also more selectivity. The correlation of communication network structure and resource endowment is critical for stabilizing needs-based transfers. If need status does not perfectly (negatively) correlate with social influence, marginal households in need may still be excluded from sharing. By linking individual incentives to community-wide patterns, our framework clarifies when indirect reciprocity can stabilize outcomes that show the signatures of need-based transfers.",

In this study we refine theoretically our understanding of ecofascism, acknowledging the inherently offensive, expansionist logic of fascism represented in the Volk, Kampf, Lebensraum triad. We then use representative survey experiment data from 1,967 UK residents to examine how susceptible the electorate is to such ecofascist ideas and whether exposure to climate change threat makes them more susceptible. Findings indicate that approximately one-fifth of the UK population is susceptible to an ecofascist ideology rooted in Volk, Kampf and Lebensraum. A sense of climate despair and anomie stemming from climate change threats, combined with predispositions toward social dominance and authoritarianism, and a conflicted relationship with nature, increases susceptibility to ecofascism significantly. We conclude by emphasising that this susceptibility could be exploited by right-wing actors in the future and the necessity to develop progressive responses to climate change threat.",

Determining whether such connections were singular events or sustained episodes is therefore critical to illuminate the scale of early seafaring. Here, we model how patterns of sea-level change impacted land connectivity between Sicily and Malta and predict potential population sizes through time from the Last Glacial Maximum to evaluate whether Mesolithic hunter-gatherers could have persisted on Malta, or if sustained connections would have been required. To achieve this, we use reconstructions of sea-level change and modern bathymetric models to evaluate changes in land size areas and connectivity. We calculate Net Primary Productivity values for a high-resolution palaeoclimate dataset, which we translate to population density by comparisons to ethnographic datasets. Finally, we calculate changes in estimated population sizes through time for Malta and Sicily, as well as minimum distances of sea voyages. Our results show that following disconnection from Sicily, Malta would have been unsuitable to support a viable, persistent forager population, including for the minimum 1000-year timespan of the Maltese Mesolithic record. As a result, only repeated, long-distance sea voyaging can explain the longevity of Mesolithic occupations of Malta, opening up the possibility that other south-central Mediterranean islands were reached and explaining the presence of European hunter-gatherer ancestry in North Africa.",

This paper, arising from an interdisciplinary team, is the first to explore the legal challenges posed by digital replicas set within the broad context of sociological and linguistic perspectives. Owing to the prevalence of AI digital voice replicas in the creative industries, we use qualitative focus group data to focus on the legal implications and potential impact of AI digital voice replicas within this domain. To do this, we draw on the views of researchers, creatives and IP practitioners. Our focus group findings illustrated a range of responses to AI and voice cloning including skepticism, uncertainty, and a sense of inevitability. We find that the loss of what many refer to as the ‘authentic voice’ through cloning evokes an emotional response. The voice means a lot to people. As AI evolves, we posit that authenticity as a concept itself may need reconceptualising. Against this backdrop, we highlight the urgent need to address the legal vulnerability of the “un-fixed” voice, (a voice not permanently captured in traditional recordings), and the inadequacy of current United Kingdom (UK) Intellectual Property (IP) frameworks to protect it, we find that those lacking such status remain largely unprotected, highlighting a significant regulatory lacuna. This shortfall calls for a more robust protection of a ‘personality right’ in UK law.",

          "abstract": "Humans are uniquely capable of reaching consensus within large, hierarchically structured societies. Yet the pathways by which consensus emerges, especially under constraints imposed by social organization, remain poorly understood. We use agent-based modeling to explore how marriage structure, social group nesting, and decision-making norms can shape a group’s ability to reach consensus. In our model, simulated agents are embedded in multilevel social networks and possess noisy information. Decisions are spread via three different cascades using one of several interaction norms. We find that family formation via marriages, especially when clustered within kin units, impedes consensus by slowing the rate of information diffusion and elevating informational entropy. In contrast, increasing the size of nested subgroups in a multilevel network reduces category overlap and promotes consensus. Finally, decision-making norms that bypass early-stage clustering through the formation of coalitions or representative bodies lead to faster group decisions. These results offer insights into how consensus dynamics are shaped by social structure and provide a theoretical bridge between research on network topology, collective intelligence, and human social evolution.",

We test the model's predictions using data from \"Seshat: Global Databank\" which describe hundreds of polities worldwide from across the Holocene.

We conducted a two-stage mixed methods study that combined digital lab measures (eye tracking, facial expression analysis, and galvanic skin response) with projective interviews. Seventy UK participants viewed three pairs of hotel messages encouraging water conservation, energy saving and recycling, and food-waste reduction, each varying in clarity and tone. Physiological data showed that participants attended closely to all messages but displayed little variation in emotional intensity, while projective interviews revealed how they reflected on and interpreted these emotional responses. Clear and empowering messages evoked warmth, pride, and trust, which strengthened behavioural intention. Constructed emotional resonance, rather than arousal intensity, drove pro-environmental intention.",

Previous research focused specifically on online social influencers suggests they may be able to affect group-level diffusion of health-protective behaviours such that they modify epidemic outcomes. The impacts of social influence on behaviour and epidemics depend on whether the disease has a low enough basic reproduction number ($R_0$) that social dynamics have time to diffuse. However, formal models have yet to test the intuitive hypothesis that online social influence is sufficient to generate tangible, real-world effects on epidemics. We develop an agent-based model that incorporates social influencers into an epidemic scenario to test hypotheses about how the presence of competing influence messages affects the diffusion of health-protective behaviours throughout a population, and thereby alters the course and outcome of infectious disease epidemics. We find social influencers had a persistent, independent effect on peak infection intensity and total infection burden of the epidemic, with the greatest effects in highly homophilous scenarios. The presence of health-protective influence effectively flattened the epidemic curve despite equal presence of anti-protective influence.",

Recent efforts attempt to reframe neglect as a consequence of ecologically layered disadvantages or “overload.” However, it is unclear if this ecological focus is reflected in the research base backing neglect interventions.

Among these five articles, we documented the populations targeted by the interventions, along with the theoretical frameworks used. By identifying which participants researchers engaged and which contributing factors measured, we shed light on the underlying, often unnamed, theoretical models that currently inform evidence-based interventions. We highlight a stark divide between the recent framing of neglect as an outcome of ecological disadvantages and an evidence base for neglect interventions focused primarily on parental failures.\n\nKeywords: Evidence-based treatment, intervention research, content analysis, systematic review, neglect, ecological models",

Both scales correlated positively with hostile and benevolent sexism and negatively with interpersonal warmth toward childfree adults, supporting their convergent and discriminant validity.

In all 6,451 courses the same nine questions (modalities, structure, explanations, outcomes, practicality, integration, respectfulness, workload, and overall satisfaction) were asked on a 5-point Likert-scale.\nWe found that students do not seem to differentiate between questions and tend to respond similarly to all of them, with Spearman correlation coefficients of up to 0.876. This suggests that the use of long and detailed questionnaires might be unnecessary. A significant reduction in the number of feedback questions could streamline the course evaluation process and encourage student participation while little information is lost.\nRelevance: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the correlations between student feedback questionnaire questions on such a large scale (n = 6,451 courses).",

A broad literature indicates, however, that politics does not stop ‘at water’s edge’, suggesting relevant differences between more ‘dovish’ Democrat-leaning and more ‘hawkish’ Republican-leaning voters. I revisit this question for the case of US support strategies aiding Ukraine against the Russian invasion in 2022. In particular, I investigate the extent of partisan differences in both overall agreement and the hard trade-offs between competing normative, strategic, and economic considerations connected to supporting Ukraine. Do Democrat and Republican-leaning voters deal with these trade-offs differently? I bring conjoint and vignette survey experimental evidence from 2,334 US citizens to this question. I show that absolute levels of support for Ukraine are lower among Republicans. However, irrespective of partisanship, citizens resolve the fundamental trade-offs involved in Ukraine policy similarly. Strategies that sustain Ukraine’s territorial integrity and political sovereignty, rather than concessions to Russia, are substantively more likely to be chosen, irrespective of partisanship, even if less strongly so among (moderate) US Republicans. Both Democrat and Republican voters show similarly high concern for the human costs of war, domestic economic costs, and escalation risk – with economic costs resonating more among Republicans. These results imply that for a case where both normative and strategic motivations for intervention loom large, public support is not structured as expected from ‘partisan types’. Tentatively, this indicates that differences in partisan preferences are no constraint for persisting US support to Ukraine.",

Class-origin differences are largest at the start of adulthood but weaken, whereas exposure to parental voting has a stronger and more persistent influence on participation. The intergenerational transmission of participation is highly heterogeneous: differences by class origin persist only among those exposed to voting parents, while parental disengagement overrides between-class differences. Parental influence also varies by class contexts, remaining strongest among individuals from middle-class backgrounds. Class structures political socialization, but parents transmit, reinforce, or weaken class-linked norms, shaping the reproduction of inequality across generations.",

This article takes a different perspective, applying ideas from an ecological approach to culture to social media informational dynamics. It argues that success online depends both on the intrinsic appeal of content to receivers and on how well content serves producers’ strategic goals within the constraints and affordances of specific platforms. These goals include reputation management, coalition building and identity management, and coordination or participation in shared activities. Transmission is often a by-product of these motivations, and replication fidelity plays a limited role compared with transformations that adapt content to local incentives. Finally, the article suggests that platforms and communities can be understood as distinct ecological niches, each characterised by different audience structures, affordances, metrics, and algorithmic pressures. This perspective offers novel insight to persistent debates on social media dynamics, such as misinformation, radicalisation and polarisation, and the reasons behind online success.",

          "abstract": "Cet article analyse l’introduction de la mixité dans les concours des ENS de Fontenay-aux-Roses et Saint-Cloud en 1981. Il montre qu’après la fusion des épreuves, la proportion de femmes admises en filières scientifiques (maths, physique) a chuté brutalement, passant d’environ 50 % à 15–20 %. La mixité a désavantagé les candidates dans ces disciplines perçues comme masculines, probablement en exacerbant l’autocensure et le sentiment d’illégitimité. À long terme, cette baisse a réduit le nombre de docteures en mathématiques, limitant les modèles féminins dans ce domaine. L’étude souligne que l’organisation institutionnelle des concours influence la reproduction des inégalités de genre. Elle invite à considérer la non-mixité comme un outil possible pour promouvoir l’égalité, et à dépasser une approche purement normative de la mixité au profit d’une analyse de ses effets concrets.",

          "authors": "Bart Schuurman",
          "abstract": "Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has increasingly used a “hybrid” strategy, supporting its conventional battlefield operations with irregular activities against Kyiv’s European supporters. At their forefront are low-cost and easily replaced “disposable agents” that provide Russia with considerable operational reach as well as plausible deniability. Using a new dataset of 127 disposable agents, this study combines descriptive and inferential statistics with social network analysis to exploratively examine their demographics, roles, deployment patterns, and organisational structure. Findings indicate that disposable agents are predominantly male, mid-thirties, drawn disproportionately from Ukrainian, Russian, Moldovan, and Bulgarian populations, and quite frequently re-used. Networks appear structurally hierarchical and compartmentalised, and seem designed with plausible deniability in mind. However, inconsistent operational security by GRU and FSB officers may have limited Russia’s ability to claim ignorance. The findings provide empirical insight into a covert and significant facet of Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy, informing both policy responses to an ongoing threat and further scholarship.",

          "abstract": "Student feedback questionnaires for courses are an essential part of quality control at universities. Feedback can be useful to improve courses and to monitor course development over time. However, the number of questions posed to students varies between universities; some use short questionnaires, while others employ more detailed questionnaires.The answers are usually represented on a Likert scale.\nWe analysed the results of student feedback questionnaires for all courses at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien between the years 2016 and 2023 (n = 6,451). In all 6,451 courses the same nine questions (modalities, structure, explanations, outcomes, practicality, integration, respectfulness, workload, and overall satisfaction) were asked on a 5-point Likert-scale.\nWe found that students do not seem to differentiate between questions and tend to respond similarly to all of them, with Spearman correlation coefficients of up to 0.876. This suggests that the use of long and detailed questionnaires might be unnecessary. A significant reduction in the number of feedback questions could streamline the course evaluation process and encourage student participation while little information is lost.\nRelevance: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the correlations between student feedback questionnaire questions on such a large scale (n = 6,451 courses).",

          "abstract": "An increasing number of studies have examined fertility variation at the regional level within countries, but this research has largely focused on women. As a result, our knowledge of regional variation in male fertility remains limited. The current study addresses this research gap by examining how the timing and chances of parenthood vary regionally for women and men in four countries in Northern and Western Europe. We hypothesise that men may be subject to less regional variation in their first births than women, and that gender differences in first births may be less pronounced in urban centres, such as the capital regions, and especially among groups with higher levels of education. The study is based on data collected from female and male cohorts born between 1963 and 1970 in Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results broadly support our hypotheses: men show modestly smaller differences in the timing and chances of first parenthood between capital and other regions than women, and consequently smaller gender differences in first parenthood exist in capital regions in all countries except the Netherlands. Moreover, highly educated women and men living in the capital regions have the most similar timing and chances of entering parenthood.",

          "authors": "Jainil Surana",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nContemporary philosophy and science lack a unified ontological framework capable of coherently explaining the relationship between consciousness, probability, and experienced reality. Existing models tend to privilege either material processes or subjective experience, resulting in persistent conceptual gaps around perception, indeterminacy, and the role of the observer.\nCurrent approaches - ranging from physicalism and idealism to information-based theories -struggle to integrate experiential reality with deeper structural mechanisms without collapsing into reductionism or metaphysical speculation. In particular, no widely accepted framework systematically distinguishes between foundational reality, the structural domain of possibility, and the rendered domain of experience.\nThis paper proposes the Three-Circle Ontology, a meta-ontological model that organizes reality into three expression layers: Circle 1 (Source) as the nondual ontological ground, Circle 2 (Possibility-Code) as the structural field of latent configurations, and Circle 3 (Projection) as the domain of perceptual experience. Rather than treating consciousness, probability, and physical reality as competing primitives, the model positions them as functionally distinct but ontologically continuous layers of expression.\nThe framework does not present an empirical theory, predictive model, or spiritual doctrine. Its scope is explicitly conceptual and structural, intended to clarify foundational assumptions underlying existing scientific and philosophical models.\nThe primary contribution of this work is a coherent meta-ontological architecture that enables interdisciplinary dialogue while preserving strict boundary conditions and logical consistency.",

Influenced by social movement studies and transnational advocacy literature, this study conceptualizes such campaigns as digital boomerangs and provides an analytical framework for analyzing them. Further, with a novel computational analysis of all Iranian hashtag activism campaigns for global attention and news articles regarding Iran sourced from all over the world, I demonstrate that receiving international attention for such campaigns is rare but possible.

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "Against a backdrop of increasingly frequent external shocks and deepening cross-sectoral coupling, traditional national risk assessments centred on ‘industry/sector’ units often struggle to explain why seemingly localised disturbances rapidly evolve into systemic instability. This paper proposes an integrated ‘Dependency Network–Knowledge Graph (DN-KG)’ framework tailored for intelligence research and academic discourse. This framework abstracts Cambodia's macroeconomic, financial, real estate, fuel and power supply, border security, climate agriculture, tourism services, and governance regulatory systems into node sets. It integrates cross-system constraints and operationalises the DN-KG framework to: DN-KG)‘ framework for intelligence research and academic discourse. This framework abstracts Cambodia's macroeconomic, financial, real estate, fuel and power supply, border security, climate-agriculture, tourism services, and governance-regulation sectors into node sets, while cross-system constraints and transmission relationships are abstracted into edge sets. ’High-betweenness dependency edges\" serve as the core indicator for identifying systemic vulnerabilities. Building upon verifiable OSINT data, this paper constructs a reproducible node-edge inventory and cascade mechanism model. This enables evidence-anchored causal chain interpretation and scenario simulation for short-term trigger points (fuel channels and supply chains), medium-term structural vulnerabilities (US export concentration—employment—household debt—financial asset quality), and risk amplifiers (property correction—collateral — non-performing exposures—credit supply contraction). Research indicates that Cambodia's most critical vulnerability lies not in the weakness of any single sector, but in the cascading structure formed by the combined effects of ‘disruptability × cross-sector spillover × recovery difficulty’ along a few high-degree dependency edges. Therefore, resilience-building priorities should shift from ‘sectoral blood transfusions’ to ‘alternative pathways for critical dependency edges, inventory buffers, and institutional stabilisers’. Furthermore, strictly refraining from providing operational coordination or violence optimisation recommendations, this paper proposes a ‘compliant, auditable, reversible, humanitarian exception’ economic action portfolio for Thailand to adopt in the context of conflict spillover. This aims to reduce regional systemic risk and create conditions for de-escalation negotiations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Communication partners are crucial for adults with severe learning disabilities, as they recognise, interpret, and respond to non-verbal cues while sharing responsibility for creating a meaningful two-way communication process. Evidence-based strategies such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) can enhance interactions; however, their implementation in social care settings is inconsistent, constrained by workforce, organisational, and systemic barriers. This study–which forms part of the Improving Communication with Adults with Learning Disabilities (ICALD) programme–aimed to identify stakeholder-perceived barriers and facilitators to good communication support and to co-develop a Theory of Change (ToC) to guide implementation improvements in social care settings.\n\nMethods: Forty-eight stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, including adults with learning disabilities, participated in a total of 15 ToC workshops, one focus group, two interviews, and four supported conversations. Template Analysis based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify core themes, barriers, and facilitators across CFIR domains. These key findings informed the iterative, collaborative development of the ToC map.\n\nResults: Implementation barriers and facilitators identified across the CFIR domains indicated individual-, organisational-, and system-level factors influencing communication support. Key barriers included limited access to specialist professionals, inconsistent training, fragmented information-sharing systems, and variable staff knowledge of communication needs. Facilitators included strong leadership commitment, collaborative working with speech and language therapists and family carers, and peer mentoring. Supported conversations highlighted the importance of staff responsiveness to non-verbal cues. The resulting ToC map outlines short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes through three core pathways: 1) collaborative development of resources and training, 2) improved information sharing and recording, and 3) ongoing skills development, coaching, and supervision.\n\nConclusions: Improving the implementation of good communication support for adults with severe learning disabilities is likely to depend on organisational commitment, leadership engagement, and structured workforce development supported by specialist input. The ToC developed provides a theoretically grounded framework for translating known facilitators into practical, context-specific strategies. It highlights the necessity of capacity-building within teams and organisational alignment with the communication rights of adults with severe learning disabilities to achieve sustainable, consistent and effective practice change.",

To ensure that evidence-based scales are used for this purpose, comprehensive and transparent reporting of measurement properties is a first essential step. This study aimed to evaluate the reporting quality of studies that applied Rasch analysis on scales designed to measure well-being or QoL in older persons. Articles employing Rasch analysis were identified through a previous broader systematic review of psychometric studies. The findings demonstrate notable deficiencies in the reporting of measurement properties, indicating substantial room for improvement. While detailed reporting alone cannot guarantee that scales possess satisfactory measurement quality, it constitutes a necessary prerequisite for drawing evidence-based conclusions about their measurement quality. Improved reporting practices are essential not only for enhancing the interpretability and replicability of individual studies but also for enabling informed decisions in clinical and policy contexts regarding the use of well-being and QoL scales for older populations.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that frontline workers often discriminate based on race or ethnicity. However, citizens can also display discriminatory behavior—for instance, by requesting service only from workers of the same ethnic or religious background. This discrimination exercised by citizens towards frontline employees remains underexplored. Drawing on studies of citizen–state interactions, discrimination, and political ideology, we investigate when the public finds such requests acceptable. Using a vignette survey experiment with 2,067 Danish citizens, we find that language-based requests are seen as more acceptable than those based on religion. Political ideology significantly shapes these views: right-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from the ethnic majority, while left-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from an ethnic minority. While these single-country findings may not generalize beyond one-to-one interactions characterized by high intimacy, they shed light on how ideology influences public attitudes toward ethnically motivated service preferences and highlight the need to further examine citizen-driven discrimination in public service settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: The structure of causes of death has changed in low-mortality countries, with recent trends showing increasing cause diversity. However, most research overlooks that several conditions often contribute to the process leading to death.\nObjective: This paper develops a framework for studying cause-of-death diversity that accounts for multiple causes of death (MCoD).\nMethods: We introduce novel MCoD life tables to estimate cause diversity based on age-standardized metrics. Two dimensions of diversity are assessed: the average number of causes contributing to death and how diverse are these causes. For the latter dimension, two indexes derived from the Gini-Simpson index are proposed, each based on a different perception of the role of the contributing causes in the process leading to death. All metrics are decomposable and applied to data from Denmark, France, Spain and the U.S.\nResults: The results show increased cause diversity, both in terms of the average number of causes and how evenly deaths are distributed across groups of causes. MCoD yields higher diversity than the underlying causes of death (UCD), confirming that relying solely on UCD downplays the complexity of the mortality process. However, the increase over time in diversity is more modest\nwhen using MCoD compared to UCD. The main driver of increasing cause diversity is the decline in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system.\nContribution: This study offers a novel framework for analyzing cause diversity using MCoD. The proposed metrics are intuitive, life-table-based, and provide valuable insights into the growing complexity of the mortality process across countries.",

          "abstract": "On July 18, 2025, the United States enacted the GENIUS Act, the first federal statute to create a comprehensive regime for payment in stablecoins. This article argues that GENIUS operationalizes state power in digital monetary space and measurably strengthens U.S. financial sovereignty. It analyzes the Act’s core levers, a licensing monopoly over issuance and a three-year perimeter on exchange offerings; aligned categories of permitted issuers; reserves confined to cash, short-tenor Treasuries, AML (Anti Money Laundering) and sanctions obligations. The article links these mechanisms to four sovereignty channels: (i) increased structural demand for U.S. public debt, (ii) consolidation of rule-of-law control over on-chain dollars, (iii) extraterritorial standard-setting through reciprocity regimes, and (iv) policy signaling that legitimizes compliant dollar tokens. However, the Act’s limits are jurisdictional arbitrage, privacy and civil-liberties trade-offs, and dependence on macro credibility. The contribution reframes “monetary sovereignty” as concrete design features and proposes near-term indicators, reserves composition disclosures, treasury rulemaking on AML/sanctions and privacy, and reciprocity determinations for foreign regimes. GENIUS does not settle digital-dollar design, but it materially expands U.S. capacity to anchor private token markets in public money.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the role of gold in the transformation of the global financial and political order, focusing on its relationship with the U.S. dollar during periods of systemic crisis. It assesses whether gold or the dollar provides a more stable reserve asset by analyzing U.S. debt dynamics, BRICS gold accumulation, and recent digital monetary innovations. The study shows that the persistent rise of U.S. public debt, now exceeding $37 trillion, undermines confidence in the dollar’s sustainability despite its continuing dominance as the global reserve currency. In response, BRICS countries increasingly diversify reserves through gold holdings, a practice that functions not only as financial hedging but also as a political act of sovereignty against U.S. monetary coercion and sanctions. However, the absence of a coherent BRICS monetary strategy limits the bloc’s ability to offer a structured alternative to dollar hegemony. At the same time, the United States seeks to reinforce its monetary dominance through regulatory innovation, notably the GENIUS Act, which anchors stablecoins to the dollar. China, by contrast, promotes its digital renminbi (e-CNY) to gradually reduce reliance on dollar-based infrastructures.

          "abstract": "Inspired by the theoretical tension between Goffman’s frontstage self-presentation and McAdams’s narrative identity theory, this study investigated if politicians’ public social media personas are strategic performances or reflect an internalized identity predicting backstage political behavior. We examined this authenticity paradox via U.S. legislators’ dissent voting, linking the language in 3.26 million tweets from 680 U.S. House Representatives (115th–118th Congresses) to 1.32 million roll-call votes. We used different natural language processing and network analysis techniques to measure narrative (agency, communion) and social identities (partisan interaction, structural holes) with fixed-effects panel models to observe that frontstage narratives predict backstage actions. Both agency and communion on Twitter were significantly associated with more dissent voting. Social identity, particularly higher inter-party interaction and spanning inter-party structural holes (lower Burt’s constraint), also positively predicted dissent. Mediation analysis confirmed social identity factors as key mechanisms linking narrative identity to dissent behavior. These findings suggest politicians’ self-narratives are public narratives that help to internalize an identity, shaping a self-concept that drives identity-congruent political action.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more common in K–12 settings, questions remain about whether AI competence can meaningfully support teachers’ psychological health. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, this study examined how teachers’ AI pedagogy efficacy relates to their instructional self-efficacy, engagement self-efficacy, workload, anxiety, and overall mental wellbeing. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 402 U.S. K-12 teachers, we employed hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect pathways. Regression analyses indicated that AI self-efficacy, instructional self-efficacy, engagement self-efficacy, workload, and anxiety all significantly predicted teacher wellbeing. The SEM revealed an indirect pathway in which AI pedagogy efficacy strengthened teachers’ self-efficacy, which in turn reduced perceived workload, lowered anxiety, and ultimately improved teacher mental wellbeing. Findings highlight the importance of building teachers’ AI competence. As AI becomes embedded in K-12 instructional practice, supporting teachers’ confidence in using these tools may serve as a valuable lever for improving teacher wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the social exclusion of people conceived through genocidal rape during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, analyzing their lived experiences through the framework of Martha Nussbaum’s capability theory. Using existing literature, the study shows how contested identities, cultural stereotypes, and social stigma marginalize this set of people across family, community, and societal levels. While people are generally innocent at birth, society still has a way of marginalizing people based on the circumstances of birth. Using Nussbaum’s ten capabilities, this study understands that people born of genocidal rape in Rwanda have diminished capabilities as compared to the majority of society. Such impaired capabilities reinforce social exclusion, which further plunges the victims into a cycle of cultural, political, social, economic, and psychological marginalization. The paper submits that the social exclusion of people born of genocidal rape constitutes social injustice and advocates for the dismantling of cultural barriers to enable the full participation of such individuals in the Rwandan society.",

          "abstract": "Digitalisation has transformed public transport services worldwide, yet disparities in access, skills, and outcomes continue to reinforce a digital divide in how citizens engage with these services. While previous studies have examined the digital divide in internet use and smart technologies, few have explored how these inequalities manifest in everyday interactions with digital public transport platforms. To this end, we investigated user experiences of public transport applications in Birmingham, whose digital inclusion is disproportionate to its status as a major urban and economic hub in the UK, by analysing 4,275 user reviews on public transport services collected from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store between 2016 and 2025. Using a mixed natural language processing (NLP) approach combining topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we identified key themes and emotional tones in user feedback. Results revealed three dominant topics: App Performance, Usability, and Service Satisfaction, each corresponding to the access, ability, and motivation dimensions of the digital divide. Sentiment analysis showed generally negative evaluations, particularly around technical access barriers and satisfaction issues. By integrating user-generated data with digital divide theory, these results provide novel empirical evidence of how inequalities in digital engagement persist within digital twin planning and smart city transport systems, and highlight the importance of inclusive digital design for equitable and sustainable mobility access.",

          "abstract": "This research positions unions as critical agents for achieving labour-centred social sustainability in tourism work. Amidst evolving Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) regulations, social sustainability has gained academic attention. While there is a growing recognition that labour conditions within tourism require improvements to sustain the industry and support the workforce within it, labour-centred social sustainability and the role of unions have received limited consideration to date, despite their important role in protecting decent work and workers’ rights. Based on semi-structured interviews with global union leaders and affiliates, and underpinned by Institutional Theory, this paper proposes a framework that shows how unions shift from a traditional union paradigm towards social-sustainability-oriented unionism. During this process, labour unions engage and intervene at various levels in tourism, mobilising normative claims, shaping regulatory structures and reframing cognitive-cultural understandings. This research argues that unions should be equal and strategic partners of tourism stakeholders to implement robust labour-centred social sustainability practices and policies to achieve improved tourism labour conditions, improved business outcomes and wider social sustainability. As ESG regulations come into force and severe labour shortages continue, the paper offers timely insight and guidance on how to improve mandatory social sustainability efforts and attract and retain talent.",

          "abstract": "This article examines writing—specifically the researcher diary—as a method of embodied and affective knowing within a qualitative study of initiatory experiences in sensitive research contexts. Drawing on autoethnography, affect theory, and the hermeneutics of experience, I argue that writing functions not merely as a tool of documentation but as a pre-analytic epistemic practice through which meaning emerges in the relational space between researcher and participants. The article is grounded in a qualitative project exploring initiation as a biographical, educational, and existential process among three groups: individuals working in thanatopedagogy, people involved in sex work and embodied sexual practices, and adults seeking or experiencing spiritual initiation. Within this study, the researcher diary played a central role in capturing embodied reactions, affective tensions, silences, and somatic traces that precede formal interpretation. The analysis demonstrates that embodied epistemology—understood as knowledge arising through the body, emotion, and relational presence—is crucial in research involving death, sexuality, spirituality, and biographical thresholds. The findings reveal recurring narrative structures of initiation, including symbolic crossings, processes of transformation, and micro-initiations understood as subtle internal shifts. At the same time, the diary documents the researcher’s own transformation, showing that fieldwork becomes a shared initiatory space in which knowledge is co-created. Conceptualizing writing as an epistemic micro-ritual, the article shows that writing is not the final stage of research but an ongoing mode of inquiry that intertwines analysis with reflexivity, vulnerability, and ethical relationality. The study contributes to reflexive qualitative methodology by demonstrating how embodied writing practices support the production of situated, affective, and relational knowledge in sensitive research contexts.\n\nKeywords: embodied knowing, autoethnography, researcher’s journal, initiation, affective epistemology, sensitive research",

          "abstract": "Social groups are arenas for both cohesion and conflict. Whereas prevailing theories focus on how these processes unfold at the boundaries between groups, the authors focus on the tensions that emerge within groups and that give rise to uncivil discourse. They develop a novel theoretical account of its network-structural antecedents. In polarized online groups, they hypothesize that the greater the structural similarity between two individuals, the less likely they will be to direct uncivil language toward one another. They further argue that this relationship will be moderated by the degree of group polarization. Using a node embedding algorithm (i.e., node2vec) to derive an omnibus measure of interpersonal structural similarity, they find support for the theory using a dataset that encompasses more than 25 million comments made by over 1.7 million users in six polarized communities on Reddit. They discuss implications for research on intergroup animosity, group polarization, the measurement of structural similarity, and the interplay of structure and culture.",

This study investigates how the Dutch public evaluates such trade-offs in the context of a potential outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to a representative sample of 1,045 respondents from the LISS panel, we examined preferences across six policy outcomes: mortality, lasting physical and mental injuries, postponed healthcare, social restrictions, and one-off tax payments. A latent class logit model identified four distinct preference profiles, revealing substantial heterogeneity in moral and economic reasoning. Two classes exhibited taboo trade-off aversion (TTOA) when values such as life or human dignity were traded against monetary costs. Respondents displaying TTOA emphasized solidarity and governmental responsibility, while cost-sensitive groups prioritized economic efficiency. These findings highlight that public acceptance of pandemic policies depends not only on effectiveness and cost but also on perceived moral legitimacy. Accounting for TTOA in economic evaluation can improve the ethical considerations and societal acceptability of future pandemic preparedness strategies.",

          "authors": "Mila Desi Anasanti",
          "abstract": "Indonesia, the world’s largest palm-oil producer, has undergone extensive forest conversion over the past two decades through forest-release policies and plantation licensing, particularly in Sumatra and Kalimantan. These land-use changes have degraded watershed buffering capacity and increased the frequency and severity of hydrological disasters for downstream communities. Yet such transformations are routinely obscured by political narratives that present palm oil as a green, pro-poor, and sovereign commodity, while dismissing concerns over deforestation as biased or misleading. Recent presidential claims that “palm oil is just trees that absorb CO₂” exemplify an emerging post-truth environmental discourse that equates plantations with forests and weakens climate commitments.\n\nThis article develops a political-ecology analysis of Indonesia’s palm-oil–disaster nexus by bringing together three conceptual lenses: (1) the political ecology of commodity frontiers and forest governance; (2) post-truth environmental politics and the strategic denial of ecological harm; and (3) disaster populism and crisis-time “governance by spectacle.” Drawing on validated secondary evidence on deforestation, licensing decisions, watershed degradation, and major flood events, complemented by NGO investigations, media reporting, and selected policy documents, the article employs a within-case interpretive design combining process tracing and discourse analysis.\n\nWe show how state–business coalitions facilitating forest conversion are legitimised through post-truth narratives, and how subsequent flood disasters become stages for personalised, mediatised food-aid spectacles that reinforce elite legitimacy while diverting attention from structural drivers of vulnerability. These findings suggest that Indonesia’s climate and disaster governance is increasingly organised around symbolic relief and denial rather than risk reduction and justice. Policy implications include re-evaluating forest-release permits in high-risk watersheds, clarifying legal definitions of “forest” versus “plantation,” improving data transparency, and de-personalising disaster relief within rights-based frameworks.",

Bangladesh is a sought-after partner for China due to its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. Previously, India seemed to have a significant amount of control over Bangladesh. However, India's long-standing concerns about its power over Bangladesh have gradually been eroded by China's growing influence in the political, military, economic, and infrastructure spheres. The paper demonstrates the degree to which China has already surpassed India in Bangladesh's key industries. It also determines if China's increasing influence in Bangladesh is weakening India’s image in South Asia by examining regional ramifications, repercussions for Bangladesh's foreign policy, and India-Bangladesh relations.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the role of amber in Russian culture during the reign of Anna Ioannovna (1730–1740), as well as the empress’s engagement in this process. Amber is presented as a material used in decorative art, an object of scientific research, and a potential collectible. An analysis of early to mid-18th century documents and publications suggests that Anna Ioannovna shared the interest in amber typical of many European aristocrats of that time; she also made some efforts to promote the development of the natural science amber collection at the Saint Petersburg Kunstkamera and of research into amber at the Academy of Sciences. The importance of archival documents for reconstructing the cultural and historical context of the formation of collections, identifying the sources and conditions of this process in the first decades of the 18th century in Russia, is justified. Special attention is paid to amber artworks that are typologically comparable with those now stored in Russian museum collections. The activities of scientists in the formation and scientific description of amber collections are shown using the example of a project submitted for consideration to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences by A. P. Volynsky, and the first popular science article on amber written by G. V. Richman. A document from the collection of the Russian State Historical Archive, titled “On the theft of amber items from the house of Anna Ioannovna”, which contains information on popular types of amber objects included in everyday life of Russian society, is introduced into scholarly discourse.",

          "abstract": "The paper examines the situation of growing attention to the practices of confession, which took place at the turn of the 10th–11th centuries and which lasted until the end of the 12th century. The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the statements by representatives of the Middle Byzantine canonical thought and discover methods (concepts, categories, hierarchical systems) by which they integrated the phenomenon of secret confession into a complex system of relationships in Byzantine society, and to evaluate their compatibility with the discourse of the time. The article consists of two parts which trace the situation during the 11th and 12th centuries, respectively. Each of these is further divided into two sections: in the first one the positions of the main authors of the period are described, while in the second they are analyzed and provided with historical contextualization. Part One compares historical narratives concerning the development of the institution of confession developed by three authors: St. Symeon the New Theologian, Patriarch John IV the Oxite of Antioch, and ex-chartophylax Nicephorus. It turns out that all three see the situation in a similar way, although they differ in their evaluation of it. The juxtaposition of these stories and their historical context allows us to conclude that the interests of the state and church authorities coincided on the issue of regulating confessional practices. This part serves as context for the subsequent assessment of the views of 12th-century authors. Part Two of the article describes and examines the phenomenon of a significant increase of the occurrence of the concept of “power” (ἐξουσία) in texts containing reflections on confession. The positions of key 12th-century church canonists are analyzed: Alexius Aristinus, John Zonaras, Theodore Balsamon, and Anonymous, the author of an unpublished commentary on Nomocanon contained in the Codex Sinaiticus 1117. Their ideas about how the “power to bind and loose” arises, exists, and is transmitted in the Church are reconstructed. The correlation of these ideas with the discussions of the 11th century allows us to assert that although Balsamon’s model was the most detailed, it also turned out to be the least organic to the views of its time, which predetermined its fate. In conclusion, a connection is made with the subsequent late Byzantine period, in which the ideas of the previous time were partly adopted and partly abandoned.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Nikolay Konstantinovich Antonov",
          "abstract": "The article continues the study of the principles of constructing the image of a priest in late Antiquity using the example of the “Apology” by St. Gregory the Theologian. It is demonstrated that the literary image of a priest is constructed by using images of other bearers of authority and is thought of as one of them: Gregory uses the topoi and vocabulary of political literature. The key image is that of the Platonic philosopher-ruler, as well as vocabulary from the monarchical rather than democratic tradition. The origin and tradition of using the formula “the art of arts and the science of sciences” (τέχνη τεχνῶν καὶ ἐπιστήμη ἐπιστημῶν), by which the author defines the priesthood, is studied. It is shown that in this way Gregory puts the priest in the place of the philosopher of the Platonic tradition. This is confirmed by an analysis of allusions to Plato’s Gorgias, which contains images of two universal power roles: the rhetorician and the philosopher. The comparison of caring for the soul with medicine, which originates in this dialogue, is further developed by Gregory, who incorporates into it provisions of the Christian gospel and describes principles of spiritual counseling that have no precedent in earlier writings. In addition, the author combines the functions of a rhetorician and a priest in the described image, thus making him a comprehensive leader of the church space, conceptualized by analogy with the polis. In conclusion, a comparison is made with the image of Pythagoras as described by Iamblichus, who, like the priest, combines a political dimension (rule of a community) with a soteriological perspective through varied types of influence on the soul: through public speech, individual communication, example, and a cult. The comparison allows us to see that the priest and the local Church are thought of by Gregory not as a separate new political space with its own power structure, but as its metaphorical projection, universal in defining identity, but not denying the existing political institutions.",

          "abstract": "Education policy in transitional democracies is particularly vulnerable to politicization due to weak institutional safeguards, polarized political environments, and unstable policy continuity. This study examines the politicization of education reform in Georgia, analyzing how recently announced policy changes reflect broader patterns of political control rather than evidence-based educational development. Using qualitative policy analysis, the research focuses on government-announced reform proposals, official statements, and public discourse to assess how political priorities and ideological narratives are embedded in the reform agenda.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the reform is shaped by centralized agenda-setting, ambiguous political concepts such as “university identity,” and governance mechanisms that increase state control over academic institutions. Proposed structural changes, including the reduction of schooling and degree durations, are shown to undermine Georgia’s alignment with the Bologna Process and restrict international academic mobility. Drawing comparative insights from the Russian precedent, the study highlights the risks of academic isolation and ideological capture associated with politically driven education reforms.\n\nThe findings suggest that the reform does not enhance educational quality or institutional autonomy but instead advances the politicization and centralization of the education system. By weakening academic freedom, marginalizing professional expertise, and distancing Georgia from European education standards, the reform poses significant risks to democratic development and European integration. The study concludes that safeguarding education policy from political interference is essential for democratic resilience in transitional democracies.",

          "abstract": "The study of cognitive biases has dominated behavioral economics and cognitive psychology for nearly half a century, proposing a view of human cognition as systematically flawed. This chapter presents a fundamental reconceptualization of cognitive biases through the lens of ecological rationality and developmental plasticity. Building on Oeberst and Imhoff's (2023) insight that many biases reflect belief-consistent information processing, we argue that these phenomena may be better understood as instances of adaptive mismatch—situations where cognitive strategies that were adaptive in their original environmental context produce suboptimal results when applied in novel environments. Rather than viewing these mismatches as products of fixed, evolutionarily-designed modules, we propose that they emerge from the flexible reassembly of basic cognitive capabilities through cultural learning processes, as suggested by the cognitive gadgets approach. This framework integrates several theoretical perspectives: the reconceptualization of decision-making as continuous environmental navigation rather than discrete choice; understanding cognitive strategies as ecologically rational adaptations to environmental structure; viewing mismatches as informative signals within a vector field of potential adaptations; and analyzing heuristics through the lens of predictive processing. We provide concrete examples from empirical research that demonstrate how seemingly irrational behaviors can be understood as adaptive responses to specific environmental structures. Our synthesis offers a theoretical integration across multiple research traditions while suggesting new approaches to research methodology and policy intervention. This ecological perspective not only provides a more nuanced account of why cognitive \"biases\" persist but also suggests more effective approaches to education, decision support, and public policy that work with, rather than against, the ecological design of human cognition.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "The newly introduced ‘sealing of public security violation records’ system under the revised Public Security Administration Punishment Law has sparked intense debate due to its implications for public safety expectations concerning highly sensitive activities such as drug-related offences, occupational access boundaries, and data governance risks. This paper refrains from making factual determinations regarding online allegations against any specific individuals or institutions. Instead, it adopts a ‘systemic security governance’ methodology to explore how the legislature can achieve risk containment, factual clarification, and institutional consolidation within the rule of law framework when significant societal doubts arise (including ‘indications of potential external undue influence during the legislative proposal stage’) and supporting regulations have yet to form a rigid closed-loop system. This paper proposes: guided by the normative benchmarks of scientific, democratic, and lawful legislation emphasised in Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, and framed by the risk management principles of coordinating people's security, political security, and institutional security as required by the overall national security outlook, the NPCSC should lawfully arrange for the temporary suspension of Article 136's key application provisions within a specified timeframe. concurrently initiating investigations into specific issues or specialised reviews. This would establish an auditable governance chain of ‘first contain risks, then investigate thoroughly, finally consolidate,’ thereby minimising systemic spillover costs to public safety, data security, and public trust without undermining institutional objectives.",

Si bien estudios internacionales han explorado el impacto de estas plataformas, en el Perú la investigación es aún escasa. El objetivo de este estudio es investigar si las variables género y edad están estadísticamente asociadas al consumo de noticias en las redes sociales. Empleando una muestra representativa de la población adulta en línea (N = 2005), este artículo se enfoca en seis plataformas: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X —ex-Twitter—, TikTok y WhatsApp. El análisis descriptivo e inferencial, basado en la prueba estadística de chi-cuadrado de Rao-Scott, reveló diferencias significativas según el género en la mayoría de las plataformas examinadas, con los usuarios hombres prefiriendo YouTube y X para consumir noticias, y las mujeres inclinándose hacia TikTok e Instagram. El estudio también halló diferencias según la edad. Facebook y YouTube emergieron como las plataformas dominantes para acceder a noticias, particularmente entre los grupos de mayor edad, mientras que TikTok mostró una tendencia predominante entre los jóvenes de 18 a 29 años. Estos resultados subrayan la complejidad y el dinamismo de los repertorios mediáticos de consumo de noticias en la era digital y la importancia de considerar los factores demográficos como variables clave en el contexto del Perú.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Emil Eldarovich Otakulov",
          "abstract": "This article analyzes the origin and development of the legend of Charlemagne’s journey to Jerusalem and Constantinople. Its roots lie in ninth-century Frankish historiography: authors transformed Charlemagne’s diplomatic exchanges with the East into a narrative centered on Caliph Harun al Rachid’s concession of jurisdiction over the holy sites in Jerusalem. The evolution of the Emperor’s image as an ecclesiastical benefactor and collector of relics further contributed to the legend, as sending ambassadors with gifts and meeting pilgrims were replaced by his independent pilgrimage to the Holy Land in search of Passion relics. Charlemagne’s acquisition of relics of the Passion became a politically significant symbol of the transfer of imperial dignity from the Greeks to the Franks, beginning with his imaginary journey to the East. As the idea of a crusading movement developed, the friendship between Harun and Charlemagne faded, and his pilgrimage assumed the characteristics of a military campaign imbued with crusading rhetoric. The sources recounting Charlemagne’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem were composed independently of one another, which precludes the possibility of a continuous development within a single tradition. However, in each case, the author’s perspective may have been shaped by a collective belief in the potential reality of such an occurrence, and adapted to specific contexts. Consequently, Charlemagne’s journey to the East and the liberation of Jerusalem came to be seen as part of a broader sequence of events, alongside emperor Heraclius’ victory over the Sasanian Empire and the First Crusade.\n\nВ статье рассматривается, как возникла и развивалась легенда о путешествии Карла Великого в Иерусалим и Константинополь. Ее истоки можно найти уже в каролингской историографии: авторы преобразовали упоминания о дипломатических отношениях с Востоком в передачу Гроба Господня франкскому императору. Становлению легенды также способствовало и развитие образа Карла как покровителя Церкви и собирателя реликвий, так как обмен послами и встречи паломников сменились его самостоятельным путешествием в Святую землю за реликвиями Страстей Господних. Перенос реликвий играл и важную политическую роль, символизируя преемственность империи на Западе. По мере развития идей крестоносного движения на Восток дружба Карла Великого с Харуном ар-Рашидом исчезла из истории, а его паломничество приобрело милитаристские мотивы в духе крестоносной риторики. Источники, повествующие о путешествии Карла Великого на Восток, были созданы обособленно друг от друга, что не позволяет утверждать о поступательном развитии этого сюжета в рамках единой традиции. Однако авторская позиция в каждом случае могла опираться на сформированное в народе представление о возможности такого события, отчего впоследствии этот сюжет даже вошел в историографию и встроился в череду исторических событий наряду с победой императора Ираклия над персами и Первым крестовым походом.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have established that abrupt and consequential periods of political uncertainty–or “eventful” times–impact political attitudes. But we still know little on whether events can affect political practices. I investigate how eventful times affect levels and socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in frequency of interpersonal political discussion, a consequential political practice and a high quality indicator of sustained political engagement. Drawing from citizen competence and social cognition studies, I hypothesize that events provoke political talk increases that will be moderate and unequalizing relative to SES for adults but large and equalizing for the young. I find empirical support for this expectation by evaluating differences between West Germany and France in political discussion changes before and during German Reunification. I develop and deploy an original quantitative indicator of eventfulness to show that this comparison meets difference-in-differences quasi-experimental conditions that tackles previously unaddressed validity issues related to history and ambiguous causal precedence.",

We highlight how laws targeting a specific group of citizens can have weak effects on turnout and vote shares but substantial effects on policy platforms, thereby influencing substantive representation even if there are no observable effects on participation. To parse these effects, we analyze a model of electoral competition with endogenous turnout and targeted voting costs. Each party anticipates the direct effect of raising one side's voting costs: discouraging targeted citizens from voting. Consequently, both platforms shift towards the untargeted group. These platform adjustments mobilize targeted citizens and demobilize the untargeted, muting the net impact on turnout and vote shares—consistent with empirical evidence for small electoral effects. Policy effects, however, hurt targeted citizens and their aligned party. The targeted group's size amplifies these effects. Our results address party competition, participation, representation, and normative and empirical evaluations of voting laws.",

The index behaves as theory predicts, correlating with municipal characteristics that prior research links to corruption. Supervised learning alternatives yield nearly identical municipal rankings (R2=0.98), confirming that the dictionary approach captures the same underlying construct.

          "authors": "Jan Wetzel",
          "abstract": "Economic historians increasingly stress that Europe’s early modern economic growth cannot be explained by changes in production alone. Demand-based accounts, notably Jan de Vries’ “Industrious Revolution,” describe a shift toward a “New Luxury” of inventiveness and style, set against older views of consumption driven by emulation. This article argues that such dichotomies obscure the coexistence of Old Luxury (rank and emulation) and New Luxury (innovation and novelty). Their interplay, rather than their succession, expanded consumption by allowing rank to be reaffirmed through innovation. Textile pattern books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries exemplify this process. Produced by commercially driven publishers and marketed to women, they diffused design trends while accommodating a hierarchy-oriented moral order. The analysis of prefaces and dedications reveals that a prestige of industriousness was central; yet this did not replace the prestige of noble birth, but rather made it possible to shift distinctions by redefining rank through labor. In this sense, social hierarchy did not stand in the way of innovation through producer–consumer interaction but was, in fact, constitutive of it. However, as the analysis shows, this expansion required design as a luxury based on the virtues of knowledge and labor.",

          "authors": "Marco Mele; Alberto Costantiello; Fabio Anobile; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper evaluates the structural, environmental, and climatic factors influencing carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector (CBE) in 27 European Union member states from 2005 to 2023. This analysis uses panel data from the World Bank and four econometric models—Random Effects, Fixed Effects, Dynamic Panel GMM, and Weighted Least Squares—coupled with machine learning and clustering to provide a robust analysis of emissions. The econometric models show that all models support a negative relationship between agriculture, forestry, and fishing value added (AFFV) and forest area (FRST), suggesting that a robust rural economy and substantial natural carbon sinks are accompanied by lower emissions in the building sector. On the other hand, water stress (WSTR), PM2.5 pollution, heating and cooling degree days, and nitrous oxide emissions (N2OP) are found to significantly, yet positively, affect CBE. Tests of diagnostic analyses support Fixed Effects and Weighted Least Squares models, whereas results from GMM models are limited by instrument validity violations. In machine learning analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models are found to be most diagnostic, with all performance metrics being improved, establishing a prominent role for coal electricity, water stress, agricultural intensities, and climatic factors. Subsequently, a solution with 10 clusters, selected using Bayesian Information Criteria and silhouettes, identified a set of environmental and economic characteristics based on differences between low- and high-emission groups. High-emitting groups result from agricultural intensification, pollution, and low energy efficiency, while low-emitting groups are associated with renewable energy, low pollution, and a favorable climate. This analysis, hence, presents a multifaceted assessment of building sector emissions, with climatic, structural, and energy transition patterns as driving factors for meeting decarbonization targets for the European Union.",

          "abstract": "In modern Indian and Western cultures, the focus is mostly on the physical health and fitness of future generations, rather than mental, spiritual, emotional, and moral values. Due to this ignorance, the upcoming generation is becoming directionless and deprived of emotional and moral values; and is getting involved in different kinds of misconduct.\nThe founder / patron of All World Gayatri Pariwar, Yug Rishi Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya ji has stated several methodologies in his literature for the development of the future generation. He directed that the decline in humanistic and moral values in children, and the downfall of society, culture, and morality starts in the womb of the mother. The foundation of the personality (body and mind) of a child is laid in the womb of a mother. So, this knowledge, based on evidence and scientific findings, should be spread to the masses, not only for the development of an individual or family, but also for the interest of the nation and the world. This will help in the development of a civilized, cultured, and virtuous future generation. All such inspiring efforts for the emotional and spiritual development of future generations are combined under a systematic movement known as the “Aao Gadhe Sanskarwan Peedhi” program. This research paper depicts one such case study of ‘Gharbhotsav Sanskar’ under the movement “Aao Gadhe Sanskarwan Peedhi”, in which the effect of basic teachings of ancient Indian culture on the developmental milestones of a new-born child have been studied. Several developmental milestones of the child, up to the age of 2 years, happened much earlier (were preponed) as compared to the standard developmental milestones, illustrating the effectiveness of the above methodology in the creation of an advanced offspring as compared to its normal peers. The results clearly depict the effectiveness of the basic elements of the ancient Indian culture, with regards to the creation of an advanced future generation.",

Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost, and that a GDP growth rate lower than the risk-free rate is actually negative. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate that probably follows a blended normal distribution of Nie (2023).",

          "abstract": "Predatory publishing – for-profit academic publishers and journals publishing academic articles with inadequate quality control – is a professional and societal problem in modern science. Due to their illegitimacy and unprofessionalism, predatory publishers and journals are seldom indexed by major journal bibliographic indices, such as Scopus or the Web of Science. This lack of indexed metadata makes analyzing the predatory publishing market difficult. To fill this gap, we collected journal metadata of corpuses of six probable predatory publishers, comprised of 310,924 articles. We also collected metadata of four other publishers of higher – but contested – legitimacy, to compare with metadata of 54 million articles indexed in the Web of Science. Our research pinpoints precise geographic, institutional and disciplinary sites where probable predatory publishing occurs. Scholars affiliated with developing countries and lower-status institutions disproportionately publish in probable predatory journals. However, since academically central countries and high-status institutions are prolific publishers, they provide much of the money and articles that support the predatory publishing market, even if predatory publishing is a proportionately smaller problem in privileged institutions. Predatory publishing is a worldwide problem, with varying niches and consequences in different institutions and countries. Inequalities in resources and scientific reward structures influence intellectual choices of scholars throughout the world, including propensities for knowingly or naively publishing articles in predatory journals.

          "abstract": "Natural disasters span political boundaries, yet their devastating impacts vary widely across political jurisdictions. I argue that this is because of the differences in political incentives to uphold regulations concerning disaster preparedness. Turkey’s 2023 earthquake provides a rare empirical window to observe the cumulative effects of otherwise hidden political incentives. Leveraging the quasi-random shock of the earthquake, I employ a spatial regression discontinuity design along municipal boundaries in the earthquake region. I treat long-term party rule as the treatment and neighborhood-level destruction as the outcome. The analysis shows that neighborhoods governed by the same municipal party for more than 25 years experienced approximately 20\\% less destruction than their adjacent, politically contested counterparts. These findings translate into substantially lower exposure of hundreds of residents to known disaster risks. The results demonstrate that electoral competition without institutional brakes can deteriorate long-term policy outcomes. My paper underscores the importance of sharing accountability with technocratic oversight in policy areas requiring sustained infrastructural investment, such as disaster preparedness.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "Abstract. Larger gaps in political engagement between individuals with high and low socioeconomic status (SES) are increasingly viewed as a threat to democratic quality. This paper investigates how such gaps in interpersonal political discussion have evolved in Western Europe over the last fifty years. While prior empirical work has often found these gaps to be stable, leading models of political behavior suggest they should have changed in response to rising economic inequality—though they differ on whether those changes were driven by increases or decreases in participation, and whether they were led by individuals at the top or bottom of the SES distribution. To evaluate these expectations, I analyze nearly one million survey responses from 843 Eurobarometer surveys conducted across 141 time points between 1973 and 2021. I find that SES gaps in political discussion followed an inverse quadratic trajectory: narrowing from the 1970s through the 1990s, and then widening again to levels comparable to those observed in the 1980s. Using Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) models, I identify economic inequality as the strongest predictor of this trend. Its effect, however, is negative—higher inequality is associated with narrower gaps in political discussion. The results also show that the evolution of these gaps was driven largely by shifts in political discussion among high-SES individuals, rather than disengagement among the less advantaged. Overall, the results do not suggest that economic inequality has driven increases in political discussion gaps. Instead, they point to the role that internet expansion and party fragmentation may have played in widening these gaps since the early 2000s.",

          "abstract": "The global games industry engages nearly three billion players, yet instrumental applications of\ngames for behavioral change, from gamification to serious games, demonstrate a puzzling\ninconsistency between short-term engagement and long-term outcomes. While these interventions\nconsistently generate initial enthusiasm, meta-analyses reveal that behavioral effects typically\ndiminish beyond three months, with changes rarely persisting after interventions conclude. This\npattern contrasts markedly with games' demonstrable cultural influence as evident in community\nformation, identity development, and sustained engagement over years or decades. We propose that\nthis discrepancy reflects fundamental theoretical inadequacies in how behavioral interventions\nconceptualize games' influence on human behavior.\nDrawing on converging evidence from cultural economics, computational neuroscience, cognitive\nscience, and game studies, we develop a framework that reconceptualizes gameplay as cultural\nmeaning-making rather than behavioral conditioning. The framework articulates how sustainable\nbehavioral transformation emerges through dynamic interactions between four interrelated\ndimensions: games as designed cultural artifacts, play as evolved behavioral disposition, gameplay\nas situated embodied experience, and re-play as reflective cultural practice. Situating this\nframework within active inference and free energy principle perspectives provides computational\nprecision to these meaning-making processes, whereas cognitive gadget theory illuminates how\nplay serves as a foundational environment for constructing distinctively human cognitive capacities.\nCentral to our analysis is what we term the ludic dilemma, a tension between play's intrinsically\nmotivated, autotelic nature and attempts to instrumentalize it for predetermined behavioral\noutcomes. We suggest that this tension helps explain the persistent failures of mechanistic\ninterventions while pointing toward alternative approaches that preserve play's essential qualities\nand enable behavioral transformation through extended cultural processes. The framework\ngenerates testable predictions about temporal dynamics, cross-cultural variations, and\ndevelopmental trajectories that distinguish cultural meaning-making accounts from mechanistic\nalternatives, with implications for an understanding of cultural learning, behavioral change\ninterventions, and human cognitive evolution.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "How do historical events—emergent, intense, and collectively experienced instances of political contingency—generate sweeping bursts of political engagement immediately after they occur? Rational choice perspectives see this capacity as stemming from how events perform as purveyors of information for citizens with exogenous and invariant political identities. Available cultural approaches, by contrast, contend that events politicize by changing the meanings people use to navigate political life. Different as they are, both perspectives assume that events’ politicizing impact remains contained within the domain of political experience. But, since politics is rarely instantiated in everyday life, they cannot fully adequately explain how events generate sweeping political activation. I offer an alternative “spillover” approach to understanding how events produce immediate politicization. I argue that the locus of this influence is located events’ ability to generate semantic disruptions that allow political narratives to infiltrate the stories and identities that guide social action within social domains that have more routinary instantiation. I develop this argument by drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in São Paulo in the wake of the unexpectedly strong victory of right-wing extremist Jair Bolsonaro in the first round 2018 Brazilian presidential election. My observations in public spaces and moments of sociability between left-leaning citizens portray this moment as one characterized by “politicization without politics”. Bolsonaro’s surprising electoral showing intensified feelings of vulnerability, prompting political perceptual and behavioral shifts that were rooted in personal rather than explicitly personal domains of social experience. These spillovers to the personal domain produced an environment of political “engagement without action” where visible political behavior drastically decreased and political conversations and interactions in intimate places skyrocketed.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "Previous studies have established that abrupt and consequential periods of political uncertainty–or “eventful” times–impact political attitudes. But we still know little on whether events can affect political practices. I investigate how eventful times affect levels and socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in frequency of interpersonal political discussion, a consequential political practice and a high quality indicator of sustained political engagement. Drawing from citizen competence and social cognition studies, I hypothesize that events provoke political talk increases that will be moderate and unequalizing relative to SES for adults but large and equalizing for the young. I find empirical support for this expectation by evaluating differences between West Germany and France in political discussion changes before and during German Reunification. I develop and deploy an original quantitative indicator of eventfulness to show that this comparison meets difference-in-differences quasi-experimental conditions that tackles previously unaddressed validity issues related to history and ambiguous causal precedence.",

          "abstract": "How do people assess the authenticity and legitimacy of another person’s racial self-identification? This study explores the racial conceptions held by both Black and White Americans as they decide who they believe can–and cannot–self-identify as Black across a range of contexts. Further, we examine how a person’s responses compare to their perceptions of how other Americans evaluate racial claims. Using a series of survey experiments, we find that respondents privilege the information contained in genetic ancestry tests over and above other attributes, such as self-identification. We do not observe meaningful differences by race in the treatment effects, illustrating the shared nature of these schemas. However, we find a discordance between respondents’ beliefs and their perceptions of how other Americans would respond in similar settings, suggesting that the attributes that people themselves use in both classifications and to judge authenticity differ from their perceptions of the broader social ‘rules’ regarding race.",

It is applied in a systematic review of 96 cases across OECD coun-tries, sourced from 73 peer-reviewed articles. The review connects the analytical power of arti-ficial intelligence in concert with expert domain knowledge. The synthesis of both enables a precise and comprehensive examination of policy and implementation dimensions, yielding critical insights into the schemes’ designs and functioning, and their broader applicability. We find considerable heterogeneity among schemes indicating flexibility for decision-makers to adapt schemes to specific environmental targets at local scale, but that there is still significant room to enhance the role of farmers as key players in collective agri-environmental schemes. By integrating human expertise with the capabilities of large language models, our approach exemplifies how to balance and mitigate the limitations of each, enhancing both the reliability and transparency of the review process.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we build on Emory Bogardus’ classical sociology of distance to develop a relational framework for understanding attitudes related to democratic coexistence. Extending his insight into the political realm, we frame political social distance as the (dis)comfort citizens feel toward supporters of the party they would never vote for, as in-laws, friends, co-workers, or neighbors. Using original survey data from eight European democracies, we show that social trust consistently reduces distance toward political outgroups, while ideological orientation influences this disposition asymmetrically: respondents on the left exhibit higher political social distance than those on the right. Moreover, citizens who attach strong importance to democracy display greater distance toward opponents, a paradox we term democratic exclusivism, grounded in a moral rather than procedural conception of democracy. These findings have important implications for democratic quality, as they reveal both the social foundations that may enable peaceful democratic coexistence and the attitudinal barriers that may gradually weaken it.",

          "authors": "Ruth Eva Jørgensen",
          "abstract": "Parental partnership dissolution appears to hamper educational outcomes among children, but the question of whether this association reflects a causal effect versus selection mechanisms remains contested. By triangulating two quasi-experimental approaches: Children-of-Twins design (CoT) and adoption design, this study assesses the educational penalties of parental partnership dissolution in Norway. Administrative population registers are used to identify adoptees and a matched sample of non-adopted peers. For the CoT-design, these data are linked to the Norwegian Twin Registry, which includes adult twin pairs and their offspring. Both analyses rely on child cohorts born between 1986 and 2006. The CoT-design compares educational outcomes of offspring of twins, exploiting variation in dissolution within and between twin pairs, while the adoption analysis compares the association in adoptees versus a matched sample of non-adopted peers. Two key educational outcomes are analyzed: grade point average (GPA) at the end of compulsory schooling and high school completion. Results from CoT analyses show that parental dissolution is negatively associated with both GPA and high school completion. Yet, the association attenuates once shared family background and genetic factors are accounted for. The adoption design similarly shows a negative association for both adoptees and non-adoptees, but the notably weaker association among adoptees indicates that genetic confounding partly underlies the observed link. Taken together, the findings suggest that parental separation exerts an adverse effect on children’s educational outcomes, while selection mechanisms also account for a non-trivial share of the association.",

          "authors": "Federica Bologna; Ian Lundberg; Matthew Wilkens",
          "abstract": "Stakeholders in the publishing industry observe strong gender homophily between authors and readers, but it is unclear what causes this alignment. One possible mechanism involves reader preferences for gendered characters – specifically, the largely untested hypothesis that men are less inclined to read books with women protagonists, while women are more willing to read stories featuring protagonists of any gender. This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character? Would women be more likely to read it if it featured a woman character? Our study provides new causal evidence on these questions in a well-powered study. Using a randomized survey experiment involving 3,000 participants, we isolate the causal effect of protagonist gender on reader preferences. Our findings reveal that the effect of character gender is close to zero. Contrary to popular belief, men’s reading preferences were unaffected by the gender of the protagonist. Women, on the other hand, displayed a slight preference for stories featuring women protagonists. These results challenge a subset of industry assumptions and reassure publishers and authors that books about women characters will not necessarily alienate readers.",

          "abstract": "How do epistemic cultures – as originally defined and reconstructed by Karin Knorr-Cetina (1999) – fuel expert controversies and contribute to lasting stale-mate situations in evidence-based regulatory disputes? Are there scientific cultures that transgress the epistemic dimension, e.g. in technosciences that combine an orientation towards better understanding with an ambition to intervene, control and create, or in so-called post-normal sciences (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1992) that combine an orientation towards better understanding with a mission to address societal problems? How do contemporary innovation regimes impact on scientific cultures and academic living spaces (Felt 2009)? These are the central questions I address in my ‘Rahmenschrift’ and the relating published texts.\nThe ‘Rahmenschrift’ starts with an outline of the initial introduction of the concept of ‘epistemic cultures’ within science and technology studies. It adds further approaches that became influential in our understanding of scientific cultures, like Becher’s (1989) investigation of ‘academic tribes and territories’, higher education research into campus cultures and academic socialisation processes or Lave and Wenger’s work on ‘communities of practice’ (Lave and Wenger 1991, Wenger 1999). This first part of the ‘Rahmenschrift’ ends with an overview of current scholarly discussions that focus on reconstructions of and critical reflections on change in epistemic cultures.\nIn the second part of the Rahmenschrift, I introduce my own engagement with the concept of epistemic cultures that goes back to my PhD project on disciplinary socialisation processes. I then move on to outline my reconstruction of ‘cultures of non-knowledge’ within expert controversies and explain how this research ignited my interest in more-than-epistemic cultures, namely techno-epistemic cultures and post-normal scientific cultures. In a short third part, I summarise the aspects that I see the most central for further developing our understanding of epistemic cultures and for applying this understanding to open questions in science and society.",

          "authors": "Mikolaj Szoltysek; Mateusz Grzyb; Bartosz Ogorek; Siegfried Gruber; J. David Hacker",
          "abstract": "This article revisits the Patriarchy Index (PI) a decade after its introduction, extending its scope to the United States around 1900 and situating it within the broader North Atlantic demographic regime. Using harmonized census microdata from IPUMS USA, NAPP, and Mosaic, we estimate PI values for the 1880 and 1910 U.S. censuses and compare them with contemporaneous European populations. The study provides the first systematic spatial mapping of family-based patriarchy in the United States, disaggregated by race and region, and identifies clusters and anomalies through spatial autocorrelation.\nResults show that U.S. counties at the turn of the twentieth century generally exhibited low levels of family patriarchy, with most values falling within the “low” range defined by earlier research. Yet beneath this pattern, significant internal variation emerges. Certain regions display PI values consistent with the Northwestern European model of weak family structure, while others—especially the South and West—register markedly higher scores, approaching those of Southeastern and Eastern Europe. Racial disaggregation reveals divergent trajectories: white households in parts of the South show moderately elevated PI values, whereas Black households tend to display lower scores, underscoring distinct family-driven gender dynamics.\nBy 1910, the overall trajectory was one of depatriarchalization, with high-PI zones retreating and low values consolidating across most regions. These findings complicate the assumption that the Northwestern European model was simply transplanted into the United States. American regional profiles position themselves between the lower tails of Eastern European values and those of Ireland and Central Europe, while remaining distinct from the “core” North Atlantic populations. Rather than a straightforward transatlantic transfer, the U.S. family system appears as a composite formation: selectively receptive to Northwestern European norms in some regions, while retaining or intensifying patriarchal structures in others.\nThe study underscores both the utility and the limitations of the PI framework. While effective in capturing family-based patriarchal structures in the period under investigation, the index becomes relatively insensitive once very low levels are reached and may not adequately reflect twentieth-century transformations. Future research should supplement the PI at least with dimensions of male and female wage labor to provide a more nuanced account of long-term depatriarchalization.",

          "abstract": "Metropolitan areas in the United States are undergoing rapid diversification, significantly reshaping the demographics of local leadership. This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",
