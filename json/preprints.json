          "abstract": "The purpose of this brief is to provide an introduction to an increasingly popular way of communicating outputs of research: the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. This model came into practice in the early 2000s, and it is now beginning to grow more rapidly. Here, we explain the model for the benefit of researchers, research funders, research institutions, and others in the scholarly communication ecosystem, and we provide data on uptake of the model to date.",

          "authors": "Atsuki Ito; Yugo MAEDA; Matthias S Gobel; Yukiko Uchida; Masaki Yuki",
          "abstract": "Prestige leadership is characterized by the voluntary nature of a leader-member relationship: followers voluntarily cooperate with a leader who evokes followers’ respect. In this article, we examined whether increased relational mobility functions as a socio-ecological foundation for the emergence of prestige leadership, focusing on the business context. Study 1, sampling 199 American, 208 British, and 222 Japanese employees, showed that the perceived prestige of one’s superior in the workplace was more prevalent in the two Western countries than in Japan, and perceived job mobility in their work environment mediated this relationship. Study 2, which included 245 American and 222 Japanese employees, not only replicated the results of Study 1 but also demonstrated that companies’ meritocratic promotion system further mediated the association between job mobility and prestige leadership. We discuss how characteristics of the social-ecological environment affect the relationships between groups and individuals.",

          "title": "How visual is the “groupitizing”? The impact of visual deprivation over its emergence.",
          "authors": "Andrea Adriano; Lorenzo Ciccione; Minye Zhan",
          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that participants can enumerate a set of objects more quickly and precisely when clusters can be formed according to Gestalt factors. This effect is known as \"groupitizing\". Although predominantly observed in the visual domain, the role of visual experience in its development is still unknown. Has groupitizing emerged from neural mechanisms underlying grouping-cues processing in the early visual cortex? What is the impact of visual deprivation on its development? A fundamental model to investigate these questions is to study congenitally blind (CB) individuals. Lacking experience of visual grouping cues, CB individuals should not develop groupitizing strategies if vision is essential. Conversely, if vision is not mandatory, CB individuals should reveal groupitizing abilities in other sensory modalities. Importantly, visual deprivation could prompt compensatory cognitive abilities, such as better auditory working memory, which may influence the enumeration of auditory stimuli. We compared congenitally blind and sighted individuals in an auditory groupitizing task, where participants estimated the number of pure tones (5 to 12) presented rapidly, which were randomly interspaced (ungrouped condition) or grouped by temporal proximity (grouped condition). We found that grouped sequences yielded lower error-rates and higher precision compared to ungrouped ones in both blind and sighted participants. Overall, the blind group presented lower error-rates and slightly better numerical precision, with a greater grouping-benefit toward larger set sizes, compared to sighted participants. These findings suggest that groupitizing may emerge even without vision, potentially relying on perceptual amodal mechanisms, and that visual deprivation may boost groupitizing in the auditory modality.",

          "title": "When Posing in Portraits Turns Cheeky: A Systematic Literature Review of the Left-Cheek Bias - Poster",
          "authors": "Oda van Jole; René Westerhausen",
          "abstract": "Since it was first noticed in the 1970s, studies have continued to observe that various types of portraits are often produced with the left side of the face protruding more than the right side of the face. This pose orientation is often preferred by the viewer and the displayed cheek appears to influence the viewer’s perceptions of the portrayed individual. This phenomenon has become known as the left-cheek bias. Based on the notion that the right hemisphere both innervates the left hemiface and is considered dominant in emotion processing, a popular explanation for the left-cheek bias is that such a posing orientation better displays emotional qualities. Given societal stereotypes associating women with emotional expressiveness, it has been suggested that this bias is more prevalent in portraits of women. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the literature on the left-cheek bias, both in terms of its occurrence, its effect on the viewers, and potential gender effects. A systematic literature search was conducted in seven electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO Discovery Service, PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Embase. Two independent raters assessed the resulting 268 articles, ultimately including 65 articles comprising 98 studies. These studies were first categorised by whether they assessed pose orientation in a set of stimuli (DV-group; k = 64) or how pose orientation affected an outcome measure (IV-group; k = 34). The present poster primarily focuses on the DV-group, analysing the outcomes of studies across various DV-categories with respect to pose orientation. Furthermore, the poster includes a review of studies examining gender differences in posing bias, along with their conclusions.",

          "abstract": "This commentary critically evaluates the randomized controlled trial “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Hypnosis in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder” by Ramondo et al. (2024), highlighting significant methodological concerns that undermine the study’s conclusions. Key issues include the lack of allocation concealment, with the lead clinician involved in both patient assignment and treatment, raising the risk of performance bias. Additionally, the study’s approach to handling missing data assumes data, potentially compromising the validity of the intention-to-treat analysis. Finally, fidelity assessments were conducted retrospectively by a single research assistant, with no real-time monitoring, raising concerns about protocol adherence. These methodological shortcomings limit the reliability of the study’s findings and emphasize the need for greater rigor in future hypnotherapy research for Major Depressive Disorder.",

          "authors": "Juyoung Kim; Grazyna Kochanska",
          "abstract": "The importance of interactions between child temperament and parenting has been accepted ever since Thomas and Chess (1977) proposed their “goodness-of-fit” construct, but over the last three decades, pertinent research has grown exponentially. Researchers examining child characteristics that can moderate the effects of socialization have tested increasingly complex, nuanced, and sophisticated models, largely inspired by the highly influential frameworks of child plasticity or differential susceptibility (Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009). Yet, multiple questions remain unsettled. We addressed four such questions as applied to predicting children’s observed disregard for rules at age 4.5 in a study of 200 community families from the US Midwest. (1) We examined children’s observed negative emotionality at 16 months, most commonly seen as plasticity “trait”, but separating anger and fear proneness, which may differently moderate effects of socialization. (2) We examined two separate aspects of observed parental socialization at age 3, Mutually Responsive Orientation and power assertion. (3) We distinguished analytically diathesis-stress from differential susceptibility. (4) We examined all effects in mother- and father-child relationships. We supported both diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility, depending on the facet of negative emotionality, the aspect of socialization considered, and parental gender, highlighting the nuanced nature of the processes involved.",

          "authors": "Juyoung Kim; Grazyna Kochanska",
          "abstract": "As interest in early morality has grown, researchers have increasingly focused on young children’s moral self, but recent studies have targeted mostly its structure and associations with behavior rather than its developmental origins. Addressing this gap, we followed children, mothers, and fathers in US Midwest from late infancy (16 months old, N = 194, 93 girls, 101 boys), to toddlerhood (3 years old, N = 175, 86 girls, 89 boys), to preschool age (4.5 years old, N = 177, 86 girls, 91 boys). We proposed that moral self at preschool age originates in the second and third years, when the onset of parental control engenders in the child both receptive and adversarial stance toward the parent. In infancy and in toddlerhood, we collected behavioral indications of both stances – positive affect and responsiveness (in toddlerhood, also positive representation of the parent); and defiance and violations of parental prohibition. At preschool age, we measured child moral self in a puppet interview (Kochanska, 2002). For both mother- and father-child relationships, structural equation modeling supported direct paths from receptive and adversarial stance at age 3 years to higher and lower moral self, respectively, and the expected indirect effects of the child’s receptive stance in infancy on moral self, mediated by the receptive or adversarial stance in toddlerhood. The path from toddler-age adversarial stance to lower moral self was present only in father-son relationships. This study highlights the long-term pivotal significance of the child’s early stance toward the parent for the formation of moral self.",

          "abstract": "Background\nThere is a growing importance of loneliness measurement through valid and reliable instruments. However, to establish valid and reliable measures, there is a need to explore their psychometric properties in different research settings and language environments. For this reason, this study aimed to validate the Three Item Loneliness Scale (TILS) in the Czech Republic within a Slavonic language environment.\n\nMethods\nA sample of Czech adults (n = 3236) was used consisting primarily of university students. We utilized Classical Test Theory to assess TILS internal consistency, temporal stability, factor structure, and measurement invariance. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to estimate the discrimination and difficulty of the TILS items and to estimate the measurement precision of the whole scale. Convergent validity was explored through the Spearman correlation coefficient using personality traits, depression, and anxiety.\n\nResults\nThe results showed satisfactory reliability and validity of the TILS in the Czech Republic. The scale's internal consistency and temporal stability were found to be satisfactory (Cronbach’s α = 0.81, McDonald’s ω = 0.82, r = 0.71). The parallel analysis supported the unidimensionality of the TILS with a high factor loading of items (λ = 0.61 - λ = 0.85). Moreover, measurement invariance indicated that the TILS measures loneliness equivalently between genders. The IRT results indicated that the highest measurement precision was reached in individuals with lower and above-average levels of loneliness. Significant correlations between the TILS scores, anxiety, depression, and personality traits supported the convergent validity of the scale.",

          "authors": "Kiri Kuroda; Alan Novaes Tump; Ralf Kurvers",
          "abstract": "Speed–accuracy trade-offs are a fundamental aspect of decision-making, requiring individuals to balance collecting more information against making faster decisions. Although speed–accuracy trade-offs have been studied extensively at the individual level, their role in human group decision-making remains poorly understood—even though faster, and possibly more error-prone, decisions often influence group outcomes more than slower decisions. We examined how individual differences in speed–accuracy trade-off preferences shape decision-making in pairs, using an interactive online experiment and drift–diffusion modeling. Participants first performed a visual perception task alone, allowing us to estimate their individual drift rates and decision thresholds, the key cognitive determinants of speed–accuracy trade-off preferences. Participants then performed the task in pairs, sharing decisions in real time. Group accuracy depended on the faster (and thus more error-prone) member, and not on the slower (but more accurate) member. Social decisions were not worse than individual ones because faster members increased their thresholds in the social condition and became more accurate, while slower members incorporated less social information. These findings show that individuals adjusted their social information use to the speed–accuracy trade-off preferences of their group members, highlighting the importance of such individual differences for understanding collective behavior.",

          "abstract": "Causal selection is the process underlying our intuition that an outcome happened because of a given event, or that an event is the cause of an outcome. When a forest catches fire after a lightning strike, for example, people tend to say that the lightning bolt was the cause of the fire, not mentioning the presence of oxygen in the air, although they are well aware that the latter was no less indispensable for the fire to occur. We argue that the extant literature on causal selection has so far operated on the implicit premise that the only relevant variables for causal selection are individual variables, corresponding to distinct nodes in the relevant network of causes. Ours is the first systematic study of plural causes in the context of causal selection. First, we establish by means of two behavioral experiments the psychological reality and non- triviality of plural causes, ruling out potential deflationary explanations. Second, we show that state-of-the-art models of causal selection based on counterfactual dependence can be extended to make non-trivial predictions about plural causes consistent with our experimental findings. Third, we show that surprising logical properties of plurals in natural language interpretation can be found in causal reasoning with plural causes. We argue that the mental representations involved in causal-selection judgments show marks of the representations formal semanticists have proposed for plurals in natural language.",

          "authors": "Thomas Procter-Legg; Rebecca Jessica Somerville Snell; Robert M. Klassen",
          "abstract": "Teacher retention in England continues to be in a state of decline with early career teachers (ECTs) most at risk of leaving the profession. High attrition rates create an unstable and unsustainable workforce which negatively affects the educational development of young people. The purpose of this paper was to explore the career-related push and pull factors for ECTs in England. The paper also explores the way in which ECTs’ experiences shape career decision-making, and the extent to which their motivational needs are being met. Previous studies have considered workplace retention; however, little is known about the motivational needs and perspectives of ECTs. This paper explores the experiences of 20 ECTs in state-funded primary, secondary and special schools in England. All participants had less than five years teaching experience and were selected through purposive sampling. Participants took part in semi-structured online interviews with data analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were constructed from the data: Complexity, Belonging, Emotional Impact, Professional Identity and Relentlessness. Findings show that these themes are interrelated and combine to create a clear ‘tipping point’ where ECTs begin to find the job unmanageable. From a motivation perspective, we found that autonomous motivation reduces quitting intentions and that the need for relatedness and positive professional identities are particularly important for retaining teachers in the first five years of their careers.",

In Study 1, we found that seeing scientists as higher in intellectual humility was associated with greater perceived trustworthiness of scientists and support for science-based beliefs. We then demonstrated that describing a scientist as high (vs. low) in intellectual humility increased perceived trustworthiness of the scientist (Studies 2-4), belief in their research (Studies 2-4), intentions to follow their research-based recommendations (Study 3), and information-seeking behavior (Study 4). We further demonstrated that these effects were not moderated by the scientist’s gender (Study 3) or race/ethnicity (Study 4). In Study 5, we experimentally tested communication approaches scientists can use to convey intellectual humility. These studies reveal the benefits of seeing scientists as intellectually humble across medical, psychological, and climate science topics.",

          "authors": "Eva Krockow; Meghann; Carolyn Tarrant; Marc Mendelson; Stephen Flusberg",
          "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an existential threat to humanity, yet public awareness remains low. An underexplored tool for AMR risk communication is metaphor. By inviting a comparison between abstract and familiar concepts, metaphors can make complex health information more accessible. However, metaphor use in the context of AMR has been haphazard and remains poorly understood. We address this issue by providing an integrative content analysis of metaphor use in global, English-language, public AMR discourse. Four types of public sources were searched: (1) websites of 71 non-profit organisations, (2) national AMR action plans from 84 countries, (3) 819 international newspaper articles and (4) 2,616 social media posts. Across all sources, 2,149 metaphors excerpts were extracted. Qualitative content analysis identified 41 distinct metaphor themes, but 75% of metaphors fell into one of four themes: “War against resistance, infections and microbes”, “Heroes and villains of resistance”, “Post-antibiotic apocalypse and looming crisis of AMR”, and “Silent, creeping threat of AMR”. All key themes are inapt or theoretically problematic by painting a misleading picture of a finite struggle between good and evil, which does not match the ecological reality of a continuously evolving challenge. Furthermore, most existing metaphors are highly conventional and emotive. They aim to raise general awareness about AMR without conferring specific knowledge. Our findings call for an urgent re-framing. Media, policy makers and health officials should choose theoretically informed, apt and novel explanatory metaphors that are specific to the context of AMR and challenge public misunderstandings with the potential to prompt behaviour change.",

We model classes in a dataset of emotional responses to the pandemic using latent class trajectory analysis on a panel dataset of UK-based participants. Participants (n=868) rated eight emotions on a nine-point Likert scale in April of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, and provided demographic variables, data on perceived social support and the impact of life events. Using a latent class trajectory analysis, we found evidence for six distinct latent trajectory classes: 68.3% of individuals belonged to classes with a pattern of well-coping (decreasing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions) while the remainder showed patterns of poor adjustment. Social support and negative life events were predictive of class membership in a multinomial logistic regression: low social support and experiencing negative life events increased the probability of participants belonging to poorly adjusted classes. Our study suggests that most individuals – over the period of four years - were able to adjust well to the pandemic, while a about one third of individuals struggled considerably. Social support may be of interest as a protective factor and could aid policy makers during future crises.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol is widely used, but motives for consumption vary. Since drinking motives are proximal predictors of initiation and escalation of alcohol use, accurate measurement of these motives is crucial. This study compared the psychometric properties – factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability- of the 12-item, 18-item, and the original 20-item versions of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ). We also examined the associations between drinking motives and alcohol use outcomes using network analysis. A total of 434 adults (77.4% female) completed the baseline session and 130 (85.3% female) participated in a follow-up approximately two weeks later. Results showed that the subscales of the DMQ have good internal consistency ( .80) regardless of version. Test-retest reliability was acceptable to good (rs= .71-83) but was higher for social and enhancement than for conformity and coping motives. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 12-item short form outperforms the original 20-item version and the more recently proposed 18-item version. Partial correlation networks including DMQ subscales and alcohol outcomes revealed consistent positive association between social motives and binge drinking, alcohol use quantity per drink occasion and enhancement motives, while frequency of use was primarily associated with coping motives. However, while associations amongst drinking motives were identical in the 12- and 18-item version, these differed from the 20-item version. This study demonstrates how network models can be valuable tools in the validation and comparison of questionnaires and shows that the 12-item DMQ could be a good alternative for the often used longer forms.",

Empirical research to date shows no consensus on the causal effects of SMU on well-being. Therefore, the present study tested if experimentally induced restrictions in SMU led to improvements in well-being outcomes. After a 2-week baseline phase, participants (Mage = 21.42 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental (N = 35) or a passive control (N = 32) condition. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to limit their SMU to a maximum of 30 minutes (divided across their preferred apps) per day for 2 consecutive weeks, while participants in the control condition were instructed to continue their SMU as usual. After the intervention phase, participants in both conditions were followed up for 2 weeks during which all restrictions were removed. During the experiment, participants reported on their self-esteem, mindfulness, sleep, and emotional well-being. Results indicate a main effect of time for most outcomes, but induced SMU restriction did not moderate these effects. In conclusion, this study found no benefits from a temporary social media reduction on mental well-being.",

          "authors": "Alexis Deighton MacIntyre; Rakhi Akter",
          "abstract": "The speech-to-song illusion is a phenomenon in which the continuous repetition of a spoken\nutterance induces the listeners to perceive it as more song-like. Thus far, this perceptual\ntransformation has been observed in mostly European languages, such as English; however,\nit is unclear whether the illusion is experienced by speakers of Bangla (Bengali), an\nIndo-Aryan language. The current study, therefore, investigates the illusion in 28 Bangla-\nand 31 English-speaking participants. The experiment consisted of a listening task in\nwhich participants were asked to rate their perception of repeating short speech stimuli on\na scale from 1 − 5, where 1 = \"sounds like speech\" and 5 = \"sounds like song\". The stimuli\nwere composed of English and Bangla utterances produced by two bilingual speakers. To\naccount for possible group differences in music engagement, participants self-reported\nmusical experience and also performed a rhythm discrimination task as an objective\nmeasure of non-verbal auditory sequence processing. Stimulus ratings were analysed with\ncumulative link mixed modelling. Overall, English- and Bangla-speaking participants rated\nthe stimuli similarly and, in both groups, better performance in the rhythm discrimination\ntask significantly predicted more song-like ratings beyond self-reported musical experience.\nEnglish speakers rated Bangla stimuli as significantly more song-like than English stimuli.\nBangla speakers did not distinguish between English and Bangla stimuli–possibly reflecting\ntheir enhanced understanding of English, in comparison to the English participants’\ncomprehension of Bangla. An exploratory acoustic analysis revealed a role of harmonic\nratio in the illusion for both language groups. These results demonstrate that the\nspeech-to-song-illusion occurs for Bangla speakers to a similar extent as English speakers\nand that, across both groups, sensitivity to non-verbal auditory structure is positively\ncorrelated with susceptibility to this perceptual transformation.",

This has heightened scrutiny and stigma for LGBTQIA+ communities and scientists, particularly on social media platforms. Here, we investigate the nature of homotransphobic comments directed at LGBTQIA+ researchers and recruitment ads through topic modeling and sentiment analysis. We collected 994 comments from social media recruitment ads posted between January 2024 and May 2024. Our analysis identified three main themes: transitions and health, confrontational language, and ideological debates, with an overall negative sentiment across all topics. This study highlights the significant hostile environment faced by LGBTQIA+ researchers, underscoring the need for supportive measures and policies to foster a more inclusive and respectful discourse. These findings provide critical insights into the impact of online harassment on LGBTQIA+ research and offer recommendations for institutional support and public awareness to mitigate these negative sentiments.",

          "abstract": "We propose a comprehensive model of how experiences are encoded and retrieved from memory. At the core of the model is a dynamic retrieval process incorporating two essential mechanisms: iterative retrieval, whereby information is sequentially sampled from memory to access the full history of experiences; and competitive retrieval, whereby the most prominent features in memory inhibit the recollection of other features. Together with context-based encoding, the model quantitatively explains well-known facts about response order and inter-response times in recall experiments. We show that our retrieval process maps closely to existing decision frameworks, such as drift-diffusion models, suggesting that the memory system plays a fundamental role in a wide-ranging set of decision-making settings.",

          "abstract": "The rise of large language models and their impressive capabilities suggests their output is indistinguishable from human and that the Turing test has been passed definitively. Much existing work has focused on testing the capabilities of the models. However, it is unknown how people themselves conceive of artificial intelligence technology's putative knowledge or attitudes, and of how they differ from the mental states of humans. By exploring how people interrogate systems to decide whether they are natural or artificial, we show that people fail to spot large language model output most of the time, except for answers to factual questions. We found people systematically overestimate the use of personal questions in a Turing test. However, people are sensitive to brusque, cynical tone, slang and perceived idiosyncrasy as cues to natural human output. Despite claims the Turing test is becoming obsolete, we argue it endures as a probe of evolving lay intuitions about artificial intelligence and a way to track theory of mind expanding to encompass different sorts of mind. Our results shed light on what people think separates humans from machines and may guide later models to detect authorship of text online.",

          "abstract": "Counterfactual learning, which refers to learning from what could have happened under different circumstances, is crucial for understanding decision-making in humans. Recent studies have well characterized the computational and neural processes underlying this aspect of learning. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of attentional allocation towards the different alternatives faced by individuals, and their consequences. The present study explores the role of gaze and pupil dilation as potential indicators of counterfactual thinking during reinforcement learning tasks. By examining how these physiological measures correlate with the cognitive processes involved in evaluating both experienced and forgone outcomes, the research provides insights into the complex dynamics of human counterfactual learning. We recorded the gaze and pupil size of 36 participants engaged in a computer-based 2-arm bandit task with full information. The participants faced scenarios where they made choices and were then shown both the actual outcomes and hypothetical outcomes of unchosen options. While the overall pattern of allocation typically involved a first fixation on the factual outcome followed by a subsequent one on the counterfactual outcome, this pattern was affected differently by both outcomes’ value. On the other hand, pupil size reflected the outcome valence of the chosen option as well as the similarity between outcomes. These findings suggest that gaze dynamics and pupil dilation serve as effective biomarkers of counterfactual processing, reflecting the cognitive load and confirmation bias associated with such processes.",

In total, 104 German twelve-month-olds (57 female) observed an established imitation task (FIT 12, Goertz et al., 2006). The results revealed that infants anticipated action goals presented at a realistic speed. Furthermore, infants’ imitative behavior was related to their goal-predictive gaze shifts.

This study aims to address this gap by examining the vulnerabilities and health risks faced by this population. \n\nMaterials and methods: Individuals aged 18 and older filmed for pornography in Sweden were recruited to participate in face-to-face interviews. A total of 120 participants completed a combination of study-specific questions and standardized questionnaires on their background, experiences in pornography, and health status. Descriptive statistics were reported, and a regression analysis was performed to assess factors impacting PTSD severity. \n\nResults: Participants reported high levels of abuse both in childhood and during pornography production. Nearly all participants had experienced sexual abuse (88%), psychological abuse (90%), and physical abuse (79%) as children. This pattern of victimization continued into their involvement in pornography, where they were subjected to further abuse and exploitation, including verbal abuse (87%), rape (65%), physical assault (56%), third-party control (56%), and online harassment (57%). The consequences of this continuous polyvictimization were significant: 83% exhibited clinically significant PTSD, 69% had attempted suicide, and 80% had been diagnosed with at least one mental health problem. Our regression analysis found that childhood abuse, third-party control, and online violence were significant predictors of PTSD severity. \n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive legal, social, and mental health interventions to protect this highly vulnerable population and address the unique harms stemming from being documented in pornography.",

Our results validate the utility of ‘shopping entropy’ as an operationalisable proxy for the Big Five trait Openness, indicative of individuals’ propensity for embracing varied experiences.

Results showed that thinking disposition predicted attitudes toward vaccination, but did not systematically survive the inclusion of scales targeting conspiracy beliefs or belief in science.

These variations could be attributed to differences in the way people define themselves, known as “self-construal”. Previous cross-cultural studies on the role of self-construal in cognitive dissonance have mainly employed the free-choice paradigm. However, many concerns have been raised about the validity of this procedure and these studies, more generally. To address this issue, we will conduct secondary analyses to explore unexamined associations in a large existing dataset (Vaidis et al., 2024). Specifically, the current study will investigate the moderating role of individual (self-construal) and cultural (individualism) variables on dissonance effects following an induced-compliance paradigm across 18 countries (N = 3822). Based on the literature, we hypothesised that induced-compliance effects (i.e., adjusting attitude to match behaviour, particularly when it has been adopted freely) will be stronger for participants with higher individual self-construal scores (H1), in more individualistic countries (H2), and in countries with higher aggregated levels of independent self-construal (H3).

We analysed data (N=15,400) from undergraduate students over eight years across three campuses at an Australian tertiary institution. Using linear mixed models, we compared examination performance across different room scales, while accounting for coursework performance, and other variables. We found some evidence that student examination performance was worse in rooms with elevated ceiling heights, but additional modelling indicated a more complex relationship (where ceiling height might be linked to improved performance). These results provide tentative support for the notion that built environment scale influences cognitive performance, and suggest caution in conducting examinations in large scale, high-ceiling rooms.",

Additionally, suprathreshold sensitivities to temporal (TM), spectral (SM), and spectrotemporal (STM) modulation as well as binaural temporal fine structure (TFS) were estimated. Older adults showed worse speech in competition (SiC) performance with 6° and 45°, but not 0°, masker spatial locations and benefited less from only 45° of spatial separation compared to young controls for speech masking. For garbled-speech masking, older adults showed worse performance overall, but benefited similarly from spatial separation compared to young controls. Older adults also showed worse sensitivity for binaural TFS, but comparable TM, SM, and STM sensitivity. Age as well as TM and SM sensitivities predicted SiC performance, whereas STM and binaural TFS sensitivities did not.

Here we tested 19 adult observers in a blanking paradigm with naturalistic scene images: AI-generated “scene wheel” stimuli that varied in a continuous and quantifiable manner. Psychometric modeling revealed that inserting a brief blank screen during a saccade increased sensitivity to trans-saccadic scene changes and decreased the stability bias. These effects occurred only when observers made actual eye movements, but not when eye movements were simulated with retinal image shifts. These findings demonstrate that trans-saccadic memory of complex scenes and an overarching stability assumption work in tandem to achieve stable perceptual experience in natural environments.",

Participants (N=30) heard two sentences spoken concurrently (familiar-novel or novel-novel) and reported the content of one (target) while ignoring the other (masker). Simultaneously, participants either ignored (single task) or tracked the location of four moving dots on a screen (dual task). Across both tasks, word-report was most accurate when the target voice was familiar, lower when both voices were novel, and lowest when the masker was familiar. The presence of the concurrent multiple object tracking (MOT) task decreased intelligibility of the novel but not the familiar target, suggesting that long-term memory for a voice can free up cognitive capacity to aid speech perception.",

Here we provide a systematic review of the CHILDES database, the major source of naturalistic recordings of children’s linguistic environment. We analyzed the database according to four dimensions considered central to language learning: SES, urbanization, family structure, and language. We present descriptive statistics of each dimension to assess whether naturalistic recordings were biased regarding the demographics of the countries and the families recorded within them. We find that CHILDES’s recordings overrepresented wealthier countries and higher parental education levels; urban settings; and smaller households. Middle- and higher-class participants were likewise over-represented. The corpora were not representative of their countries in terms of urbanization either - with a larger percentage of families residing in urban settings than is overall true for their respective countries. In terms of family structure, nuclear families were more prevalent than in the countries where the data was collected. Last, we found that corpora were linguistically diverse, but we estimate that these recordings underrepresent bilingual and multilingual households. We conclude that researchers should be careful when generalizing from naturalistic recordings of children's input and output obtained from CHILDES.",

Thematic analysis was used to uncover key themes related to facilitators and barriers relevant to accessibility, knowledge, communication, disclosure / self-identification, policies / legislation, support strategies, and useful technologies. Highlights of our results indicate that accommodations that are typically available in college classrooms are not appropriate for most internship settings, that policies and procedure manuals related to accessibility supports / accommodations in internships are scarce, and that communication among faculty, students and accessibility advisors is poor and do not typically include on-site clinical supervisors. In addition, we found that students are often reluctant to self-identify as having a disability because of fear of stigma and professional concerns. A variety of technologies that can be useful in internship settings was identified, but participants noted that internship settings were often reluctant to use these because of concerns with patient confidentiality and biohazard safety. We recommend that colleges develop Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility (EDIA) policies that reflect internships and that communication structures be developed that allow all stakeholders to participate.",

Random forest models were used to identify potentially important predictors, such as variables relevant to profanity generally (e.g., age, gender, and personality) and variables specific to humor creation (e.g., humor self-concepts and self-ratings of their jokes’ funniness). Profanity in the jokes was reasonably common, used by 22% of the sample, diverse in type, and generally mild in severity. The random forest models identified a set of uniquely important predictors. Profanity use and severity were marked by being younger, identifying as male, rating one’s own jokes as funny, and expressing more confidence in one’s ability to be funny and make others laugh—a true profile in boorishness. The discussion explores roles for personality in indecorous humor and the broader question of strategic aspects of humor creation.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive offloading refers to the use of physical action and the external\nenvironment to reduce cognitive demand. Offloading strategies such as creating\nexternal reminders instead of relying on internal memory are highly effective and\nplay a key role in supporting real-world cognition. Previous work has shown that\npeople have systematic biases in their offloading strategies, which are related to\nbiased metacognitive evaluations of cognitive ability. These metacognitive biases\ncould potentially be mitigated by metacognitive interventions. However research\ninvestigating the effect of metacognitive interventions has produced mixed results.\nHere, we investigated the influence of a brief intervention comprising just five trials\nof metacognitive feedback during an initial practice session. After this intervention\nparticipants performed a memory task where they decided between using internal\nmemory (for maximum reward) or external reminders (for reduced reward),\nallowing us to determine the optimality of offloading strategies. The key difference\nfrom earlier work was that task performance determined financial reward, to\nincentivise optimal offloading. As predicted, metacognitive training reduced\nmetacognitive bias and also led to more optimal offloading strategies. Therefore,\nmetacognitive feedback is an effective intervention to improve the optimality of\ncognitive offloading, which could improve the adaptive use of cognitive tools.",

          "abstract": "Mental health research often seeks to witness, understand and empower marginalised communities through methods such as qualitative research. Qualitative research favours rich and meaningful data segments representing peoples’ lived experiences. The neurodiversity movement has identified and challenged the ableism that can arise when applying research methods with normative assumptions about human minds and language production. However, schizophrenia and psychosis qualitative research has so far been under-considered in efforts to reduce these forms of ableism in research. This paper highlights how mental health researchers can resist and reject the ableism that comes from adopting ‘rich data’ as representative of the lived experiences of those with schizophrenia. Qualitative research may occlude the real experiences of individuals with schizophrenia if they are not heard or represented in the multitude of ways they communicate or articulate themselves, the language they use and the stories they tell. This article provides solutions to meaningfully represent those with schizophrenia and their voices in all stages of the research process so that the available research in the field accurately reflects the needs and experiences of those with schizophrenia.",

          "abstract": "HIV is a highly stigmatized condition, and negative beliefs about HIV and people with HIV are frequently internalized. This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "abstract": "In this review, challenges related to the measurement of word durations in language production are identified, highlighting gaps in current theoretical frameworks and the resulting difficulty in interpreting available evidence. To compensate for limited theoretical predictions regarding response durations in spoken language, we turn to other fields, such as written production and motor control, to provide informative analogies. In written production, reliable effects on durations have been observed but the field similarly suffers from the absence of clear predictions from the available models, limiting interpretations. Since word durations are the result of motor programming and execution, evidence from motor control is particularly relevant. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that planning and execution stages overlap in time, with response planning continuing even after the initiation of the motor response, making variations in durations arise from either planning or execution processes. In addition, they propose a gating mechanism to launch response initiation. Similar dynamics could be easily assumed in language production, which could help bridge the gap from response selection to response execution and extend current models of language production to account for motor execution and predict word durations. We end by outlining pending questions for the field of language production, and some recommendations to tackle them in the future.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulation was utilized here to investigate the distinct involvement of two recognized cortical hubs for semantic integration (the left anterior temporal lobe, lATL) and inhibitory control (the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, rDLPFC) in creative problem-solving. Participants were presented with a list of category-exemplar words, selectively recalled some of them, and then solved a set of RAT problems. Selective retrieval was introduced to trigger inhibitory control over competitors. Critically, some RAT problems could be solved with words from the previous phases of the experiment, including words that might be less accessible due to inhibition. Other problems, however, could only be solved with unpresented words. Experiment 1 showed that anodal tDCS over the lATL had a negative effect on the production of correct responses to baseline RAT problems, but not on those that required inhibited solutions. Experiment 2 produced the reverse pattern with cathodal tDCS over the rDLPFC. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained before and after delivering tDCS, which also revealed specific tDCS-induced changes in frequency bands depending on the site of stimulation. Overall, these findings provide support for the involvement of semantic and control processes in creative problem solving that are linked to different brain networks.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Based on Fowler’s wide definition of faith as finding meaning in life, and progressing with his perspective on faith as a typology of hierarchically ordered styles that can optimally be assessed with the faith development interview (FDI), this study breaks new ground by investigating predictors and outcomes of faith development. \nMethods: This investigation is possible, because in two decades of mixed-method research with the FDI in the USA and Germany, we accumulated over 1500 FDIs including n = 324 longitudinal cases with at least one re-interview. Based on this longitudinal sample, this article presents results from quantitative analysis of faith development associated with a wide range of variables. \nResults: Results confirm assumptions that faith development predicts the rejection of the representation of God as authoritarian and predicts the rejection of xenophobia and other prejudice. Faith development also results in higher need for cognition, tolerance of ambiguity, and openness to revising one’s viewpoint. Predictors for faith development are high openness to experience, low frequency of payer and of experience of divine intervention. Predictors are also low agreement to the truth of texts and religious teachings (Religious Schema Scale, RSS), high agreement to the fairness, tolerance and rational choice schema (RSS) and to the xenosophic-dialogical schema (RSS) that features openness to the alien and strange. \nDiscussion: After two decades of faith development research, we thus can present predictive validity for the RSS and, based on this evidence, conclude that the RSS can be used to predict faith development.",

Our study addresses the two main limitations of existing research by (a) using a precise, LLM-based surprisal measure and (b) including the largest sample size to date by a factor of four. Although the expected syntactic priming effect was reliably observed, the present data provided strong Bayesian evidence against a prime-surprisal effect (which was also not significant in any frequentist analysis). These results confirm that the previous inconsistent results are not due to low sample sizes or inaccurate surprisal measurements. Crucially, the unreliable nature of the prime surprisal effect casts doubt upon the suitability of using this method for investigating error-based learning in future work.",

Yet hidden at the core of such everyday routines are specific functional relationships between objects, such as a carafe and a mug, a knife and a loaf, or a key and a lock. G&amp;H’s article was a turning point in a long but sparse tradition of research that had considered such relations from a vision-science perspective (e.g., Scholl &amp; Tremoulet, 2000), as it steered many researchers — ourselves included — to explore questions in the burgeoning field now known as “relation perception.” This field advances the idea that, beyond objects, features, and locations, the visual system extracts and represents relations — properties that specify interactions or connections between objects, rather than each object’s characteristics.

          "authors": "Xiaohui Rao; Hanlin Wu; Zhenguang Garry Cai",
          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly proficient at engaging in human-like conversations, it is essential to understand how people process language generated by LLMs compared to language produced by humans. During language comprehension, people interpret incoming linguistic input by integrating it with their world knowledge (e.g., semantic anomalies can elicit an N400 effect in brain potentials) and linguistic knowledge (e.g., syntactic anomalies can lead to a P600 effect). Crucially, people adjust their language comprehension based on the perceived demographic attributes of the speaker, which has been shown to modulate both semantics-sensitive N400 and syntax-sensitive P600 effects. In two ERP experiments, we investigated whether people are sensitive to the fact that LLMs excel in linguistic formulation (i.e., consistently producing grammatically correct texts) but are prone to hallucination (i.e., occasionally generating nonsensical content). Participants were informed that they would be reading texts previously generated by either an LLM or a human. Experiment 1 revealed an N400 effect for semantically anomalous sentences compared to semantically coherent ones. Importantly, the N400 effect was smaller for LLM-generated texts than for human-generated texts. Furthermore, participants who more strongly believed that LLMs possess human-like knowledge exhibited a larger N400 effect. Experiment 2 demonstrated a P600 effect for syntactic anomalies in LLM-generated texts, with the effect being larger for LLM-generated texts than for human-generated texts (and not statistically significant in the latter). These findings suggest that people’s expectations about LLMs’ potential for hallucination and near-perfect grammatical competence modulate the way they comprehend LLM-generated texts. This research highlights the importance of considering perceived language model attributes when studying human language comprehension in the context of AI-generated texts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Access to mental health care is limited by financial, time, and resource restraints. Massive open online interventions (MOOIs), a form of online self-directed mental health interventions, work to address these barriers by providing evidence-based interventions to many individuals at little to no cost. The present meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of MOOIs to inform the development of future MOOIs for mental health. \n\nMethods: Following the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review of research investigating fully online and self-directed mental health interventions was conducted within the PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Academic Search Complete databases. Random effect models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes using mean differences for mental health outcomes to determine the efficacy of MOOIs. Person-level (age, gender, continental location) and program-level (control type, inclusion criteria, therapeutic orientation, treatment components, treatment format, time to follow-up, treatment duration) moderators were examined with mixed-effect or meta-regression models.  \n\nResults: The meta-analysis included 31 articles with 10397 participants. MOOIs (n = 5235) were more effective at reducing mental health symptoms versus controls (n = 5162). Small intervention effect sizes were observed for anxiety, depression, sleep, and stress at post-treatment. At follow-up, all mental health outcomes were null. Subgroup analyses indicated studies had a larger effect size at post-treatment if they had an inactive control (vs. active), were conducted in Europe (vs. other continental locations), and delivered the intervention through web-based formats (vs. mobile applications). No other moderators were significant. \n\nConclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates the positive potential impact of MOOIs in reducing mental health symptomology across various populations. However, due to the limited findings, it cannot be concluded which intervention components led to the most favourable outcomes and for whom may benefit most from MOOIs. Further research should investigate which aspects of MOOIs lead to meaningful results to help design and implement more effective self-directed online interventions.",

Essentialist beliefs emerged across early childhood in both communities, but their instantiation and trajectories varied across cultures. In the sample from the United States (but not from China), essentialist beliefs that categories and their features are fixed-at-birth and inflexible increased across age. On the other hand, in the sample from China, children held stronger beliefs that categories are objective and explanatory, and viewed them as more homogenous with age. Children sampled from these two contexts also showed variation in basic explanatory, linguistic, and inferential processes, suggesting that cultural variation in the development of essentialism across childhood might reflect variation in the basic conceptual biases that children rely on to build intuitive theories of the world.",

One hundred and fifty children participated in two tasks: a Lexical Decision Task (LDT) and a Grammatical Decision Task (GDT). The LDT was used to test single word processing abilities whereas the GDT was used to test multiple word processing abilities. Signal detection theory analysis revealed that all children performed well in the LDT, whereas a different pattern emerged in the GDT, where only Grade 4 and Grade 6 children performed above chance in this task. Then, a cluster analysis was used to investigate the relation between LDT and GDT sensitivity. The analysis revealed two clusters that differed in reading fluency and sensitivity in both tasks. Children from Cluster 2, who exhibited the highest sensitivity in the LDT, were the only ones to perform on average above the chance level in the GDT. Moreover, a strong correlation (r = .64) between LDT and GDT performance was found in this group. Finally, we found that a sensitivity of 1.95 in the LDT almost perfectly predicted cluster membership. We estimated that such sensitivity is achieved at Grade 3, suggesting that the ability to process multiple word sequences first requires sufficient efficiency in processing words in isolation. Once this turning point is reached, single word processing skills support the development of multiple word processing, which could take several years to mature fully.",

The current study attempted to gauge public perceptions of exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder using a series of surveys and vignettes in an online sample (n =495). Half of the sample was unfamiliar with exposure and response prevention. Respondents rated exposure effectiveness below many alternate interventions, some of which have been shown to exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In general, participants viewed the examples of exposure therapy as traumatizing, dangerous, unethical, and ineffective at treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. These views were consistent for exposures related to contamination, responsibility for harm, and unacceptable thoughts, but not for “not just right” experiences. These results highlight the importance of efforts to inform the public of evidence- based treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPurpose. In March 2020, a unique situation unfolded wherein the UK government announced social restriction measures to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Various remained in place until April 2021, with older adults, who were considered clinically vulnerable, being placed under stricter restrictions. This study aimed to determine the impact of psychosocial factors, including loneliness, depression, and engagement in various recreational lifestyle activities, on hearing and cognitive function in younger and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMethods. 112 older adults (62 female) aged 60-82 (M = 70.08, SD = 5.89), and 121 younger adults (85 female) aged 18-29 (M = 20.52, SD = 2.63) participated online between June 2020 - February 2022. Participants completed questionnaires assessing loneliness, depression, auditory and lifestyle engagement, and hearing ability, as well as behavioural tasks assessing auditory function and global cognition. All measures were completed 12 times at 4-week intervals. \nResults. Linear mixed effects analyses found that, of the variables examined, increased loneliness was a significantly associated with poorer auditory function. There were no main effects of time during the pandemic on auditory or cognitive outcomes. However, the interaction between time and age group significantly impacted global cognition; in younger adults, global cognition decreased overtime, whereas older adults displayed an unexpected positive change. \nConclusions. These data show that there are associations between loneliness and auditory function but provide a lack of support for the impact of time experiencing auditory deprivation, or other psychosocial factors, on hearing and cognitive function. Such observations may be underpinned by motivational differences, learning effects, or sample biases. Future research may wish to investigate these factors further, to determine how psychological factors like loneliness impact hearing and wider brain function across diverse participant groups.",

For consumers, however, the trade-off between this environmental impact and the convenience of “fast fashion” is hidden at the point of purchase. We present a pre-registered, experimental test of two clothing eco-labelling systems using a large, representative sample of consumers (N = 1,200). Participants used a simulated online clothing store, with some chosen at random to receive their selected items. They were randomised to see (i) a binary label, informed by existing policy, applied to the most sustainable products, (ii) a colour-coded, graded “eco-score” applied to all products, or (iii) no label. Compared to the control condition, participants exposed to binary label chose 10% more sustainable products. Eco-score participants, however, chose 20% more, and were twice as likely to exclusively buy the most sustainable products. There was no effect on the number of items purchased, implying a shift towards more sustainably produced clothing. Exploratory analyses revealed that the effects were driven by greater salience of the eco-score system and that effects were stronger among those most concerned about the environment. Those who saw the eco-labels reported the same level of shopping satisfaction and willingness to wear selected clothes as those in the control condition. Additional findings revealed a general underestimation of clothing production's environmental impact and strong support for implementing the eco-score both online and in-store. The results have implications for enabling informed consumer choice in the clothing market.",

          "authors": "Kiia Jasmin Alexandra Huttunen; Stephan Lewandowsky",
          "abstract": "People's subjective conceptions of truth and honesty have undergone significant changes in recent decades. Parts of society increasingly favour the sincere expression of personal belief,\nhowever inaccurate, over verifiable facts. This trend has been accompanied by increasing norm violations by political elites which have been identified as a significant contributor to democratic backsliding. Those two trends highlight the need for a thorough examination of the nexus between norm violations and conceptions of honesty. We present a series of preregistered studies that examined the conditions under which people acquiesce to democratic norm violations and politicians’ dishonesty. We find that when participants are asked to take a perspective of honesty that emphasises sincerity over accuracy, which we call ``belief-speaking'', they are more willing to accept norm violations by politicians than if participants take a perspective that emphasizes accuracy as a criterion for honesty, which we call ``fact-speaking''. When a fictitious politician is presented as telling untruths, tolerance of norm violations is reduced compared to when the politician is presented as truthful. The findings highlight the need to develop a better understanding of how individuals interpret and respond to political leaders’ behaviours, especially within the evolving landscape of  perception and the ensuing threats to democratic stability.",

          "abstract": "Guilt is recognized as a social and moral emotion that drives prosocial behavior, typically through actions to repair relationships with victims, often at a personal cost. Prior research has yielded mixed results regarding compensatory behavior: In some instances, guilt prompted individuals to redirect resources away from unrelated others (observed in the Netherlands) or from themselves (observed in Romania and Japan) to compensate the victim. This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

Researchers are increasingly incorporating qualitative analysis into their studies in recognition of the rich, contextual information this provides. This scoping review aims to identify the existing qualitative research on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of mental health disorders, analyse trends in research questions and methods, and recognise opportunities for future qualitative research.  \n\nMethods and Analysis\nThe methodological guidelines set out in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis (Aromataris et al., 2024) will be used to conduct the review. The review will include qualitative studies involving psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, administered in a controlled research setting, for the treatment of any mental health disorder. Microdosing studies will be excluded. PubMed, Scopus, PsycNET, and reference lists of included studies will be searched. Two reviewers will screen papers for inclusion. Data will be extracted into a table and findings will be presented in a narrative form. Relevant qualitative research will be identified, trends in the qualitative research questions and methods will be analysed, and opportunities for future qualitative research will be discussed.\n\nEthics and Dissemination\nEthics approval is not required.

          "abstract": "Community engagement is a vital but often overlooked aspect of developmental science. Integrating it into research practices can drive meaningful progress within the field, offering both societal benefits and enriching academic experiences. This call-to-action advocates for the integration of community-driven events, such as Science Adventures – a data collection and outreach event held at Newcastle University, UK - to bridge the gap between researchers and the public. Science Adventures (SA), one of a handful of such programmes in the UK, serves as an exemplary model, bringing primary school aged children and their families in the UK to university campuses during school holidays to participate in interactive, science-focused educational activities, whilst simultaneously contributing to live research studies. Here we provide a review of the current obstacles of carrying out developmental science and how initiative like SA can help mitigate the issues faced. This includes the practicalities of organising such events to building long-term reciprocal relationships with the community. By investing in community engagement, developmental science can benefit from richer, more diverse data. For the general public, it can improve the public perception of science and create invaluable learning experiences",

          "abstract": "Trust in mainstream institutions is declining while people are increasingly turning to alternative media and conspiracy theories. Previous research has suggested that these trends may be linked, but the dynamics of trust across multiple sources has received little investigation. Is trust a neutral process, where each source is judged independently, is it a zero-sum competition, where a loss for one side is a gain for the other, or does losing trust in one source in foster a more generalized sense of distrust? Across three experimental studies (N = 2,951) we examined how people react when a source makes a serious error, testing several potential models of trust dynamics. We found that regardless of whether the outlet is mainstream, counter-mainstream, or neutral, trust drops for the erring source but does not rise for its competitors. This was the case in the context of both food regulations and COVID-19 precautions. Such a pattern suggest that each source may be judged independently of others. However, in several cases, an error made by one source led to a loss of trust in all sources, suggesting that rather than choosing sides between competing sources, people are also judging the media landscape as a whole to discern if it is feasible to find trustworthy information. However, correlational data did also find that the more people saw a source as politicized, the less they trusted that source and the more they trusted its competitors.",

However, despite the wide dissemination of this practice for cancer survivors (CSs), current research on it is lacking. This study aimed to identify tattoo artists’ (TAs’) perspectives on the types, impacts, barriers, and facilitators of therapeutic tattooing for CSs and the impact of doing this work on themselves.\n\nMethods: Twenty-two international TAs who tattoo CSs were interviewed and resultant transcripts were analysed thematically. \nResults: The following themes emerged: Emotional Management of Artists, Emotional Transformation of CSs, Stigma and its effects on CSs, Artist Barriers, CS Barriers, Artist Facilitators, and CS Facilitators. The findings also identify a typology of cancer survivorship therapeutic tattoos.\n\nConclusion: This is the first study to identify barriers/facilitators of therapeutic tattooing, a typology of cancer survivorship therapeutic tattoos, TAs’ perspectives on therapeutic tattooing, and potential negative outcomes from this practice. The findings indicate that therapeutic tattooing can be both beneficial and harmful for CSs and TAs, that there is a need for better therapeutic tattooing training for TAs and healthcare providers (HPs), increased awareness of therapeutic tattoos, a reduction in barriers to the practice and greater collaboration between HPs and TAs. \n\nImplications for Cancer Survivors: Findings from this study have major policy implications for healthcare systems, non-profit organizations, and regulatory bodies, which could serve to empower cancer survivors to make more informed decisions about their bodies and support enhanced training and accreditation of this practice.",

Although research has investigated the consequences of this phenomenon, little is known about individual factors that predict street harassment tolerance in men. The current study investigates the role of cognitive empathy toward victims and social dominance orientation (SDO) on tolerance of street harassment in two European cultures. After being assessed for SDO and street harassment tolerance, 136 Italian and 113 British heterosexual men viewed a video of a woman repeatedly subjected to street harassment. Participants reported beliefs about the emotions experienced by the victim and were again assessed for street harassment. Results revealed that street harassment tolerance both before and after the video was independently associated with lower cognitive empathy and higher SDO. These effects replicated across the two cultures. These findings suggest two possible attitudinal and cognitive targets for reducing street harassment tolerance across societies.",

          "abstract": "It is well known that perception and cognition are systematically biased towards the recent past. That is, a decision about the current state of a perceptual feature (e.g., orientation) can be predicted based on a recent state of the same feature. Such serial dependencies have been demonstrated across perception, memory, and cognition, and have been jointly attributed to an adaptive mechanism meant to promote stability in a constantly changing environment. Here, we argue that this adaptive mechanism prioritizes past information on the most basic structural level, such that the strength of the attractive bias is modulated by the amount of structural coherence in stimuli. We presented visual patterns of varied structural disorder (randomness) prior to a recognition memory decision that required discriminating between trained and novel visual patterns. Both highly generic geometrical shapes and completely random patterns failed to elicit an effect on decisional response times. By contrast, we found recognition memory decisions to be significantly faster in trials where the irrelevant probe pattern was “optimally” random. This result suggests that decision-making is influenced by the past’s informational worth. More importantly, it suggests an optimal amount of uncertainty to facilitate future decisions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Between 50–70% of autistic individuals report clinically significant decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sound in one’s environment) at some point in their lives. DST in autism comprises multiple distinct disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust), although few studies to date have distinguished these conditions from one another or studied their correlates independently. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Univariate and multivariate Bayesian models were then used to examine the demographic and clinical correlates of each DST diagnosis (both alone and independently of the other condition) in the autistic adult population. \n\nResults: Hyperacusis and misophonia were strongly correlated. Accordingly, all significant correlates in univariate analyses were found to associate with both conditions. In multivariate analyses (including control for depression and generalized anxiety, which strongly related to DST symptoms), both disorders were independently associated with female sex; increased autistic traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and phonophobia symptoms; and increased likelihood of seeking medical care for DST. Most other significant correlates (primarily hearing-related or neurological symptoms/disorders) were found to be associated only with hyperacusis rather than misophonia, although misophonia was uniquely associated with anger symptoms and identification as a gender minority. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia explain substantial variance in clinical outcomes of interest in the autistic population and demonstrate utility as additional diagnoses for autistic adults who experience debilitating DST symptoms within clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether perceived racial and ethnic discrimination mediates the relationship between race and impulsivity, as measured by delay discounting, among adolescents aged 10–11 years.\nMethods: Utilizing data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study release 5.1, we analyzed a sample of 3,857 participants who completed the delay discounting task and perceived discrimination measures at the year-one follow-up. Delay discounting was assessed through a hypothetical monetary choice task, with the area under the curve (AUC) serving as the primary measure of impulsivity—lower AUC scores indicate higher impulsivity. Perceived discrimination was measured using an adapted Perceived Discrimination Scale. Linear mixed-effects regression models examined the direct effects of race, socioeconomic factors, age, and gender on impulsivity, as well as the mediating effect of perceived discrimination.\nResults: Black adolescents exhibited significantly lower AUC scores compared to White adolescents (p &lt; 0.05), indicating higher impulsivity. When perceived discrimination was included in the model, the effect of being Black on impulsivity was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. Perceived discrimination was associated with lower AUC scores (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting greater impulsivity. Males demonstrated higher impulsivity than females (p &lt; 0.001), consistent across models.\nConclusion: Perceived racial and ethnic discrimination significantly mediates the relationship between being Black and higher impulsivity in early adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of addressing discrimination to reduce racial disparities in impulsivity and associated risk behaviors. Interventions focusing on both systemic factors contributing to discrimination and enhancing individual coping strategies are crucial for promoting equitable developmental outcomes among minority adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Background: Decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sounds in one’s environment) is one of the most common sensory features of autism, with a lifetime prevalence between 50–70%. Multiple disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust) likely contribute to the burden of DST in the autistic population, but there has been little exploration of this symptom cluster in autism in a way that distinguishes these conditions from each other or that examines how these disorders potentially differ in autistic and non-autistic individuals. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Descriptive statistics were derived to report on the prevalence of each DST category, as well as clinical features of individuals in both categories.  \n\nResults: Across the sample, 40.2% met case criteria for hyperacusis (sex-weighted prevalence: 33.5%), whereas 35.5% met case criteria for misophonia (sex-weighted prevalence: 29.1%), and comorbid hyperacusis and misophonia was found in 27.0% (sex-weighted prevalence: 21.9%). Both hyperacusis and misophonia were associated with tinnitus and tinnitus disorder, although neither condition was associated with (diagnosed) hearing loss. Sound-evoked pain was a commonly reported symptom of hyperacusis, with 64.7% of autistic adults experiencing pain at least once per month and 24.7% of autistic individuals with hyperacusis meeting criteria for “pain hyperacusis.” Onset of hyperacusis was much earlier than previously reported in non-autistic samples, although most other features of both hyperacusis and misophonia did not differ from what is known from general population studies. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia (and their comorbidity) are highly prevalent in the autistic population and should be studied in tandem (rather than as a unified construct) in future investigations of autism-associated DST.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of the stream of spontaneous thoughts has been the object of increasing research in\nthe last few years. In the present study, we set to study the transitions from one coherent thought\nepisode to the next. Participants (N=61) were asked to either perform spontaneous word\nproduction or to let their mind wander during runs of 3 minutes. They were instructed to report\nthought transitions with a key press (online segmentation). First, we validate the use of this online\nsegmentation as a report of thought transitions, enabling us to measure the duration of coherent\nthought episodes. Then, we show that among a reasonable set of candidate mechanisms, the\ntiming of thought transitions is best explained by an accumulation-to-threshold model. We further\nfind that the threshold of this accumulation – but not the drift rate – negatively correlates with\nparticipants’ trait tendency for mind-wandering. Our results shed new light on the processes\nunderpinning the individual variability of mind-wandering.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated whether toddlers accommodate their gestures to partners of different ages. Video data from 53 toddlers (410-1080days, 27boys) were collected during free play time in 3 Portuguese nursery schools. Toddlers adjusted their vocabulary complexity and the temporal patterns of their gestures to the recipient’s age, but did not change their prominence. Toddlers communicated with younger peers at a slower pace and using a simpler vocabulary, following child-directed communication patterns. However, when comparing adult-directed with peer-directed communication, toddlers used a more diverse set of gestures and shorter gestures. This study suggests that our ability to accommodate our communication emerges before language is fully developed, and that accommodation is flexibly expressed as a result of intersecting features of social partners.",

          "authors": "Matthias Guggenmos; Philipp Sterzer; Isa Steinecker",
          "abstract": "An intriguing finding in human decision making is that the act of choice itself affects preferences − chosen options often increase and unchosen options decrease in subjective value. The observation of such choice-induced revaluation inspired the theory of cognitive dissonance, which posits that human behavior generally strives for internal consistency. Yet, which aspects of choices are responsible for choice-induced revaluation has remained unclear. Here we argue that previous research has overlooked an important explanatory variable: choice confidence. While the original cognitive dissonance theory posits stronger revaluation for low-confidence decisions, a recently proposed theory that parallels confidence and reward predicts stronger revaluation for high-confidence decisions. To arbitrate between these hypotheses, and a confidence-independent mere-choice hypothesis, we employ an instrumental conditioning paradigm and quantitatively compare computational models of choice revaluation that operationalize the hypothesized confidence effects. Our results will clarify the mechanism of how choices and preferences interact in human decision making.",

          "abstract": "Confidence leak (i.e., confidence serial dependence) is a phenomenon where confidence from a previous trial predicts confidence in a current trial independent of current choice or accuracy. Confidence leak has been shown to robustly occur across various cognitive domains and tasks. However, it remains unclear what factors, if any, modulate the strength of the confidence serial dependence. Here we investigate whether switching the motor response in a perceptual decision-making task influences the strength of the confidence leak effect. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch using their left or right hand, with the response hand being randomly cued on each trial. We found that switching the response substantially weakened the confidence leak effect. We further replicated this finding in a second experiment in which left-hand responses were given using a keyboard and right-hand responses were given with a mouse. In both experiments, we also found that confidence leak was weaker whenever the left hand was used in the previous trial, suggesting that lack of motor fluency reduces the strength of confidence serial dependence. These results demonstrate that switching the motor response weakens serial dependencies and imply that the action required to make a choice can impact one’s metacognitive evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Despite widespread claims that music training enhances nonmusical abilities, causal evidence remains inconclusive. Moreover, much research has focused on potential benefits for perception and cognition, but socioemotional skills are often overlooked. Here, we used longitudinal and correlational approaches to ask whether music training improves emotion recognition in voices and faces among school-aged children. We also assessed musical abilities, fine- and gross-motor skills, broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory short-term and working memory. Study 1 (N = 110) was a two-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school environment with three groups: music training, basketball training (active control), and no training (passive control). Compared to both control groups, music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory short-term and working memory, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Study 2 (N = 192) compared musically untrained children with those attending a music school. Music training correlated with improved emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), but this association disappeared after accounting for musical abilities, short-term memory, or socioeconomic status. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with improved emotion recognition in prosody and faces independently of music training and other confounding variables. These findings suggest that while music training may enhance fine-motor skills and auditory memory, observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities.",

This study highlights the importance of researching positive mental health and resilience in doctors starting their careers, going beyond the mere absence of mental disorders. It emphasizes the need to understand resilience as an essential component in this context, especially in the face of challenges such as \"Burnout\" syndrome.\n Methodology: The \"Positive Mental Health (PMH) Scale\" and the \"Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale\" were administered to doctors beginning their career paths. A descriptive and correlational analysis was conducted between the results of both scales. Results: A total of 93 young medical professionals participated, with most women. The results reveal a positive correlation between positive mental health and resilience. Although, in general, an increase in positive mental health was associated with greater resilience, atypical cases showed inverse correlations, thus underscoring the complexity of this relationship.\n Discussion: The evident correlation between positive mental health and resilience highlights the importance of adaptability in challenging work environments. The low scores in criteria assessing physical and emotional aspects suggest potential deficiencies in the comprehensive understanding of what positive mental health entails in the studied population. There is a highlighted need to strengthen strategies to manage work-related stress, especially in improving equanimity. \nConclusions: There is a correlation between positive mental health and resilience in this group of professionals. Understanding this relationship enriches knowledge and suggests practical strategies to improve the quality of life of healthcare professionals, specifically doctors, prioritizing a balance between work and personal life.",

          "abstract": "A recent meta-analysis published in this journal included 27 studies that experimentally manipulated social media use and investigated their impact on mental health outcomes (Ferguson, 2024). The author concluded that social media effects were statistically no different from zero. However, this meta-analysis did not investigate potential moderating effects of length of social media reduction or abstinence interventions. We conducted a re-analysis to investigate the impact of social media reduction / abstinence intervention length on mental health outcomes. We used the information available on the OSF platform related to the original meta-analysis and excluded 7 studies because they were not reduction / abstinence interventions. We categorized studies into those with intervention lengths of less than 1 week vs. 1 week or longer, and tested for curvilinear relationships between intervention length (weeks and days as continuous variables) and outcomes by including quadratic terms. Stratified analyses indicated that interventions of less than 1 week resulted in significantly worse mental health outcomes (d=-0.168, SE=0.058, p=.004), while interventions of 1 week or longer resulted in significant improvements (d=0.169, SE=0.065, p=.01). Analyses of intervention length as continuous moderator included k=19 studies and showed significant quadratic effects for number of weeks (b=-0.022; SE=0.008; z=-2.6; p&lt;.01), as well as number of days (b=-0.001; SE=0.000; z=-2.5; p&lt;.05). These findings suggest that social media use reduction / abstinence interventions should have a minimum length of 1 week or longer to confer mental health benefits. An ideal intervention length may be around 3 weeks, but future research is needed to confirm this.",

          "abstract": "Sequence learning in the serial response time task (SRTT) is one of the few learning phenomena that are widely agreed to be implicit in nature (i.e., that learning may proceed in the absence of awareness). Evidently, it is also possible to explicitly learn a sequence of events. In the past few decades, research into sequence learning largely focused on the type of representation that may underlie implicit sequence learning, and whether or not two independent learning systems are necessary to explain qualitative differences between implicit and explicit learning. Using the drift-diffusion model, here we take a cognitive-processes perspective on sequence learning and investigate the cognitive operations that benefit from implicit and explicit sequence learning (e.g., stimulus detection or encoding, response selection, or response facilitation). To separate the processes involved in expressing implicit versus explicit knowledge, we manipulated explicit sequence knowledge independently of the opportunity to express such knowledge. Performance data from this experiment was fed into a dynamic drift-diffusion model that allowed us to disentangle the contributions of the above-mentioned processes to sequence-learning effects. Results revealed three findings that are relevant for sequence learning theories. We discuss how the diffusion model may be helpful in future research addressing these theories.",

          "authors": "Marius Barth; Christoph Stahl",
          "abstract": "The distinction between implicit and explicit learning is fundamental to theories of human learning. However, it remains an open question whether implicit and explicit learning are based on a single, unitary learning meachnism, or multiple learning mechanisms or systems. The dual-systems model (Keele, Ivry, Mayr, Hazeltine, &amp; Heuer, 2003) posits that, in addition to a multidimensional learning system that is accessible to consciousness, implicit learning may also proceed in a unidimensional learning. Learning in this system is considered to proceed within a set of dimension-specific, encapsulated processing modules, where strong separation between different kinds of information protects against interference. Parallel acquisition of multiple uncorrelated sequences has been considered crucial evidence in favor of encapsulated processing. However, recent work has demonstrated that parallel learning is also well accounted for by a single learning mechanism, and can therefore not provide convincing evidence for encapsulated processing. In a series of three experiments, we therefore aimed at testing the assumption of encapsulated processing more stringently. To this aim, we orthogonally manipulated sequences of stimulus and response features, and tested for selective influence of these sequences on the cognitive processes that are involved in SRTT performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, stimulus colors and response locations followed independent six-item probabilistic sequences. In Experiment 3, stimulus colors and stimulus locations followed such independent sequences. Replicating previous findings, we found learning of sequences of response locations. By contrast, we consistently found evidence against learning of sequences of stimulus colors or stimulus locations. First implications for the debate on encapsulated processing, and the organization of sequence learning systems, are discussed.",

          "authors": "Hayden Peel; Philippe A. Chouinard",
          "abstract": "We used the Garner paradigm to examine the relationship between the perceptual and conceptual aspects of an image for identification. Participants completed tasks that required them to selectively attend to semantic identity (e.g., manmade vs. natural) while ignoring image format, and vice versa, with the irrelevant dimension either held constant (baseline block) or varying simultaneously (filtering block). Experiment 1 compared black-and-white and greyscale drawings (BWvGS) and Experiment 2 compared coloured and greyscale drawings (CvGS). The former assessed the contribution of structural form cues to perception, while the latter assessed the importance of colour. Garner interference was found with accuracy (with more errors in filtering than baseline) in both the BWvGS and CvGS experiments, but this was asymmetric and limited to the semantic classification task. Participants’ selective attention to semantic identity failed when the image format varied simultaneously, indicating that conceptual processing is not independent of perceptual processing. However, in the image format task, selective attention to image format was successful despite variation in semantic identity, demonstrating that perceptual processing can occur independently of conceptual analysis. Together, these results demonstrate that the semantic classification of images is influenced by the format of the stimulus.",

To this end, many new initiatives have been developed that represent procedural (i.e., behaviours and sets of commonly used practices in the research process), structural (new norms, rules, infrastructure, and incentives), and community-based change (working groups, networks). Objectives: To outline international initiatives that enhance awareness and uptake of open research practices in the discipline of psychology. Methods: A systematic, narrative review was conducted in three stages: (1) a web search to identify open research initiatives in psychology; (2) a literature search to identify supporting publications; and (3) a hand search of grey literature. Eligible initiatives were coded into a narrative theme of procedural, structural, or community-based change. Results: A total of 187 initiatives were identified; 30 were procedural (e.g., toolkits, resources, software), 70 structural (e.g., policies, strategies, frameworks), and 87 community-based (e.g., working groups, networks). Discussion: Open research is progressing at pace through various initiatives that share a common goal to reform research culture. We hope that this review promotes their further adoption and facilitates coordinated efforts between individuals, organisations, institutions, publishers, and funders.",

However, no existing models for assessing posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) have successfully demonstrated out-of-sample replicability. We develop\na language-based AI model for PTSD and rigorously evaluate replicability in a prospective\nsample.\nMETHODS: Participants from the Stony Brook World Trade Center (WTC) Health and\nWellness Program described their lives in an automated interview during a clinical monitoring\nvisit. The language was analysed using AI to assess PTSD CheckList (PCL) for total symptom\nseverity score and four symptom subscales and validated against medical record PTSD\ndiagnosis.\nTo yield realistic accuracy estimates in this cross-sectional study, we propose the Sequential\nEvaluation with Model Pre-registration design, consisting of an iterative, two-phase pre-\nregistration paradigm. The first pre-registration specifies the data split, the model development,\nand the initial hypotheses. The second pre-registration specifies the exact pre-trained models,\ndata cleaning procedures, and the refined hypotheses.\nRESULTS: The data split included a development (N=1437) and a prospective (N=346) dataset.\nWithin the prospective sample, the pre-registered models produced scores that significantly\ncorrelated with their targets: PCL total (r=.38, p-value&lt;.001) and the four subscales (r=.28–.37,\np-value&lt;.001).

The current study explored whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiments 2a and 2b). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2a and 2b found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across these experiments, there was no evidence for interaction between binding condition and prioritization; participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space or modality. The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, and suggest that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of material.",

          "abstract": "Psychological measurement plays a vital role in many areas of science. Traditional methods for developing and scoring measurement instruments require large sets of human responses, making them time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new ways to tackle these challenges. In this brief note, we explore the use of convex hulls—a concept from computational geometry—in combination with AI-driven large language models to enhance psychometric practice. A convex hull is the smallest convex “boundary” around a set of points. By treating language embeddings as high-dimensional coordinates and forming convex hulls, we can interpret the structure of items and free text responses in new ways. We propose two novel applications of convex hulls: (1) item analysis without data: We use convex hulls to check if a test item “belongs” to a scale, providing a new indicator of item quality; and (2) scoring free text: By interpreting candidate responses in relation to the convex hull of other responses, we propose an objective way to score psychological constructs from natural language. Each method is possible in supervised and unsupervised modes. These methods are experimental and yet to be validated. We outline, but do not implement, brief methods for testing their efficacy. We discuss open questions that we expect will impact the utility of these methods, such as, a) why we don’t just ask the LLM to score the items and responses, b) why convex hull centroids might be preferred over clustering and scale embedding means c) what to do if the construct hull does not match the intended target, and d) whether the centroids of psychometric convex hulls represent the intensity or the essence of item discrimination and the constructs being assessed.",

However, the mechanisms by which SEB skills support students at school remain unclear. In the present research, we integrate research on SEB skills and student engagement, hypothesizing that SEB skills can be considered as individual antecedents of student engagement, a multidimensional construct encompassing four dimensions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, and agentic). A sample of 1642 high school students (Mage = 15.68; SDage = 1.47; 913 girls) completed measures assessing SEB skills, student engagement, and student outcomes (achievement, school satisfaction, life satisfaction, and school burnout). The results of a path analysis confirmed that self-management and social engagement skills domains are significantly associated with student outcomes, through the mediation of global student engagement. Further specific patterns of associations between the five SEB skills domains and the four dimensions of student engagement were also found. Our study emphasizes the value of integrating research on individual factors associated with student success and well-being into broader theoretical frameworks.

          "abstract": "The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of controlling one’s own actions and, through them, external events. It is a crucial aspect of consciousness, indicating that an agent can understand the causal relationship between their actions and environmental changes and, more importantly, voluntarily influence the environment through their actions. There has been extensive debate about when children and which animals possess the sense of agency, primarily because they cannot easily report it. Observing actions might be a promising way to estimate the sense of agency without relying on introspection. However, despite actions containing rich information about human subjective feelings, there are very few ways to abstract such information. In the present study, we aim to clarify the relationship between actions and the sense of agency during control exploration using a dataset of 167 children (6-16 years old) acquired by Nobusako et al. (2022). We employ action plan analysis developed by Chang et al. (2024) to analyze motion sequences data which was self-generated by participants during a control detection task. The action plan analysis uses transformer-LSTM-based autoencoders to capture high-level, abstract representations of sequences of motor commands (referred to as action plans). This approach allows us to quantify action plan diversity that reflects control exploration behaviors. The results showed that action plan diversity can be a promising way to measure the sense of agency both within individuals and among them. This suggests that simply observing how actions change under different control conditions can quantitatively reflect the emergence of the sense of agency in children. The findings and methodology provide a highly novel and useful tool for studying the sense of agency in broader populations and species in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Psychological distress that stems from racial discrimination experiences may depend on how strongly individuals identify with their race. Existing findings across survey research and a small body of experimental research are equivocal on whether and how racial identity factors exacerbate or buffer the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination. This study included experimental and survey data to characterize the moderating roles of racial identity centrality, private regard, and public regard in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress. Participants were 240 young adults of color (Mage=23.27; 50.8% women; 37.5% Asian American, 35.4% Hispanic/Latino, 15.8% Black/African American; 56.7% college students). Findings generally converged across experimental and survey methods. Simulated racial discrimination predicted acute psychological distress and measured lifetime racial discrimination predicted general psychological distress, but racial identity factors did not moderate these associations. Considerations for these null results and future research directions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) refers to the simplest form of conscious experience, characterized by the absence of time, self, and sensory content, where only pure awareness or consciousness remains. In this paper, we present a computational neurophenomenological account of minimal phenomenal experience within the active inference framework. We propose a generative mechanism that allows active inference agents to leverage capacities akin to those in generative adversarial networks, which use a dual framework of data generation and discrimination to improve perceptual accuracy. Our hypothesis posits that the brain continuously generates synthetic data to fill perceptual and cognitive gaps, and we provide a computational mechanism within the active inference framework to support this. We explore how synthetic data generation, when amplified by meditation, psychedelics, or other altered states, can the brain to ‘defabricate’ entrenched conceptual structures and approach pure consciousness at the limit. We provide simulations of an active inference agent embedded in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that recursive loops of synthetic data generation can lead to a breakdown in conceptualization — 'seeing as' — while enhancing the system’s ability to predict its own observation stream. We argue that this model can characterize the essential features of MPE, including contentlessness, epistemic openness, and the unique valence profile associated with minimal phenomenal experiences.",

          "abstract": "Background: Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms are fairly common in the general population but are linked to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the genetic and environmental origins of these associations are unclear. This twin study examined the phenotypic and aetiological associations between subsyndromal hypomania with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions and related symptoms (e.g., self-harm).\n\nMethods: Participants were 4,932 twin pairs from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. Hypomanic symptoms were assessed using the parent-rated Mood Disorders Questionnaire when the twins were aged 18. Specialist diagnoses of 14 conditions and symptoms were ascertained from Swedish population registries. Phenotypic associations between hypomania and these conditions/symptoms were investigated and their aetiological overlap examined using the twin method.\n\nOutcomes/findings: Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms were significantly associated with the diagnosis of all 14 conditions/symptoms. The highest odds was for psychotic disorders (odds ratio [OR]=1·48, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1·33-1·64, p&lt;0·001) and the lowest was for eating disorders (other than anorexia) (OR=1·15, 95% CI 1·08-1·22, p&lt;0·001). The genetic correlations between subsyndromal hypomania and these diagnoses ranged from 0·12 (95% CI 0·04-0·33) for eating disorders (other than anorexia) to 0·58 (95% CI 0·28-1·00) for drug misuse. The highest non-shared environmental correlation was for psychotic disorders (0·52, 95% CI -0·02-0·92) and lowest was for body dissatisfaction (0·04, 95% CI -0·01-0·08). For bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity/Disorder, genetic and non-shared environmental correlations with subsyndromal hypomania were of a similar magnitude.\n\nInterpretation: The association between subsyndromal hypomania and the diagnosis of multiple psychiatric phenotypes highlights its important role in the developmental pathway to clinical disorders, its complex origins and that it may represent a quantitative trait for bipolar disorder, and various psychiatric phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "‘Suspicion’ probes in experimental psychology are a widely used methodological tool and often touted as a gold standard approach to ensuring the internal validity of experimental methods. However, such probes and their associated suspicion-mitigation efforts (e.g., excluding ‘suspicious’ participants) remain unstandardized and unvalidated. Through meta-analytic p-curves, we compared the evidentiary value of studies that reported the use of ‘suspicion’ probes versus those that did not, as well as studies that either retained or excluded ‘suspicious’ participants. We sampled 200 independent effects from psychology experiments that employed deception and were recently published in five eminent journals of experimental psychology: Cognition, Emotion, JEP: General, JPSP (all sections), and Psychological Science. Studies that reported the use of ‘suspicion’ probes (k = 100) had less evidentiary value and statistical power than those that did not report the use of ‘suspicion’ probes (k = 100). Furthermore, studies that excluded ‘suspicious’ participants (k = 50) had less evidentiary value and similar statistical power to those that retained ‘suspicious’ participants (k = 50). Though we cannot claim that these differences are causally-induced by ‘suspicion’ probes, our findings call into question the value of performing such probes and using them to exclude ‘suspicious’ participants in the context of hypothesis testing in experimental psychology.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the psychometric properties of the Farsi version of Parents' Beliefs about Children's Emotions Questionnaire (PBACE) in the Iranian setting. The PBACE is a self-report measure comprising seven subscales: Value of Anger, Cost of Positivity, Control, Parental Knowledge, Manipulation, Stability, and Autonomy. The psychometric properties of the PBACE, including reliability, content, convergent, and construct validity, and dimensionality, were assessed in a sample of 397 parents of children aged 5-11 years. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of seven models and a general seven-correlated model, which showed good model fit for the PBACE and its subscales, except for the Parental Knowledge subscale. The poor fit of the Parental Knowledge subscale led to testing a six-correlated model without it, which demonstrated superior model fit compared to the seven-correlated model. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) indicated good content validity for the scale. Additionally, significant associations with children's emotion regulation established satisfactory convergent validity. Internal consistency, measured by the Omega coefficient, was acceptable for all subscales except Parental Knowledge, while the PBACE overall demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Findings from the bifactor model indicated that the measure could be considered unidimensional with some multidimensional features. Although the poor fit and lower Omega coefficient for the Parental Knowledge subscale suggest that it should not be used, the PBACE is recommended for research and clinical purposes in Iran due to its sound psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) is a widely recognized tool for assessing intelligence. However, it often faces challenges related to lengthy administration times, which can diminish its practicality and increase resource costs. Although several short-form APMs have been developed, they typically overlook the differences in cognitive components assessed by various items, potentially compromising the instrument's content validity. To enhance the consistency of the proportion of cognitive components measured in the short-form instruments compared to the complete APM, this study employed an automated item selection algorithm with cognitive component constraints within the item response theory framework—the revised maximum priority index—to develop a series of short-form APMs with varying item counts. By comparing them with existing short-form APMs, the newly developed instruments demonstrated good reliability while maintaining a nearly consistent proportion of cognitive components measured as in the complete APM. Finally, we recommend two short-form APMs containing 12 and 18 items, respectively, for subsequent use, based on the customary lengths of existing short-form APMs.",

          "authors": "Tamlin Conner; Jack Cooper; Robin Turner",
          "abstract": "Healthy lifestyles are a cornerstone of optimal physical health, yet their contribution to optimal mental health is still an open question. This article investigated the relationships between three key health behaviors—sleep quality, physical activity, and dietary choices—and psychological well-being among young adults ages 18 to 25, a demographic known for disproportionately low levels of well-being. The research used three datasets: a cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N=1,032) and two daily diary datasets (Study 2, N=818; Study 3, N=236) of young adults living in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Multilevel regression analyses examined how these health behaviors simultaneously and synergistically predicted well-being at the between-person and within-person levels, while controlling for covariates such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and depressive symptoms. Additionally, Study 3 incorporated wearable device-measured physical activity to supplement self-report measures. The findings highlighted better sleep quality as the strongest predictor of well-being across all three datasets, followed by fruit and vegetable consumption, with significant associations between these health behaviors and well-being observed at the between-person and within-person levels. Physical activity also emerged as a reliable predictor of well-being, mostly at the within-person level. The use of device-measured physical activity confirmed similar patterns, reinforcing the validity of findings. Pathways linking health behaviors to well-being were mostly additive, except for a buffering pattern observed at the within-person level indicating that higher fruit and vegetable intake could potentially mitigate the negative impact of poor sleep on daily well-being. This article underscores the importance of the “big three” health behaviors in well-being among young adults, offering insights for future health interventions to improve positive psychological functioning in this population.",

          "abstract": "Causal inference and questions about timing are central to developmental science. Yet scientists are often limited to observational data, and conceptual, methodological, and computational barriers have prevented uptake of relevant methodological tools from other disciplines that are designed to improve causal inference. This paper provides a practical guide to implementing one powerful causal inference tool, marginal structural models (MSMs), to strengthen our ability to test causal questions about exposures/treatments that unfold over time. We draw on an illustrative example testing the potentially causal roles of dose and timing of exposure to economic strain from infancy through early childhood on children’s behavior problems in early childhood. We first introduce the advantages of MSMs for investigating causal questions over time. Specifically, we review the logic of ‘exposure histories’ and the potential outcomes framework, using sequential randomization as a conceptual tool. We then discuss inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) for addressing the threat of confounding over time. We then outline how to implement MSMs with observational data, before providing step-by-step guidance for using our novel, open-source R package, devMSMs. In our example, we create longitudinal IPTW balancing weights to attenuate a number of confounder-exposure relations. We then apply these weights to test an outcome model relating economic strain across infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood to future behavior problems. Finally, we estimate and compare the predicted causal effects of different developmental histories of high economic strain that vary in dose and timing and discuss substantive implications. We close with ongoing considerations.",

          "abstract": "Philosophers and psychologists alike have long debated the etiology of beliefs about human agency. Recently, empirical investigations have shown that lay beliefs about free will and determinism represent stable and important individual differences. Despite a perennial interest in the sources of agentic belief, genetic and environmental influences on such beliefs have never been studied. We administered a battery of items assessing these beliefs to a unique sample of 394 adoptive and biological families with adult offspring to investigate the origins of agentic beliefs and their relationships. We found significant differences between adopted and biological offspring and between the parents of such children, particularly in beliefs about determinism. Biometric modeling revealed especially surprising results: unlike the vast majority of traits studied in family designs, agentic beliefs appear to be weakly or not at all heritable. Since genetic factors might be regarded as typical of the \"initial conditions\" in philosophical thought experiments about free will and determinism, it is especially ironic that beliefs about free will and determinism may be among the traits least influenced by genetic differences.",

          "abstract": "Avoidant processing of positive emotional information and facilitatory processing of negative emotional information are related to the experience of anhedonia and anxiety. However, how these cognitive processes inter-relate with self-report symptoms of psychopathology over time is unclear. The current study thus examined behavioral indices of perception, attention, and affective updating in relation to self-report measures of anhedonia and anxiety in dynamic network models at six separate time-points among participants preselected for a wide-range of depression symptoms (N = 101). Findings suggest that two different pathways are associated with emotional information processing over time: one represents an anhedonic circuit, and the second represents a two-node reward devaluation circuit. The first pathway reveals how anhedonia and cognitive functioning are related over time (and, potentially, across levels of analysis) and could inform future longitudinal studies of anhedonic individuals. The second pathway represents a theoretical advance in the conceptualization of reward devaluation by further demonstrating that attentional avoidance and perceptual avoidance of positivity are inter-related. Future studies and network analyses that evaluate anhedonia and devaluative processing of positivity, and that replicate these innovative methods, are needed to elucidate how avoidance of positivity and anhedonia are related as part of a causal system of self-reported symptoms and behavioral tasks.",

          "abstract": "Within-disorder heterogeneity complicates mapping neurobiological features of psychopathology to DSM conceptualizations. The present study explored patterns of diagnostic classification errors among disorders with commonly co-occurring features to examine this heterogeneity. We conducted classification analyses with the UCLA Phenomics Study database using a support vector classifier to differentiate disorders via whole-brain task-based functional connectivity, predicting that model misclassifications would provide insight about brain connectivity characteristics shared across disorders. We also explored whether symptoms and specific brain networks could account for misclassification rates. The classification model performed better than chance (44% accuracy, p = .01) and revealed that misclassification of schizophrenia (SCZ) as bipolar disorder (BD; 38%) and BD as SCZ (36%) was symmetrical. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was misclassified as BD at the highest rate (46%) and higher than the converse (17%). SCZ and ADHD were misclassified least (SCZ as ADHD 15%; ADHD as SCZ 22%). Considerable variance in misclassification of SCZ as BD (R2 = .83) and BD as SCZ (R2 = .71) could be accounted for by symptoms of both SCZ and BD. Permutation testing revealed disorder- and network-specific effects, with certain networks improving classification accuracy and others hindering it for specific disorders. An approach focused on classification errors replicated known disorder overlap, producing errors in the expected configuration. Further, it identified clinical and neural features within and across diagnostic categories that contribute to disorder misclassification and within-disorder heterogeneity. This approach may facilitate neurobiologically informed phenotypic differentiation within diagnostic groups.",

Whereas 32 of these dyads were composed of CHR youth and their caregivers, the remaining 38 dyads encompassed psychiatrically healthy youth and their caregivers. Dyads engaged in 10-minute neutral, conflict, and pleasant conversations while their autonomic physiology was continuously monitored. In conflict and neutral interactions, CHR youth exhibited contrarian coregulation. Contrarian coregulation was associated with elevated risk for psychosis, was linked to greater baseline psychosis symptomatology, and prospectively predicted increases in symptoms one year later. These findings document alterations in physiological coregulation between CHR youth and their caregivers, highlight their relevance for clinical symptomatology, suggest novel avenues for relationship-focused treatments, and contribute to a biologically-informed science of social connection.",

We also demonstrate how we, as a field, often fail to follow important lines of argument to their end --- this results in a paradoxical praxis.

          "abstract": "In our original study, 'Consumed by Creed' (Adam-Troian &amp; Bélanger, 2024), we established significant and consistent associations between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom severity and radical intentions across four distinct U.S. population samples—Environmentalists, Republicans, Democrats, and Muslims—partially or fully mediated by obsessive passion. Fillon et al. (2024) challenged our findings, alleging methodological errors and an excessive degree of researcher flexibility, which they claim could lead to false-positive results. In this response, we critically examine Fillon et al.'s commentary, arguing that it exemplifies flawed meta-scientific critique. We demonstrate that their approach relies on a series of unsupported and misleading claims, including a misinterpretation of the literature, unjustified reliance on visual data inspection, speculative assumptions about religious influences on our findings, and a shifting of the burden of proof. Through rigorous re-analyses, we reaffirm the robustness of our original results and address the unfounded allegations regarding our methodological practices. We also critique Fillon et al.'s approach, highlighting the necessity of domain-specific expertise in meta-scientific evaluations and cautioning against the risks of speculative and defamatory criticism in academic discourse. This exchange underscores the importance of maintaining rigorous standards in both original research and its critique, ensuring that scientific debate remains grounded in evidence rather than conjecture.",

          "authors": "Sierra Ha; Joshua Gilbert; Erin Le; Connor Ross; Alice Lorch",
          "abstract": "Background:\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with inadequate screening rates even in urban areas with high concentrations of medical professionals. While medical guidelines recommend annual diabetic retinopathy screening for patients with diabetes mellitus, adherence to these recommendations remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the impact of a novel teleretinal DR screening program on screening compliance across urban community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods:\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study comparing DR screening compliance between intervention and comparison community health centers before and after implementing a teleretinal screening program. Participants included patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with primary care providers at the studied sites. We defined compliance as completion of either teleretinal screening or a documented eye care professional examination within the previous 365 days. Monthly compliance rates were analyzed using two-way fixed effects regression and event study techniques.\nResults:\nThe study included 10,247 patients with diabetes mellitus who received care at six participating sites, generating 222 monthly compliance rate estimates. Baseline compliance rates before implementation ranged from 25% to 40% across sites. The two-way fixed effects regression analysis revealed that the screening program significantly increased DR compliance rates by an average of 7.2 percentage points (p &lt; 0.001). Event study analysis showed positive effects across all sites, though the initial improvement tended to diminish over time.\nConclusions:\nImplementation of a community-based teleretinal DR screening program significantly improved compliance with annual screening guidelines in urban communities. These findings support the broader adoption of teleretinal screening as an effective strategy for preventing DR-related vision loss in vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to assess long-term clinical outcomes and optimize program sustainability.",

          "authors": "Mikel Jimenez; Antonio Prieto; Anna Grubert; José Antonio Hinojosa; Pedro R. Montoro",
          "abstract": "While most research on the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) has focused on exploring the candidate event related potentials (ERP) components associated to visual awareness, much less is known about the temporal dynamics associated to those correlates. In the present study, we will measure the temporal dynamics of visual awareness as a function of the level of processing (LoP) of the stimulus and report condition (report vs. no-report). In the report condition, participants will perform a low-level (color identification: blue vs. red) or high-level (category identification: animal vs. object) task on colored stimuli that will be presented at threshold while reporting their awareness of the target (e.g., ‘seen’ or ‘unseen’). In the no-report block, participants will count the number of times that a task-irrelevant, but LoP congruent, stimulus appears within each block. The VAN (visual awareness negativity) and LP (late positivity) components of the ERP will be computed for each condition by pooling together aware and unaware trials. If awareness to different stimulus representations is temporally dynamic, we will expect an earlier low-level VAN compared to high-level VAN together with an earlier high-level LP compared to low-level LP, suggesting that the temporal course of the NCC is dependent on the level of processing of the stimulus and task demands. An absence of differences between low-level and high-level VANs, on the other hand, will suggest that awareness emerges “at once”, independently of the level at which the stimulus is processed. Regarding the LP, we expect two alternative scenarios. In the first one, we will observe reliable LPs only in the report condition and no LPs in the no-report condition. This will be in line with the proposal that the LP/P3 is not a correlate of awareness but reflects post-perceptual or task related processes. In the second scenario, reliable LPs might be observed in both the report and no-report tasks, but only for the high-level tasks. This will suggest that the LP is indeed a correlate of visual awareness which is exclusively modulated by high-level stimulus representations. In sum, here we will explore whether the NCC within the no-report paradigm are depend on the LoP of the stimulus and whether they are temporally dynamic, or alternatively, they are temporally invariant and independent of the LoP conceptualization.",

          "abstract": "Humans often need to make decisions that take future situations into account. This kind of sequential choice entails a trade-off between the present and the future, where decision-makers have to decide to accept or reject the currently available option. The approach-avoidance conflict, on the other hand, is a frequently used framework in psychology to study the behavioral trade-off regarding appetitive and aversive stimuli. This study investigates the influence of approach and avoidance conditions on sequential choice. Therefore, we developed experimental conditions in which participants should either approach or avoid environmental dangers in order to optimize their behavior. The main objective is to evaluate meta-decision making strategies under ecologically valid conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a game-like foraging paradigm with probabilistic outcomes where people could use different types of decision rules (or policies). While some policies would only account for one variable of our game environment, others would account for different variables depending on the time-point and the situation. Model comparisons allowed us to test whether participants would rely on a rather myopic/heuristic or a forward-looking policy. We then tested whether policies differed depending on our task’s approach and avoidance condition. Our findings suggest that people generally use a myopic strategy in sequential decision-making. However, we observe increased optimal behavior in situations where the environment bears higher dangers that should be avoided. We suspect the underlying mechanisms to be linked to an internal energetic trade-off between efficient and accurate meta-decision making depending on the risks imposed by the environment.",

          "abstract": "The consciousness-collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics was explored as a weak measurement quantum Zeno effect in an optical diffraction apparatus. Fifty participants were selected via a worldwide search for individuals with experience in focusing their attention. Each was mailed an optical apparatus and provided with software to run an experiment to see if illumination recorded in a portion of the interference pattern would be affected when it was observed versus unobserved. Another portion of the interference pattern was recorded simultaneously but not observed at any time to provide a real-time control. A variety of environmental sensors and real-time encryption of the key data were among the methods built into the apparatus to help ensure data integrity.\nForty-seven participants completed their assigned experimental tasks, and two of three preregistered hypotheses were significantly confirmed. However, data from two participants were deemed probable outliers because they each achieved results over 7 sigma from chance. Those outcomes appeared to be due to misalignments in their optical systems, likely caused by rough handling during shipping. The two participants were sent new optical systems to provide replacement data, which upon review was assessed to be reasonable. Analysis of the revised dataset no longer supported the preregistered hypotheses, but an exploratory hypothesis based on skewness was significant. An exploratory time-series analysis found strong evidence that during observation periods interference progressively declined as compared to unobserved periods, in accordance with the proposal that human consciousness can act like a weak measurement quantum Zeno effect. In addition, performance by participants experienced in an outward focus of attention performed significantly better than those experienced with an inward focus of attention.",

          "authors": "Paul Linton; Nikolaus Kriegeskorte",
          "abstract": "We present a new illusion that challenges our traditional understanding of stereo vision. Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. There is no scaling of disparity with distance. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth.",

          "abstract": "The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) has gained significant interest in the scientific community in recent years. Despite its demonstrated impact on social and personal functioning, the neural bases underlying EI remain poorly understood. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of the existing literature on the neural correlates of EI. The search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. A total of 849 studies were initially identified (after duplicates were removed), of which 34 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the final synthesis. These studies employed various neuroimaging techniques such as lesion studies, grey and white matter structural MRI, task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and EEG. The findings of this review suggest that EI is supported by a complex and widespread brain network primarily implicated in the integration of cognitive and emotional processes, with significant involvement of structures commonly linked to social cognition. The literature mainly emphasized the role of the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and amygdala in conjunction with brain networks comprising these areas, such as the somatic marker circuitry and the social cognition network. Other brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cuneus, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, frontopolar gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and superior longitudinal fasciculus were also frequently mentioned. However, further research is needed to clarify the roles of some of these regions in EI. Limitations and future lines of research are discussed.",

Progress in one interoceptive domain does not imply progress in others, highlighting a need for more differentiated and modality-specific approaches. We review findings demonstrating weak correlations in performance across interoceptive tasks and modalities, as well as differential associations with clinical variables.

However, the mechanism underlying people’s willingness to exert effort in exchange for information remains unclear. Previous work has suggested that valence and uncertainty are two key factors influencing information-seeking, but few studies have tested if these factors are important when exerting physical effort in exchange for information. Additionally, it remains unknown whether different kinds of uncertainty, i.e., risk and ambiguity, have differential impacts. In the current study, we developed a novel information-seeking task to quantify the value of non-instrumental information using incentive-compatible physical effort to examine how effort changes as a function of valence and uncertainty. Across two studies (N = 123), we found that people’s willingness to exert effort positively correlates with outcome expected value under both risk and ambiguity. Additionally, people exert more effort when outcome distribution uncertainty increases in risky situations, but are insensitive to ambiguity, except when facing extreme ambiguity. Our results demonstrate an unexpected dissociation. Humans will\nengage in effort-based information-seeking, even for non-instrumental information, when facing risk. In contrast, they show a much lower willingness to expend effort to resolve non-instrumental ambiguity.",

Study 2 (34 countries, N = 123,502) shows that subjective SES predicts obligation to sacrifice for future lives, especially in nations with less inequality. In Study 3 (N = 1,264 Americans), individuals randomly assigned more resources allocate more to future generations, though not proportionately more.

          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 19th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i. e. perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, even though their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the basis of these assumptions and exam-ines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreas-ing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Addi-tionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable This study also derives new formulas for the biased estimation of the TRC, based on empirical results. These findings demonstrate that while the TRC may perform well under ideal conditions, even slight deviations from its assumptions can lead to significant inaccuracies. Therefore, the TRC may be unsuitable for practical applications, particularly when test condi-tions are uncontrolled, or traits vary over time.",

Using a diverse sample of N = 1,083 respondents from Germany, the psychometric properties of the instrument were evaluated. The results demonstrated low rates of missing responses, minimal response biases, and a robust measurement model that was invariant across sex, age, education, and employment status. These findings support the use of the ATTARI-WHE to assess AI attitudes in the work, healthcare, and education domains, with three items each.

Participants completed a battery of assessments (psychosocial, neuropsychological, and physical functioning) at baseline and subsequently were randomly assigned to receive 20 hours of cognitive training via Games (stationary computerized tasks emphasizing executive functioning and exerciser self-certainty, and exergaming with dual-task components; n=118) or attention-control health educational Videos (n=115). Training was split across five 2-hr lab sessions (overall adherence=98.3%), followed by five 2-hr home sessions. Among Games, 81.4% fully complied with our exergaming protocol (lab &amp; home) and 88.4% completed the cognitive training protocol. Video engagement was assessed via accuracy to attentional checks (Ms=82.4% accuracy in lab, 82.0% accuracy at home). The primary outcome was physical activity engagement (PAE), a latent factor based on physical activity steps &amp; moderate intensity minutes derived from yearlong Fitbit step recordings, visitations &amp; classes, &amp; Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire). As hypothesized, Bayesian multiple-indicator, multiple-cause model analysis indicated a significant group effect (PAE score M±SD is 4.20±1.02 in Games and 3.77±0.92 in Videos; Cohen’s d=0.19 and one-sided p= 0.03) after adjusting for a set of background variables. Based on 58.4% respondents to our study evaluation survey, 87.3% enjoyed the intervention they were part of, 87.4% enjoyed the yearlong exercise program, and 97.1% would recommend it to friends/family. Only 4.1% of study completers were able to guess the study's true purpose. Results associated with hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change, including cognitive functioning and psychosocial outcomes, will be discussed. Our findings replicated our previous trial and show reliable effects for promoting exercise engagement within an unsupervised community-based exercise program for middle-aged adults.",

          "abstract": "We present a retrieved-context theory of memory for items, associations, and their\ninteraction (CMR-IA). Our theory assumes an evolving representation of temporal context that binds to items and associations, allowing the rememberer to make judgments based on the occurrence of a mnemonic target within a particular context. In addition to the assumptions inherited from prior retrieved-context theories, CMR-IA assumes a conjunctive (Gestalt) representation for paired associates, increased attention to rare items, and variable thresholds for recognition decisions. We apply CMR-IA to key findings concerning recognition of items and associations, including effects of recency, similarity, receiver-operating characteristic curves, word frequency, differential forgettings of items and associations, and contiguity effects for successive probes. We also apply CMR-IA to cued recall phenomena, including serial position effects, distribution of correct responses and errors, contiguity effects, associative symmetry, and similarity effects. Finally, we ask whether CMR-IA can account for the dependencies between successive tests of item and associative memory. We show that combining a Gestalt associative mechanism with retrieved-context theory provides a good account for many empirical phenomena concerning item and associative memory. The analysis of successive memory tests highlights the important role of output encoding in our model.",

          "abstract": "Background: Racialized heteroscedasticity, characterized by unequal variance in neuroimaging data across racial groups, may challenge the assumptions underlying brain-behavior predictive models. These models often assume homoscedasticity, potentially leading to biased predictions, particularly when applied across diverse populations. This study investigates the presence of heteroscedasticity in functional connectivity data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and examines its implications for predictive modeling using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data.\nMethods: We analyzed resting-state functional connectivity from 5,084 participants in the ABCD study, comparing variance in rs-fMRI connectivity between Black and White participants across 35,912 non-redundant connectivity edges. Levene’s test, adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic covariates, was used to assess differences in variance, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction applied. Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM) was employed to predict performance across 15 behavioral and cognitive tasks, and 95% confidence intervals were generated for prediction intervals via bootstrapping over 1,000 iterations.\nResults: Significant differences in variance were observed in 10.5% (n = 3,768) of connectivity edges, with 98.5% (n = 3,712) showing greater variance in Black participants. CPM analysis revealed significantly wider prediction intervals for Black participants across 10 of 15 tasks, particularly in measures of working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. These results suggest that increased variance in functional connectivity in Black participants contributes to greater prediction uncertainty in brain-behavior models.\nConclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for racialized heteroscedasticity in neuroimaging-based predictive models. Failing to account for differences in variance may exacerbate health disparities and lead to less reliable predictions for Black participants. Addressing these disparities is essential for the development of more equitable predictive models in neuroscience and psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Perceived discrimination is a pervasive social stressor with significant implications for adolescent mental health and neurodevelopment. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we investigated the relationship between perceived discrimination and functional connectivity patterns in the adolescent brain. We applied a Network-Based Statistic (NBS) analysis to 268x268 connectome data from 5,084 participants who provided data on perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was coded as a binary variable (Yes/No) based on participants' responses to a validated discrimination scale. Our analysis identified two primary subnetworks associated with perceived discrimination: a positive subnetwork, characterized by increased connectivity between the right prefrontal cortex, left insula, and subcortical regions, and a negative subnetwork, marked by disrupted connectivity between the right prefrontal cortex and left temporal regions. The positive subnetwork suggests enhanced cross-hemispheric communication in adolescents reporting discrimination, while the negative subnetwork indicates reduced cross-hemispheric integration in those reporting no discrimination. Additionally, significant alterations in connectivity across large-scale brain networks were observed. Specifically, adolescents reporting discrimination exhibited increased connectivity between visual processing networks and regions involved in attentional control, while showing decreased connectivity in other network interactions. These findings offer novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of perceived discrimination on adolescent brain function, particularly in regions related to emotion regulation, social cognition, and stress responses. Our results underscore the importance of considering discriminatory experiences in the context of adolescent neurodevelopment and mental health.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel methodological framework for cognitive control training, embedded in a video game that incorporates action-based gameplay and a multidimensional Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) system. This system adapts to individual player performance in real-time, ensuring a personalized and engaging experience. The game architecture is modular, including a configurable set of cognitive training modules which are tailored according to one’s training goals. Transitioning between modules occurs through an action-based central hub following the literature on action video games and their positive impact on brain plasticity. Analysis of data from 34 players demonstrates how they progress through each module, with most players reaching their zone of proximal development after approximately 30-45 minutes of playing a module. Once players stabilize in their skill progression, the DDA system maintains variability in gameplay, a feature that has been suggested to promote the transfer of skills to novel situations. This analysis also highlights how our novel multidimensional DDA system accommodates a wide range of skill levels, offering a seamless on-boarding experience across a variety of players. Together, this novel architecture and DDA framework provide a new, rigorous methodological blueprint for the design of computerized cognitive training tools.",

          "authors": "andra geana; Christina L. Boisseau; Michael Frank; Steve Rasmussen",
          "abstract": "Compulsivity is a key feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with compulsions—repetitive, stereotyped behaviors and mental acts meant to relieve distress—often posing significant obstacles to daily function. The last few years have seen increases in compulsive behaviors; yet, the specific mechanisms of compulsions in OCD remain unknown. Previous research holds mixed findings on compulsivity-linked cognitive deficits, and, while many accounts assume compulsions aim to reduce anxiety, most individuals with anxiety do not develop compulsions—suggesting that the anxiety-reduction account is incomplete. A deeper insight into the neural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning compulsions holds immediate potential benefits for improving treatment options for OCD patients. We propose here that one factor in the formation of compulsions is the inability to integrate uncertainty across hierarchical goal levels. Using a predictive inference task with a hierarchical structure relying on local uncertainty reduction (short-term goals) in the service of global uncertainty reduction (long-term goal), we tested local and global learning in OCD patients (n = 20) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). Both groups showed the ability to reduce uncertainty locally, learning the statistical structure of the local environment based on observed data; however, only the healthy volunteers showed evidence of integrated learned knowledge at the local level into reducing uncertainty about the higher level of the task hierarchy. We suggest that this indicates a potential mechanism for compulsions that relies on the inability to adaptively prioritize and “toggle” among different local goals in the service of global goals.",

          "abstract": "Our memories play a crucial role in many decisions. Recent work has begun to study how individuals recombine elements of past episodes stored in memory to evaluate the outcome of some decisions (Biderman et al., 2020; Shohamy &amp; Daw, 2015). However, memory is not infallible and can get distorted. Understanding the impact of a fallible memory system on decision-making is essential. To explore how rewards influence memory and subsequent choices, we employed a modified version of the classic Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995), where we assigned different levels of reward to different DRM lists at the encoding stage . Words were either novel, studied, or conceptually related critical lures. In Experiment 1, we tested the effect of reward level at encoding on subsequent memory performance. In Experiment 2, we tested the effect of reward level on subsequent memory-guided value-based decision making. We found that high-value critical lures were brought to mind more often than low-value critical lures overall. Interestingly, participants properly identified high-value critical lures as new, despite bringing those words to mind (i.e., participants successfully monitored their memory for high-value critical lures), but failed to so for low-value critical lures. Moreover, participants chose high-value critical lures more often than novel items that were not related to the studied lists when compared to low-value critical lures. These findings suggest that reward can modulate memory representations to be more generalizable and consequently shape decisions that rely on such representations.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of the impact of SCEs on health outcomes among sexual- and gender-minority populations.  \nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on preregistered search criteria. The initial search identified 3,067 articles from 2013-2022, narrowed to 64 independent studies following double-reviewer abstract and full-text screening. Seven health outcomes were identified: psychological health (k = 26), suicide and related behaviors (k = 23), substance use (k = 14), sexual health (k = 13), physical health (k = 5),  housing instability (k = 3), and adulthood abuse/victimization (k = 3). An individual meta-analysis was conducted for each health outcome. \nResults: Across all health outcomes, there were increased odds (31 - 132%) for sexual- and gender-diverse-identifying individuals who experienced SCEs before age 18 to develop an adverse health outcome after age 18. \nConclusion: Increased odds for the development of an adverse health outcome following SCEs among sexual- and gender-diverse populations highlight the need to assess SCEs in research and clinical practice. This is one of the largest meta-analyses to examine the impacts of SCEs on health outcomes among LGBTQ+ populations. Beyond research and the clinic, these findings have critical policy implications for creating environments that mitigate the impact of SCEs on health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals.",

A major limitation of that study was the use of the binary measurement. In this paper, we show that the same effect is detectable with a new, near-Gaussian measurement of leftism. The correlation between this measurement and paternal age was r = 0.12 (p &lt; 0.001). This measurement has high reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.93) which far outperforms the commonly used Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale (α = 0.71) [2] as well as high criterion validity, as evidenced by the Cohen’s d between Republicans and Democrat on the measurement (d = 2.31, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, we show that, as before, there is no significant correlation between general leftism and age when having a child in fathers, suggesting this result is not due to older fathers being more leftist.",

In spite of the dire consequences of allowing inequality persist unabated, efforts to mitigate inequality via redistribution typically fail, often because economically disadvantaged people oppose the very redistributive policies which would improve their lives. This counterintuitive finding has posed challenges to existing theories of human behavior, leading many to speculate that it is fairness, not material interest, which underlies redistributive choice. In the current study, we propose a novel experimental paradigm to assess how both fairness and self-interest impact redistributive choice. In an online sample of 231 participants, we demonstrate that the choice of redistributive tax rate was impacted by both factors. However, employing a computational modeling approach, we also find evidence that strategic norms underlie redistributive choice, both in choices observed in the laboratory and the policy views that participants hold.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the interplay between cognitive tasks and physical performance has drawn increasing attention, with research suggesting that engaging in cognitive effort prior to exercise can impair subsequent physical performance due to heightened mental fatigue. However, recent studies have cast doubts on the robustness of this effect, prompting for a reassessment of the mechanisms underlying cognitive fatigue and its impact on physical performance. In this study, we present a novel approach aimed at addressing methodological limitations in prior research, with a focus on individualizing cognitive task difficulty and duration. By integrating innovative techniques such as Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) and psychophysiological monitoring, we sought to unravel the complex dynamics between cognitive engagement, subjective states, and physical performance. In a pre-registered (https://osf.io/8rkxq/), randomized, within-participant design experiment, 21 recreational athletes completed a running task to failure test at 90% of their maximal aerobic speed after performing a cognitive task until failure or watching a self-selected documentary (control). Six different subjective dimensions were recorded with the TET and pupillometry was recorded during cognitive task performance. The key findings of this study were: 1) subjective changes during effortful tasks are not limited to a single experience, such as mental fatigue or boredom, but can be grouped into distinct patterns; 2) despite the individualized and demanding cognitive tasks, completing them before exercise did not impair subsequent physical performance; 3) pupil size reliably reflected cognitive task performance until failure and partially reflected changes in subjective states, while fixation on the stimulus decreased over time, especially during high-demand periods. These results provide a new approach for understanding physical and behavioral responses, with implications for psychology and sports science.",

The purpose of this study was to identify epigenetic predictors of early childhood attention problems among children born very preterm and to examine the joint role of epigenetic and environmental factors in predicting attention problems in this population. We studied 242 participants from a multi-site study of infants born less than 30 weeks gestational age. Neonatal buccal swabs were assayed for DNA methylation levels at over 450,000 CpG sites and age acceleration metrics were calculated using existing epigenetic clocks. A composite of postnatal environmental adversity was calculated using maternal reported risk factors. Attention problems were assessed in early childhood (mean age 6.58 years) using the Conner’s Kiddie Continuous Performance Test 2nd Edition. After adjustment for multiple testing, we found that DNA methylation of 9 CpG sites was associated with childhood attention problems. Several CpGs were located in genes previously linked to neurodevelopmental traits and inflammation in prior epigenome-wide and genome-wide association studies. Greater environmental adversity was also associated with increased attention problems. When tested together, DNA methylation and environmental adversity independently predicted attention problems. This study is the first to show associations between DNA methylation, environmental adversity, and objectively measured attention problems in school-age children born very preterm. These results could shed light on the etiology of attention problems in this population and may help us identify at birth preterm children at highest risk for later ADHD diagnosis.",

In the proposed study, we aim to assess the efficacy of a second-generation mindfulness intervention (SG-MBI) on spiritual distress, spiritual decline, and spiritual growth in women with advanced cancer. A secondary aim is to examine the impact of the intervention on psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, loneliness, nonattachment to self, and self-transcendent states. A third aim is to explore any benefit of nature immersion on intervention outcomes.  \n\nMethod: This study will utilize a three-arm RCT with wait-list control design. A total of 198 women will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (treatment indoors/outdoors) or wait-list control group. Participants in the 8-week intervention groups will be introduced to Buddhist-derived wisdom practices that draw upon the sublime attitudes or abodes (Sanskrit: brahmavihārā): compassion (Sanskrit: karuṇā), loving kindness (Sanskrit: maitrī), appreciative joy (muditā), and equanimity (Sanskrit: upekṣā). Assessments will be conducted at three time points: before random allocation and post-intervention at 8 weeks and 20 weeks. \n\nProposed Analytic Plan: Linear mixed models will be used for intention-to-treat (ITT) primary analyses. Per-protocol (PP), subgroup, and secondary outcome analyses will also be conducted. Results will provide critical information about the utility of SG-MBIs for meeting the spiritual and psychological needs of women with advanced cancer.",

          "authors": "Danai Papadaki; Ramakrishna Chakravarthi; Søren K. Andersen",
          "abstract": "Recognising and responding to task-relevant stimuli may be hindered by nearby task-irrelevant flanker stimuli. Such effects occur both in visual crowding and in Flanker Compatibility Effects (FCE). Whereas crowding is a visual phenomenon that reflects a breakdown of object recognition in clutter, the FCE in the Eriksen flanker task is thought to be due to conflict during decision-making. In two experiments we investigated if and how these two seemingly independent phenomena are related. We employed an orientation categorisation task that allowed us to concurrently quantify crowding and FCEs. Specifically, we examined whether the spatial arrangement of stimuli affects the FCE in a similar way as in crowding. Interestingly, even when flankers were outside the crowding range, larger FCEs were observed for radially placed flankers compared to tangentially placed ones and for two compared to one flanker, corresponding to established patterns in crowding. However, inner flankers produced larger FCEs than outer flankers - the opposite of what is observed in crowding. In Experiment 2, we further investigated this reversed inner-outer asymmetry while manipulating the magnitude of crowding through varying target-flanker spacings. As expected, the outer flankers produced stronger crowding than inner ones. Crucially, the inner flankers produced a larger reaction time FCE and this inner-flanker interference was highest at the largest spacing. These findings demonstrate that the spatial layout of visual stimuli modulates conflict at both visual and decision-making stages, but the opposite patterns of the inner-outer asymmetry in the two phenomena provide a clear demarcation between the processes underlying them.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can represent information about multiple objects in the form of ensemble statistics, such as their mean feature. Although ensemble representation is often considered a strategy to deal with attentional capacity limitations, it is under debate whether it requires attention. We investigated this question using two ERP markers, the P3 which is evoked by change detection of attended stimuli, and visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) which is elicited by automatic sensory discrimination under attention diverted from the critical stimulus. In Experiment 1 (attended ensemble changes), observers attended to ensembles and reported rare changes of their mean orientation, while fixating on a central cross. In Experiment 2 (unattended ensemble changes), participants attended to changes in a central cross and ignored the background ensemble stimuli which also sporadically changed mean orientation. When ensembles were attended, changes in their mean evoked the P3 component, a marker of conscious change detection. When the same ensembles were unattended, no evidence for the vMMN, a marker of automatic discrimination, to ensemble mean changes was found. These results let us suggest that attention is critical for ensemble discrimination.",

A vision scientist has shared their own analysis of the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’ (titled: ‘There is no challenge to our understanding of stereo vision: Response to Linton and Kriegeskorte (ECVP 2024 and ArXiv:2408.00770)’) claiming that the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’ is fully explained by Johnston (1991). I regard Johnston (1991) as one of the most important stereo vision papers in our young (&lt; 200-year-old) field, and so this challenge requires a response. In this paper I explain why Johnston (1991) cannot explain the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’. Indeed, Johnston (1991) makes predictions that are the exact opposite of those observed in the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’. I also highlight a key concern with Johnston (1991)’s account that has so far been overlooked. Johnston (1991)’s account predicts that vergence eye movements will cause massive stereo distortions, leading to a world of unstable stereo perception. But this simply does not reflect our visual experience.",

          "authors": "Bruno Sérgio Dias Oliveira",
          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises—or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Emphasizing theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power while avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. Through this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to offer new insights into the social world and its complexities.",

This paper contributes to this emerging research paradigm by demonstrating how the many-analysts framework can be incorporated into social science methods classes and by pioneering its use in difference-in-differences (DiD) designs. By engaging students in independent DiD analyses on a specific research question, in this case related to local governance, the study uncovers a broad range of effect sizes and diverging conclusions reported by the analysts, highlighting the subjective nature of analytical choices and their potential impact on research outcomes. This variability underscores the importance of critical thinking and methodological rigor in social science education. The implications extend beyond pedagogy, suggesting that causal inference methods with significant researcher discretion such as DiD designs benefit from robustness analysis with multiple independent analysts.",

          "abstract": "Calorie labeling is a popular policy to address the obesity epidemic, but it has had little empirical success. Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic—one of the largest public health issues globally—and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",

          "abstract": "Cultural ecosystem services are non-material benefits people obtain from ecosystems; yet the indirect inspirational values of biodiversity, including both ecosystems and biological organisms, in creative literary works remain underexplored. This study investigated occurrences of biodiversity in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs based on monetary estimation, as an exploration of the inspirational value of biodiversity. I analyzed the lyrics of the top 50 songs from the Japanese CD singles chart over 22 years (1999–2020), extracting nouns related to ecosystems and organisms. The extracted words were classified into ecosystems and taxonomic groups, and the total sales amount of songs related to each class was calculated. Statistical analyses compared the occurrences and total sales amounts of songs containing biodiversity. Finally, I investigated the effect of richness of ecosystems and biological organisms within a song on its sales amount, using generalized linear mixed modeling to assess the prevalence of songs inspired by biodiversity. Out of 1,100 songs, 403 songs included references to ecosystems or biological organisms, with plants being the most frequently mentioned. Ecosystems that are familiar to Japanese people and biological organisms which they frequently encounter in their cultural and daily lives contributed to aesthetic inspiration in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs. Most importantly, I indicated that the existence of a single biological organisms within a song lyric can enhance its sales amount, namely prevalence to people. My result implies that the inclusion of a less well-known biological species within a song can indirectly inspire people, increasing recognition and willingness to conserve it.",

          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive System of Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI – the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "Human and LLM-based annotation of constructs of marginalization such as discrimination or hate speech comes with challenges. One such challenge is coder bias, the systematic variation in annotations driven by individual characterstics. To systematically understand the presence and sources of such biases, we conducted two studies and compared both. In Study 1, we surveyed crowdworkers on marginalization-related characteristics and analyzed their annotations of racism. In Study 2, we assigned personas to LLMs and studied variations in the annotations. Moreover, we compared human and LLM coder bias from a text-level perspective to account for textual properties driving variation. Our findings suggest that being affected by or aware of marginalization causes systematic variation in human annotations, while persona assignment significantly impacts LLM outputs. Against this backdrop, we advocate for ‘inclusive annotation’ which introduces variance by intentionally integrating coders with lived experience or awareness of the constructs, thereby enriching measurement quality.",

In this paper, we use a massive dataset of Anglophone fiction (over 23,000 books) and the tools of natural language processing to understand whether the long-term change of topics in books is driven by the individual change of authors or by the cohort turnover in author populations. To answer this question, we borrow a method from evolutionary ecology: decomposition analysis based on the Price equation. To prove the suitability of this method, we first apply it to simulated data and show that it does allow distinguishing between these two processes. Afterwards, we decompose the temporal trajectories of topics and measure the relative effects of the arrival of newcomer authors (entrances), the retirement of authors (exits), and the change of topic preferences during authors’ lifetimes (individual change). We find that cohort turnover is a stronger force than individual change. Within the cohort effects, the effect of entrances is almost twice stronger than the effect of exits. Using simulated data, we discover that this difference stems from the unequal lengths of authors’ careers.",

          "authors": "Yuning Liu; Matt Motta; Amanda Yarnell",
          "abstract": "Background: Social media platforms like TikTok are pivotal for mental health communication (MHC), providing accessible, trusted content. Despite known benefits of creator training programs in improving content quality, it's uncertain if or how these enhancements affect people who watch that content. This study examines how training programs for TikTok creators influence TikTok users’ mental health knowledge construction and intended behaviors by analyzing user comments on TikTok videos.\n\nMethod: We employed LLM-assisted content analysis to annotate TikTok video comments for mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions. We then analyzed the impact of a creator training program on users' mental health knowledge construction through within-subject field experiments. Additionally, we extended this method to measure how TikTok's Mental Health Awareness Month (MHAM) in May 2023 affected user mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions.\n\nResults: LLM-assisted analysis showed that asynchronous toolkits significantly enhance mental health knowledge construction among video commenters, particularly among creators with high engagement, fewer followers, who are licensed mental health professionals, or  who do not offer paid coaching services. MHAM increased mental health knowledge construction among users, though the audiences of the 7 institutions and 10 content creators that were spotlighted by TikTok during MHAM did not show this effect.\n\nConclusions: Asynchronous toolkits improve mental health knowledge construction among video viewers. Future training should focus on emerging creators and separate toolkit learning from conference training to enhance training efficacy. In addition, promoting hashtags such as #MentalHealthAwareness can drive meaningful discussions and knowledge construction in video comments, but there is an opportunity for platforms to refine their creator selection criteria to improve on-platform mental health knowledge construction.",

          "abstract": "The Court of Justice frequently redrafts the questions submitted to it by the national courts in the \ncontext of the preliminary reference procedure. The practice is known as reformulation, and \noftentimes determines a change to the substance of the question, which is referred to in this article as  substantial reformulation. The Court justifies its use in the need to provide a useful answer to the \nnational court. This article empirically investigates how the Court uses the submissions of the parties \nand other materials in the case to substantially reformulate. To do so, it builds a framework of analysis  to observe the possible influence of the parties in the changes to the dispute and the justifications used  by the Court. The analysis relies on a unique dataset of 380 hand-coded preliminary rulings on interpretation.\nThe findings confirm that substantive reformulation at the Court is frequent and significant. In \nreformulating the dispute, the Court draws on the materials submitted by the parties, and their \ninfluence can be traced to the questions actually replied to by the Court. Yet, the influence of the \nparties in setting the boundaries of the dispute must not be overstated, as it remains fully within the \nCourt’s control when to reformulate and which materials to use to do so. Furthermore, it is difficult \nto identify patterns in the Court’s use of substantial reformulation. Providing a sufficient answer is a \nconvenient excuse, but it does not seem to fully explain the findings of the article. The article explores other possible explanations for the increasingly frequent revert to reformulation.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a novel statistical framework for modeling systems of potentially overlapping subgroups in cross-sectional network data, adhering to prior assumptions about the mean and variance of the number of actors per subgroup and the number of subgroups per actor. A stationary two-mode Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model is specified to obtain the distribution of actors' memberships in subgroups. Subgroups emerge from actors' decisions to join one or more subgroups. Cohesion of these subgroups is modeled by actors' strong preference to be in the same subgroups as their network contacts. The model is estimated using the Method of Moments, with target statistics derived from the prior assumptions. Evaluation statistics are defined to measure the cohesion and variability of the generated systems of subgroups. As a proof of concept, we model cohesive subgroups in a high-school friendship network, where students are assumed to belong to unobserved peer groups. The results indicate that actors form cohesive subgroups of varying composition, characterized by denser overlaps when actors prefer multiple memberships with their network contacts.",

Homelessness has increased especially in areas with greater shortages of affordable private rental housing (relative to demand from low income households). \n\nThe research, ‘The changing geography of homelessness in Australia (2001–21) and its structural drivers’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from Swinburne University of Technology, Launch Housing and RMIT University, investigates the changing geography of homelessness in Australia from 2001 to 2021 and the role of structural factors, such as poverty and supplies of affordable rental housing, in shaping this geography. \n\nHomelessness was also higher in areas with smaller supplies of social housing relative to demand. The research suggests that an increase in social housing will further significantly reduce homelessness.\n\nIn areas with a greater shortage of affordable rental dwellings, a higher percentage of Specialist Homelessness Service clients are returning for support after having been assisted. As the majority of people experiencing homelessness tend to remain in the same area, localised responses to homelessness are really important. Homelessness services and affordable housing options need to be expanded in areas where they are needed, and not just where existing services are located.\n\nIn order to provide housing to clients who accessed a Specialist Homelessness Service in 2021–22, the research estimated that around 158,000 one- to two-bedroom dwellings and 25,000 three-or-more-bedroom dwellings are needed nationally. These dwellings must be affordable and available to households with the lowest incomes.",

          "authors": "Michael Jacob",
          "abstract": "Neuroscience is traditionally considered a branch of biology, with interdisciplinary influences from a wide range of fields including psychology, computer science, engineering and mathematics. As a result, a computational approach to neuroscience has emerged that analyzes human brain activity as the superposition of signals that yield complex rhythms and nonlinear dynamics. The computational approach assumes that normative properties, such as value, meaning and purpose, that are highly relevant to humanity are somehow emergent from these otherwise mechanical interactions. Here, I propose that brain dynamics reflect an organic whole that, in the words of Iain McGilchrist, is “inextricably linked with values, meaning and purpose.” This proposal suggests that brain activity can be investigated as a “kind of music:” a global, emotive form, the shape of which contains nested information regarding vital physiology and embodied emotionality. Using electroencephalography (EEG) as an example, and drawing on the field of musicology, I review historical and recent evidence that reveals how neurodynamics can be seen more like music or an artistic creation: multi-scale, context sensitive, dynamically evolving, and intrinsically meaningful. This “neurodynamics of music” hypothesis is investigated using a geometric framework that includes rhythms and nonlinear dynamics, but where those properties must be understood in the context of the vital metabolism of living organisms. Vital, homeostatic and emotional signals underpin the recurrent play of anticipation and fulfillment in life, brain activity and from which, differentiated meaning is sculpted from the global whole. Neuroscience can benefit from the tools of the humanities informing its analytic methods, theoretical assumptions and interpretive frameworks. Through reengagement with the musical heart of neurodynamics, we may be more inclined to see our brains, our minds, and ourselves, as creatively meaningful, purposeful and alive.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive focus on the rise in midlife mortality in the U.S. in recent years, the implications of this trend for children’s exposure to parental death—or bereavement—remain minimally explored. In this study, we introduce a new approach to estimate trends in children’s exposure to co-resident parental death in the U.S over the past 25 years (1999-2023). Our methodological approach relies on a fusion model and data simulation that joins recent population and mortality data to estimate children’s exposure to co-resident parental death. The results reveal a subtle rise in parental death each year since the early 2010s: in 2023 alone, more than 300,000 children experienced a co-resident parent’s death. The results further demonstrate that the long-running, steady increase in the annual number of parentally bereaved children accumulates to more than 2.4 million children under 18 in 2023 having ever experienced a parent’s death—representing approximately 3.2% of the child population. The results further demonstrate race and ethnic disparities, with non-Hispanic Indigenous children especially at risk of parental death. Together, the results attest to the need for a comprehensive policy response to support parentally bereaved children, and the need for further scholarly recognition of this uniquely consequential childhood adversity.",

          "abstract": "Accurately predicting football match outcomes is valuable for stakeholders such as fans, analysts, sports betting companies, and team strategists. In this study, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for predicting football match results by transforming numerical features into contextual inputs. Key features include historical match results, player ratings, coach ratings, and other relevant conditions, which are processed by the LLM to predict the match winner. We compare the performance of LLM-based predictions with traditional machine learning (ML) models, including random forest and XGBoost. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs achieve comparable accuracy to these conventional ML techniques. Additionally, the LLM offers a significant advantage in that it requires no model training, simplifying implementation and reducing computational costs. This makes LLMs a promising, resource-efficient alternative for football match prediction, presenting new opportunities for AI-driven sports analytics.",

          "title": "Analysing A Selection of Family Policies from the Perspective of Resilience",
          "authors": "Mary Daly; Merve Uzunalioglu; Holly Shorey",
          "abstract": "This report undertakes an analysis of social policy provision in the six rEUsilience countries from the perspective of resilience and the role of social policy. The analyses are based on a theoretical framework which defines resilience as families’ capacity to adjust to situations of risk without negative outcome and interprets social policy as having both protective functions, such as support available throughout family-based transitions, and promotive functions, such as adequate income support, in affecting the conditions for families to be resilient. The report prioritises the protective aspects. It therefore considers how policy supports transitions for all parents between care and employment and how policy treats three particular types of family situation that the research identifies as needing extra support: parenting alone, caring for a children with a disability or illness, and coping with a migrant background. Consequently, five areas of policy are analysed: parenting-related leaves, early childhood education and care (ECEC), provisions for lone-parent families, provisions for families coping with a disability or illness on the part of a child, and provisions for families with a migration background adjusting or integrating into the new country.\n\nIn response to the question of the extent to which the national and EU policy systems support families to be resilient, the analysis highlights a number of important findings. First, some policy fields seem to be better equipped, or further along the road, than others in helping families to be resilient. The policies oriented to transitions - parental leaves and ECEC – generally seem to be better developed then those for family situations with heightened risk. Second, conditions that exclude people from benefits and services reduce policies’ effectiveness (from a resilience as well as other perspectives). Third, where the EU has set legal benchmarks most countries meet them, and so the significance of the EU as a policy agent is confirmed. But where the EU only makes ‘soft recommendations’, they do not seem to penetrate deeply into the national systems. Fourth, the recognition that some families need more has not fully penetrated the policy systems. One big issue is that of equivalence in support for lone-parent families vis-à-vis those with two parents. The dearth of information on and system knowledge about certain types of families, especially those coping with child illness and migrant families, is a general weakness found across countries.",

          "authors": "Peter Søgaard Jørgensen; Louis Delannoy; Sofia Maniatakou; Carl Folke; Michele-Lee Moore; Pero Olsson",
          "abstract": "Social and environmental challenges are combining to form a polycrisis with potential to delay or reset many sustainability efforts. These risks raise questions about what capacities will be needed for advancing sustainability during a time of interlinked crises. Here, we evaluate the adequacy of adaptive and transformative capacities for navigating the polycrisis. Specifically, we perform a rapid assessment of their potential for addressing the 14 recently proposed Anthropocene traps. We find that ten Anthropocene traps have characteristics that challenge in total 17 of 23 adaptive and transformative capacities. On the other hand, 10 of 23 capacities - with an overrepresentation of transformative capacities - have general potential to prevent formation and progress of traps. Coevolutionary struggles between the expression of a capacity and the progression of traps are widespread. Importantly, transformative and adaptive capacities complement each other in the types of Anthropocene traps they most frequently address, with transformative capacities targeting global traps and adaptive capacities the emergent structural traps related to connectivity and pace of change. We end by proposing five unifying processes that can serve as an organizing framework for consideration of other sustainability and crisis capacities.",

          "title": "Estimating Unknown Cut-points in Regression Discontinuity and Kink Designs",
          "authors": "Benjamin F. Reese",
          "abstract": "Regression discontinuity designs (RDD) and regression kink designs (RKD) are popular identification strategies across the social sciences. The relatively weak assumptions required for identifying a causal effect with RDD/RKDs make the designs attractive quasi-experimental methods for causal inference. One limitation of RDD/RKDs is that they rely on an exogenously given and previously known treatment rule. To overcome this limitation, economists (Porter &amp; Yu 2015, Hansen 2017, Boehnke &amp; Bonaldi 2019, and Tanu 2020) and computer scientists (Herlands et al. 2018) have begun to develop methods and tests that can find unknown discontinuities. However, these tests are either largely theoretically focused, computationally intensive, inconvenient to implement, or otherwise do not fit the specific needs of applied political scientists. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel, more flexible, and extremely easy to implement approach to estimate unknown cut-points in both RDDs and RKDs. It is the first method that can detect unknown thresholds in both RDDs and RKDs. I call this method the unknown cut-point regression discontinuity/kink design (UCRDD/UCRKD). It works by uniformly dividing an assignment variable into quantiles to create a distribution of “candidate” cut-points. Each candidate threshold is then tested in a RDD model (Imbens &amp; Kalyanaraman 2012) to find the “best” cut-point, the cut-point that has the largest substantive effect and highest degree of statistical significance. Researchers can use UCRDD/UCRKD to find “tipping-points” in behavior; to determine obscured or non-public policy criteria; and as a diagnostic tool to determine if there are other significant thresholds in their traditional RDD/RKD. In the application section, I apply UCRKD to assess how to define the concept of a minority district and to estimate the treatment effect of minority districts on electoral support for minority candidates.",

          "abstract": "As the concept of polycrisis gains popularity among academics, policy-makers, and the general public, many questions linger about the utility, scope, and applicability of the term in different contexts. Building on prior work, we argue that crises can fruitfully be understood as existing along a spectrum, characterized by multiple different factors, with our modern polycrisis at one extreme. We illustrate this by surveying three historical periods with varying geographical scope – late 1st-millennium CE Mesoamerica, Late Medieval Eurasia, and the early modern Northern Hemisphere – arguing that these exhibited many, but not all, of the key characteristics that make up a polycrisis. We detail the experience of individual societies during these periods, focused on regions to highlight how stresses and dysfunction across multiple systems combined to produce devastating impacts and contrast these with the relatively mild experiences of others facing the same conditions. We highlight how the interaction of stresses across ecological, economic, social, and political systems produced disasters that further deepened these crises and so led to yet more disasters and further devastation. We illustrate how viewing these historical periods through a polycrisis lens can not only inform our understanding of the past but can produce valuable lessons for our modern world. The multi-faceted, far-reaching, and devastating consequences of our current polycrisis should not be viewed as entirely a recent phenomenon. Ultimately, we argue that studying historical polycrises as we do here can help us learn lessons from the past that allow us to hone strategies for addressing the comparable issues we face today and will continue to contend with for the foreseeable future.",

Many older adults receive home care, but the nature of the support varies from country to country. This Forum Article considers how home care is defined, its scope and purpose and how services are shaped by the systems in which they operate. Systematic data collection in home care services already exists in some countries, while in many others, such as the UK, it is being planned. Defining data requirements for home care is critical to evaluation of care quality and cross-country comparisons. Data have the potential to play an important role in shaping perceptions of home care.  For information to be useful, we require a shared understanding of what constitutes home care, what people want and need from a service and which data should be captured.",

          "authors": "Goro Takahashi",
          "abstract": "Background: The conventional formula for calculating food self-sufficiency cannot cover all the food we eat on a daily basis, and the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of each country cannot be calculated. The conventional food self-sufficiency ratio (CFSSR) can only calculate the FSSRs of each country for grains. To determine the actual state of food insecurity worldwide as accurately as possible, a method for calculating the FSSR of each country for all the foods we eat on a daily basis is needed. To address this situation, this study proposes the supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio (SSFSSR), which can be used to systematically calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of all foods in all countries/regions.\n\nResults: We compared the results of both calculations under the same conditions and used the same data to determine whether the CFSSR or the SSFSSR is a more suitable method for obtaining basic information and formulating measures of global food security. The results showed that the SSFSSR has advantages and practicality over the CFSSR. The SSFSSR can calculate self-sufficiency ratios for all foods in all countries/regions of the world, and the figures for various statistical tests are better. The food that is the subject of the calculation in the SSFSSR formula is the entire supply from production, distribution, storage, and consumption, excluding duplication in the calculation, and includes primary products required to produce secondary products, such as livestock products and edible oils. The study also highlighted the value of reducing the amount of primary products used to produce secondary products such as livestock and edible oils, thereby lowering the primary product conversion rate (PPCR).\n\nConclusion: This study used actual data to estimate the SSFSSR for each country/region to demonstrate the applicability of this method and that lowering the PPCR would lead to an increase in the food self-sufficiency ratio. To further refine this methodology, we find that the most important tasks for the future are to collect more reliable data on calories per weight for a large number of foods, expand the number of types covered by more reliable PPCRs, and analyze those data.",

          "abstract": "Supply of more housing options for people on social housing waiting lists should be given increased priority, as longer wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing creates further mental health challenges for applicants already facing increased health needs, according to new AHURI research.\n\nThe research, ‘The role of housing providers in supporting clients with complex needs’, was undertaken for AHURI by researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Tasmania. It investigates the current challenges in providing social housing to people with complex support needs and considers potential alternative policy responses. \n\nMental health was identified at the centre of many clients’ health needs. Longer social housing wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing was seen as increasing mental health challenges for clients. An increasingly uncertain and expensive rental market was also recognised as exacerbating the issues.\n\nAt the simplest service response, connecting people to secure housing helped their mental health. Indeed, social housing providers may be the first and only point of contact that clients with unmet mental health needs have with the service system.\n\nDeveloping the housing service providers’ workforce could improve the effectiveness of support provided to people with multiple support needs, together with providing individual casework support for with clients to helping people navigate support networks, including ensuring that clients are designated as priority clients on social housing registries. \n\nThe provision of secure, genuinely affordable housing for people with low and moderate incomes would reduce the pressure on social housing registries. Affordable housing rents need to be reviewed and set based on percentage of income formulae, rather than setting rents as a percentage of market rents.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the potential of multimodal large language models (LLMs) for plant species identification and educational enrichment. Using an annotated dataset focused on fungi, particularly those classified as edible or non-edible, we implement a practical application that allows users to upload plant images. The LLM then identifies the species, determines its edibility, and provides detailed information on its characteristics. For edible species, the model offers culinary insights and preparation methods, while also delivering comprehensive educational content on plant ecology and cultural significance. Our approach showcases the ability of LLMs to bridge image recognition with rich, text-based knowledge, facilitating an interactive learning experience that promotes plant literacy and practical understanding. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLMs in educational tools and their potential to enhance public awareness of plant species, including fungi, through visual and contextual data fusion.",
