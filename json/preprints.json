          "authors": "Maxwell Semonian Vetter",
          "abstract": "The Hollywood Apocalypse Film and its tropes ultimately represent a genre interested in translating the horrors of colonial violence (mass murder, destruction and theft of land, forced internment) to an audience which both likely has not experienced said violence and potentially is not even aware of how it has directly benefitted their lives. This essay, however, examines the Indigenous Apocalypse Film, a rapidly developing countermovement to this genre, where members of indigenous and colonized communities create their own apocalyptic narratives reflective of their collective experience and history. The essay examines two prominent themes found in many of these films: the Apocalypse as allegory for indigenous trauma, and the reclamation of indigeneity as a tool of liberation.",

          "authors": "Musa al-Gharbi",
          "abstract": "On its face, journalism is a project that requires humble inquiry: reporters have to speak on matters that are fluid, complex, dynamic, and ambiguous – they have to turn in the “first draft of history” even as the “facts” continue to evolve. They must also convey “the facts” in a manner that is concise, compelling, and accessible to non-specialized audiences, often working under tight deadlines, and engaging with stakeholders who have their agendas, which may diverge from those of the readers, the publication, or the journalists themselves. Put simply, this is very difficult work. And “getting it right” often requires a willingness to check one’s assumptions, recognize and admit errors, and subordinate one’s vision and preferences to those of editors and audiences. This chapter will describe some failures and opportunities of news media to promote humble inquiry. It will discuss how journalists may foster HI in their own work and how journalists can encourage HI in their readers.",

          "authors": "Jesica Formoso; Nicolas Palopoli; Irene Vazano; Paz Míguez; Julián Buede; María Cristina Nanton; D.I. Burin; Laura Acion",
          "abstract": "Open Science (OS) has gained prominence as a framework for more transparent and equitable research, but few studies have directly examined the barriers faced by researchers in Latin America. Understanding these obstacles is crucial not only to systematize the challenges to OS implementation but also to design and evaluate targeted training initiatives that address them. In this study, we combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the perspectives of Spanish-speaking researchers participating in an OS training program. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses allowed us to categorize perceived barriers into four domains: cultural resistance and perceived risks, knowledge and training gaps, structural limitations, and institutional constraints. Quantitative analyses using cumulative link mixed models revealed that participation in the training was associated with significant increases in knowledge and implementation of OS practices, along with higher ratings of their perceived importance. Together, these results show that training interventions can help mitigate some of the reported barriers, while also providing systematic evidence to guide policies and institutional reforms needed for sustainable OS adoption in the region.",

          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "This paper contributes to meta-research on how clinical claims should be made transparent, reproducible, and auditable under open-science practices. We present a transferable Evidence–Values–Accountability (EVA) framework and use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a testbed to analyze how research evidence, patient values, and institutional accountability can be structurally linked without endorsing specific therapies. The framework operationalizes transparency through repository-ready artifacts—checklists, prompt-preservation templates, preregistration pathways, and workflow logs—that document reasoning, evidence weighting, consent/risk communication, and human oversight. We map EVA to reporting and oversight elements (e.g., data availability, AI-use disclosure, and referral criteria) to reduce ambiguity at the research–practice interface and to improve meta-evaluation of clinical narratives. CAM is analytically useful because heterogeneity, cultural framing, and evidence gaps make reproducibility and governance challenges salient; recent AI-amplified misinformation (e.g., a bromism case) further illustrates why provenance and disclosure matter. Although demonstrated on CAM, the framework is domain-agnostic and intended for broader health research. By foregrounding research transparency and accountability rather than therapeutic claims, this work advances meta-research on how clinical knowledge is generated, communicated, and audited within open science, and offers concrete tools that health systems and journals can adopt.",

          "authors": "Daniel Brown; Riley Scott; Renee Ireland; Jacqueline Harness; Daniel John Phipps; Jacob J Keech",
          "abstract": "Social media use has become a near-universal feature of modern life, offering many opportunities for connection and self-presentation. Yet, certain patterns of use have been implicated in poorer psychological outcomes. Further, evidence suggests that individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may be particularly drawn to certain social media behaviours as a means of coping with distress. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties predict patterns of social media use and, in turn, symptoms of depression and anxiety. We examined four distinct types of social media use: (1) image management-based, (2) social comparison-based, (3) negative engagement-based, and (4) passive consumption-based. Sampling 548 adults aged 18 to 84 years (Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.37; 401 (73.2%) female; 128 (23.2%) male), we tested a structural equation model to examine whether the four distinct types of social media use mediated links between difficulties in emotion regulation at Time 1 and depression and anxiety symptomology at Time 2, one week later. Results suggested that, when controlling for age, difficulties in emotion regulation significantly predicted all types of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety over one week. Only comparison-based social media use predicted anxiety symptoms over time, with no other types of social media use significantly predicting these symptoms. The model explained 50.1% of the variance in depression symptoms and 52.1% of the variance in anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest the critical importance of emotion regulation over and above social media use in shaping mental health.",

          "authors": "Lisa-Maria Tanase; Lucia A. Reisch; Malte Dewies; Lee de-Wit",
          "abstract": "This study tested whether Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom misread public support for climate policies and whether this perception gap can be corrected. Given MPs’ central role in shaping policy direction, underestimation of public support for climate action could carry serious consequences for climate progress and for representative democracy, but remains understudied. In an online survey–experiment with current MPs (N=100), participants’ estimated support for four climate policies under both neutral and cost-salient descriptions were compared with nationally representative polling. MPs significantly underestimated public support, and underestimated public willingness to accept financial impacts of climate policies. This study also offered novel evidence that MPs exaggerated partisan polarisation and formed significantly larger underestimation of support among Conservative voters. Offering original evidence of Spiral of Silence in Parliament, lower perceived support was associated with lower willingness to advocate for a pricing policy. Results indicated significantly larger underestimation of public support in politicians opposed to a climate policy, but even supportive politicians underestimate on average. Bayesian estimation suggested a moderate effect of a norm-based intervention on underestimation reduction, although results were inconclusive under frequentist tests. These findings suggest that misperceptions of others’ preferences within Parliament are structured in a way that can actively discourage climate advocacy, by presenting public opinion on climate policy as weaker and more polarised than it is. By highlighting gaps between public demand and elite perception, the study identifies a tractable barrier to climate action and democratic responsiveness.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: People hold general beliefs about the world called primals (e.g., the world is Safe, Intentional), which are strongly linked to individual differences in personality, behavior and mental health. How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs. \nMETHOD: In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data was compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic. \nRESULTS: The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American. \nCONCLUSION: Primals were remarkably stable during the initial shock wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic, supporting a view of primals as stable lenses through which people interpret the world.",

          "abstract": "Sexuality is central to well-being, relationships, and health. Yet, the science of well-being has traditionally overlooked the topic. To assess whether this gap persists, we conducted a large-scale content analysis of three leading well-being journals. We scraped all abstracts published up to September 2024 (n = 3,094), then used large language models (GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0) for systematic screening. Articles flagged as potentially relevant were reviewed manually. Only 18 articles (0.6%) substantively focused on the topic. Out of these, 8 (0.3%) addressed topics related to minority groups, 6 (0.2%) negative aspects of sexuality such as abuse, and 4 (0.1%) general positive or neutral aspects. Sexuality remains underexplored in well-being science. Integrating it is essential for a complete understanding of human flourishing. We call for a paradigm shift: to move beyond silence toward a research agenda that embraces sexuality as a vital dimension of well-being.",

          "authors": "Christopher N. Wahlheim; Geoff Ward; Samuel Cox",
          "abstract": "Memory for an earlier event can be impaired by later studying a related event (retroactive interference). However, when later events cue retrievals of earlier events that also enable integrative encoding, memory for the earlier event can be enhanced (retroactive facilitation). Two experiments using continuous A-B, A-C paired-associate tasks examined retroactive memory effects across lags and retention intervals. We indexed study-phase retrieval and integrative encoding by examining associations between awareness of changes and memory for first responses. Participants studied A-B, A-C, and retention-interval-matched A-B pairs and indicated when they detected response changes. The lag between A-B and A-C and the retention interval between A-C and test trials varied factorially across 4, 16, and 48 intervening items. Cued-recall test formats differed: Experiment 1 prompted direct retrieval of first responses, with participants reporting recollected changes. Experiment 2 used modified-modified free recall in which participants reported responses as they came to mind and indicated whether they were the first, second, or only responses; the first two decisions indicated recollection of changes. Both experiments showed the greatest retroactive facilitation at the longest retention interval and intermediate lag. Retroactive facilitation co-occurred with and was statistically associated with detection and recollection of changes, suggesting these processes contributed to the observed effect. Negatively curvilinear, non-monotonic lag functions occurred for A-B, A-C recall at the longest retention interval and were associated with detected changes, especially those not recollected. These findings may be accounted for by a memory-for-change framework with a role for contextual variability that determines study-phase retrieval success.",

          "authors": "Tania Rosiles; Melissa Nguyen; Irina Calin-Jageman; Robert Calin-Jageman",
          "abstract": "Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription.  What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten?  And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory?  To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica.  Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible.  We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017).  Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018).  Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust.  Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting.  Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression.  We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale, cross-cultural research on character requires brief measurement instruments that are psychometrically sound and invariant across cultures. Currently, no measure of character meets all these prerequisites. In this study, we developed the Big Three-Mini, a nine-item instrument designed to assess the three fundamental dimensions of character — heart, mind, and will — based on McGrath's Big Three of Character model. Using data from 27,000 participants across 27 countries, items were selected from the VIA Inventory of Strengths using Ant Colony Optimization to maximize cross-cultural measurement invariance. The resulting Big Three-Mini demonstrated metric invariance across all but one country comparison and scalar invariance across nearly half of them. Exploratory analyses using World Values Survey indicators revealed meaningful associations between the Big Three-Mini dimensions and national well-being. These findings demonstrate that metaheuristic optimization can produce a concise, cross-culturally comparable measure of character, providing a practical tool for international studies on values and flourishing.",

          "authors": "Angel V Jimenez; Lei Chang; Keith Jensen; Hui Jing Lu; Alex Mesoudi",
          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, aka cumulative cultural evolution, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to engage in costly innovation, and whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing, and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was not possible, preferences for information sharing declined to comparable levels as non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Affective valence and reinforcement learning (RL) are increasingly recognized to be closely connected, yet the exact nature of their relationship remains unclear. Here, we investigated how RL-related computations contribute to affective valence and how affective valence contributes to RL. Applying an original computational method, we found that affective experience during RL is best explained by a combination of three prominent theoretical perspectives: valence is determined by reward, prediction errors, and counterfactual comparisons. To account for these findings, we hypothesized that the valence of affective responses represents (i.e., encodes, tracks) the value of the eliciting stimulus, and contributes to RL alongside reward per se. We confirmed this hypothesis across three RL tasks, showing that decision-makers prefer choice options associated with more positive affect in addition to preferring options associated with greater reward. Altogether, our results establish a unifying model of the valence-RL relationship with key implications for the mechanisms of affective experience and human RL. Moreover, they validate a powerful new computational framework for future research on these topics.",

          "authors": "Steven Verheyen; Tom Heyman",
          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

Higher-order (HO) theories of consciousness seek to explain how mental states that are conscious differ from those that are not.  That would tell us what it is for a mental state to be conscious.  All HO theories rest on the commonsense observation that whenever a mental state is conscious, one is in some way aware of being in that state.  So they see awareness of being in a mental state as a necessary condition for that state to be conscious.  The reliance on this condition distinguishes HO theories from other theories of consciousness.  There are several versions of a HO theory, which differ mainly in how they explain our awareness of mental states when those states are conscious.",

Using LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), we assess these primary emotional responses that characterize conflict-related discourse. Our analysis includes tweets from the U.S., East and West European NATO countries, Ukraine, and Russia. Tweet volume spiked initially but stabilized by week ten. Results show that anger consistently exceeded fear across all regions, indicating that the conflict primarily evoked mobilizing rather than paralyzing emotional responses. Russia showed substantially lower levels of both emotions than other regions, while no significant differences emerged among the U.S., NATO countries, and Ukraine despite their varying proximity to the conflict. This analysis offers a nuanced understanding of how fear and anger shape regional emotional responses to ongoing international conflict.",

Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "authors": "Katarina Kliit; Uku Vainik; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

This study examined HIV stigma among 260 health care providers in Türkiye, comparing HIV care providers with other professionals. Measures included HIV knowledge and training, fear of infection, observed stigma, stigmatizing attitudes, intention to discriminate, and facility policies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated the Turkish stigma scale, and chi-square tests compared stigma indicators between groups. Stigmatizing attitudes and fear of infection were prevalent across all participants. HIV care providers had higher knowledge and training but still exhibited discriminatory practices. Policies reinforcing stigma, such as testing without consent and differential treatment protocols, were commonly reported. Structural interventions, anti-discrimination policies, and targeted stigma-reduction training are needed to foster institutional change and ensure equitable care for people with HIV.",

When we face our social partners, what is upright to one person might be upside down to the other, and what is on one’s left would be the other’s right. In five experiments (N = 318), we investigated whether 3- to 4-year-old children appreciate others’ distinct visual experiences when engaged in social actions. Specifically, we presented children with pictures and books that were initially upright to them, and we asked children to show those pictures and books to people who faced the children (i.e., whose perspectives on the pictures and books were opposite those of the children). Across experiments, we found that young children spontaneously oriented pictures and books so that those objects appeared upright to their social partners. Whereas classic research suggests that young children are egocentric, these findings suggest that young children are sensitive to the visual experiences of their social partners. These findings support the possibility that, from early in development, children engage in mental state reasoning to better cooperate with and communicate to their social partners.",

          "authors": "Ingo Landwehr; Katrin Landwehr; Alexander F. Schmidt",
          "abstract": "In a pilot study using mouse tracking, men’s interpretation and weighting of global sexual (e.g., clothing style) and specific affective (e.g., facial expression) cues when judging women’s flirting intentions depended on two factors: (1) whether the men were sexually aroused and (2) whether the women’s sexual and affective cues were congruent or incongruent. Both reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) emerged as significant indicators of men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) in the context of sexual flirting, as evidenced by their positive correlations with self-report trait measures of interpersonally problematic (e.g., disinhibited, exploitative) sexuality. In the present study, we sought to replicate these findings in a substantially larger sample, using a simplified key-press paradigm and focusing solely on RT and ER as dependent variables. In a preregistered online study with heterosexual men (N = 284), experimentally induced sexual arousal again increased the likelihood of OGC as a function of task difficulty, i.e., the (in)congruence between global sexual and specific affective cues displayed by a potential female flirting partner. While the main and interaction effects were replicated and a meaningful pattern of correlations emerged between the experimental measures and self-report measures of dispositional risk factors for sexually problematic behavior, a somewhat different moderation pattern by these individual differences was observed. Taken together, the simplified paradigm proved largely successful and appears promising for diagnostic applications in forensic and clinical contexts.",

This study took a within-person perspective to explore their day-to-day relations and the moderating role of self-transcendence values in strengthening such associations.\nMethod: We employed a daily diary design and recruited 60 Italian young adults (Mean Age = 25.8; SD = 3.6; Women = 58%) who reported their behavior once a day over 21 days.\nResults: Using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling, we found no significant day-to-day spillover effect of PB and PEB. However, we identified significant same-day positive associations, namely, on days when individuals engaged in PB, they also showed higher than usual levels of PEB. Additionally, we found positive carryover effects in both PB and PEB, suggesting that young adults are likely to persist in their daily prosocial and pro-environmental efforts. No significant cross-level interaction between self-transcendence values and the spillover effect from PB to PEB was found.\nConclusion: The findings provide new insights into young adults’ daily engagement in prosocial and pro-environmental behaviors, highlighting the role of day-to-day within-person changes, while accounting for stable, between-person differences in behavioral and motivational tendencies.\nKeywords: Pro-environmental behavior, Prosocial behavior; Young adults; Experience Sampling Methods; Spillover; Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling.",

          "abstract": "The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model is a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes a modifiable health-determining construct, identity state, defined by three domains hypothesized to all stem from identification of the core self with the physical body: 1) a self-concept that is inclusive of all living beings vs. exclusive based on physical attributes, 2) the perceived basis of the worth of all living beings as intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and 3) the degree of universally compassionate orientation toward all living beings. The identity state construct is theorized to act through modulating stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior to influence the causal relationship between social position-dependent stressors, biological aging, and age-related diseases. The IVP Scale (IVPS) was developed to empirically assess the hypotheses of the IVP framework and the utility of the identity state construct for population health research. This study provides the first description of the psychometric properties of the long (20-item) and short form (12-item) IVPS. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) of data from two separate samples of self-identified Black and White adults (aged 18-81) collected in 2021 and 2025 (total N=2,318). Associations between the IVPS and related constructs of optimism and resilience were examined to establish construct validity. EFA supported a unidimensional structure and CFA confirmed good model fit for both IVPS measures. Both scales are significantly positively correlated with indicators of optimism and resilience and significantly negatively correlated with social dominance orientation. These initial findings suggest the IVPS-20 and the IVPS-Short are valid and psychometrically sound scales.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "Categorizing oneself as a member of a group involves merging ones’ sense of self with the group, such that the self becomes an interchangeable exemplar of the social category (Turner et al., 1987) and self-interest and ingroup interests become interchangeable (Brewer, 2010). Because of this, social identification is associated with ingroup favoritism and behaviors that support the ingroup (Brewer, 1999; Brown, 2000). However, we suggest that some of the variance generally explained by social identification may be better explained by the concept of psychological ownership—feelings of ownership for place (Verkuyten &amp; Martinović, 2017), which implies the right to control use or access (Furby, 1978). In Study 1, I demonstrate the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the South is a better predictor of positive attitudes toward the Confederate battle flag than Southern identification. In Study 2, I provide further evidence of the empirical distinction between social identification and psychological ownership and demonstrate that psychological ownership of the United States is a better predictor of intentions to purchase American-made versus foreign-made products than is national identification.",

          "abstract": "Successful task-switching performance is thought to rely on inhibitory mechanisms suppressing no-longer-relevant tasks, indexed by the n–2 repetition cost. Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "abstract": "To enable human living within planetary boundaries is among the biggest challenges of our time. In this context the question emerges how consuming less can go along with subjective wellbeing. Analysing meaning construction of pro-environmental behaviour might offer insights regarding this relationship. Based on the hierarchical model of meaning the current study aimed to investigate meaning construction of behaviours that mitigate resource consumption which we call sufficiency behaviour. Therefore, we analyzed survey data with N = 544 participants. Path-analysis revealed intrinsic motivation for repairing, curtailment and sharing to be related to hedonic wellbeing and behaviour frequency mediated by ascribed behavioural meaning. Intrinsic motivation did partially regress on altruistic and biospheric values. We found no significant relationship between sufficiency behaviour and life satisfaction or presence of meaning in life. We conclude that finding meaning in behaviour is important for behaviour frequency as well as experienced behavioural wellbeing. Choosing alternatives to buying new products seems to be perceived as meaningful when it is intrinsically motivated. Biospheric and altruistic values might constitute sources for the intrinsic motivation to develop. Taken together, these results illustrate how less consumption might positively connect to wellbeing. Future research should explore ways how meaningfulness of sufficiency behaviour can be fostered.",

Practitioners who had\npublished in peer reviewed journals and/or presented at Association for Contextual\nBehavioral Science conferences on CB supervision in the last 20 years were invited to take\npart in a Delphi study to find consensus: 20 participants provided responses to an open-ended\nonline questionnaire on CB supervision. A reflexive thematic analysis, within a qualitative\nresearch design, was used to interpret common ideas and themes within the data. Through\nanalysis, four main themes were generated: contextual factors, tasks and behaviors,\nsupervision qualities, and supervision purposes. A further round to find consensus was then\nconducted, with participants providing ratings of statements based on these themes in an\nonline survey. Consensus ratings indicated that functional analysis and experiential learning\nmethods appeared to be central to the practice of CB supervision. Overall, participants\ndescribed features of CB supervision, which were both consistent with existing ideas on CB\nsupervision and contextual behavioral science, as well as clinical supervision more broadly.\nThe results serve to inform future research in the area.",

          "abstract": "Cultivated meat is an emerging food innovation with the potential to transform food systems, raising important ethical, social, and sustainability considerations. Including consumer perspectives is essential to understand which cultivated meat attributes drive acceptance and satisfaction, highlighting the need to study specific products rather than the category as a whole. This study presents the first exploratory application of the widely validated Kano model to explore consumer classification of seven key cultivated meat products’ attributes, their impact on satisfaction, and potential differences across dietary groups.   Two products were examined: a cultivated burger and cultivated foie gras, including a willingness-to-try assessment using realistic product images provided by companies. A total of 107 conference attendees representing diverse nationalities and dietary patterns participated. Results indicate that attribute classification differs both within and across products. Price and protein content emerged as attractive attributes for all consumers. Taste parity was valued mainly by meat-eaters for the more familiar burger, while vegan labelling was considered one-dimensional by non-meat-eaters, especially vegans. No must-be attributes were identified, suggesting consumer expectations for cultivated meat are not yet fully formed. Attributes such as appearance resemblance, country of origin, and those drawing policy attention, like labelling products as “meat” or “foie gras”, were largely perceived as indifferent. These findings underscore the product and consumer- specific nature of cultivated meat acceptance \nand the value of incorporating consumer perspectives early in product development. The Kano model proved effective in classifying attributes, providing insights for both theoretical understanding and practical decision-making in this innovative sector.",

The effect of pharmacological treatments on suicide-related outcomes is inconsistent. Although the main approach to evaluate effectiveness, randomised controlled trials may not provide externally valid results for suicide prevention in psychiatric populations. We aimed to synthesise the evidence and assess the medication effects on suicide outcomes from observational studies.\nMethods\nWe systematically searched eight databases from database inception to March 2025 for pharmacoepidemiological and other observational studies on suicide-related outcomes in people treated with the main types of psychotropic medications. We included primary studies involving adults with psychiatric diagnoses who were prescribed medication and a comparison sample with the same diagnosis without prescribed medication (between-individual studies) or the same individuals during a non-prescription period (within-individual studies). We excluded studies that did not report psychiatric diagnoses and selected samples (such as inpatients only). Outcomes were any suicide-related behaviour (self-harm, attempted suicide) and suicide mortality. We pooled effect sizes as odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR) or risk ratios (RR) using random-effects models and assessed study quality. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024515794.\nFindings\nWe identified 47 independent studies from 13 countries based on more than 6 million people (46.6% male). Across main diagnostic categories and 70 individual medications examined, strongest associations with suicide risks were found for second generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (OR range 0.35 to 0.75), lithium and divalproex/valproic acid in bipolar disorder (OR range 0.26 to 1.03), and SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants in depression (OR range 0.47-0.78). Benzodiazepines were associated with higher suicide risks in all diagnostic categories (OR range 1.57-5.47). There was evidence for publication bias for SSRIs in depression, leading to more papers reporting higher risks of suicide-related outcomes.\nInterpretation\nObservational studies suggest a role for psychotropic medication for suicide prevention in certain psychiatric disorders.",

The emotion category model, particularly sadness and disappointment, was consistently associated with neural event boundaries across the cortical hierarchy from early sensory areas to transmodal hubs in the default mode network, and aligned with behavioral segmentation at coarser temporal scales. These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories. Social salience cues, such as “collective presence,” also robustly predicted boundaries, suggesting complementary roles of emotional and social information.

(2022), which investigated the importance of individual and classroom characteristics for students' social integration in secondary mathematics classrooms. The original study showed that performance anxiety in mathematics was negatively related to subjective social integration and that performance self-concept and constructive support from teachers were positively related to social integration. Finally, it was shown that classroom characteristics could moderate these relationships. Teacher support was particularly important for the social integration of students with high achievement anxiety, and to a lesser extent, for the integration of students with low self-concept of mathematics ability. This study replicates and extends these findings. Using data from the IQB Trends in Education Study 2018, in which approximately 44,000 German ninth graders were surveyed, factors related to the operationalization of the constructs were identified that affect the replicability of the original study in this dataset. For this purpose, the replication study used different related measures for the concepts from the original study. Patterns in the effect sizes were identified using exploratory multiverse analyses. Across all analyses, a pattern of results comparable to the original study emerged for the main effects, albeit with smaller effect sizes. The interaction effect from the original study could not be replicated. Reasons for differences between original and replication study were mainly the operationalization of the construct of social integration. We discuss the value of replication studies and how multiverse analyses can be used to speed up the process of knowledge development.",

          "abstract": "Researchers analyzing intensive longitudinal data often aim to detect between-group differences in dynamics of psychological constructs, such as positive and negative affect. These constructs are usually latent (not directly observable). To validly compare groups of individuals in their dynamic processes, the latent constructs must be measured equally across the individuals. If this is not the case – that is, if measurement invariance is violated for some items – this partial non-invariance must be accounted for. Otherwise, the group-specific estimates of the dynamic process may be biased. To aid researchers in obtaining unbiased group-specific estimates despite partial measurement non-invariance, we present an extension of the Three-Step Latent Vector Autoregression, a novel method that separates the estimation of the measurement model and the structural model. We expand this method to multi-group modeling, where differences in structural parameters (e.g., regression coefficients) are captured by allowing these parameters to vary across the groups of individuals. Measurement heterogeneity between and within these groups is captured by group- or person-specific MM parameters. Through two simulation studies, we demonstrate that the method performs well in obtaining correct estimates of a dynamic process despite the presence of measurement heterogeneity. The method is further illustrated with an empirical example.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relationship is a fundamental component in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal components of self-other relationship can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. In this study, we aim to evaluate how individual differences in both intrapersonal and intersubjective traits influence the quality of friendship and the experience of loneliness. We hypothesize that the quality of friendships and the experience of loneliness arise not only from interpersonal factors, but also from distinct intrapersonal features of the individual. We administered a set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis was employed to confirm the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results confirmed that the intrapersonal factor has an important influence on the sociability of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and lockdown-related changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. A mediation analysis further showed that the effect of intrapersonal traits on loneliness was partially mediated by the participants’ friendships. Our results emphasize a central role of self-concept for social life quality. These findings further provide a new perspective for individuals in the general population with low social life quality and possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. Finally, our study also brings potential contributions to the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

          "abstract": "Not all pro-environmental behaviors are created equal—some are vastly more effective at mitigating climate change than others. Do people judge more effective behaviors as proportionally morally superior? This question is important because moral motivations are powerful drivers of individual and collective action. Four studies (N = 5,334; three pre-registered) reveal a robust morality-effectiveness disconnect: Behaviors that rank better on objective climate mitigation potential rank worse on perceived morality. This disconnect is mediated by stronger personal support for less effective behaviors, and is weaker among individuals more interested in learning about environmental impacts. Study 3, a five-country experiment, reveals that explicitly labeling behaviors' impact reduces the disconnect by 68%, but does not eliminate it. Study 4 demonstrates that providing detailed information reverses the disconnect, leading people to judge more effective behaviors as proportionally more moral and increasing policy support relative to less effective behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescent mental health is deteriorating, and identifying those in need is challenging because of flawed assessments, flooded services, and low help-seeking by those most in need. A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

          "abstract": "Statistics anxiety is a persistent barrier for psychology undergraduates, yet little qualitative work has explored how it is experienced in higher education. This study employed semi-structured interviews with twelve psychology students from Scottish universities to examine the lived experiences of statistics anxiety. Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four overarching themes were formulated: (1) Negative Prior Experiences with Mathematics, (2) Misconceptions of Course Content, (3) Fragility and Hypervigilance, and (4) Student-Tutor Interaction. The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt. Tutor communication, class size, and assumptions about baseline competence further shaped students’ experiences, intensifying anxiety. This research provides a nuanced investigation of how students conceptualise statistics in their psychology journey, and offers suggestions and recommendations for applied practice.",

          "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor in the acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), but market data indicate that public trust in AVs remains suboptimal. Of all tested strategies, anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices, has gained attention. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes, from 5903 participants across seven databases, were included.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

          "abstract": "Love Island is a popular reality dating series that has faced significant criticism for consistently casting contestants with highly idealized bodies. There has been widespread concern that these casting choices may inadvertently pressure young viewers to internalize unrealistic body ideals and engage in body change strategies to conform to them. However, to date, no longitudinal research has explored this possibility. Using three-wave panel data collected during the 2023 series of Love Island UK (N = 344; M age = 20.42, SD = 1.98), this study examined the reciprocal within-person relationships between body pressure from watching Love Island and engagement in - or desire to engage in - three body change strategies (i.e., weight loss, muscle gain, cosmetic surgery). Nearly all (97.38%) participants reported at least some degree (i.e., M &gt; 1.00) of body pressure from watching Love Island, and fluctuations in body pressure followed a positive developmental trajectory across the series. Body pressure at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery at the beginning of the series predicted increased body pressure during the series. Results therefore suggest that prolonged exposure to highly idealized bodies on Love Island may harm young viewers’ body image, to the point that many feel compelled to alter aspects of their body.",

          "abstract": "Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness—a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritised emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behaviour than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context‑sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This research investigated how people respond to true and false news, and how the type of social endorsement associated with news posts influences belief and engagement intentions.  Across three experiments (total N = 1084), participants viewed true and false news accompanied by varying levels of positive (likes) and negative (dislikes) endorsement.  Participants were sensitive to post veracity, rating true news as more believable (large effect), and showing greater willingness to like true content, dislike false content and share true content (small effects).  Positive social endorsement by others reliably increased belief, like and share intentions and decreased dislike intentions (small effects).  Negative endorsement reduced belief (Experiment 1) and like intentions and increased dislike intentions (small effects), but had no detectable impact on share intentions.  When negative endorsement was presented alongside high positive endorsement, this reduced belief and like intentions, but only when the negative endorsement level was high, signalling divided opinion.  These findings demonstrate that: 1) veracity has a strong effect on beliefs, and a small effect on engagement and 2) social cues—positive and negative—have a small but significant role in shaping how people evaluate and interact with online news.  Our findings suggest that incorporating a dislike option on social media platforms could improve content evaluation by signalling epistemic rejection, though safeguards may be needed to mitigate risks of misuse.",

Existing CCT models have predominantly focused on unidimensional point truths using dichotomous, polytomous, or continuous response formats. However, certain domains such as risk assessment or interpretation of verbal quantifiers may require a consensus focused on intervals, capturing a range of relevant values. We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses. We then apply the model to empirical judgments of verbal quantifiers.",

          "abstract": "Transsaccadic vision is typically described as the ability to retain and integrate visual information across rapid eye movements (saccades) for the purpose of continuous perception. In this review, we break this down further into two fundamental processes: the cortical mechanisms that maintain extrinsic spatial properties (i.e., location, orientation) versus intrinsic identity cues (i.e., spatial frequency, shape) of objects across saccades. First, we summarize the computational problems associated with transsaccadic vision, emphasizing the need to retain and integrate both extrinsic and intrinsic feature information between fixations for predictive vision. Next, we briefly review psychophysical, neurophysiological, stimulation, and neuroimaging evidence that specific cortical mechanisms exist for these processes. Then, we focus on our recent experiments combining functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation-inspired and functional connectivity approaches. These experiments suggest that parietal cortex (specifically, right supramarginal gyrus) contributes to spatial updating of object orientation, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex (cuneus) supports updating of spatial frequency and object shape. Taken together with the previous literature, this supports the notion that an ‘extended parietal eye field’ is involved in the updating of extrinsic spatial cues, whereas dorsomedial occipital cortex is involved in updating intrinsic cues to object identity, both in communication with the broader functional networks for perception and action. Finally, we synthesize these results in a simple conceptual model for cortical updating and integration of object features and consider the implications for future studies of transsaccadic integration, the ‘binding problem’, and possible clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent screen use is highly heterogeneous, varying across dimensions such as activity type, time spent, purpose, and content exposure, with patterns that may persist or shift over time. However, little is known about how such heterogeneity relates to later psychosocial functioning in everyday life. This study addressed this gap by examining longitudinal trajectories of screen time and media content engagement across adolescence and their associations with day-to-day psychosocial functioning in emerging adulthood. Data were drawn from the Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (z-proso) and its add-on study, Decades-to-Minutes (D2M), which employed ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Parallel latent class growth analysis modelled trajectories of three screen activities (ages 11,13,15,17) and three types of media content exposure (ages 13,15,17,20) in z-proso (n=1521). Daily psychosocial functioning was assessed in the D2M sample at ages 21 (n=255) and 27 (n=451), and associations with adolescent screen-use trajectories were examined using dynamic structural equation modelling (DSEM). Results showed that youth in the high TV/DVD and chatting/surfing, moderate-content group exhibited higher mean levels and variability of daily aggression and aggressive reactivity. The high-use, high-content group displayed greater daily cannabis use, aggressive reactivity, and provocation inertia. The moderate-use, escalating-content group showed higher stress variability, aggression inertia, aggressive reactivity, and cannabis use. The low-use, low-content group consistently displayed the most adaptive daily functioning. These findings underscore the importance of jointly considering adolescent screen time and media content patterns, given the distinct relations of different joint trajectories to (mal-)adaptive dimensions of psychosocial functioning into adulthood.",

To test these hypotheses one hundred and forty-nine undergraduates were randomly assigned to receive either a 5-day mindfulness training intervention or no training (control). Both groups answered physics questions before and directly after the intervention and rated their confidence, anxiety, and difficulty for each question. Mindfulness training led to a greater increase in confidence and a reduction in anxiety among women and non-binary students, but not for men. The intervention also led to a reduction in judgments of difficulty for all students. The association between mindfulness training and self-reported anxiety among women and non-binary students was mediated by reductions in physics threat (measured mid-week using experience sampling). However, physics threat did not mediate any of the other mindfulness training outcomes for confidence or difficulty. The results are discussed in relation to a model of challenge and threat and mindfulness applications.",

We stacked a brief video intervention highlighting sympathetic personal narratives previously shown to decrease political animosity on a multi-hour event, led by MCC Respectful Conversations, that aims to increase empathy and understanding through guided conversations. The idea is that the video intervention would open people up to the lessons of the event. We tested this in a preregistered pre-test post-test experimental design (N = 209, Events k = 10). Although effects for liking and respect for people with different opinions were in the expected direction (b’s range [.02, .05] across inclusion criteria), they were not typically significantly different from zero (p’s range [.03, .26] across inclusion criteria). We also explored if the events improved people’s attitudes in a one-group pre-test post-test design and found evidence that the overall events may be effective.

The home literacy environment (HLE) is observed to relate to brain activation during language and reading tasks; however, whether HLE relates to phonological and semantic functional specialization and sensitivity remains unknown. \nMethod: Using an open-source dataset, the present study examined 33 5–6-year-olds and 76 7–8-year-olds. Data from fMRI sound and meaning judgment tasks were used to examine phonological and semantic functional specialization (contrasting tasks) and sensitivity (comparing conditions within a task). Then, voxel-wise regression analyses were used to test correlations between those brain indexes and HLE (i.e., family-to-child reading, child independent reading) measured using a parent survey. \nResults: We observed weak evidence of phonological specialization at 5 years old and weak evidence of semantic specialization at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. We also observed weak evidence of phonological sensitivity at 5 years old and strong evidence of semantic sensitivity at 7 years old associated with family-to-child reading. Across the cohorts, a progression from temporal to frontal brain regions was observed in those relations, in line with prior literature on language specialization and sensitivity across development. \nConclusions: Overall, our results suggest that HLE is linked to functional specialization and sensitivity, with a relation of family-to-child reading to processing the sound structure of language at 5 years old and meaning at 7 years old. This finding supports the Interactive Specialization theory, which emphasizes the role of environmental inputs in neural specialization.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

Data was collected before randomization, at post-intervention and at four-week follow-up. \nResults: N = 92 participants were recruited, of which n = 46 were allocated to the experimental condition. No signals of indirect effects of condition on any outcome through the five mechanisms (i.e., 95 % confidence intervals included zero) were found. The magnitude of association, however, indicated that the association between EMIcompass and psychological distress may be mediated via pathways through threat anticipation (β = -0.12, 95%CI = -0.30 – 0.03). Further, we observed associations between changes in candidate mechanisms and mental health outcomes.\nConclusions: Although no direct signals of mediation via candidate mechanisms were observed due to lack of power, condition-linked shifts in our candidate mechanisms were associated with mental-health outcomes.

          "authors": "Sebastian Ehmann; Terje Sparby; Daniel M. Ingram; Matthew Sacchet",
          "abstract": "That meditation is similar to mental training is a widely used analogy that seeks to capture the\ngrowth-oriented processes that unfold through the intentional performance of mental activities.\nHowever, despite its intuitive appeal, this notion remains conceptually underdeveloped. To our\nknowledge, no interdisciplinary dialogue has been established with training science—a field\ndedicated to the understanding of training variables and principles. In this paper, we address this\ngap by first providing an overview of foundational principles in exercise science, introducing key\nconcepts such as programming and periodization. Building on this foundation, we outline how\ncore training variables—such as volume, frequency, duration, density, and intensity—can be\nmeaningfully adapted to contemplative training contexts. Among these, we propose training\nintensity, defined as the graded phenomenal presence of specific meditative qualities together with\nthe minimization of counteractive qualities. Referenced against a normative standard, this\nconstruct offers a particularly promising link between objective training metrics of meditative\nexperience and subjective markers of meditative proficiency. We argue that advanced meditation\nentails not only the accumulation of training volume over time but the refinement and mastery of\nspecific skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Finally, we\nsuggest that meditation would benefit from adopting a unified semantic framework and\nsystematically assessing these training variables, thereby enabling more precise, comparable, and\ncumulative analyses across studies. This work represents a first step toward integrating principles\nfrom training science into meditation research, offering novel tools to understand the mechanisms\nand trajectories underlying meditative development.",

It also tests the effects of party cues on the intentions assigned to reformers proposing to alter democratic rules. The results show that (1) the in-party supporters evaluated the intentions to reform checks and balances as benign, whereas the out-party supporters were more vigilant and saw them as malicious; (2) participants were less vigilant of an administrative reform and evaluated it as less ill-intended; (3) these effects held across supporters of different political parties – both incumbent and opposition.

          "abstract": "Reward and punishment learning are critical across multiple clinical populations. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is frequently used to assess these constructs and multiple forms of psychopathology are associated with IGT performance. However, it is not clear whether alterations in IGT performance are general to psychopathology, or specific to different forms of psychopathology. Thus, we examined whether IGT performance was uniquely predicted by anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Overall, our findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Remembering personal events typically involves reconstructing our original first-person perspective, often accompanied by a vivid sense of re-experiencing the past. The angular gyrus (AnG) has been implicated in both perspective reconstruction and subjective memory experience, yet its specific contribution remains unclear. We investigated the role of the AnG across three studies using a behavioural paradigm in which healthy adults (aged 18–35) encoded a naturalistic video. At retrieval, participants judged whether test images matched their original perspective and rated subjective aspects of the experience, including vividness and re-experiencing. In Study 1 (n=42), vividness ratings significantly predicted accurate perspective discrimination. In Study 2 (n=45), offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the AnG significantly enhanced perspective discrimination relative to control stimulation, with richness of visual imagery predicting performance. In Study 3 (n=28), online rTMS to the AnG produced a non-significant impairment in discrimination, suggesting possible disruption. Re-experiencing ratings predicted successful discrimination of first-person perspective scenes, particularly under AnG stimulation. Across these studies, we show that the AnG supports memory for encoded perspective and contributes to subjective aspects of episodic retrieval. The direction of its influence may depend on stimulation timing and its interaction with broader cortical networks involved in self-referential processing and memory reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "Despite urgent need for sustainable solutions, many individuals resist sustainability innovations such as plant-based diets or genetically modified organisms. This sustainability behavior gap stems partly from misaligned risk perceptions: individuals rely on heuristics that generate cognitive biases, whereas experts use statistical probabilities. Existing interventions often fail to produce lasting effects because they neglect underlying cognitive drivers of risk perception. We introduce rebiasing, a novel strategy that leverages cognitive biases to realign risk perceptions. Across seven studies (N = 2,213), we show that (1) opposing heuristics and biases can neutralize each other, reverting perceptions to baseline; (2) rebiasing can be tailored to individuals with either high or low risk perceptions to better align with expert views; and (3) adjusted perceptions influence downstream sustainability behaviors, though context-dependently. Our findings advance theory on bias interaction and offer actionable insights for marketers, policymakers, and advocates seeking to close the sustainability behavior gap.",

          "abstract": "Online, at-home testing of scholastic skills can widen participation in research, but needs evidence on quality and practicality. We ran two pilots in samples of Dutch adults to: (a) compare a digital version to the official pen &amp; paper version on a short arithmetic test (TempoToets Rekenen; TTR), (b) evaluate two online vocabulary tests, (c) benchmark a developing abstract-reasoning test (OMSS), and (d) examine the Dutch translation of the Math Ability Rating Questionnaire (MARQ) self-report.\nPilot I (N = 55) included home online testing and supervised lab testing (online and pen/paper). Home: TTR, Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB), synonym vocabulary test, Dutch Auditory &amp; Image Vocabulary Test (DAIVT).  Lab: TTR, synonym test, DAIVT, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the OMSS. Pilot II (N=61) repeated TTR across three settings; home-digital, lab-digital, lab-pen/paper and compared it to (subsets of) the MARQ. Outcomes included internal consistency (α), Pearson correlations (r), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) from mixed models, administration time, and feasibility indicators.\nArithmetic (TTR): In Pilot I, cross-format associations were moderate (r = .63). In Pilot II, home-digital vs pen/paper r = .69, lab-digital vs pen/paper r = .70, and home- vs lab-digital r = .79. Scores were generally higher on pen/paper than on the digital versions (modality effect), but the two digital settings were more consistent.\nVocabulary: Both tests were reliable and convergent with PPVT: DAIVT α = .90; r = .76; synonym α = .85; r = .66. The synonym test was shorter than the DAIVT (~4.5 vs. 7 min) and required no audio, favouring remote feasibility; DAIVT provided stronger convergence, likely reflecting the similar format to the PPVT.\nAbstract reasoning: OMSS showed acceptable preliminary indices versus MaRs-IB (α = .67; r = .56; ICC = .51; ~11 min). A ~20-item OMSS form appears efficient with limited expected loss in precision.\nSelf-reported math (MARQ): Internal consistency was strong (α &gt; .80 for MARQ-19/5/3). Higher MARQ scores (poorer self-reported arithmetic ability) were weakly to, at best, moderately correlated with TTR (timed arithmetic performance); the strongest being for MARQ-5 (r = −.33, p = .011).\nFor the remote, online version of the TTR standardized administration (clear on-screen instructions, short practice, consistent device) is crucial to limit modality-related variance. For vocabulary, both online tests are suitable; the synonym test is pragmatic for remote use, whereas DAIVT offers stronger convergence at greater time cost. OMSS is promising pending item refinement and shortening. MARQ–TTR associations were weaker than expected, suggesting differences in construct coverage (broad self-report vs. timed operations), translation and sample effects. Within MARQ, the MARQ5 subset appears most suitable in our context due to its brevity, high internal consistency, and the strongest, albeit modest, correlation with TTR.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists often compare groups in terms of relations between latent variables (LV) (often called structural relations) using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). LVs are measured indirectly by questionnaires; thus, measurement invariance must be evaluated before comparisons can be made. To efficiently compare many groups, the recently proposed Mixture Multigroup SEM (MMG-SEM) clusters groups based on their structural relations while accounting for measurement (non-)invariance. However, the current MMG-SEM relies on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, which assumes continuous indicators. This can introduce bias when dealing with ordinal data, especially for variables with fewer item categories. In this paper, we extend MMG-SEM to accommodate ordinal data relying on the stepwise Structural-After-Measurement estimation approach. In the first step, we implement a multigroup categorical confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CCFA) with diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) to estimate the measurement model (MM). The second step uses ML to perform the clustering and estimate cluster-specific structural relations. A simulation study compares the performance of this approach to that of ML-based MMG-SEM under various conditions. The results show a better recovery of MM parameters with DWLS, particularly with fewer response categories, whereas both approaches perform similarly regarding the recovery of the clusters and structural relations.",

          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

Individuals perceive products as higher in quality when ratings are presented on a binary scale, assuming reviews have been assigned to positive or negative categories based on whether they are above or below the midpoint of a five-point scale. Individuals perceive products as being of equivalent quality across scales only when ratings of four and five are taken as positive, and the remainder as negative. However, when individuals are asked to generate a five-point ratings distribution from binary ratings, they do not account for this skewed perception of positivity unless the five-point scale is labelled so that the ‘neutral’ point of the scale is defined as four rather than three.

We explore the extent of xenodyskheria's influence on outgroup prejudice before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic-arguably one of the most salient pathogen threats of the century. We found that, prior to the pandemic, pathogen disgust had no effect on rejection of and callousness towards healthy looking strangers. However, at the onset of the pandemic, pathogen disgust became the main predictor of outgroup prejudice. In contrast, neither stress nor anxiety were associated with outgroup prejudice during or after the pandemic. Interestingly, we observed a paradoxical relationship between pathogen and moral disgust, as the latter can serve as a \"buffer\" tempering the exclusionary tendencies of the former, despite these two disgust domains being highly correlated. Additionally, our Post-COVID sample showed no reversion to pre-pandemic levels of xenodyskheria, suggesting that the psychological effects of COVID-19 crisis may have left a more enduring imprint on social dynamics than previously assumed. Results are discussed in the light of evolutionary theories. Future research avenues for a dual-process model of behavioral immunity and for pre-genocide dehumanization processes are proposed.",

          "authors": "Immanuel Stoltenhoff; Ineke van der Ham; Anne Cuperus; Judith Schomaker",
          "abstract": "Treadmill Virtual Reality (VR) has a potential application in rehabilitation, but its adoption is hampered by commonly experienced cybersickness symptoms, and an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence relevant (learning) outcomes. Previous studies have suggested that with active locomotion (self-motion) cybersickness symptoms may be limited. Restriction of the field-of-view – e.g., via the use of video vignettes – may also reduce symptoms. Whether a VR intervention is effective may also depend on the subjective presence within the virtual environment as experienced by the user. It remains unclear, however, what the optimal conditions to prevent cybersickness and to induce high levels of presence are. In the current study we investigated the effect of self-motion (walking vs. standing) and field of view as manipulated by vignetting (on vs. off) on cybersickness, presence and memory. Thirty-two healthy adults walked two predetermined routes in two different virtual environments: During one trial participants walked on the treadmill, determining direction with a handlebar (walking condition; using a Virtuwalk-treadmill), and during the other trial (order counterbalanced between participants), participants used the handlebar while standing still to move around the virtual environment (standing condition). In a between-subjects design, half the participants experienced the virtual environments with a vignette that restricted the field-of-view, while vignetting was not applied for the other half of the participants. In contrast to expectations, cybersickness was not influenced by walking or vignetting. However, results showed a positive effect of self-motion on presence, with higher presence in the walking than no-walking condition. In addition, presence and motivation were positively correlated. Vignetting did not affect presence, but it reduced landmark memory, potentially by partially obstructing the field-of-view. The current study’s findings thus suggest that self-motion is positively associated with presence, and in turn higher presence is associated with higher motivation. Vignetting did not reduce cybersickness and may not be recommended when memory of the environment is of relevance.",

Self-report data were collected from 211 adult women (88% response rate) in Belgian prisons, representing 42% of all female prisoners nationwide. During their current incarceration, one in three (31%) participants had ever used drugs and a quarter (26%) did so in the past month. Cannabis and non-prescribed tranquillizers (such as benzodiazepines) were most commonly used. The main reasons cited by participants for using drugs in prison were to relieve stress, forget problems, and counteract boredom. In a multivariate analysis, perceived social support and availability of meaningful activities were negatively associated with recent drug use while incarcerated. Other factors related to the prison environment had no significant influence on drug use, providing a more nuanced perspective on extant qualitative literature.",

          "abstract": "Understanding others’ mental states is a cornerstone of human cognition, yet how spontaneous\nbelief attribution operates in complex, naturalistic perception remains underexplored. Dramatic\nirony (DI)—a narrative device through which viewers are made aware of crucial information\nwhich is unknown to characters of the narrative—provides a controlled but naturalistic context\nto examine these processes. Using a curated DI film corpus (Cabañas et al., 2023), we\ncombined eye-tracking with a Self-Paced Viewing (SPV) paradigm to investigate how SToM\nshapes real-time processing. In a pre-registered between-subjects study (https://osf.io/by56s),\nparticipants viewed edited Harold Lloyd film excerpts that either provided viewers with\nprivileged information unknown to a character (Installation group) or withheld it to align\nviewer and character knowledge (Control group), reflecting false-belief and true-belief\nscenarios, respectively. We analysed narrative comprehension, reaction times, and eye-\ntracking measures indexing cognitive effort and attentional allocation. Results showed that the\nInstallation group exhibited longer viewing times at moments of representational conflict and\nlonger overall fixation durations, indicating greater cognitive effort. Gaze analyses revealed\nselective attention to belief-relevant characters and objects, suggesting top-down control\nguided by mental state representations. Extended dwell times on characters’ mouths in the\nInstallation group further reflected deliberate information seeking. These findings indicate that\nviewers spontaneously construct and maintain complex false-belief representations during DI\ncomprehension, dynamically modulating cognitive processing and attention. By integrating\nnaturalistic film stimuli with controlled manipulations, this study extends theories of scene\ncomprehension to include spontaneous mentalizing, offering a tractable model of social\nreasoning in dynamic visual contexts.",

          "abstract": "Polyregulation refers to employing multiple strategies to regulate emotions within a single emotional episode. However, evidence on its affective outcomes remains inconclusive, likely due to reliance on strategy count as the operationalization of polyregulation and the overlook of context sensitivity. Across two independent ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies from the United States (Study 1, N = 158, 12,217 observations) and China (Study 2, N = 144, 11,347 observations), we introduced the effective strategy ratio, the ratio of idiographically effective strategies to total strategies used, to evaluate the overall quality of polyregulation. We directly tested whether the joint contribution of context sensitivity and the overall quality predicted various indices of momentary psychological distress. Total number of strategies was associated with increased distress at lower levels of the effective strategy ratio, but with reduced distress at higher levels. Context sensitivity magnified the benefits of high effective strategy ratio but was less helpful when the ratio was low. The results were robust across culturally distinct samples and after controlling for lagged distress. These findings underscore the utility of the effective strategy ratio and highlight the synergistic benefits of flexibly aligning idiographic effective strategies with contextual demands. We emphasize the importance of moving beyond strategy count to focus on overall quality and prioritizing context-sensitive emotion regulation in future affective science research.",

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) offers a scalable neuromodulatory approach, but its behavioral effects in subclinical ADHD are poorly understood. This study tested whether online (during-stimulation) taVNS yields domain-general or domain-specific cognitive benefits. Twenty adults with elevated inattention completed two single-blind, sham-controlled, and counterbalanced sessions. Stimulation was delivered at 25 Hz to the cymba concha (active) or at 1 Hz with identical montage and sensation (sham). Participants performed the Attention Network Task (ANT: alerting, orienting, executive control) and a 2-back working memory task. ANT reaction times were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models; 2-back accuracy with linear mixed models. Blinding was successful, and only mild transient side effects occurred. Results showed that active taVNS selectively reduced flanker interference, indicating enhanced attentional control, with no effects on alerting, orienting, or working memory. These findings demonstrate a domain-specific benefit of online taVNS in subclinical ADHD, selectively strengthening executive control rather than producing broad gains across attention and memory.",

While LQH components are typically investigated in reading, their role in resolving cognitive conflict remains unknown. This study applies the construct of lexical precision to the traditional naming Stroop task, a gold-standard to quantify cognitive conflict resolution specifically investigating its influence in dyslexia and stuttering. \nMethod: Stroop interference was measured in 84 neurotypical readers, 50 dyslexic adults and 30 adults who stutter (AWS). All participants completed a naming Stroop task, together with a suite of individual difference measures that were analysed using a Principal Component Analysis, which established measures of phonological precision and lexical precision. \nResults: The data showed that, on average, dyslexic adults and AWS showed significantly larger Stroop interference effects compared with neurotypical adults. Crucially, the magnitude of the Stroop interference was moderated by lexical precision. Dyslexic adults and AWS who scored higher on the lexical precision component showed Stroop interference levels similar to the neurotypical adults, while those with lower precision demonstrated a significantly larger Stroop interference. However, the level of Stroop interference did not differ between AWS and dyslexic adults. \nConclusions: The results indicate that an imprecise lexical representation underpins the difficulties in cognitive control mechanisms that are independent of the specific neurodivergent groups.",

          "abstract": "Mixed emotions are strongly linked to aesthetic emotions, which involve both positive and negative emotional experiences. Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "abstract": "Community violence is an epidemic in the United States. Studies estimate almost 30% of youth experience community violence, with higher rates in low-income, urban settings. Community violence exposure is consistently linked to adverse mental health outcomes, including post-traumatic stress, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. In response, nationwide efforts have emphasized increased financial investment in social services as a potential means to mitigate the impact of violence exposure. Yet, gaps remain in understanding whether structural investments (i.e., social service expenditures) moderate mental health outcomes. This study aimed to: (1) provide an updated examination of the associations between community violence exposure and mental health outcomes, and (2) test whether state-level social service expenditures moderated these associations. We conducted a spatial meta-analysis using a three-level random-effects model, linking study data to publicly available Census expenditures data. A total of 155 studies representing 23 states yielded 769 effect sizes. Results indicated a significant small-to-moderate positive association between community violence and mental health (Fisher’s z = 0.22, p &lt; .0001; 95% CI [0.20, 0.24]), with heterogeneity across studies (Q = 9524.4, df = 768, p &lt; .0001). Hospital and veterans’ services spending weakened the positive associations with somatic and post-traumatic stress outcomes. By contrast, employment security and health spending amplified the positive associations with internalizing outcomes. Findings underscore the enduring mental health burden of community violence, the potential role of targeted policy investments, and the need for cross-disciplinary research to clarify how psychological and structural factors impact mental health outcomes among those exposed to community violence.",

Building on an unexpected finding of stronger White–rich/Black–poor stereotyping among third-group individuals (e.g., Latine and Asian Americans) relative to Black and White Americans, we hypothesized that biased social sampling from network homophily might produce this stereotype. Supporting this possibility, we observed that (a) contact with Black people explained racial group differences in stereotyping and, crucially, (b) exposing participants to counterstereotypic (Black–rich and White–poor) exemplars decreased the degree of stereotyping across a number of procedural variations and to similar degrees across racial groups. Overall, these findings suggest that social relationships are critical to understanding how individuals form and maintain stereotypes about groups that are unequal in wealth and status.",

This work aims to address the \"Neural Binding Problem\", understood here as explaining the unity of conscious experience yielded through the activity of a distributed system, such as the sensory nervous system. Finally, this model yields testable hypotheses, such as: (i) TMS-induced perturbations to regions responsible for processing a subset of perceivable predicates should selectively distort corresponding dimensions in  experiential space ; (ii) The implementation of a Brain-Computer Interface directly interacting with the sensory nervous system, would yield phenomenal representations coming from the interface within the experience's coordinates ; (iii) The presentation of a gradually changing sequence of stimuli with diverse predicate values during a fixed time interval should yield a higher path-average speed within the experiential space, than the presentation of unchanging stimuli during the same fixed time interval  ; (iv)  The presentation of unchanging stimuli followed by a rapid change in stimuli with diverse predicate values during a fixed time interval should yield a higher distance speed within the experiential space, than the presentation of unchanging stimuli during the same fixed time interval.",

This cross-sectional study investigated age-related differences in SEB skills and their gender variations using a large sample (N=31,315, ages 10-70). There were four key findings. First, there were temporary and modest decreases in some skill domains during early adolescence, possibly reflecting “adolescent disruption.” Second, despite these temporary declines, mean levels of all SEB skill domains increased with age, with most skill domains (Self-Management, Social Engagement, Cooperation, and Emotional Resilience) improving markedly during adolescence and early adulthood. This is broadly consistent with “maturation” in the personality trait literature. Third, there was considerable heterogeneity in age-related patterns when assessing specific skill facets. Fourth, there were some gender differences: men and women varied in age-related differences for Cooperation and Innovation skills, and non-binary youth reported lower initial levels on most skills but showed greater positive change during adolescence and early adulthood. These patterns show both parallels and distinctions with developmental principles derived from the personality trait literature, such as adolescent disruption and adult maturation. These findings provide the most comprehensive map of SEB skill development to date and should be used to inform future longitudinal studies and the design of developmentally-timed interventions.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

The current study explored how sexual fluidity beliefs, relationship satisfaction, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness were associated with sexual satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals (n = 175; 72% cisgender women) via an online survey. Results showed that a minority of participants (27%) shifted their sexual identity label in response to having a TGNB partner; when shifts did occur, they were most often to broader labels. Relationship satisfaction was the strongest predictor of sexual satisfaction, and individuals who reported higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness reported higher relationship/sexual satisfaction relative to before their partner’s TGNB identity disclosure. Relationship satisfaction fully mediated the effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on sexual satisfaction. However, sexual fluidity beliefs were not associated with sexual satisfaction. The findings point to the ways in which relationships including a TGNB partner show similar patterns to those identified in other types of relationships, as well as highlight the importance of LGBTQ+ community connectedness for well-being in partners of TGNB individuals.",

We found that after controlling for the actual temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that shared contextual overlap. Notably, within these causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found. Further, participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory and increased temporal integration between the contextually-related events compared to participants who contributed less. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and that agentic task engagement modulates how real-world experiences are remembered.",

          "authors": "Henna Vartiainen; Erik C Nook",
          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing one’s interpretation of a situation to change its emotional impact. Cognitive reappraisal studies typically assess changes in valence ratings following reappraisal as the primary dependent variable, but scholars have recently documented that valence ratings can take two forms: affective valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s hedonic internal feelings) and semantic valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s cognitive evaluation of the stimulus). Because typical rating instructions do not distinguish between these forms of valence, it remains unknown how strongly cognitive reappraisal shifts either one. We address this gap through two preregistered studies. In Study 1, N=155 participants completed a classic cognitive reappraisal task in which they either responded naturally to or cognitively reappraised negative images. Critically, we manipulated whether participants rated either affective valence, semantic valence, or “default” valence (conventional instructions). Reappraisal significantly improved valence ratings in all conditions, but reappraisal most strongly influenced semantic valence and least strongly affective valence. Interestingly, default valence behaved most similarly to semantic valence, suggesting that existing reappraisal studies largely document changes in semantic evaluations, more than affective experiences. Study 2 (N=105) replicated these effects within-subjects. These results extend research on affective and semantic valence by demonstrating that they vary in their responsiveness to regulation. Additionally, they suggest that existing research likely overestimates the impact of reappraisal on felt emotional experiences, prompting new perspectives on past findings and more focused methods for assessing the hedonic impact of emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "Cleeremans and Tallon-Baudry (2022) proposed that the core function of consciousness might be to enable agents to value their experiences. From this perspective, every conscious experience is affectively valenced, albeit to varying degrees. Interestingly, acting itself is associated with a specific phenomenology referred to as “sense of agency” (SoA, Pacherie 2008). Thus, if every conscious experience is valenced, and if performing an action is accompanied by a conscious SoA, then SoA should itself be valenced. Sixty participants completed an Affective Misattribution Procedure (Payne &amp; Lundberg, 2014) in which we manipulated two factors: intentionality (voluntary vs. passive key selection) and causality (outcome matching vs. not matching the selection). We expected the SoA to be higher in the voluntary/matching blocks than in the passive/non-matching blocks. Following the SoA manipulation, participants’ task was to judge the valence of a priori neutral Chinese pictographs. We hypothesized that higher SoA should be more positively valenced, and therefore implictly influencing the rating of the pictographs toward positive valences. While explicit reports could corroborate our hypothesis, we did not observe evidence of an influence of the SoA manipulation on the valuation of pictographs (i.e., implicit measure). However, exploratory analyses highlighted a high variability of the effect suggesting that SoA could be differently valenced from one individual to another rather than not valenced at all. Future studies should explore what produces this difference in the experience of SoA.",

          "abstract": "The e-QPASS (Quick Psychoaffective Symptoms Scan) is a comprehensive 105-item psychopathology assessment that captures three core emotional dimensions underlying mental illness: depression, anxiety, and anger. While clinically valuable, its 10-minute administration time creates barriers for high-throughput clinical and research settings. This study developed a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version to preserve comprehensive symptom coverage while dramatically reducing respondent burden. We analyzed data from 625 participants (47.8% female, ages 15-79) who completed the full e-QPASS. Exploratory factor analysis identified dimensionality, and Item Response Theory (IRT) Graded Response Models were fitted to calibrate item parameters. CAT simulations determined optimal item administration sequences, with final versions limited to 12 items for general psychopathology and 8 items each for internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining preservation of known gender differences in externalizing symptoms between full and CAT versions. Factor analysis revealed a robust two-factor structure: Dysregulated Externalizing and Internalizing. IRT models demonstrated acceptable fit (CFI=0.965, RMSEA=0.059). The CAT versions maintained high measurement precision (SE≤0.40) across clinically relevant trait levels while achieving a 10-fold reduction in items. Gender differences in externalizing symptoms were preserved with identical effect sizes across both full and CAT versions, confirming construct validity. The CAT e-QPASS successfully balances comprehensive psychopathology assessment with practical efficiency, offering substantial promise for clinical screening, treatment monitoring, and large-scale research applications where repeated assessments are essential.",

We also reflect on co-creation with the public, the challenges of working outside controlled environments, and strategies for sustainability and evaluation.

The challenge of AI alignment is thus an interdisciplinary one that involves not only a technical challenge for computer science but one with important ties to the psychology of moral values, decision-making, and trust. Early work identified a static set of universal values, without considering the key questions of to whom and to which values AI should be aligned. This perspective paper challenges the notion of universal alignment and instead argues for dynamic, context-specific alignability across different domains, tasks, and users. Specifically, we emphasize the need to go beyond traditional pluralism and rethink how AI alignment can be achieved through a qualitative and quantitative research process that involves identifying context-specific values, developing alignable AI algorithms using limited human feedback, and evaluating alignment through assessing both an AI’s values and actions, while considering how humans trust and delegate to the AI. We discuss several paths forward for our proposed framework, including the potential ethical and societal implications of context-specific alignability, and draw on examples ranging from chatbots to value-aligned decision-making in the medical triage domain.",

          "abstract": "Whether selective attention alters initial sensory processing or instead only operates at higher cortical stages (often referred to as early vs. late selection) is a foundational question in cognitive neuroscience. Investigating the influence of covert visual selective attention, Clark and Hillyard (1996) found that directed attention modulated the amplitude of several early components (P1 and N1) of the visual event-related potential (ERP) derived from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG). However, attended and non-attended visual stimuli did not produce statistically different amplitudes in the C1 or P2 components. Dipole source estimation of the neural locus of these ERPs indicated that the C1 originated in primary (striate) visual cortex (V1), while the later components primarily arose from extrastriate visuocortical areas. Together, these results led to the conclusion that sustained spatial attention enhances the sensory gain of early visual processing in V1 via feedback projections from the extrastriate visual cortex where the P1 and N1 are generated. Despite the influential nature of this original work in EEG and cognitive neuroscience more broadly, recent research has reignited the debate on which stage of the visual processing hierarchy is influenced by attention. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project (Pavlov et al., 2021), we will be revisiting this issue by conducting a multi-site, high-powered direct replication of Clark and Hillyard (1996).",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Accurately quantifying belief strength in heuristics-and-biases tasks is crucial yet methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce an automated method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to systematically measure and manipulate belief strength. We specifically tested this method in the widely used “lawyer-engineer” base-rate neglect task, in which stereotypical descriptions (e.g., someone enjoying mathematical puzzles) conflict with normative base-rate information (e.g., engineers represent a very small percentage of the sample). Using this approach, we created an open-access database containing over 100,000 unique items systematically varying in stereotype-driven belief strength. Validation studies demonstrate that our LLM-derived belief strength measure correlates strongly with human typicality ratings and robustly predicts human choices in a base-rate neglect task. Additionally, our method revealed substantial and previously unnoticed variability in stereotype-driven belief strength in popular base-rate items from existing research, underlining the need to control for this in future studies. We further highlight methodological improvements achievable by refining the LLM prompt, as well as ways to enhance cross-cultural validity. The database presented here serves as a powerful resource for researchers, facilitating rigorous, replicable, and theoretically precise experimental designs, as well as enabling advancements in cognitive and computational modeling of reasoning. To support its use, we provide the R package baserater, which allows researchers to access the database to apply or adapt the method to their own research.",

          "abstract": "Social connection is a fundamental animal need, and its maintenance primarily depends on the rewarding nature of positive social interactions. A central feature of several medical conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, is decreased interest in positive social interactions and a tendency toward social isolation, which can in turn worsen these conditions. \nNumerous studies using animal models have identified brain mechanisms underlying both unconditioned and conditioned (using conditioned place preference) social interactions, where the interaction is imposed by the experimenter. In contrast, much less is known about the brain mechanisms involved in volitional, rewarding social interactions that are initiated by the animals themselves. This is critical as social interactions between humans are often voluntary. Early studies showed that rats will perform a volitional operant response to gain access to social interaction with a peer. More recently, the operant social self-administration procedure has been used to investigate the brain mechanisms of rewarding social interaction in mice, rats, prairie voles, and hamsters.\nIn this review, we summarize behavioral and neurobiological studies that have used the operant social self-administration procedure. We then discuss how this model has been used to study the effect of volitional social interaction across neurodevelopmental disorders, addiction, stress, pain, and inflammation, including its role in drug self-administration and relapse in rats, the identification of heroin-addiction–vulnerable individuals, and to study how pain and social stress disrupt volitional social interaction.

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four overarching themes were formulated: (1) Negative Prior Experiences with Mathematics, (2) Misconceptions of Course Content, (3) Statistical Fragility, and (4) Student-Tutor Interaction. The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt. Tutor communication, class size, and assumptions about baseline competence further shaped students’ experiences, intensifying anxiety. This research provides a nuanced investigation of how students conceptualise statistics in their psychology journey, and offers suggestions and recommendations for applied practice.",

Previous research suggests that individual (i.e., feminist identity) and situational factors (i.e., humor type and joke teller gender) play an important role in interpreting feminist humor as a tool to subvert sexism and in its subsequent impact. Two studies were conducted to analyze the influence of participants' feminist identification and the joke teller’s gender on the appreciation and interpretation of feminist humor (Study 1) and on the proclivity to engage in collective action (Study 2). In Study 1 (N = 307), we manipulated humor type (feminist vs. neutral) and gender of the joke teller (woman vs. man). We found that weaker feminist identifiers perceived more criticism of sexism when the feminist (vs. neutral) joke was told by a woman (vs. a man), but no significant differences emerged in appreciation responses (i.e., funniness and aversiveness). In Study 2 (N = 200), we extended these findings and found that weaker feminist identifiers reported greater proclivity to engage in collective action after exposure to feminist jokes told by a woman, not by a man. These findings contribute to the understanding of the ways through which feminist humor can raise awareness of sexism, enable the recruitment of activists, and promote mobilization for social change.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive threat-neutralization is a common behavior pattern across anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that contributes to functional impairment. However, laboratory studies of this behavioral phenomenon are scant. In the present study, we examined effects of anxiety-related disorders and anxiety sensitivity on repetitive threat-neutralization behavior. Adults recruited from the community (n=40) with and without anxiety-related disorders completed clinician-administered and self-reported anxiety assessments and the Tap-to-Safety Task. Task stimuli included a threat cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety cues (CS-) never paired with shock, and safe stimuli varying in similarity to the CS+. The task included choice trials, in which participants could repeatedly tap a button to reduce risk of shock, while also reducing accumulation of reward points. In an extinction phase, shocks were no longer administered. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to examine differences related to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety disorder diagnosis in repetitive threat-neutralization behavior across stimulus types. Participants with greater anxiety sensitivity showed more adaptive neutralization behavior to the true threat-cue as well as more unnecessary neutralization to the former threat-cue. Those with anxiety-related disorders showed more neutralization behavior to the former threat-cue. Anxiety sensitivity and anxiety-related disorder status were both associated with less-steep declines in neutralization behavior across trials of extinction, consistent with the hypothesis that neutralization behaviors would persist in safe situations for anxious individuals. These findings suggest that the TTS task captures anxiety-related individual differences in extinction of repetitive threat-neutralization behavior, and provides an adaptable tool for probing threat-related behaviors.",

We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis to quantify the burden of psychological distress in this population (PROSPERO: CRD42024596813). A total of 139 studies and four primary databases were identified (k = 212, N = 128,684) via Scopus and supplementary searches through 31 December 2024. Based on established diagnostic thresholds, pooled prevalence estimates indicated that 28.9% (95% confidence interval 25.3–32.7%) of ECRs met the criteria for at least one mental health syndrome or symptom. Specifically, 28.9% (25.4–32.5%) met criteria for depression, 29.1% (25.4–32.9%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 24.9% (20.6–29.4%) for an eating disorder, 21.4% (17.2–26.0%) for alcohol abuse, 18.2% (14.2–22.6%) engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury, and 17.5% (14.2–21.0%) reported suicidal ideation. Complementing prevalence estimates, analyses of normalized severity scores indicated that ECRs experienced mild degrees of depression, anxiety, and moderate degrees of stress. Severity estimates for eating disorders and suicidal ideation did not exceed clinical cut-offs. Moderator analyses indicated that the type of syndrome and the type of measurement scale explained the largest part of the variance in both the prevalence and the severity models. Most individual-level factors, such as gender, ethnicity, academic discipline, country, career stage, social support, and supervisor relationship, did not significantly moderate prevalence or severity estimates. Age showed a small, but significant association with lower prevalence (β = -0.01, CI -0.03 – -0.0009). Higher study quality and random or full sampling were also associated with lower severity and prevalence levels of psychological distress. These findings underscore both the need for structural reforms and for the implementation of evidence-based support services and interventions for ECRs.",

          "abstract": "Across species, cooperative decisions are often asymmetric: one individual risks their own resources before knowing whether others will reciprocate. Such uncertainty is central to the evolution of trust and reciprocal exchanges. Physiological synchrony is frequently assumed to support cooperation, yet it remains unclear both how synchrony arises and how it functions in these asymmetric social interactions. We tested whether mutual visibility shapes physiological synchrony, and whether synchrony in turn predicts cooperative behaviour in repeated trust-reciprocity exchanges. Skin conductance synchrony was stronger and more temporally aligned when individuals interacted face-to-face, yet facial expressivity did not account for this effect. Contrary to the dominant perspective, higher synchrony predicted reduced reciprocity, and only when partners could see each other. Exploratory analyses suggested that this negative link depended on arousal, indicating that the social function of synchrony is shaped by both mutual visibility and the affective state of the individual involved. These findings show that physiological synchrony is not a uniformly prosocial mechanism but a context-dependent phenomenon that can undermine cooperation under certain conditions, offering insight into the mechanisms and the function of synchrony in shaping cooperative exchanges.",

Understanding whether and how cultural context moderates the influence of behavioral interventions is essential for the design of culturally-attuned and adaptable interventions to address collective action problems like climate change. Yet, past research has primarily relied on correlational approaches to test this theory, without experimentally manipulating norm information across different settings, limiting insights into how cultural context shapes conformity to norm information. Our study tests the effects of three social norm interventions on the climate-related attitudes and behaviors of 16,070 participants in 42 countries. We find limited evidence that cultural tightness moderates the strength of conformity to social norm information in our study, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between the two.",

In addition to characterizing typical development, CDIs have also been used to detect “red flags” for language delay (e.g., Guinchat et al., 2012; Herlihy et al., 2015). Furthermore, CDIs have since been applied in studies of children with neurodevelopmental conditions and genetic syndromes, often beyond the age range CDIs were designed for (e.g., Luyster et al., 2007). These studies span clinical screening, developmental monitoring, outcome prediction, and the exploration of condition-specific developmental profiles (e.g., Rescorla, 2011; Can et al., 2013; Tager-Flusberg et al., 2009).

We find that GPT-4o demonstrates notably better performance across most variables compared to ChatPDF, Bing Chat, and GPT-4. The proposed DCR method powered by GPT4-o achieved higher accuracy in most structured data extraction and the few-shot prompting strategy further improved performance on complex information (e.g., correlation coefficient). These findings highlight the potential of using LLMs in ES research.",

          "authors": "Konstantinos Vassilis Petrides",
          "abstract": "This white paper presents the derivation and validation of the TEIQue-DISC®, a novel DISC assessment instrument derived from the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Widely used in workplaces for behavioral profiling despite well-documented psychometric limitations, the DISC model categorizes individuals along four dimensions: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. By extracting DISC profiles from the scientifically grounded TEIQue framework, the white paper introduces a robust alternative to existing DISC tools. Using multiple large datasets (N ranging from 101 to 13790), we implemented data-intensive methods, including machine learning techniques to identify items meeting stringent criteria for circumplex structure, internal consistency, and normative measurement. Multidimensional scaling analyses of three independent samples confirmed excellent fit to the theoretical DISC model, with the four traits arranged at approximately 90° intervals. Baseline internal consistency estimates were satisfactory across traits and datasets. Wide-ranging testing of 28 prespecified hypotheses examined relationships with gender, established personality measures (16PF, TEIQue, and NEO), occupational roles, managerial levels, and industry sectors. All hypotheses were supported, exhibiting theoretically expected convergent and discriminant validity patterns. The TEIQue-DISC® offers several advantages over legacy DISC instruments: empirically proven circular arrangement, protection against response manipulation through semantic concealment, dual assessment efficiency simultaneously providing both trait emotional intelligence and DISC profiles, and identification of up to 20 distinct behavioral styles through a mathematically exhaustive classification system. While constrained by inherent limitations of the DISC model, the TEIQue-DISC® constitutes an advancement in personality diagnostics, bridging sophisticated psychological theory with practical applicability.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) provide deaf individuals with access to auditory feedback from their own voice during production. This experiment investigated whether typical hearing participants can use CI simulated speech feedback for perceptual learning and sensorimotor control of speech. CI simulation was achieved via noise vocoding, a technique that degrades the spectral detail in a speech signal in a manner similar to a CI. 32 participants took part in the experiment. First, participants were tested on their recognition of noise vocoded sentences before and after a training task; either perception training, where participants listened to noise vocoded sentences while reading matching text; or production training, where participants read aloud sentences whilst hearing their own voice noise-vocoded in real-time. Both groups of participants then underwent a speech motor adaptation paradigm in which formants were perturbed in real-time noise vocoded speech auditory feedback. Both perception and production training tasks resulted in significant improvements in recognition of noise vocoded sentences, with no effect of training type. Speech motor adaptation however was not significant at the group level in response to the formant perturbations. This suggests that successful perceptual learning for degraded speech is not sufficient for successful sensorimotor learning with degraded auditory feedback.",

          "authors": "Stephan Moratti; Sergio Felipe Calvo García",
          "abstract": "Group-level averaging of psychophysiological data often obscures meaningful individual differences, masking response patterns that may explain variability in behavior and central nervous system activity. Identifying such patterns is particularly relevant in heart rate (HR) responses to threat, where subtle variations may reflect distinct coping mechanisms such as orienting or defense. Machine learning techniques that learn latent representations, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs), offer powerful tools for revealing such hidden structures.\nThis methodological report introduces a simple VAE-based approach for characterizing HR responses to threat pictures in 165 participants. To validate the method, simulations first demonstrated that the model accurately separated noisy sine and cosine waveforms. The VAE was then applied to empirical HR responses, mapping them into a two-dimensional latent space for subsequent cluster analysis, which was compared to clustering based directly on raw HR waveforms.\nThe VAE revealed three distinct response profiles: (1) strong decelerators (fear bradycardia), (2) weak decelerators with late acceleration, and (3) immediate accelerators without a decelerative phase. In contrast, clustering raw HR waveforms identified only two groups. Clusters derived from the latent space were more coherent and exhibited greater within-group consistency. Finally, applying the pre-trained autoencoder to a small fear-conditioning dataset enabled characterization of distinct HR response patterns despite limited sample size. These findings show that even a basic autoencoder enhances the categorization of psychophysiological response patterns, offering a framework for linking individual autonomic variability to broader models of affective and defensive behavior.",

We move beyond such comparisons to examine how cognitive processes might shape this relationship. In a pre-registered longitudinal study, we applied computational modelling to repeated decision-making tasks to test whether preference for immediate rewards moderates the longitudinal relationship between social media use and mental health. Adolescents with a greater preference for immediate rewards exhibited larger declines in behavioural activation as social media use increased. This effect was consistent across timepoints, indicating heightened vulnerability among those favouring immediate gratification. No moderation was observed for other mental health outcomes, and delay discounting was unrelated to time spent on social media or compulsive internet use. Cognitive processes could therefore provide insights into individual differences in social media’s mental health effects, offering future mechanistic explanations and potential targets for intervention.",

This dynamism isn’t captured by existing systems consolidation theories that predict a unidirectional process where memories are first supported by the hippocampus and then the neocortex. I propose a three-dimensional state-space for episodic memories. The first two dimensions relate to whether episodic retrieval is driven by the hippocampus and the neocortex, critically allowing for independent and additive contributions from both regions. The third dimension relates to the episodic-specificity of retrieval. Memories can be located at any point in this state-space and move to any other location. The state-space captures the dynamic nature of episodic memory and broadens the search space of possible memory states and transformations across time.",

We ran a pre-registered study with UK adults (N = 150, Prolific) where participants rated the value to them of 41 different monthly incomes (£1–£8000; random order). Comparing the fit of different classes of function, the most frequent best fit was sigmoid (59% of respondents; quadratic 37%; linear 5%). Generalized Additive Models corroborated the S-shape: the mean first derivative rose at low incomes and fell at higher incomes, while the mean second derivative was positive at low incomes and negative thereafter, with the inflection around £1,600/month. Exact question wording did not appear to affect the shape. The midpoint of the S-shape increased with respondents’ own income and the typical income of people they know. Thus, in this population, directly elicited psychological utility functions for income appear to be S-shaped, consistent with earlier findings and the Desperation Threshold Model: marginal utility increases up to a basic-needs threshold and decreases beyond it. Because the inflection lies at an income level actually experience by millions of Britons, these findings have potentially important implications for understanding real-world behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Even in today’s high-choice media landscape, people are drawn to stories of crime and murder, best exemplified by the massive appeal of the true crime genre. Interestingly, while studies report negative effects of violent media on consumers, newer avenues in horror research suggest that frightening media may act as training grounds for coping with anxiety. We investigated both perspectives in a two-week daily diary study on positive and negative affect (anxiety, anger) and true crime consumption (data collected in 2024). Cross-lagged multilevel modelling (Bayesian estimation) was applied to data of n = 199 participants to examine if affect on day n predicted true crime consumption on the following day (n + 1) and vice versa. We found that today’s anxiety positively predicted violent true crime consumption of tomorrow, and in turn, violent true crime consumption of today positively predicted positive affect of tomorrow. These findings corroborate the idea that anxiety may motivate engagement with self-relevant negative media worlds like true crime for emotion regulation, which may yield affective benefits. Conversely, we did not find that true crime consumption increased anxiety or anger, which adds nuances to the idea of fear and aggression cultivation by crime portrayals in the media.",

Drawing on a positive psychology perspective, we aimed to investigate how parenting joy and perceived partner responsiveness covary during this time and how they are related to the longer-term development of parenthood regret. We collected 35 days of experience sampling data, complemented by baseline and follow-up measures, from 269 parents in the United Kingdom (13,249 total observations). Using dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM), we examined the within-person dynamics between momentary parenting joy and momentary perceived partner responsiveness. At the between-person level, we explored how participants’ average levels of these momentary experiences predicted changes in parenthood regret from baseline to follow-up. DSEM revealed a unidirectional, positive prediction from perceived partner responsiveness to parenting joy at the within-person level. At the between-person level, person means of joy moderated parenthood regret from baseline to follow-up, after relevant sociodemographic variables were controlled for. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on parenthood regret by emphasizing the role of daily emotional experiences and partner dynamics in shaping parental identity. Practically speaking, even small everyday adjustments in family interactions may meaningfully dampen parenthood regret.",

Evidence for such a role is typically based upon the ways neurons reliably respond to specific stimuli. In a recent paper, Pohl et. al. (2024) have offered a more formalized account of neural representation evidence that utilizes Shannon’s information theory. Despite the ingenuity of their theory, we argue that Pohl et. al. fail to present a successful account of evidence for neural representation, and indeed, repeat common mistakes that other researchers make in supporting neural representations.  We offer a more in-depth and rigorous analysis of such evidence, and argue for a more skeptical conclusion: What commonly gets presented as evidence for neural representations actually isn’t.  While we support the reality of cognitive representations at higher levels of analysis, we do not believe compelling evidence has been presented that supports assigning a representational role for neural states and structures.",

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

Within this narrative, Wilhelm Wundt and William James are frequently presented as dual progenitors of the experimental method. A widespread presumption is that these methods radiated from the United States and Germany outwards to other regions. However, broader evidence, drawing from the medieval Arab world and from later instantiations of laboratory psychology in Japan, China, India, and Argentina, demonstrates that experimental methods in psychology were developed and adapted for a range of contexts and purposes in other world regions. In these regions, laboratory psychology methods were marshalled to successfully effect major social and structural reform. These works are almost entirely absent from the canon of scholars associated with the birth of experimental psychology, yet their impact, like that of James and Wundt, has endured for over a century. The paper analyzes how the prevailing narrative describing the genesis of experimental psychology has been an organizing factor in the field. Recognizing a broader genealogy recognizes the accomplishments of psychological pioneers around the world, articulates the range of impacts that experimental psychology can achieve, and expands the hypothesis space of experimental psychology.",

Powerful computational tools also enable new analyses of high-dimensional data, incorporating feature annotation of the stimuli and model-based evaluation of gaze. These advances in both data collection and analysis are providing new insights into individual differences in both health and disease. Here we discuss four key approaches to modeling eye movement data: saliency-based attention phenotyping, data-driven gaze pattern identification, supervised machine learning classification, and unsupervised clustering. We highlight their advantages in psychiatry research, as they inform better understanding of visual attention, provide more fine-grained characterization of individual differences, and make more powerful clinical predictions.

          "abstract": "Social identity profoundly shapes whom people choose as information sources, constraining exposure to diverse perspectives. While people are motivated to seek accurate information, they systematically avoid outgroup sources even when group membership is irrelevant to the task at hand.  Here we investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can circumvent these identity-driven biases in source selection. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1,054) preferred AI over human sources when seeking information about political conflicts. In Study 2 (n = 284), an incentivized political fact-checking experiment revealed that participants preferred AI sources over outgroup (d = 0.470) and even ingroup (d = 0.230) partisan sources, despite recognizing they were of equal competence. In Study 3 (n = 277), using an identity-irrelevant shape categorization task, participants only preferred AI over outgroup sources (d = 0.191), with no difference between AI and ingroup sources. Computational modeling revealed that these preferences emerge through selectively accumulated evidence against partisan advisors during deliberation, rather than differences in priors. These findings suggest that AI's perceived neutrality enables it to bypass identity-based discrimination. These results highlight the potential of AI to reduce echo chambers and broaden epistemic exposure by serving as an identity-neutral conduit for information acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood (3- to 5-years of age) is a period marked by significant developmental changes in the brain. This development underlies age-related improvements in several domains – including language, memory, and socioemotional skills. However, assessing changes in brain structure and function during this period using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) poses several challenges. For example, difficulty remaining still, maintaining attention for long periods and non-compliance in performing behavioral responses in the scanner are particularly prevalent issues. Technological advances in neuroimaging techniques over the past decade have significantly improved success rates for pediatric neuroimaging studies. For example, shorter scan durations and real-time monitoring and correction of motion during scanning have proven especially valuable in acquiring reliable data. However, developmental researchers must still be creative in order to adequately prepare young participants for the scanning environment and, subsequently, ensure the data acquired can be used to address the questions of interest. The success of these sessions has become paramount with the onset of large, multi-site consortium studies such as the HEALthy Child and Brain Development study, which seek to track normative and atypical brain development across the first ten years of life. To this end, the current report provides a pediatric neuroimaging protocol to improve young children’s scanning experience and developmental neuroimaging data quality.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation strategies play a critical role in helping people manage stressors and maintain psychological well-being. Understanding the efficacy and boundary conditions of regulatory strategies—as they are implemented in response to stressors in daily life—is especially important for college-aged students, a population that has been experiencing chronically high levels of depression and anxiety in recent years. Here, we utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture college students’ use of multiple emotion regulation strategies in response to idiosyncratic, real-world stressors, as well as the effects of strategy use on momentary stress levels and momentary affect. Following a preregistered analytic plan, we first combined two EMA samples from Rice University and Bard College (N=159) to examine effects of strategy use on momentary affect. We also investigated the influence of factors that could interact with strategy use, namely momentary fluctuations in mental exhaustion and people’s general propensity to experience distress in the first place. Some results were consistent with our preregistered, a priori hypotheses, with rumination negatively associated with momentary affect, but use of other strategies did not significantly predict changes in momentary affect. Contrary to our predictions, efficacy of reappraisal slightly increased at higher levels of mental exhaustion. Exploratory analyses revealed that the number of adaptive strategies positively predicted momentary affect and the number of maladaptive strategies negatively predicted momentary affect. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on the variable effects of emotion regulation strategies in real-world contexts. Our findings also speak to the dynamic interplay between strategy type/tactic, situational factors, and individual characteristics to drive changes in momentary affect.",

          "abstract": "Memory distortions emerge from a complex interplay between prior knowledge and ongoing experience—dynamics which are not readily provoked in controlled laboratory experiments. Here we investigate naturally occurring memory distortions using the largest known dataset of narrative recall, comprising hundreds of spoken recollections. Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

          "abstract": "Language provides a window onto how people conceptualize their subjective experiences, including emotions. Although rare, linguistic analyses that go beyond emotion words provide deep insights into emotional experience across cultures. In this study, we explored cultural models of emotions prevalent in the US and Belgium using verbal descriptions of recent emotional events collected from speakers of North American (US) English and Belgian Dutch in form of semi-structured interviews. We analyzed the interviews in three stages: 1) topic modeling to characterize content, 2) word counting to examine linguistic resources, and 3) inductive analysis to uncover broader themes. Our findings revealed notable cultural differences alongside some similarities. US English speakers used more first-person pronouns and emotion words, emphasized high-arousal emotions, and prioritized asserting personal achievements and openly expressing their feelings. In contrast, Belgian Dutch speakers’ descriptions reflected a more moderated approach to emotions, illustrating how social standards and broader worldviews gave meaning to the events, with use of fewer first-person pronouns and more language focused on relativization and comparison. Taken together, our observations are consistent with previous psychological research on US and Belgian culture. We evaluate our approach against other means of exploring the conceptualization of emotion across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Recently, researchers have proposed that the Belief in a Just World comprises two dimensions: Effort-based Belief in a Just World (EBJW), focusing on the relationship between effort and reward, and Valence-based Belief in a Just World (VBJW), centering on the association of good and bad behavior with consequences. This research aimed to develop and validate standardized measures of EBJW and VBJW in English. Following item generation and selection, an initial list was administered to a US sample (n = 311). Subsequently, a refined list was administered to a second US sample (n = 276). The final measures demonstrated excellent reliabilities and strong convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. For instance, egocentric selfishness was negatively related to VBJW but not to EBJW, and VBJW explained variance in egocentric selfishness beyond what was accounted for by General Belief in a Just World. This underscores the potential of these concepts and measurements to elucidate mechanisms underlying various justice-related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Emerging research suggests that caregiver oral reading prosody may be a key feature of shared reading that supports children’s storybook comprehension, with potential implications for broader language development. Building on this evidence, the present study investigated whether associations between caregiver oral reading prosody and children’s language at the preschool age extend beyond real-time listening comprehension to include broader language skills.  \nMethods: Forty-one caregivers read a children’s book to their child (ages: 4–5 years) as they normally would at home. The caregivers’ oral reading prosody (intonation, timing, and loudness features) was examined in relation to children’s receptive vocabulary and core language skills. Moderated mediation models then investigated possible impacts of caregiver reading skills and shared reading time on putative links between caregiver oral reading prosody and child language.\nResults: Caregiver intonation range positively related to child receptive vocabulary and caregiver inappropriate (i.e., ungrammatical) pausing negatively related to child core language skills. Mediation models revealed that caregiver reading skills indirectly related to child language skills through oral reading prosody. Importantly, the indirect effect linking caregiver reading skills to child receptive vocabulary via caregiver intonation range was moderated by shared reading time, with the strongest effects observed in dyads reporting less shared reading engagement. \nConclusions: Findings illuminate caregiver oral reading prosody as one factor linking caregiver reading skills to child language, with effects through caregiver intonation on child vocabulary most evident in families with limited shared reading engagement. Overall, this research has implications for early language intervention approaches, especially among families of caregivers with reading difficulties and for those with limited shared reading opportunities.",

          "abstract": "When asked where they have previously looked, people rarely report their visual behaviour correctly. However, previous tasks have probed participants’ awareness of their gaze behaviour through explicit measures, like recognition, and it remains unclear whether poor awareness is also seen in implicit measures. We investigated this with a novel tracking paradigm in which participants first completed a visual search task while their eye movements were recorded. Next, participants completed a tracking task where they followed a moving red dot on the screen with their eyes. In Experiment 1, the dot replayed either their own previously recorded gaze position or that of another participant. We measured tracking performance by cross-correlating the previously recorded gaze position with the tracked positions. Participants were not significantly faster or more accurate in tracking their own eye movements compared to another participant’s. Experiment 2 tested this with a more extreme manipulation, in which participants tracked either unaltered or temporally reversed sequences of their own eye movements, which resulted in higher accuracy in the forward compared to the reversed condition. Finally, Experiment 3 examined whether performance would decrease when participants tracked a participant with very dissimilar gaze behaviour from their own. Tracking performance was similar when tracking their own scanpath compared to a dissimilar participant, but participants’ tracking latencies were shorter when tracking a participant with consistent scanning behaviour. Overall, our results suggest that though awareness of one’s eye movements is generally poor, extreme manipulations, like temporally reversing one’s eye movements, can influence tracking performance.",

          "abstract": "Sometimes people miss the “good old days” of their country. This national nostalgia can\nfuel populist movements worldwide, rallying supporters with promises of restored glory.\nSocio-psychological work has characterized national nostalgia as a coping mechanism for\ncollective self-discontinuity, but it remains theoretically unclear which aspect of collective\nidentity (e.g., national, political, or moral) is most central in shaping national nostalgia.\nWe propose the Moral Nostalgia Hypothesis (MNH), which posits that moral identity is\ncentral. MNH predicts trait sensitivity, meaning that people who prioritize moral values\nare dispositionally prone to national nostalgia, and threat sensitivity, meaning that\nperceived moral decline evokes nostalgia more strongly than economic decline as a\nsituational response. We test MNH across four studies in 20 societies (N = 4,924) using\nsurveys and two centuries of English and Chinese texts. Values tied to hierarchy and\ntradition emerged as the strongest dispositional predictors of national nostalgia, even after\ncontrolling for multiple individual- and societal-level variables, while perceived fairness\ndecline was the most powerful situational trigger. These findings identify moral identity\ncontent, rather than material welfare or generic group cues, as the key mechanism linking\ncollective self-discontinuity to national nostalgia, illuminating why nostalgic political\nrhetoric framed as moral restoration resonates so powerfully.",

Using validated instruments, we employed linear regression models to analyze trends and Cohen’s d to pinpoint critical transition points, with analyses stratified by gender and school type. Results revealed a non-linear trajectory, characterized by a significant decline in most attitude and identity constructs during the transition to secondary school (6th-7th grade), followed by a rebound in the 8th-grade cohort. This decline was more pronounced among girls, particularly in self-efficacy and Science Identity. While both school types showed a similar decrease in Science Identity, private schools exhibited a protective effect on students' self-efficacy and perceived utility of science.

          "abstract": "Youth differ in how strongly they respond to environmental influences, with some individuals demonstrating greater sensitivity to both adverse and supportive contexts. Environmental sensitivity (ES) has emerged as a unifying framework encompassing theories such as differential susceptibility, biological sensitivity to context, and vantage sensitivity. This scoping review examined sensitivity as a moderator of the relationship between environmental exposures and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents. The review aimed to (1) identify key markers used to approximate individual differences in sensitivity and (2) examine the methods used to measure these markers across studies. A total of 34 articles representing 37 studies were included. Markers of ES fell into five categories: phenotypic (e.g., temperament, sensitivity), genetic (e.g., 5HTTLPR, DRD4), physiological (e.g., cortisol, vagal tone), biological (e.g., prematurity), and neurobiological (e.g., amygdala activation). Phenotypic markers were most commonly studied, primarily assessed through parent- or youth-report questionnaires. Sensitivity was found to moderate the effects of various environments on mental health, with differential susceptibility emerging as the most consistently supported theoretical model. Assessment approaches varied widely in measurement tools, informants, and analytic methods depending on the marker used. Few studies used multi-informant or longitudinal methods. This review highlights the value of identifying sensitive youth who may be more responsive to both risk and protective factors and highlights the need for more methodologically rigorous research to guide personalized prevention and intervention efforts within an ES framework.",

Among the most prevalent causes for WM impairment affecting military personnel, TBI and mTBI have been the most pervasive and consistently on the rise worldwide. Hence, current research efforts have been made to investigate relevant brain areas, cortical and subcortical regions, and cognitive functions related to WM impairment in military personnel. The aim of this review is to identify brain areas, cortical and subcortical regions, and cognitive functions related to WM impairment in military personnel from a selection of recent studies in order to inform novel clinical applications, including cognitive rehabilitation methodologies, for the benefit of individuals suffering from WM impairment. Affected brain areas included the VLPFC, DLPFC, VMPFC, OFC, FP, hippocampus, dorsolateral and orbitofrontal striatal circuits, and caudate nucleus. Identified disruptions to cognitive functions included slower reaction times, lower WM performance and accuracy in delayed visual and verbal abilities, and worse neuropsychological performance. Future research should focus on the cross-examination of underexplored WM impairment causes and affected brain areas and cognitive functions.\n\nKeywords: military personnel, working memory, impairment, traumatic brain injury, cognitive impairment, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, striatal circuits",

          "abstract": "The number of dogs in Western countries has increased over the past 2 decades, whereas the number of children has remained stable or decreased. Many dog owners, including those with children, say that their pets are more important to them than any human. Presumably, the declining fertility rates contribute to the increasing value of dogs in the lives of people, and dogs fill an empty niche. The companion-dog cultural-runaway theory posits that the change in dog-keeping habits has both biological and cultural evolutionary roots. Human ancestors developed a cooperative breeding system 2 million years ago, with the community aiding in child-rearing. Because people currently do not perceive the level of social support and trust to which they are biologically adapted, they seek alternatives. One coping strategy may involve transferring genetically based prosocial attitudes, such as the tendency to engage in parental behavior, to dogs. Western culture supports this shift and portrays dog ownership positively. Moreover, the biological evolution of dogs, with the spread of short-headed, small-sized lapdogs, also contributes to them being viewed as “children.” Dogs may facilitate or hinder the restoration of human network complexity, but this area is currently largely unexplored.",

Our referential expressions help listeners efficiently find what we’re talking about by strategically adding color or material words as needed. But most conversations are about things that are not physically in front of us. In these cases, do we also use language to efficiently help a listener retrieve an item from memory? Across two experiments, we asked participants to describe images to help a listener recall each image. In Experiment 1 (total n = 600), participants spontaneously incorporated expectations about memorability, providing relatively more description for images that people expect to be less memorable. In Experiment 2 (n = 300), we replicated this pattern even when participants had no access to or knowledge of their listener’s prior experience. Interestingly, people’s descriptions were more aligned with subjective estimates of memorability, rather than objective, empirically-derived metrics. Together, this work provides new evidence that speakers spontaneously guide listeners’ mental processes to effectively facilitate their memory recall.",

          "abstract": "Class differences in aptitude testing are often attributed to working-class deficiencies in a host of basic cognitive skills. The present research challenges this deficit narrative in the context of logical reasoning. We argue that reasoning tests often privilege abstract styles of reasoning as a \"neutral\" benchmark and provide a poor match to social-cognitive competencies promoted in working-class contexts. We evaluate this hypothesis in archival data from an international study of mathematical aptitude (N = 158,216), a pre-registered nationally-representative experiment on logical deduction (N = 781), and an integrative data analysis (IDA) combining data from Study 2 with three supplemental studies (N = 2,269). In Study 1, reasoning items higher in social-relational content (i.e., mentions of people) yielded smaller class gaps among eighth-grade students from 46 countries. Study 2 and the IDA experimentally replicate and extend these findings, demonstrating that reframing an abstract reasoning task to recruit social-cognitive skills reduces class-based performance differences among adults. Study 2 and the IDA also highlight that these effects cannot be explained by the mere inclusion of real-world content (e.g., money, food), but are most robustly produced by content invoking social relations. Our results support a cultural-psychological account of reasoning performance, highlight working-class strengths in social reasoning, and point to inclusive approaches to testing as a way to attenuate social-class gaps in aptitude testing performance.",

          "abstract": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be quantified using a myriad of mathematical indices, but the lack of systematic and empirical comparison between these indices complicates the evaluation and interpretation of HRV data. This study assessed the reliability, consistency, and generalizability of the structural relationships among 89 HRV indices using a consensus-clustering approach. We analyzed 635 short-term resting-state electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from two samples of college students with differing psychological profiles. Results from a sample with elevated internalizing symptoms (N=233)—collected across two sessions, one week apart—were compared to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the HRV clusters. To further assess the stability and generalizability of these HRV clusters beyond individuals with elevated internalizing symptoms, these results were compared with a second sample not selected based on psychological symptoms (N=203). We identified 19 clusters of 70 HRV indices with cross-method, test-retest, and cross-sample robustness. Based on the robust empirical convergence and the relative popularity of some HRV indices in the extant literature, we recommend 13 HRV indices for short-term recordings of resting-state HRV (under 10 minutes): RMSSD, SDNN, RSA (Porges-Bohrer or Peak-to-Trough method), RSA (Gates method), SD1/SD2 or CSI, ApEn or SampEn, HF or LnHF, DFA α1, DFA α2, one of the MDFA α1 features, one of the MDFA α2 features, one of the heart rate asymmetry indices, and one of the heart rate fragmentation indices. This approach mitigates the biases that can arise from redundant or highly correlated indices, facilitates clearer interpretation, and enhances the validity of conclusions drawn from HRV analyses.",

          "abstract": "Computational models of auditory salience predict that acoustic change and divergence from prediction increase the salience of sound streams. Confirming these predictions, prior research has shown that acoustic change and unpredictable sound features are linked to increases in physiological arousal and disruption of concurrent task performance. However, it remains unclear whether linguistic features, such as phonemic and lexical/semantic surprisal, help drive attentional orienting, or whether instead attentional capture takes place prior to linguistic analysis. To address this question, we introduce a new technique for assessing attentional capture by naturalistic task-irrelevant speech. In this paradigm participants tap to a metronome while ignoring a spoken passage from an audiobook. Salient features of the task-irrelevant speech capture attention, increase arousal, and expand subjective time, leading to shifts in tap timing. We show that distortions of subjective time are driven not only by acoustic change but also by phonemic surprisal. Thus, attentional orienting to sound takes place after the initial stages of linguistic analysis.",

          "abstract": "Back in 1961, Donald Hebb established a classic paradigm for studying repetition learning: He asked participants to remember several memory sets for an immediate serial recall task and repeated one set multiple times throughout the experiment. Participants’ ability to recall the repeated set improved gradually with repetitions, thereby demonstrating repetition learning. Explaining this effect has concerned researchers for decades, as it provides key insights into how we form durable memory representations through repeated exposure. In this review, we revisit the dominant views on the mechanisms underlying repetition learning, thereby challenging two central assumptions: The assumption that repetition learning is gradual, and the assumption that it is implicit. We show how these views have emerged from flawed analytical approaches, summarize recent evidence strongly contradicting these claims, and present a re-analysis of previously published data to illustrate how correcting implausible analytical assumptions leads to different theoretical conclusions. We propose an updated theoretical framework of the cognitive mechanisms underlying repetition learning in which we integrate elements from previous models of the Hebb repetition effect with established models of episodic memory, thereby joining two branches of the memory literature.",

Nine graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) were conducted: for each disorder, across three time phases (assessment to start-of-treatment; start to mid-point of treatment; mid-point to end-of-treatment). Each GGM included 19 nodes, based on PHQ-9, GAD-7 and NHS TTad phobia scores, using residuals as indices of change for each node. \n\nNetworks of symptom change were largely similar. Estimated network matrix similarity ranged between r =.74 and r = .91 across disorders, with depression and GAD networks more similar to each other than to panic disorder. Networks varied over time within the same disorder, more so for panic disorder (r = .61-.63) than GAD (r = .86-.90) or depression (r = .87-.93). There were close links between changes in worry-related items and feeling nervous or anxious, and between depressed mood and anhedonia across all networks, as well as links between sleep disturbance, appetite, trouble relaxing and irritability.\n\nFindings suggest shared patterns of co-change across anxiety and depression. There is a potential indication that therapy may work by leveraging existing natural change mechanisms rather than by creating entirely new patterns of symptom interaction.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

Listeners can use rhythmic patterns to predict the timing of sounds and guide their perception and action. It is still unclear how rhythmic patterns are represented in the human mind. Here, we used a probabilistic model of auditory expectations to simulate the perception and production of rhythmic patterns. We modelled expectations in rhythmic sequences at three different levels of abstraction: as the predictability of absolute inter-onset intervals (IOI), ratios between successive intervals (ratio), and the direction of change of successive intervals (contour). Subsequently, we selected rhythms that varied maximally in their modeled predictability across the three levels of abstraction for three behavioral tasks: a target detection task in which the rhythm was not task-relevant (implicit task), a complexity rating task (explicit task), and a tapping task (motor task). We found that both ratio and contour affected behavioral responses across all tasks, with the largest effects in the explicit rating task. IOI only affected responses for the explicit and motor tasks, where the rhythm was task-relevant, and to a greater extent when an imprecise, categorical representation of IOI was assumed. These findings suggest that humans rely mostly on imprecise representations of rhythmic patterns, but may flexibly adapt their representation based on task demands.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions are influenced by personality traits such as approach-avoidance motives. However, it remains unclear how traits, states, and interpersonal perceptions interact to shape everyday social experiences – and for whom their interactions are most consequential. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing personality-in-context models and identifying mechanisms underlying deficits in interpersonal functioning. A two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment was conducted with 136 participants (N = 3,991 social interactions), who reported on motivational states, partner perceptions, and interaction preferences. The combined model integrating traits, states, and perceptions best predicted interaction preferences. Higher approach-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted increased interaction preference, whereas avoidance-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted lower interaction preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that maladaptive interpersonal functioning amplified the negative effects of avoidance trait and state motives on social evaluations. Integrating trait and state perspectives offers valuable insights for understanding social functioning, particularly in individuals at risk for interpersonal difficulties.",

          "abstract": "Since their inception, deepfake videos (i.e., AI generated or modified videos that depict a person saying or doing something they never did) have been primarily used to create non-consensual sexual imagery of women. We argue that false beliefs about the harms of deepfake technology (e.g., the idea that fake videos are not harmful because they are fake) encourage the watching, creation and sharing of deepfake content. We report on the development and validation of a 6-item deepfake myths acceptance scale (DMAS) over 3 studies (n = 1080) which consist of an Exploratory Factor Analysis, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis and a second Confirmatory Factor Analysis, which focused specifically on high-perpetrating populations. The scale has strong psychometric properties (Cronbach's α = .87) and moderately correlates with self-reported past behaviours and future intentions to watch, share, and create deepfakes.  The scale takes approximately 2 minutes to complete and is a useful tool for researchers who seek to understand the individuals and communities that produce and share deepfakes. We also encourage researchers to utilise the deepfake myth acceptance measure to assess the effectiveness of interventions at changing the attitudes/beliefs that underpin deepfake abuse.",

          "abstract": "The assumptions of standard tests such as the t-test, ANOVA and ordinary least squares regression are frequently violated. This can impact the desired error rates in statistical hypothesis testing. Robust tests like the Mann–Whitney U test and robust linear regression do not rely on assumptions such as normality and equal variances. Using them can counteract non-replicated findings that are just due to data anomalies, such as extreme values and outliers, which occur differently across studies. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives. Restricting to a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids generating multiple results, thus counteracting fishing for the desired, which can occur subtly. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and many robust methods are readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what it is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

          "abstract": "Background. Humans have cognitive abilities that enable them to decide about taking precautions, such as avoiding predators, detoxifying food, and possibly taking vaccinations. By hypothesis, these cognitive abilities include reasoning about and applying precaution rules, such as taking precautionary actions conditional upon being exposed to a hazard (i.e., perceived threat) and belief that the precautionary action protects against the hazard (i.e., coping appraisal). Whereas standard health psychology models typically treat the perceived threat and coping appraisal as two separate factors, the precaution rule entails that they should be treated in conjunction. In this study, we tested (i) whether people’s stated vaccination intentions are in line with reasoning according to the precaution rule, (ii) under which circumstances they reason according to the precaution rule, and (iii) how the perceived threat and coping appraisal are associated with individual differences in worldviews. Method. We used a cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N = 923–1,575) and a mixed-subject experiment (Study 2, N = 811) with respondents from the Netherlands. Results. While threat and coping appraisals were related to vaccination intentions, respondents did not reason according to the precaution rule, irrespective of the circumstances. The threat and coping appraisals were associated with participants’ worldviews and partially mediated the association between these worldviews and vaccination intentions. Conclusion. Vaccination intentions are related to appraisals about threat and coping, but people do not use these appraisals in the normative manner proposed by the precaution rule.",

          "abstract": "Elderly people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) immensely rely on arithmetic skills to lead an independent life. Activities such as medication management, financial transactions or using public transport require intact abilities to manipulate numbers with different arithmetic operations. However, research on cognitive deficits in PD has been focussing on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention or working memory so far – largely neglecting potential domain-specific aspects of numerical cognition (e.g., carry or problem size effect). These aspects should be addressed, as PD-immanent deterioration of domain-specific numerical areas and domain-general functions suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary (mediated by other cognitive deficits) arithmetic deficits, respectively. The current study systematically investigated arithmetic performance and effects in PD patients differing in cognitive impairment for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of arithmetic as well as the influence of domain-general factors. Besides healthy controls (HC), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were compared in arithmetic performance in the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The deficits consisted of problems in two-digit addition and subtraction and PD-MCI, as well as delayed arithmetic fact retrieval for single-digit multiplication and division in PD-NC and PD-MCI. Deficits were not domain-specific, as arithmetic effects (problem size, carry, and borrow effects) did not differ between the groups. Discriminant analyses showed that performance in addition, multiplication and division tasks could differentiate between PD-NC and PD-MCI. The study results help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of arithmetic deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Generalization enables individuals to apply knowledge derived from past experiences in novel situations, yet it is unclear whether common experimental paradigms probe the same underlying ability in early to middle childhood. We assessed 84 children aged 4, 6, and 8 years on four paradigms, namely statistical learning, associative inference, transitive inference, and categorization, and examined age effects and cross-task concordance. Accuracy increased with age in every task, but inter-task correlations were weak, suggesting that each paradigm might tap a partly distinct facet of generalization. Focused analyses of the associative and transitive inference task showed that older children’s success increasingly relied on memory for directly learned pairs. In younger children, the weak memory–generalization link diverged by task: 4- and 6-year-olds often solved transitive inferences without accurate pair memory, whereas such increased memory-independent generalization was not evident in associative inference. Computational modeling supported this pattern, indicating that younger children used value-based reinforcement learning to solve transitive problems, whereas 8-year-olds employed a pair-memory strategy. Taken together, our findings show that generalization develops through multiple pathways, underscoring the need for multi-indicator and model-based approaches to capture its multiple facets.",

          "authors": "Leyan Zheng; Leon Y. Xiao; Steve Sharman",
          "abstract": "Background/Aims: Loot boxes are randomised in-game monetisation mechanisms that share similarities with gambling. Although previous studies summarised the intricacy of loot box design based on random reward mechanism, there is no specific framework linking the characteristics of loot boxes with the gambling-related psychological factors. Therefore, this study aimed to explore loot box features and categorise them into different domains to analyse how these design elements incorporate gambling-related psychological principles to enhance player engagement and monetary expenditure in video games.\nMethods: Based on the Loot Box Features Model and researchers’ lived experience, we developed a codebook identifying 23 gambling-related features capturing six domains: (1) monetary manipulation &amp; investment, (2) psychological manipulation, (3) sensory gambling cues, (4) fear-of-missing-out mechanics, (5) reward structure &amp; probability systems, and (6) social dynamics. We conducted a coding exercise on the first hour of gameplay content from the 20 mobile games based on their grossing, excluding social casino games. Two researchers co-coded an initial subset separately and refined the framework before applying it to the remaining titles.\nFindings: All six domains appeared in the sample, with the highest prevalence in monetary manipulation, psychological manipulation, and fear-of-missing-out. Typical tactics included VIP schemes, limited-time discounts, variable-ratio reinforcement, rarity, and pity systems. The classic gambling resemblance was also found in some games. Social dynamics features showed the lowest prevalence.\nConclusion: This study developed a framework to summarise gambling-related psychological features of loot boxes and initially explored the prevalence of these features in the highest-grossing games. We conclude with a discussion of potential association between these identified features of loot boxes and their potential risks on game players. The limitation of this study is the limited number of sampling games, and the first one-hour recordings are not enough to present full views of these games. Future work should audit longer play windows and validate the framework across regions.",

Some immune signals may reflect assay bias or illness effects; immunogenetic approaches help disentangle cause and correlation. Genetic associations in the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) remain of unclear relevance to immunopathogenesis but warrant finer-resolution analysis. Integrating non-MHC risk variants with immunological data implicates especially adaptive immune cells in psychiatric pathogenesis. Epigenetic studies show that resting immune cells carry a ‘poised’ landscape encoding past exposures and predicting future responses, illuminating how genetic variability shapes illness risk from environmental “insults” such as stress and infection. While only some patients may have immune-driven symptoms, the tractability and accessibility of the immune system make it a compelling focus for stratification and therapeutics.",

          "authors": "Olga Poluektova; Simone Tonelli",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the role of ethnonationalist sentiment in shaping opposition to abortion in contemporary Europe. Far-right political movements increasingly deploy conspiracist narratives of “native population replacement” to evoke fears about demographic decline, cultural erosion, and the loss of traditional values. We argue that these fears manifest both outwardly, as prejudice toward perceived out-groups, and inwardly, as support for tightening social norms and opposition to practices such as abortion and voluntary childlessness, which are viewed as contributing to the in-group’s demographic and cultural decline. Accordingly, we expect out-group prejudice to be associated with opposition to these practices. To investigate these dynamics, we analyse data from the European Values Study, focusing on perceptions of abortion justifiability. We find that (1) prejudice toward people of other races, Muslims, and migrants is consistently linked to viewing abortion as less justifiable, even after controlling for ideological and socio-demographic factors; (2) these associations has grown stronger over time; and (3) are especially pronounced in countries with a larger share of foreign-born residents from ethnically distinct backgrounds. These findings suggest that abortion opposition in Europe is increasingly intertwined with ethnonationalist views.",

Hungarian residents with online gambling history will be informed that they will have the chance to gamble with real money on sports events. Following random allocation, half of the participants will be told that they will have the option to cash out their bets before the outcome of the sports event is known, while the other half will not. The study will compare the proportion of participants placing bets, bet sizes, and bet risks between the two groups. Furthermore, the study will explore the differential effects of the cash-out feature on specific high-risk subgroups.

          "abstract": "Purpose. Research on workplace violence has predominantly focused on individual, organizational, and situational risk factors associated with employee victimization. However, limited attention has been paid to the interactional processes that shape workplace violence events despite microsociological theories and evidence underscoring the critical role of face-to-face interactions in conflict situations. This paper proposes a microsociological approach to better understand how workplace encounters escalate into acts of victimization. Methodology. To exemplify the value of a microsociological approach, we analyze body-worn camera footage of a work situation that escalates into aggression between a ticket inspector and a bus passenger without a valid ticket. Using qualitative process analysis, we examine how interactional dynamics involving status and emotions shape the step-by-step progression of this high-risk encounter. Findings. We demonstrate how the imposition of a fine transforms the inspector-passenger interaction into a status negotiation, with passenger aggression emerging in response to the inspector’s exercise of authority. Moreover, the inspector’s emotion management plays a key role in preventing the situation from escalating further into mutual displays of anger and aggression. This case illustrates how a micro-interactional analysis of risky work situations can reveal the mechanisms of violence and inform situational prevention strategies. Implications. We provide methodological and theoretical guidance for incorporating microsociological analysis into workplace violence research. Originality. This study demonstrates how a microsociological approach, grounded in a novel video-observational method, yields unique insights into the interactional dynamics that causally shape incidents of workplace violence.",

In three studies, we investigated the effects of Sonoception on emotional processing and inhibitory control, cortical processing of cardiac signals, and brain activation patterns. In Study 1, participants completed a Go/No-go task with faces showing disgusted or neutral expressions to assess the influence of the auditory stimulation on inhibitory control in emotional contexts. The 6Hz stimulation decreased false alarms for neutral faces, whereas the 2Hz stimulation increased false alarms for disgusted faces. This suggested a facilitatory effect of the 6Hz frequency on inhibitory control and a disinhibitory effect of the 2Hz frequency that enhanced impulsive responses. In Study 2, we assessed the heartbeat-evoked potentials as an index of heart-brain interaction and observed increased amplitude following 6Hz stimulation, suggesting enhanced cortical processing of cardiac signals. In Study 3, passive listening fMRI showed that the 6Hz stimulation selectively activated the left insula compared to the 2Hz condition. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Sonoception exerts distinct effects on behavioral, physiological, and neural functions, supporting the hypothesis that auditory frequency-specific stimulation can modulate cognitive-emotional functions, brain-body interactions and insular activation patterns.",

Across thematic focus, moral foundations, personal values, and emotional tone, most differentiation arose between churches, with smaller effects between denominations, and minimal variation between counties. Churches differentiated their sermons across several dimensions, including the use of high-arousal positive emotions and traditional moral values. Denominations differed in their endorsement of liberal versus conservative values and ritual content.

Using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling of emotion self-reports, we found that greater affective reactivity to gains and losses within the task was associated with more severe symptoms of both anxiety and hypomania.

In Phase 1 (N = 101; ~1,000 responses), participants completed digital forced-choice surveys in which they compared 65 robot-to-human kindness scenarios drawn from four categories—Emotional Support, Practical Help, Social Awareness, and Family &amp; Child Support—or ranked actions within a single category. Phase 2 (N = 918; ~9,086 responses; U.S.-only) replicated all scenarios and added four extensions: (a) a human-to-human comparison condition for every action, (b) Likert ratings (1–7) of perceived kindness alongside preferences, (c) random assignment to one of four between-subject survey versions (Robot→Human Preference; Robot→Human Likert; Human→Human Preference; Human→Human Likert), and (d) gender demographics. Across phases, results show that choices are not statistically random; clear patterns emerge at both the category and scenario levels. Phase 2 reveals robust actor effects (robots vs. humans), category-level differences, and systematic convergences and divergences between perceived kindness and choice. Together, these findings refine how kindness is evaluated when enacted by robots versus humans and surface design targets for emotionally intelligent, user-centered robots.",

          "abstract": "Bushfires are anticipated to become more severe in Australia due to climate change. However, Australians have a long history with bushfires, making them part of the Australian identity. We theorise that Australian identity would therefore lead people to be less likely to subjectively attribute bushfires to climate change and in turn be less supportive of climate policy. This pre-registered, cross-sectional study examined these relationships using a representative Australian sample (N = 5038). In support of our hypotheses, subjective attribution partly explained the relationship between Australian identity and climate policy support. Specifically, those higher in Australian identity were less likely to attribute bushfires to climate change, which reduced their climate policy support. These findings expand our understanding of how differences in the content of a country’s national identity can impact climate outcomes and suggest that public campaigns should consider how appeals to national identity may influence climate policy support.",

          "authors": "Martin S Hagger",
          "abstract": "I propose a mechanism by which trait or dispositional constructs, such as intrapersonal constructs (e.g., traits from factor models of personality such as conscientiousness and extroversion) and other trait-like constructs (e.g., trait self-control, health literacy, and political beliefs), and perceptions or interpretations of social structure (e.g., income, education, and socioeconomic status), on subsequent intentions toward, and actual performance of, a future target behavior. The mechanism builds on prior generalized proposals put forward by the original proponents and advocates of the social cognition theories that have been typically used to predict behavior and provide insight into the mechanisms involved. I begin with a broad overview of social cognition theories, often referred to as reasoned action or rationale decision theories, and their general assumptions, predictions, commonalities in constructs, and evidence base. Next, I propose, and formally state, the current mechanism in which trait and dispositional constructs relate to intentions and subsequent behavior indirectly through the mediation of the sets of belief-based social cognition constructs that are proximally antecedent to intentions and behavior. Building on original social cognition theory proposals, I emphasize the informational function of the traits and dispositions, and individuals’ alignment of beliefs such that they are trait-consistent, as explanations for the proposed mechanism. I also outline the nascent research in the field that offers preliminary evidence to support the mechanism, and highlight some caveats and avenues for future research. Finally, I propose a trait-informed attitude, cognition, and intention tenet (TACIT) as a candidate label for the mechanism.",

Using validated instruments, we employed linear regression models to analyze trends and Cohen’s d to pinpoint critical transition points, with analyses stratified by gender and school type. Results revealed a non-linear trajectory, characterized by a significant decline in most attitude and identity constructs during the transition to secondary school (6th-7th grade), followed by a rebound in the 8th-grade cohort. This decline was more pronounced among girls, particularly in self-efficacy and Science Identity. While both school types showed a similar decrease in Science Identity, private schools exhibited a protective effect on students' self-efficacy and perceived utility of science. Findings indicate that the attitudinal decline is not linear but concentrated in key transitions and is significantly moderated by gender and school context.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their perceived task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested whether pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., “Limited Prosocial Emotions”) characterize a particularly severe group of antisocial youth. “Secondary” CU traits, as opposed to “primary,” are distinguished by co-occurring anxiety and are theorized to reflect an acquired phenotype that develops through an interaction between heightened emotional sensitivity and prolonged adversity exposure. The aim of this study was to test this pathway in a large, diverse sample spanning late childhood (age 9-10) to middle adolescence. Methods. Data were drawn from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, with youth (N = 11, 880; Mage = 10; 48% female) assessed annually over five timepoints. Retrospective and prospective analyses examined the effects of emotional sensitivity and different forms of adversity on the development of CU traits. Results. Retrospective analyses showed no main or interactive effects of emotional sensitivity and adversity during late childhood in predicting secondary CU traits by adolescence. Instead, a significant interaction (B = .21, SE = .06, p &lt; .001, RRR = 1.24) was found such that higher overall adversity and emotional sensitivity together increased risk for primary, not secondary, CU traits. Prospective analyses among emotionally sensitive (≥90th percentile) youth with no CU traits (n = 365, age ~10) similarly showed no forms of cumulative adversity predicted increases in or the onset of “elevated” CU traits after four years. Conclusions. Findings did not support a distinct adversity-linked pathway to secondary CU traits via emotional sensitivity. Instead, results were consistent with alternative models in which secondary CU traits reflect a comorbid profile marked by broader clinical severity or overlapping liabilities (e.g., negative affectivity, internalizing risk).",

          "abstract": "Clothing size labels have been shown to influence women's mood, self-esteem, and body satisfaction. This study examined the effects of different sizing nomenclatures—specifically color-based versus category-based labeling—on women's body satisfaction, weight concerns, feelings of fatness, and mood. Participants attended a lab-based session in which their body measurements were taken, and size feedback was provided according to their assigned labeling condition. State mood, feeling fat, weight concern, and body dissatisfaction were measured at three time points: before measurement, after measurement, and after receiving feedback. Contrary to expectations, the results showed no significant changes across time points, nor any interactions between labeling conditions and time. These findings challenge previous research linking clothing size feedback to women's body image and emotional well-being, suggesting that the format of size labeling may not meaningfully affect body image outcomes. While some participants expressed a desire to reform the current sizing system, many remained indifferent to the nomenclature used.\nFuture research should explore other aspects of clothing experiences, such as fit, garment type, and shopping context—to better capture the complex relationship between clothing and women's body image and mood.",

Using an extended Kuramoto framework with additional global coupling terms, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that weak electromagnetic interactions can enhance phase coherence (R = 0.61 ± 0.04) across neural populations. The model achieves stable synchronization with parameters λ = 0.9 and G = 0.015, suggesting that long-range field effects may complement local synaptic connectivity in enabling large-scale neural integration. These results provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for field theories of consciousness while remaining grounded in biophysical principles.

Participants completed the task either alone or in groups of five with different types of social information and resource speeds. Contrasting earlier work, participants in groups outperformed solitary individuals, but only when payoff information was available. High-resolution visual field data and movement trajectories revealed that payoff visibility prompted adaptive recalibration of visual information flow, thereby enabling flexible adaptation. Computational models of fine-grained movement decisions and agent-based simulations showed that payoff information let participants dynamically identify and selectively respond to reliable social cues, thus unlocking the group's collective potential.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin conductance responses (SCR), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), and electrocortical activity indexed by frontal alpha asymmetry (FAAS), as well as self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited anticipatory HR slowing before stimulus onset, suggesting threat-related preparation. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, pre-stimulus HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

          "abstract": "Visual memory and visual imagery are closely intertwined cognitive functions, yet whether visual memory necessarily deteriorates when visual imagery is impaired remains unresolved. Aphantasia, the inability to voluntarily generate mental images, provides a compelling model to address this issue. However, previous reports of preserved or subtle deficits in aphantasia may have stemmed from tasks with low cognitive demands, coarse measures, and memory content lacking fine-grained demands, thereby limiting sensitivity to genuine impairments. Using high-load paradigms and continuous precision measures with mixture modelling, we tested colour memory, a domain requiring fine-grained representation, to examine whether these conditions would reveal pronounced impairments in aphantasia. Experiment 1 (20 aphantasic, 20 controls) tested colour memory for six sets of 20 objects (15 meaningful, 5 meaningless). Meaningless objects were included to further minimise verbal labelling. All object colours were sampled from the Hue–Saturation–Value (HSV) space, a perceptually uniform colour space. Recall was assessed using a continuous colour wheel, and performance was analysed with a computational mixture model that decomposed response errors into retrieval success (whether a colour was retrieved) and precision (how accurately it was remembered). Results revealed that aphantasic individuals showed markedly larger errors than controls, driven by reduced retrieval success rather than precision. Moreover, error magnitude and retrieval success correlated with several imagery dimensions (e.g., object imagery, spontaneous use of imagery), whereas retrieval precision was not. Experiment 2 (18 aphantasic, 20 controls) further tested whether deficits extend beyond colour using an analogous size-memory task with a slider. No group differences were observed in size error, retrieval success, or precision, and no correlations were observed between memory and several imagery-related aspects. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that visual imagery is indispensable for retrieval success but not for precision when accessing visual memory traces for object colour, and that this indispensability may not extend to all object features.",

We studied undergraduate participants (N = 133) in a climate crisis class (intervention condition) and participants not enrolled in the class (control condition). All were required to answer questions about their knowledge at two time points (separated by nine weeks), while we measured real-world collective action in the intervention condition through the 9 weeks as well as several self-reported beliefs. First, as preregistered, we found that some knowledge items as well as self-reported collective efficacy increased significantly for the intervention compared to control participants. Second, in the intervention group itself, and contrary to our preregistration, there were no significant relationships between knowledge / belief elements and real-world collective action, even though many participants engaged in substantial action. These results raise questions about how analytic knowledge of the climate and ecological predicament is measured, and how it is taught. They also point to the need for research of this kind to also measure how non-analytic elements, such as group dynamics, drive collective action participation. Finally, the study pioneers new methods for measuring real-world collective action in a class setting that goes beyond typical studies of hypothetical intentions to act.",

          "abstract": "Background: Meditation-based interventions (MBIs) hold promise for enhancing health and well-being. However, substantial barriers impede engagement in traditional forms of these interventions. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. A particular mobile health innovation – Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) – has the potential to enhance the accessibility, acceptability, and efficacy of MBIs. However, there is limited research on EMIs integrated into MBIs (i.e., meditation-based [MB]-EMIs). This conceptual paper aims to make a theoretical case for MB-EMIs to highlight their potential and to inform future studies on MB-EMIs. Methods: We discuss the historical context, conceptual foundations, motivation for adoption, and empirical evidence supporting the potential of EMIs. Additionally, we explore the conceptual intersections between EMIs and both traditional contemplative sources and contemporary secular MBIs. Furthermore, we describe empirical studies on MB-EMIs. Findings/Results: Studies have demonstrated diverse approaches to integrating EMIs into MBIs. These studies exhibit variability in key dimensions, including the MBI with which the EMI is integrated and the characteristics of the EMI itself. MB-EMIs have therapeutic potential, but there are many important scientific questions about them that have not yet been answered. Conclusions: Future studies should continue to examine the impact and safety of meditation-based EMIs, leverage innovations in passive data collection, explore user experiences, develop these interventions for and with marginalized populations, and emphasize informal meditation practice. As the field matures, systematic reviews or meta-analyses will be essential to map the full landscape of MB-EMIs.",

A sample of young adults (n=144) spanning the social dysfunction spectrum completed measures that capture different forms of psychopathology relevant to social dysfunction, from which two dimensions – namely Social Negative Affect (SNA) and Social Disengagement (SD) – were extracted using Principal Components Analysis. Participants additionally completed a variety of clinician-rated and self-reported social functioning measures that were aggregated into one overall social functioning score. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the unique contribution of SNA and SD and their interaction on overall social functioning. SNA and SD explained unique variance (Δr2=46.3%), indicating that elevated SNA and SD levels predicted worse social functioning. The SNA-by-SD interaction was positive and explained significant additional amounts of variance (Δr2=2.9%), indicating a less-than-additive effect on social dysfunction. These effects remained significant after controlling for intellectual functioning. The findings suggest that examining social behaviors and affect simultaneously is important for understanding social functional outcomes in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on a defendant’s psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility - including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Mental health professionals’ approach to settled insanity cases will map well onto the relevant body of clinical psychological science. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, M_age=37.66, M_experience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often use circular reasoning to disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and unnecessarily complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

Voxel-wise analysis using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was also conducted. \nResults: Global FA and RD differed significantly in girls at FHR for EDs versus HC in unadjusted analyses, but differences did not persist following covariate adjustment. TBSS revealed a significant cluster of reduced FA in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) in the FHR group (p &lt; .05, Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)-corrected). Exploratory analyses stratified by maternal diagnosis showed similar FA reductions in girls of mothers with Anorexia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder, with overlapping involvement of the IFOF. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that WM-alterations in fronto-parietal associative tracts may represent early neurobiological markers of EDs vulnerability. Further research in larger, longitudinal samples is needed to confirm these preliminary results and clarify their potential as trait markers.",

          "authors": "Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort; Simon van Gaal; Timo Stein",
          "abstract": "Science requires objective measurements to be able to falsify predictions, whereas consciousness is thought to be intrinsically personal and subjective. Consequently, behavioral measures of consciousness are often designated as “objective” or “subjective”. Surprisingly however, the exact meaning of the terms objective and subjective is typically not clearly defined. Moreover, applying this label to a given behavioral measure is misleading, as the same measure can often be analyzed within a “subjective” or “objective” framework. Thus, the objective-subjective designation is not only relevant to the measure that is used, but to several other dimensions as well. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of dichotomies along which one might conceptualize the difference between objective and subjective approaches, such as the empirico-analytical method (manipulation vs trial-by-trial sorting), the mode of stimulus presentation (forced-choice vs nonforced-choice), the response type (Type 1 vs Type 2), and the adoption of a ground truth when computing the outcome measure (performance vs appearance). Although these dichotomies often overlap, the correspondence between them is typically only partial. Problems and pitfalls are discussed. Finally, advice is formulated to always explicitly outline how one’s stimulus presentation, task, response measure, and analysis approach score on these dichotomies, requiring further explicit justification when claiming to capture “consciousness” as a construct.",

          "authors": "K. T. A. Sandeeshwara Kasturiratna; Andree Hartanto",
          "abstract": "NOTE. Please refer to Version 2 for the corrected AI Attachment Scale items.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into daily life, not only as tools but also as social partners that people may turn to for interaction and support. This raises important questions about whether, how, and why individuals form attachment-like bonds with AI, and what psychological implications such attachments may carry. Across five studies involving 1259 participants from Singapore and the US, the current work developed and validated the AI Attachment Scale and investigated the dispositional and motivational factors that predict attachment to AI, as well as its emotional and social outcomes. The AI Attachment Scale displayed strong psychometrics properties, including a reliable three-factor structure comprising of emotional closeness, social substitution, and normative regard subscales, strong convergent validity and discriminant validity, and high test–retest reliability. Examination of correlates revealed that time spent on AI, particularly for socioemotional purposes, was a strong predictor of AI attachment. Individuals higher in social anxiety, loneliness, and anxious attachment were also more likely to turn to AI as a compensatory surrogate when human connections were lacking. These tendencies were further linked to dispositional needs that AI fulfils, including closure through predictability, relatedness through socioemotional presence, and competence through affirming feedback. At the same time, stronger AI attachment is associated with heightened positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting that AI attachment may satisfy the psychological needs and provide meaningful emotional benefits. These findings provide the first validated measure of attachment to AI and offer a foundation for future research on its psychological and societal implications.",

          "abstract": "Children’s intergroup attitudes emerge early in development; yet, most research has focused on contexts where egalitarian values are formally promoted, while structural inequalities remain implicit. Less is known about how these attitudes develop in conflictual sociocultural settings marked by visible exclusion and power asymmetries. This study addresses this gap by examining intergroup preferences among preschool-aged children in two sociopolitically stratified yet understudied contexts: Lebanon and Romania. We investigated how children evaluate peers from their ingroup, a stigmatized outgroup (Syrians in Lebanon, Roma in Romania), and a valued outgroup (French). In both studies, children completed a physical distance task and a friendship choice task. \nIn Study 1 (N = 94, Mage = 4.13 years, SDage = 0.83 years; 42 girls), distinct photographs were used for each group. Children showed a strong preference for the valued outgroup and consistently rejected the stigmatized outgroup across both tasks. These results were observed even among the youngest participants. In Study 2 (N = 87, Mage = 4.98 years; SDage = 0.82 years; 45 girls), the same photographs were used, and only group labels were varied. When physical appearance was held constant, the preference for the valued outgroup disappeared. Children instead favored the ingroup and continued to reject the stigmatized outgroup, indicating that labeling alone was sufficient to elicit exclusion.\nThese findings underscore the robustness of early bias against stigmatized groups, the sensitivity of young children to symbolic group labels, and the powerful role of both visual and social cues. They support the Integrative Developmental-Contextual Theory and highlight the urgency of early, context-sensitive interventions.\nKeywords: Early intergroup attitudes, Conflictual settings, Preschoolers, Physical distance, Affiliation",

          "abstract": "Learning is most effective when individuals actively engage with new information, \nexperimenting and integrating experiences to build meaningful understanding. Since it is \nrecognized as an active rather than a passive process, several factors may influence how \neffectively individuals engage with new information. One such factor is the sense of agency, \nwhich refers to the subjective feeling of control over one’s actions and may be important for \nlearning, as it transforms experience from passive observation into active understanding. The \npresent study aims to investigate whether differences in the sense of agency will affect \nimplicit learning by using an artificial grammar learning task. Participants were assigned to \neither an active condition, where they had full control over responses, or a passive condition, \nwhere they had much limited control. Subsequently, they rated their perceived control. \nResults revealed that participants in the active condition reported a stronger sense of agency \nand achieved higher accuracy than those in the passive condition. Both groups improved over \nrepeated trials, but the active group consistently performed better than the passive group. \nOverall, our study demonstrated that a sense of agency plays an important role in shaping \nimplicit learning, thus suggesting that learning is more effective when individuals feel in \ncontrol of their actions.",

There is limited research which has investigated qualitative, narrative, experiences of men convicted of sexual offences on a treatment programme in prison. Further, there is limited existing consideration of evaluating idiographic trajectories of members’ data and narratives in an intervention. Our aim was to examine personal narratives in relation to wellbeing and programme engagement, as expressed in self-reflective diaries to capture the treatment experience over time. Along with psychometric wellbeing data, we statistically and narratively analysed group-level and personalised trajectories in the sample. In both types of analysis, we found that the mental wellbeing of the group improved. Group participation appeared to have implications for the development of a prosocial identity, which is known to be linked to desistance. Through the weekly personal narratives, we saw resistance to group-based sessions and discussions about sex, moving to more positive future- and skills-oriented discourse. Taken together, this paper shows the value of mixed methods within-programme evaluations.",

          "authors": "Lukas Schellenberg; Wiebke Bleidorn; Peter Haehner",
          "abstract": "Understanding when and why people become lonely is of theoretical and practical relevance. Personality traits and loneliness have been theorized to reciprocally influence each other over time. However, longitudinal research on personality-loneliness transactions remains scarce, yielded inconsistent findings, and shares methodological limitations. To advance understanding of the longitudinal transactions between loneliness and personality traits, the present study analyzed data from three nationally representative large-scale panel studies (N = 63,555). Meta-analytic aggregation of the findings across datasets showed that, at the within-person level, increases in extraversion (β = −0.04), conscientiousness (β = −0.02), and emotional stability (β = −0.03) predicted decreases in loneliness 4 years later. In turn, increases in loneliness predicted decreases in extraversion (β = −0.03), agreeableness (β = −0.02), conscientiousness (β = −0.02), and emotional stability (β = −0.02) 4 years later. Notably, effect sizes differed substantially across the individual datasets. Overall, the present findings highlight the dynamic relationship between loneliness and personality traits, indicating that traits not only shape but also adapt to changes in loneliness. Personality traits therefore represent an important factor in understanding, preventing, and reducing loneliness.",

Four advertisement types were combined: two headlines (empathic vs. informational) and two descriptions (with vs. without expertise). The outcomes were ad click and conversion rates for the three landing-page actions (self-check for mental health, self-care, and consultation services).\nResults: Empathic headlines increased click and self-check rates, suggesting their effectiveness in promoting early-stage engagement. In contrast, informational headlines were effective in promoting access to consultation services. Expertise cues decreased access to self-care and consultation services, yet increased access to self-care with empathic headlines.\nLimitations: This study examined a limited set of ad elements, was conducted in Tokyo for a limited period, and used Japanese-language advertisements and webpages. Additionally, conversion outcomes may have been influenced by the structure of the multifunction landing page.\nConclusion: Empathic messages facilitate early-stage behaviors, whereas informational messages promote access to information about consultation services. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring ad messages to users’ stage of help-seeking and life issue areas in digital suicide prevention strategies.",

While such inferential abilities help early knowledge acquisition, their computations and neural bases are not understood. Here, we collect optical brain-imaging and oculomotor data while preverbal infants watch simple scenes requiring disjunctive syllogism to identify an unknown object. These scenes elicited greater hemodynamic activation in bilateral temporoparietal and left-frontal regions, compared to controls. Oculomotor responses signaled higher processing load at two logically relevant moments: when something unknown (x; A or B) can be represented, and when a non-visible object can be identified via inference (not A, therefore B). These responses were similar to those previously described in adults, but the mostly bilateral response differs from the left-lateralized pattern characterizing mature brains, suggesting that the same functional operations are realized in neural circuits which maturation, experience, or language learning modify into a more specialized cortical organization.",

          "authors": "Hugo Alexander Fleming; Gloria Feng; Robb Rutledge; Jonathan Paul Roiser; Oliver Joe Robinson",
          "abstract": "Pavlovian biases are patterns of behaviour that involve approaching stimuli associated with reward and avoiding those associated with punishment (regardless of whether this is actually optimal behaviour). They are an ubiquitous feature of everyday decision-making, and are also believed to play an important role in the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although Pavlovian biases have classically been described as fixed and automatic, some studies have indicated that their influence on behaviour can actually vary over time and with task demands. While these results hint that people may have some control over their Pavlovian biases, direct behavioural evidence for this control is still lacking. In a preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study (N = 800), we tested whether a week-long cognitive training intervention could reduce Pavlovian biases on the Orthogonalised Go/No-Go task, a well-established paradigm for isolating Pavlovian-instrumental conflict. Participants were trained on either high-conflict or no-conflict conditions of the task across five days. Using reinforcement learning models to dissociate components of decision-making, we found that high-conflict training led to a significant reduction in Pavlovian bias—particularly avoidance bias—at follow-up. This result is incompatible with the view that Pavlovian biases are fixed and automatic, and instead implies much greater flexibility in the way that they influence cognition than has previously been understood. The training was kept deliberately simple (i.e. one stimulus per condition, with the correct responses kept constant over sessions) so as to provide a minimal proof of concept of whether Pavlovian biases can be reduced through training, but as a result we did not observe transfer to other tasks or self-reported mood. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that targeted cognitive training can modulate Pavlovian biases, which may be beneficial both in everyday life and especially in the context of affective disorders like anxiety and depression.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings are based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalyzed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 &lt; BF_{10} &lt; 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF_{10} &gt; 3 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/3), and fewer than twenty percent were strongly supported (BF_{10} &gt; 10 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more robust results. \nOur study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that results are flawed but rather suggest caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "abstract": "Classic psychedelics profoundly influence emotional states, eliciting intense acute emotional experiences followed by subtle, sustained changes in emotional reactivity lasting up to several weeks. While clinical studies with controlled participant screening, dosing, and settings provide evidence for these effects, the impact of psychedelics is highly context-dependent. Thus, it remains unclear whether naturalistic, less-controlled psychedelic use similarly modulates emotional reactivity. To address this, our preregistered, cross-sectional fMRI study compared experienced psychedelic users (≥10 lifetime experiences; N = 33) with a matched group of non-users (N = 34) on behavioral and neural responses to emotional facial expressions. Psychedelic users demonstrated faster and more accurate recognition of angry facial expressions, suggesting reduced interference from threat-related stimuli during task performance. Whole-brain fMRI analyses revealed diminished neural responses to anger in limbic and salience network regions, coupled with enhanced responses to happiness in parietal and sensorimotor areas, consistent with prior clinical findings. Additionally, users showed increased precuneus activation in response to fearful facial expressions. Region-of-interest analyses further indicated reduced differentiation of emotional categories in two default mode network regions—the frontal medial cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. In conclusion, our study provides a nuanced view of neurofunctional alterations in emotional processing associated with naturalistic psychedelic use, advancing our understanding of its potential long-term effects.",

          "abstract": "Anger is prevalent in chronic pain (CP), often co-occurring with heightened distress and disability. The complexity of the anger construct manifests in heterogeneity of how anger is experienced, expressed, and regulated. Nevertheless, most work does not consider the inter-relationships between multiple dimensions of anger, limiting understanding of how anger might differentially contribute to pain outcomes. Here, various anger metrics and latent profile analysis (LPA) were utilized to identify disparate anger profiles in people with CP. Whether these profiles associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally with pain outcomes was subsequently examined. Data was collected from 735 treatment-seeking adult patients with CP of varied etiologies, of which 242 also completed follow-up assessments about 5 months after baseline. Anger measures included state and trait anger, anger expression (anger-in, anger-out), anger control (control-in, control-out), and perceived injustice. Pain outcomes included pain- intensity, distribution, interference, and behavior, and physical function. LPA identified four distinct anger profiles characterized by the combination of varying levels (low, medium, high) of anger and of perceived injustice. These profiles significantly associated with pain outcomes at both baseline and follow-up, above and beyond anxiety and depression. Profiles with medium-to-high levels of both anger (state, trait, and expression) and perceived injustice predicted the worst pain outcomes, suggesting that injustice-based profiling should be prioritized for anger-related stratification of risk in CP. The mechanistic and prognostic value of these anger profiles suggests that early assessment could enhance long-term treatment planning and advance personalized pain care, further emphasizing the need for tailored, anger-focused, patient-specific interventions.",

Findings revealed varied levels of internalized stigma, with some participants feeling ashamed or uncomfortable, and others perceiving menstruation neutrally. Anticipated stigma, stemming from societal views linking menstruation to femininity, led to fears of misgendering and medical discrimination. Enacted stigma included negative reactions and limited access to menstrual products and suitable restroom infrastructure. Participants resisted intersectional stigma by reframing menstruation positively or neutrally, and urged for the promotion of inclusivity.

          "abstract": "In creative fields, individual talent is often considered paramount for fame and success. However, forming social bonds, particularly romantic relationships with influential individuals, may also play a crucial role in career advancement. In this study, we investigate the associations between an individual’s fame in one creative industry and their engagement in romantic relationships with partners working in similar occupations, industries or sectors (referred to as ‘occupational homogamy’), as well as with famous partners. The French music industry, known for its numerous high-profile creative couples, provides a compelling context for this exploration. We conducted a web-based analysis of biographical data from 253 prominent French-speaking singers born in the 20th century, examining three Internet-derived metrics of fame (i.e., total number of hits, Wikipedia page length in octets and total number of pageviews), the timing of their musical hits, and the formation of romantic relationships. Data were primarily sourced from Wikipedia, press articles, and the Infodisc database, which lists musical success records in France since 1900. We found that occupational homogamy was common, with nearly two-thirds of singers engaging in at least one such relationship, more often women than men. Homogamy was positively associated with fame metrics (Wikipedia views, article length, chart hits). Relationships with celebrity partners did not yield additional visibility beyond homogamous non-celebrity ties, underscoring occupational proximity as the main channel. Sequencing analyses showed that a significant proportion of singers formed homogamous ties before their first hit, though these only modestly predicted later fame. This study suggests that, beyond talent and passion, forming a creative collaborative couple may both promote and accompany a rise in the occupational hierarchy, particularly in this competitive industry.",

          "abstract": "Little research has investigated explanatory models and treatments for mental health in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, diagnostic systems and interventions remain limited in their ability to identify and effectively treat psychological disorders across diverse cultural contexts in the region. Contrary to Western conceptions, mental health in sub-Saharan Africa is nested within pan-African cultural values and knowledge systems, which prioritize community, ancestral and family needs over individual ones. These systems offer important insights for uncovering yet-unknown aspects of mental health. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we evaluated 133 studies on mental health in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed each study for emic (culture-specific understanding of symptoms), etic (importing systems to assess universal aspects) or combined (merging both universal and culture-specific elements) approaches; study design; research location, and author-characteristics (e.g., proportion of authors from the region). Imported (etic) methodologies predominated (69.4%), though the majority (56.7%) of first authors were affiliated with sub-Saharan African institutions. Studies were nearly evenly split between observational and interventional designs. Research was geographically concentrated in South African metropolitan areas, while Central Africa was notably underrepresented. Within South Africa, although overall studies emphasized universal aspects, emic approaches were more common when studies were led by regional first authors, compared to other sub-Saharan contexts. Despite this, the predominance of foreign funding and training in South Africa may still privilege etic approaches; shifting decision-making power to local researchers could tip the distribution of emic and etic studies. Mental health research in sub-Saharan Africa continues to rely heavily on importing outside diagnostic frameworks and interventions, which de-emphasize local African knowledge systems. At the same time, findings also present a more nuanced picture of the current state of mental health research in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting avenues for further research and underscoring the need for more blended emic-etic approaches, locally funded researchers, and a broader cultural representation outside of South Africa. A blended emic-etic approach, which balances universals and incorporates region-and language-specific cultural concepts, is discussed. This approach ensures relevant clinical care in sub-Saharan Africa and has the potential to advance knowledge in mental health, globally.",

Although robust evidence shows that subliminal affective stimuli bias emotional perception, social behavior, and decision-making through transient priming, it remains unknown whether these influences persist beyond the immediate exposure period. Across four experiments (N = 105) utilizing delayed facial discrimination tasks, we demonstrate that subliminal affective information is not only stored in nonconscious working memory (Experiment 1), but also actively maintained against suprathreshold interference (Experiment 2). This representation retains abstract affective content rather than precise identity details (Experiment 3). Crucially, these latent affective trace drive valence-congruent misattribution onto subsequently encountered neutral faces (Experiment 4), establishing affective misattribution as a consequence of nonconscious working memory. This study provides a novel mechanism for affect-as-information theory, revealing the continuous influence of subliminal affective information on supraliminal processing. It also deepens our understanding of the irrational underpinnings in behavioral economics by tracing their origins to latent biases in affective memory.",

          "authors": "NA; Markus Gangl",
          "abstract": "This study examines how rising income inequality has been impacting individuals' belief in merit-based success, using three decades of survey data from 39 advanced capitalist democracies. Challenging the seminal finding of a \"paradox of inequality,\" we find no evidence of a positive effect of inequality on meritocratic beliefs across countries. Instead, we identify a substantively moderate but robustly negative effect of inequality on perceptions of meritocracy from within-country changes over time: as inequality rises, citizens’ belief in meritocracy declines. We further uncover that inequality does not merely induce a mean shift, but affects the shape of the distribution of meritocracy beliefs insofar as we find the proportion of sceptical perceptions of meritocratic realities to be increasing with higher levels of inequality. Our findings thus suggest that growing inequality undermines citizens’ trust in procedural fairness and contributes to an increased polarisation of attitudes and beliefs at the heart of open societies.",

          "authors": "Elena-María García-Alonso",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) shapes the reproduction of educational inequalities from a sociological perspective. It argues that AI systems are not neutral tools but socio-technical artifacts embedded in power relations that influence knowledge, pedagogical practices, and structures of legitimacy.\nThe analysis highlights three dimensions through which inequality is reproduced: digital divides that go beyond access and include skills and algorithmic literacy; structural and cultural biases embedded in AI processes such as admission, assessment, and adaptive learning; and algorithmic governmentality, which governs education through surveillance, metrics, and automated feedback, producing new forms of subjectivity oriented toward efficiency rather than critical thinking.\nThe article concludes that AI in education is an ethical and political challenge. It calls for inclusive and contextualized platform design, critical training for teachers, participatory co-design of evaluation systems, and governance mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability. From the sociology of education, promoting digital environments that are democratic, inclusive, and emancipatory is essential to achieve educational justice in the age of AI.",

          "abstract": "Framing contests often ensue around levels of protest violence and who the perpetrators are, and such frames can be out of step with the actual violent or peaceful nature of protests. During the 2020 racial justice protests, many capitalized on dramatic images of violence and property damage to frame the protests as violent with the left-wing group Antifa as the culprit. Drawing on event data and news reports covering the 2020 racial justice protests and comparing to historical U.S. protest data, we examine the central claims of this framing contest. We find that this wave of racial justice protests was more peaceful than Civil Rights protests of the 1960’s and that Antifa was present at only a handful of events which turned violent. We also find that media attention to Antifa corresponded with declining support for BLM, suggesting that scapegoating Antifa led to a decline in support of the movement.",

          "abstract": "This paper uses original panel data from Senegal to evaluate the effect of co-residence with elderly individuals on the educational attainment of female children. To identify this effect, I exploit the deaths of elderly co-residents which occur during the study period in an empirical strategy which relies on triple-differences with child fixed-effects. I show that an event of elderly death is associated with 23% additional education completed over a period of 4 years by affected girls. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving among older female children within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results highlight the importance of female teenagers in caregiving activities and suggest that policies that increase the availability of formal care for the elderly could reduce gender inequalities in education in contexts similar to Senegal.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates whether consumer ratings of hotel eco-friendliness reflect actual sustainability performance. Using data from 6,696 hotels in the world’s 100 leading destinations, we compared Expedia’s post-travel, customer-submitted eco-friendliness ratings with sustainability information reported on Booking.com, including both self-reported practices and third-party certifications. Support Vector Machine regression analysis shows that eco-friendliness ratings are explained almost entirely by overall guest satisfaction, with sustainability indicators contributing little explanatory power. This suggests that ratings conflate general service impressions with perceptions of environmental responsibility, limiting their value as measures of sustainability performance. While plausible explanations such as response biases and the limited salience of many certified practices warrant further research, our findings provide robust evidence that single survey items on eco-friendliness should be interpreted with caution. For platforms and policymakers, the results highlight the need to make sustainability cues more visible and directly tied to the consumer experience if ratings are to support informed choice.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen; David Pannell",
          "abstract": "In analysing potential policy responses to improve outcomes in collective-action problems, economists often focus on financial disincentives to reduce the expected gains from free-riding and thereby promote within-group cooperation. In this study, we investigate the potential for groups to develop non-financial disincentives to free riding, thereby promoting convergence towards collectively beneficial actions. Using a within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants play two multi-period public-goods games sequentially: without and then with non-financial incentives activated by allowing for the endogenous formation of a social exclusion mechanism. This is operationalised by allowing participants, at a personal cost, to assign exclusion tickets to group members after observing their contributions: the member(s) having accumulated the most in their group gets excluded from a group activity not involving monetary payoffs nor linked to the main game. First, the threat of receiving exclusion tickets, then the threat of being excluded, and finally actually being excluded work as non-financial social disincentives to free ride. Results show that group members who contribute relatively less receive more exclusion tickets. By imposing expected social costs on relatively low contributors, exclusion or the threat of exclusion enables groups to operate with higher contribution levels, thereby reversing the collective decline in contributions observed in the Baseline public good game. Exclusion is experienced by individuals who consistently contribute less than other group members, and this experience amplifies the effectiveness of the subsequent exclusion threat. Willingness to incur personal costs to enhance the exclusion threat increases over time and it is shaped by more cooperative normative expectations. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who perceive norms as tight, especially when higher contributions become more dispersed. In the absence of financial disincentives, these patterns show how non-financial incentives, shaped by more cooperative normative expectations, can foster group coordination and higher public-good contributions.",

          "authors": "Aleksei Opacic",
          "abstract": "Firms increasingly drive college graduates' labor market earnings, yet the vast literature on the value-added of college has largely overlooked their role. Drawing on human capital theory and institutional theories of credentialism, closure, and organizational matching, I argue that college-to-workplace pipelines are a critical driver of college value-added. To test this, I assemble a novel US employer-employee matched dataset merged with postsecondary and high school academic records. Firm placement explains much of the variation in earnings premiums between colleges. Absent firm sorting, the range of counterfactual earnings differences across colleges would fall by 56%, and over half of the earnings advantage to attending the state flagship comes from access to higher-paying employers. These sorting effects extend broadly across the distribution of high-wage firms, and not merely a handful of elite employers. Crucially, sorting effects do not simply reflect skill-based advantages, implying that college quality derives as much from institutional linkages to the labor market as from human capital development. Policies aimed at broadening recruitment pipelines, rather than solely improving instructional inputs, are therefore essential to reducing inequalities in the economic returns to higher education.",

          "abstract": "Organization redesign often raises a central question: Where are managers needed? A potential substitute for formal supervision by managers is interpersonal cultural alignment, which can ease coordination between colleagues. Yet prior research suggests cultural alignment may also complement formal structure. We theorize that the balance depends on coordinative complexity: Whether culturally aligned individuals benefit from common supervision hinges on how broadly they depend on others to get work done. Cultural alignment substitutes for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and complements it when coordinative complexity is high. Focusing on one of the most tangible and consequential forms of cultural alignment---the degree to which individuals are linguistically aligned with their peers in everyday communications---we make predictions about which pairs of colleagues will be brought together under, versus pulled apart from, a shared supervisor. Using archival data from a design firm, we find support for our theory, with effects especially strong when colleagues are highly visible to their senior managers.",

          "authors": "Sehyun Hong; Nak Nyeon Kim; Zhexun Mo; Li Yang; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "We combine household survey micro data, tax data, and national accounts to construct annual pretax income inequality series for South Korea, which is coherent with macro aggregates. We provide the distribution of pretax national income over the time period from 1933 to 2022, with detailed breakdown by income composition in the years from 1996 to 2022. Our new series demonstrates that Korean top income shares decreased substantially from the 1930s up until the mid-1960s, following various wars, independence and land reform policies. Income inequalities then stabilized against the backdrop of rapid economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and decreased even further from the late 1980s onwards until the onset of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, which contradicts the “Kuznets Curve.” In the aftermath of the crisis, income inequality worsened due to the rise of tax-exempted capital income concentration at the top. Compared to other East Asian countries, South Korea exhibits relatively lower levels of income inequality in terms of higher bottom 50% income shares, mostly due to a more equal distribution of national income growth at the stages of economic take-off in the 1980s, even though income concentration at the very top has strikingly worsened over the last two decades, with its top 1% income shares in 2022 returning back to the peak only observed during the colonial era.

It replicates and expands the 1992 econometric study of the textbook Solow growth model by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil to recent years. Using cross- sectional data, the paper analyzes the impact of saving and population growth, technology and capital depreciation rates on the economic growth of a country. It shows that, in line with the textbook Solow model, higher saving positively affects economic growth, while the population growth rate affects it negatively. However, the paper demonstrates higher values of the OLS estimators of these factors than predicted by the Solow model, which suggests that augmentation of the model is necessary for it to be more successful in explaining the variation in international standards of living.",

          "authors": "Brittany Tarufelli; James Gibson; Sarah Barrows; Abhishek Somani; Daniel Boff",
          "abstract": "Grid-scale energy storage enhances power system performance by shifting loads and supporting capacity, reliability, and transmission. However, as storage penetration increases, arbitrage opportunities—and associated profits—decline (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage due to moderate weather and expanded storage. This trend contrasts with findings that long-duration storage is essential for reliability and affordability (Blair et al., 2022), suggesting the need for new business models to capture storage’s full value.  Despite growing deployment in energy storage, empirical research on storage’s value remains limited.\n\nTo address this gap, we develop a commodity-market-based framework and apply it to hydropower as a grid-scale storage resource. Using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume as a proxy for energy storage, we estimate its causal effect on risk premiums—measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread—in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for time-invariant heterogeneity across balancing authorities and account for dynamic price behavior.\n\nWe find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces risk premiums by 5%, indicating that hydropower reservoir storage mitigates short-term supply-demand imbalances. Our results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and suggest that storage is especially valuable during grid stress events, with pronounced impacts at the upper end of the price distribution. This result indicates that reservoir storage may be more valuable during grid stress events. As most markets lack compensation mechanisms for stored energy, our findings offer empirical support for designing future models that better reflect the risk-reducing benefits of grid-scale storage.",

          "abstract": "Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea marked the onset of a systematic repression campaign against the Crimean Tatar population. We introduce CriTaRep v1.0, the first comprehensive, geo-coded event dataset documenting state repression against Crimean Tatars (2014-2024). Drawing on locally sourced materials in Crimean Tatar, Ukrainian, and Russian languages, CriTaRep records n = 690 repression events affecting more than 2,200 individual victims. We inductively identify 22 repression types across three categories: deprivation of liberty, legal and administrative repression, and physical repression. Our data shows a strategic yet adaptive campaign, including a systematic concentration of arbitrary searches on Thursdays, initial physical repression targeting primarily elites, and intensified repression during periods of dissent. Integrating additional disaggregated variables and employing fixed-effects Poisson models, we find that the short-term frequency of repression is significantly driven by protest activity, rather than sanction levels or cultural focal events. Russian authorities respond rapidly and increasingly harshly to dissent, pursuing a dual strategy of immediate protest suppression and long-term deterrence. CriTaRep fills critical gaps in existing datasets and provides new opportunities to study patterns and mechanisms of demographically targeted repression.",

          "abstract": "This proof-of-concept study introduces the Social Morphology Ball, a framework for visualizing multivariate social data as three-dimensional morphological structures. The method normalizes variables using the median and interquartile range (IQR), followed by nonlinear compression with a hyperbolic tangent function to reduce the impact of extreme outliers. Each normalized variable is mapped onto spherical basis functions, transforming numerical relationships into geometric deformations—bulges or concavities—on a sphere. When all variables align with their long-term medians, the model yields a perfect sphere representing a morphologically neutral, structurally balanced state. Implemented in Python, the pipeline automates normalization, shape generation, and visualization, exporting results in STL, PNG, and GIF formats. Applied to Japanese national statistics from 2015–2023, the model captured temporal variations in the balance and distortion of societal indicators through intuitive 3D forms. By interpreting data as morphology rather than numbers, this approach extends social data visualization into a sensory and cognitive domain, providing a conceptual foundation for morphological visualization of social phenomena and potential applications in education, policy, and data-driven art.",

          "abstract": "摘要\n\n本研究旨在解决客家民系与语言起源的核心谜题。通过整合大规模群体遗传学数据、数学模型、制度经济学分析、历史地理学与语言学证据，本文提出了一个有别于传统“中原移民说”与“土著融合说”的整合性理论。其核心论点是：现代客家民系的主体，其根源并非晚至宋代的北方移民，而是可追溯至公元前三世纪秦帝国派驻岭南的南方野战主力。\n\n决定性证据来自大规模全基因组数据分析。 分析显示：（1）众多南方汉族及客家核心父系（如曾氏、黄氏、钟氏）的共祖时间，并非如传统叙事所暗示的魏晋或唐宋，而是惊人地集中在距今2300-2100年前，与秦军南征及南越国立国的时间窗口完全重合。（2）客家群体的常染色体主体（超过80%）为古老的南方汉族基底，其“北方汉族”成分虽高于广府地区，但远不足以支持“北方移民”为主体的论断。\n\n基于此，本理论重构了客家民系的演化路径：这支秦军事拓殖集团，在赵佗建立的南越国时期及之后西汉“以其故俗治”的制度框架下，形成了享有高度自治权的“南越士族”。他们凭借组织与技术优势，系统性地占据了华南关键山间盆地，并为维系其制度特权而长期采取“战略性默存”的集体生存策略。这一策略使其在近千年的时间内实现了内部的稳定繁衍和文化的独立演化，其所使用的古老汉语（“南越国国语”）也得以保存，成为客家话的直接源头。直至宋代，随着科举制度的全面渗透，该群体才开始吸收少量携带“中原叙事”的北方移民，其文化认同也随之重塑，最终形成了现代客家的面貌。\n\n本理论将客家的形成，理解为一个以秦军事拓殖集团为生物学基础，历经千年制度性封存，最终在文化上被后来者叙事所覆盖的复杂过程，为客赣同源、客粤差异等区域性难题提供了统一的解释框架。\n\n关键词：客家，群体遗传学，秦军，南越国，南越士族，战略性默存，客赣同源，历史社会学，方言地理学",

          "abstract": "A new software platform is presented in this article to oversee and manage urban and industrial smart systems by employing digital twin technologies and immersive, interactive metaverse settings, thereby achieving environmentally sustainable urban infrastructure. The system proposed is prepared to track, simulate, and optimize building performance using predictive analytics and interactive dashboards, and thus serves as a modular, interoperable solution. By defining a multi-residential site management case study, a working prototype is developed and implemented here using simulated and realistic datasets, thereby designed for real-time calculation and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) across various areas, including energy efficiency, preventive maintenance, user experience through design, and economic performance. The choice of KPIs, such as energy usage intensity, return on investment, and user satisfaction, can benefit from this technology setup and yield improvements through enhanced operational efficiency, clearer decision-making, and long-term cost-effectiveness. Although such obstacles exist, empirical testing with real data may reveal that integration with hardware, interoperability with existing setups, and economic costing are feasible for small to medium-sized players. With evaluation performed using simulated data, the platform suggests a prospective setup ready to be tested through pilot testing with real-world deployment. In situating the Smart Infrastructure Metaverse here, as a transformation setup of digital governance within a built and developed framework with technological innovation coupled with sustainability and with inclusivity to all the players/stakeholders, the cities embarked here through ever-increasing digital ecosystems with advantages of having such works through an emerging discussion of how immersive technology informs here of a next-generation potential of smart, sustainable, and participatory urban living.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nMolecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) integrate molecular and clinical data to guide precision oncology decisions. However, their structure and functioning remain highly heterogeneous across Europe. This study aimed to develop consensus-based policy recommendations to support their harmonized implementation. \nMethods:\nA two-round Delphi process was conducted among 17 European experts actively involved in MTBs. Questionnaire items were derived from a systematic and scoping review on the clinical impact and implementation aspects of MTBs. Experts rated items on a five-point Likert scale, with consensus predefined as a Content Validity Index (CVI) ≥ 80% of experts agreeing or strongly agreeing (scores 4-5).\nResults:\nAcross two Delphi rounds, 76 items were evaluated. Thirty-six achieved consensus and were consolidated into 15 recommendations across four domains: organizational aspects (n = 8), testing (n = 3), inclusion criteria (n = 2), and clinical aspects (n = 2). Organizational standards emphasized the appointment of a referent clinician, the use of standardized digital submission tools, online meeting formats, and the integration of decision-support systems. The recommended MTB composition was multidisciplinary, including oncologists, molecular biologists, pathologists, geneticists, and other relevant specialists. In the testing domain, experts agreed that NGS should be the preferred approach for molecular profiling, conducted in certified laboratories, with variant interpretation supported by curated databases (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, OncoKB). Inclusion criteria prioritized patients with metastatic or rare diseases, ECOG performance status 0–2, life expectancy ≥12 weeks, and exhaustion of standard therapeutic options.\nConclusions:\nThis Delphi consensus produced 15 policy recommendations to standardize and sustain MTBs across Europe. These guidelines complement existing frameworks by providing practical operational guidance for precision oncology implementation.",

          "abstract": "El Consenso de Washington ha sido uno de los paradigmas de política económica más influyentes y controvertidos de finales del siglo XX. Concebido como un decálogo de reformas orientadas al mercado, su implementación generó un vasto cuerpo de literatura que evalúa sus impactos. Esta revisión narrativa cualitativa sintetiza la evidencia de 53 estudios académicos para ofrecer una visión panorámica de su legado. Se exploran sus orígenes y evolución, la evidencia empírica que lo asocia con mejoras en el crecimiento, y las críticas que lo vinculan con el aumento de la desigualdad y las crisis económicas. Finalmente, se analiza el surgimiento de narrativas post-consenso, argumentando que esta evolución, más que una ruptura, representa una adaptación estratégica del neoliberalismo. Los hallazgos revelan que, si bien la era de las soluciones universales ha terminado, el paradigma post-consenso a menudo recicla principios fundamentales bajo un nuevo lenguaje de inclusión y especificidad contextual, planteando nuevos desafíos para la búsqueda de alternativas de desarrollo genuinas.",

          "authors": "Robert M Ceresa",
          "abstract": "American democracy is entering a period of structural exhaustion. The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone. It requires form.",

          "authors": "Alen Kaminski",
          "abstract": "While a significant body of scholarly work exists to diagnose the probability of systemic socio-political crises, less attention has been paid to the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the character of the regime that emerges from the collapse. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a falsifiable theoretical framework for forecasting the post-collapse morphology of political systems. It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis. Through a detailed examination of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, and the Weimar Republic, we illustrate how this two-stage analysis can deconstruct the anatomy of historical chaos and provide a more structured understanding of the political forms that emerge from it.",

          "abstract": "Micro-targeting is entering a new era: interacting a large set of voter characteristics with multiple message sub-components -- \"nano-targeting'' -- will become increasingly cheap and accessible. We combine evidence from two survey experiments (N=5,000) and predictive modeling to test the effectiveness of nano-targeted messages on climate policy. We find that, on average, nano-targeting does not perform better than an overall \"best message'', but that nano-targeted messages were more persuasive than the best message for individuals who were already supportive of climate action. We also discover backlash effects from \"mis-targeting'', and find an important asymmetry: being randomly assigned messages predicted to be far from one's best policy has stronger dissuasive effects than the persuasive effects of being shown one's best message. Together these results suggest that these technologies may not be practical for most actors, but may be effective for entrepreneurs who aim to dissuade, demobilize or polarize.",

In this study, we evaluated the quality of information in 109 French-language TikTok videos on autism, ADHD, and dyslexia (with over 66 million cumulative views) to capture variation across disorders. The videos were identified using an ecologically valid keyword search and assessed by healthcare professionals with relevant scientific expertise. Results showed that 41% of autism videos, 56% of ADHD videos, and 41% of dyslexia videos were rated as “very poor” or “fairly poor” on information quality, because they contained major inaccuracies.

          "abstract": "The paper examines the linguistic and academic life of Bangla-background learners at English-medium institutions in Bangladesh. As English-medium education becomes more popular, many students with a Bangla-speaking background face difficulties in a second-language academic setting. The research focuses on how these students handle language barriers, cultural differences and negotiation of identity in classrooms and social contexts. A qualitative methodology is used, and four Bangla-background students enrolled in different English-medium institutions in Dhaka are interviewed using a semi-structured format. Brief narrations provide information about language use, classroom participation and learning strategies. Thematic analysis identifies common difficulties and coping styles. Findings show that while most students can acquire functional English knowledge, they often struggle with confidence, self-expression, and cultural connection in class. Memorization is widely used due to language gaps; students tend to memorize lessons rather than fully understand them. Peer and teacher support plays an important role in academic achievement. The study highlights the sociolinguistic reality of Bangla-background students in English-medium settings, which is more complex than often assumed. The research suggests the need for more inclusive teaching approaches and policies that consider cultural and linguistic diversity and promote open and supportive language learning environments.",

          "authors": "Medinah Suleiman",
          "abstract": "Population ageing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is occurring rapidly amid persistent socioeconomic inequities, yet little is known about how disadvantages accumulate across the life course to shape older adults’ wellbeing. Drawing on a scoping review methodology guided by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and enhancements by Levac et al. (2010), this review synthesizes evidence from empirical, theoretical, and policy literature published between 1990 and mid-2025 to map how cumulative social and economic disadvantage unfolds across life stages and affects later life outcomes in SSA. Sixty-odd studies from 18 countries were included, spanning quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods designs. The review reveals that early life adversity such as low childhood socioeconomic status, limited education, and health shocks sets trajectories that constrain opportunities for formal employment, asset accumulation, and social mobility. These constraints are compounded over adulthood, especially among women and rural populations who disproportionately engage in informal work, caregiving, and face structural exclusions such as lack of pension coverage. The accumulation of disadvantage across life stages is consistently associated with poorer physical and mental health, reduced financial security, social isolation, and heightened vulnerability in old age. While a minority of studies explicitly frame their analyses in life course or cumulative disadvantage theory, many implicitly invoke life trajectory thinking. Longitudinal data remain scarce, and intersectional, contextually grounded, and comparative research is limited. The review underscores the need to adapt cumulative disadvantage models to the African context, accounting for macro-historical shocks, informal economies, kin networks, and nonmaterial assets, and to invest in life course–oriented policies. Interventions aimed at early childhood, education, inclusive social protection, gender equity, and integrated ageing frameworks are vital to interrupt compounding disadvantage and promote equitable ageing in SSA.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

We argue that this variation can be explained by differences in the historical industrialization process. Communities that industrialized later and more intensively realign more toward the radical right today. This is because the built environment shaped by the original industrialization drives demographic persistence and neighborhood disadvantage. To examine our argument, we study the effects of nineteenth-century coal mining in Germany's Ruhr area. We match the geolocation of over 1,000 mining shafts, historical plant-level employment data, and the spread of company housing with contemporary electoral results at the neighborhood level. For identification, we exploit the depth of coal deposits that governed the adoption of deep-shaft mining. The findings demonstrate how the path of economic development influences voting in the long run.",

US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

          "abstract": "This study reconsiders a classic sociological question: how does space shape intimate ties? Specifically, it examines how the spatial segregation of ethnic groups contributes to patterns of ethnic endogamy. It does so by applying conditional logit models to Swedish population registers describing couples who began cohabiting between 1990 and 2017. The models compare observed unions to counterfactual unions drawn from available singles, distinguishing the effects of ancestry assortativity---based on country of origin---from residential propinquity, while controlling for matching on nativity, education, and age. Proximity strongly predicts partnering, but assortativity matters too, particularly for non-Western groups. Mediation analysis shows that failing to account for propinquity overstates endogamy by 20–40 percent for these groups, with stronger mediation for the most segregated groups. The findings suggest that segregation complements ethnic boundaries in the short term, but also suggest how integration may undermine group boundaries in the longer term.",

This study aims to systematically synthesize and analyze empirical evidence regarding the performance of BAZNAS across three key dimensions: efficiency, effectiveness, and governance, amidst the rapid wave of digitalization. This research employs the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Through a search process across the Scopus, Google Scholar, and SINTA databases, 40 relevant journal articles published between 2015-2025 were identified and analyzed in-depth. The synthesis results show a consensus that BAZNAS is effective in its poverty alleviation programs (as measured by the CIBEST Model and NZI) but faces challenges in operational efficiency (identified via DEA/SFA studies) and uneven implementation of governance. A research gap was found, namely the lack of studies integrating these three performance dimensions to explain their reciprocal relationships. As its main contribution, this study proposes an integrated conceptual framework that positions governance (GCG) as a fundamental independent variable influencing operational efficiency and program effectiveness, with digital technology adoption acting as a moderating variable. This framework can serve as a reference for future empirical research.\nKeywords: BAZNAS, Systematic Literature Review, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Zakat Governance, Conceptual Framework, PRISMA.",

          "abstract": "Recent debates on ‘democratic deconsolidation’ raise three key questions: are younger people less supportive of democracy; where is this occurring; and is the trend worsening? This paper addresses these questions by comparing African and European democracies using five rounds of the Integrated Values Survey and nine rounds of the Afrobarometer. We apply age-period-cohort-interaction models to assess generational support for democracy and openness to authoritarian alternatives; we also differentiate democratic trajectories across regions. In Africa, the dominant pattern is a general downward trend in democratic support and rejection of authoritarianism, in some cases led by younger cohorts. In Europe, although cohort effects continue to reflect declines in democratic support that were concentrated among younger age groups in the past, support for democracy subsequently recovered among more recent cohorts.  However, some European electoral democracies show a rise in openness to authoritarianism, especially among young cohorts.",

Counteradaptation highlights how adaptive moves in one domain—\nwhether foreign extraction, ‘development’ apparatuses, or climate policy regimes—create new\npressures that compel situated responses elsewhere. Case studies of fishing communities, timber\nand gold frontiers, and informal urban settlements show how counteradaptation reframes\nhabitability as a contested threshold and exposes the limits of technocratic adaptation toolkits.

This article addresses this question by evaluating the French ‘pass Culture’, a €300 stipend for cultural consumption offered to all 18-year-olds. Drawing from the fields of the sociology of culture and cultural economics, this study aims to determine whether an increase in purchasing power for cultural goods can influence participation. The empirical analysis is based on an econometric examination of a large-scale survey examining cultural participation and the use of ‘pass Culture’. The results reveal that while the voucher does not affect participation in institutional highbrow cultural activities like museum visits, theater, or opera attendance, it significantly increases engagement with commercial popular culture, including cinema and comic book reading. These findings suggest that financial barriers are not the primary obstacle to consumption in cultural capital-intensive activities. However, financial constraints do appear to contribute to non-participation in popular cultural life among certain youth demographics. The article then discusses the theoretical implications of these findings for our understanding of the relationship between cultural consumption, cultural policies, and social inequalities.",

          "title": "Does Retirement Make People Happy? The Impact of Retirement on Couples' Life Satisfaction in Germany",
          "authors": "William Fernandez",
          "abstract": "In the developed world, efforts are underway to extend working lives. However, discussions often overlook the potential implications of  retirement for individual well-being. While the relationship between retirement and life satisfaction has been extensively studied, the effects of spousal retirement remain underexplored, particularly from a gender and timing perspective. This paper examines the impact of retirement on self-reported life satisfaction among couples in Germany. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), I employ standard fixed-effects (FE) models and fixed-effects individual slopes (FEIS) to estimate the causal effects of personal and partner retirement on life satisfaction. The findings show that retirement substantially increases life satisfaction, a result that remains robust across methodologies and specifications. For partner retire￾ment, accounting for heterogeneous trends by health status reveals an overall positive effect, driven by men. Moreover, women appear to be worse off when their husbands retire while they remain in the workforce, whereas the opposite holds for men. To my knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of both personal and spousal retirement on life satisfaction using the SOEP. The results provide robust evidence that partner retirement affects life satisfaction, highlighting the importance of understanding retirement as a life course event with intra-household spillover effects that extend beyond the retiring individual.",

          "authors": "Clara Overweg; Carla Rowold; Anette Eva Fasang",
          "abstract": "Population aging and increasing family diversity raise concerns about women’s financial security in later life, as a greater share do not live with a breadwinning spouse. Women’s financial security is particularly jeopardized in conservative welfare states that limit women’s options to accrue independent pension entitlements. This study examines women’s work–family life courses and financial security in later life in two conservative welfare states with distinct pension policies: West Germany with a Bismarckian pension system and the Netherlands with a more universalistic pension system. Drawing on SHARELIFE data, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis, and regression methods to link work-family life course typologies to individual pensions, survivor benefits, and household equivalence income. Findings show that the work-family life courses in the two countries strongly resembled each other, characterized by a strong care orientation and weak labour force attachment of married mothers. However, women with care-oriented life courses receive substantially higher individual pensions in the Netherlands, which grant Dutch women higher financial autonomy. In contrast, women’s survivor benefits and household income were slightly higher in West Germany, affording a higher living standard but less financial autonomy, and a higher risk of poverty following a potential separation compared to the Netherlands.",

A large body of scientific research has shown that nature markets regularly do not achieve their environmental objectives, and provides generalisable lessons to support their ongoing improvement. The scale of the biodiversity crisis and the enduring popularity of nature markets means it is now critical to stop reproducing the same mistakes. Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five rules which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks. Lastly, we outline critical evidence-based actions that can be taken to push nature markets towards greater integrity.",

We describe the process of carrying out participatory research using the method of board game hacking. Hacking is a creative research method and mode of critical play that involves participants unmaking and remaking games by doing things like changing the game rules, creating new components, making new pieces for the game, or new art, and combining the different elements of the game in new ways. This experience was messier than we had envisaged when designing and pitching the project for our funders, Game in Lab and the Libellud Foundation, who are industry-based funding bodies promoting the scientific study of games. The semi-contained chaos in the room punctured the confidence of our written research proposal, which naïvely described a neatly complementary interaction of games and young researchers. This chapter is a reflection on what we learned as researchers, and an examination of the relationships that unfolded between research, game hacking and activism.",

          "authors": "Molly Hickey",
          "abstract": "How do authoritarian regimes implement unpopular economic reforms without triggering destabilizing unrest? Prevailing theories suggest that governments must either repress dissent, concede through meaningful policy reversals, or ignore unrest and risk backlash. This paper introduces the concept of temporary concessions: short-term, strategic policy reversals later re-implemented to demobilize protest while maintaining reform and regime stability. I argue that regimes deploy temporary concessions when repression is costly or externally constrained, and ignoring protest risks escalation. By disrupting protest momentum and introducing a collective action problem among protesters, tem porary concessions make demobilization the individually rational choice. Evidence from subsidy reforms in Jordan and Egypt, combined with a nationally representative survey experiment, shows that these tactics defuse unrest even when citizens doubt their durability, challenging prevailing models of authoritarian responsiveness and resilience under economic liberalization.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and the depletion of the Earths natural resources are among the largest challenges humanity currently faces. In light of this, the planned German Longitudinal Environmental Study (GLEN) aims at investigating the incentives, restrictions, attitudes, and beliefs that underlie human-environment interactions. In doing so, the GLEN project aims to provide a foundation for evidence-based environmental policy assessments and guidance. The project will build up a large-scale panel study of the adult population in Germany in which the same individuals will be repeatedly observed over time using a standardized and stable online survey instrument. Due to its longitudinal design and the linkage of the collected survey data to geospatial information on respondents social and ecological environments, the panel will be well suited to analyzing natural experiments such as regional policy measures (e.g., price changes, information campaigns) and exposure to local environmental conditions (e.g., extreme weather events). In addition, the panel\nwill be used as a platform for survey experiments to investigate trade-offs in environmental preferences, consumption decisions, and the acceptance of environmental technologies and policies. With this design, GLEN will meet the urgent need for data suitable for causal research and simulations in the environmental social sciences. With occasionally refreshed samples, it will also allow for the monitoring of trends in environmental concern and behavior, focusing on diverse social, political, economic, and psychological aspects. Accordingly, GLEN is primarily understood as a data infrastructure for environmental research across all social science disciplines. Key questions that can be addressed with the data include: What influences environmental concern, behavior, and the acceptance of technologies and policies to protect the environment? What consequences do environmental policies and changing environments have for social inequalities, and how does that affect (perceived) environmental justice? As a long-term project, GLEN will cover the period between 2024 and 2035, and thus the period in which decisive policy measures to replace fossil fuels are set to be implemented in accordance with international agreements. In sum, the project includes three work streams to pursue three closely related goals: (I) First and foremost, the project will generate a data infrastructure for the environmental social sciences, to be used not only in Germany, but also internationally. (II) The project team will utilize the data for substantive environmental social science research. (III) The project will provide evidence-based policy evaluations and guidance with regular policy reports and embedded experiments. The project team requests funding for the first 3-year period of the planned long-term project.",

          "abstract": "The widespread adoption and use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the foundation for artificial intelligence applications in applied computer science have significantly advanced tools for the translation of human languages. These tools are now ubiquitously and instantly accessible, e.g., via smartphones, and the quality of their translations has markedly improved. When used in informal and institutional, spontaneous as well as planned contexts between individuals and groups without a common language or lingua franca, these translation tools create new and unique contexts for interaction that would not otherwise exist. This development has generated a novel genre of research settings essential for exploring intercultural communication, as they foster new forms of interculturality, enabling new experiences, and raise new ethical questions about intercultural interaction. Consequently, AI-translated intercultural communication has emerged as a new basis for the development of interculturality. The current research overview indicates that this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, with significant research questions and areas still unaddressed. Existing studies focus on the technical aspects of machine translation, the feasibility and limitations of achieving human-like, accurate translation, and the future role of human translators. The active role of translation tools in creating novel intercultural contact situations urgently requires further investigation and exploration.",

The framework proposed in this research can become a more comprehensive reference source for future studies in sustainable food consumption topics. In specific, policymakers can use this framework to design effective campaigns/policies to promote sustainable food consumption practices of their residents. Future researchers can reference this framework to conduct more comprehensive studies on sustainable food consumption topics.",

Sources of inquiry into current practice, learning, and experience which may shape reform of providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples in the land now known as Australia are health practitioners working in the space. This work seeks to explore foot care service delivery by investigating First Nations and non-Indigenous health practitioners’ perspectives regarding providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples. \nMethods: Ways of working are documented in previous work; ‘Working right ways in foot health with and for First Nations Peoples: research method guided and governed by First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing in cross-sectional qualitative study design’. Four First Nations and six non-Indigenous health practitioners provided perspectives with culturally responsive semi-structured interviews guiding talking with consenting participants. Analytic induction utilised First Nations expertise, inductive reasoning, and constant comparison method in thematic analysis.\nResults: Two talking points engaged health practitioners’ perspectives of providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples: (1) What does foot health mean to you as a First Nations or non-Indigenous health practitioner? (2) What are needs for providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples? Within responses, themes emerged of mobility, overall wellbeing, and advocacy being related to the meaning of foot health. The requirements of Cultural Safety, workforce, and holistic care were perceived as needed for provision of good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples.    \nConclusion: Participants described a meaning of foot health relational to physical and spiritual constructs, and central to reclamation of, and continuation of, First Nations cultures; amidst a project of ongoing colonisation. Needs for good foot care provision with and for First Nations Peoples included a workforce continually learning and unlearning to develop cultural capabilities to work with and for, and support, First Nations foot health.

Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts.

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate feedback in L2 writing, yet little is known about how such output reshapes learners’ decision-making. This qualitative multiple-case study examines how genre-based ChatGPT feedback and dialogue shape novice L2 writers’ metacognitive judgments (MJs)—their basis, accuracy, and evolution—and how these judgments, in turn, drive self-regulated learning (SRL). In a first-year composition course for international students, nine participants completed three genre-based assignments and engaged in structured, AI feedback cycles using a custom GPT, Genre Guru, designed to provide genre-specific feedback. Data sources included AI-feedback reflections, ChatGPT interaction logs, end-of-course reflections, and five post-semester interviews. Using thematic analysis, MJs were traced across the four domains of genre-specific knowledge (formal, rhetorical, process, subject-matter) and mapped onto the phases of SRL (forethought, performance, self-reflection). Four themes emerged: (1) students moved from initial skepticism to measured trust; (2) learners critically evaluated and selectively adopted AI suggestions, preserving text ownership; (3) writers integrated the four domains and articulated genre awareness; and (4) emotions and motivation drove self-regulatory cycles. Findings suggest that, when framed by genre theory and embedded in reflective dialogue, LLM-mediated feedback can function as a catalyst for AI-calibrated metacognition: enhancing judgment quality, scaffolding regulation, and expediting adaptive, autonomous L2 writing without displacing human intelligence and agency.",

Military recruitment targets were likewise consistently met despite avoidance and poor health.

Using the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs as a case study, I provide evidence that increasing representation of bureaucrats from a member state increases the accuracy of that state's economic forecasts. This effect, which I call ``national expertise,\" decreases as member state representation within the Commission increases and is most pronounced for large economies.

We implement a pre-registered field experiment embedded in a real-world citizens’ assembly on wealth inequality in Austria. Using a three-group-design comparing assembly participants, non-selected volunteers, and a population sample, we isolate the causal effects of taking part in a citizens’ assembly from self-selection into participation. We find that while participating in the citizens’ assembly substantially improves factual knowledge about the wealth distribution and promotes convergence around specific tax policy proposals, notably a EUR 1 million allowance, it has no measurable effect on political efficacy or broader civic engagement. We also document significant political self-selection: individuals willing to participate in the citizens’ assembly were already more engaged and supportive of redistribution than the general population. These findings suggest that while deliberative formats can foster informed convergence on policy proposals, their ability to mobilize broader publics is limited – especially if they primarily engage the already supportive and, as in this case, lack institutional anchoring that might facilitate spillover into more institutionalized political arenas.

          "abstract": "Writing in the sciences transcends the notion of sticking to the data. Writing is a complex transformation of a wealth of semi-ordered information into a clear and persuasive scientific story. The formalised form of a research article contains this story and, if published, legitimises it. This empirical study provides a nuanced, empirically-driven appreciation of scientific writing before writer and text are mediated by the competition for and accounting of authorship. It builds on a qualitative study of writing (n=22) and elucidates essential features of writing such as the hermeneutics of the scientific story, different modes of writing as iteration and collaboration, spanning across levels of seniority and position. Furthermore, this study delivers a new perspective on professional scientific writers—trained scientists who provide writing-as-a-service but often remain invisible in attributions of authorship. The structure of this article is as follows. The introduction provides an overview of the literature and elaborates the central research questions (1). We then define our area of research in terms of actors and discuss our research design (2). Thereafter (3), we present and contextualise empirical findings along central themes such as: the writing journey, the division of labour in scientific writing, the meaning of style and storytelling, the relation of writing practices and authorship, and the position of the scientific writer. Finally (4), we conclude, expounding on the intermediatory functions of scientific writing in the broader context of knowledge production, and provide a comprehensive outlook.",

          "abstract": "Editorial boards function as gatekeepers in academic publishing, yet systematic frameworks for quantifying how symbolic capital concentrates within editorial networks remain absent. This study operationalizes Bourdieu’s symbolic capital theory through network analysis of 2,135 editorial positions across 30 sustainability science journals. Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power. This reproducible analytical framework enables systematic comparison of editorial governance structures across fields.",

We test two implementable policies: a Time-Indexed Minimum Wage (TIMW) that sets the wage floor by rule wmin,t = Ct/Htarget to cap essentials at 120 hours/month, and an Essential Hours Tax Credit (EHTC) that refunds gaps below 100 hours/month for low-wage cohorts via monthly advances. Using CPI components and CPS/OEWS wages across six metros, we show how TIMW stabilizes MSH near target while EHTC backstops D1–D3 renters during shocks, delivering a dual-key hours guarantee without price controls.

          "abstract": "In recent years, Europe has experienced an increasing number of devastating floods. In 2023 alone, 26 flood events were reported in the first nine months of the year. Two of such events were the floods that hit the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna in May 2023 and Tuscany in November 2023. Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

Existing research shows that sexism may be a stronger predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour than a voter’s gender. To what extent do the findings from the US presidential elections apply to other contexts and research questions? To answer this question, we present a systematic review of studies focusing on sexism as a predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour. In two databases (Scopus and Web of Science), we identify 97 relevant studies, including 42 on the 2016 US presidential elections. The review shows that particularly modern and hostile sexism played a role in Trump's election. However, few other research questions have been answered with similar certainty. Our review discovers gaps in the literature and proposes further directions for this growing research field. To enable future comparative research, we discuss best practices for measuring sexism and show the variety of ways in which sexism is operationalized.",

          "abstract": "Dementia is a major challenge in our aging society. Apart from its health economic impact, cognitive decline may affect the quality of life (QoL) and affective states of individuals. From a measurement perspective, it is of high importance to use quality-assured measurements to derive valid and reliable results. This paper investigates to what extent improved memory metrics can be exploited to investigate the strength of correlation between memory ability, depressive symptoms, and well-being. It also aims to shed light on earlier heterogeneous results through the application of quality-assured measurements. In this paper, we analyzed associations between memory ability, measured by the new and more accurate NeuroMET Memory Metric (NMM), and depressive symptoms and wellbeing of the same individuals measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the WHOQoL-BREF of older individuals (n=332, ranging from healthy controls to patients with dementia due to suspected Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), with a mean age of 72 years). While decreased memory ability was moderately associated with more depressive symptoms (Pearson R = -0.36), it was only negligibly associated with worse well-being (associations with WHOQoL-BREF and subdomains ranging between R = 0.08 and 0.12), which is partly in line with previous studies. A group-wise analysis revealed that these effects were stronger for individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Our study leveraged measurements scales and models with improved accuracy.",

Drawing from lived experience, I explore how simple acts of care—like adjusting a cup of tea or offering a gentle hug—can build trust and emotional connection between staff and residents. I reflect on moments of challenge and growth, particularly in understanding residents' preferences, building rapport, and responding to non-verbal cues. Central to the narrative is the concept of “huggerholics”—residents who welcome warmth and affectionate gestures—and the emotional reciprocity this role offers. This piece highlights how aged care work, especially in hospitality roles, can be a source of meaning and healing, not just for those being served but also for those serving. Through this reflection, I hope to contribute to a richer understanding of person-centred care and the importance of emotional labour in aged care settings.",

          "abstract": "The Multicultural Systems Approach (MSA) proposes a shift from viewing culture as a set of static, national traits toward understanding it as a dynamic system of interdependent cultural logics operating within organizations. Building upon general systems theory, intercultural management, and organizational behavior, the MSA conceptualizes multicultural interaction as the negotiation of equilibrium among diverse cultural subsystems, each with distinct assumptions about hierarchy, communication, time, and coordination.\nUnlike established frameworks such as Hofstede’s dimensions or the GLOBE project, the MSA emphasizes interactional dynamics and feedback loops rather than categorical differences. It accounts for how multicultural teams and institutions co-create hybrid cultural orders, shaping both performance and cohesion. This article introduces the theoretical architecture of MSA, clarifying its axioms, levels of analysis, and principles of Cultural Alignment. By reframing intercultural management through a systemic lens, MSA contributes to theory by explaining how and why multicultural collaboration succeeds or fails—and provides an integrative platform for future empirical research on cultural systems in organizations.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Beached Whale Hypothesis, a conceptual framework linking nationalism to collective cognitive disorientation. Drawing analogies from marine strandings, it interprets socio-political extremism as a product of affective and informational imbalance. The proposed Tensional Realignment Model (TRM) offers a neurocognitive explanation for how societies recalibrate emotional, temporal, and structural equilibrium through distributed tension management. Integrating insights from affective neuroscience, ecological systems theory, and social dynamics, the study situates nationalism as an emergent symptom of affective compression under digital acceleration. By comparing the global diffusion of the MAGA movement with the evolution of Japanese online nationalism, the paper frames digital populism as a “magnetic realignment failure.” The TRM thus proposes a post-national governance approach that sustains adaptability and emotional diversity by restoring systemic oscillation between affective and informational poles.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate that follows a blended normal distribution of Nie (2023).",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm’s debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "A paradox of hominization needs to be resolved: Homo erectus experienced a\ndoubling of brain volume, yet the development of its cognition took eons. In almost\ntwo million years of brain growth, Homo erectus made only a few technological\ninnovations. Therefore, in Homo erectus, it seems that the biological process\nof mutation and selection for the evolution of the cerebrum was primarily\nresponsible for the increase in cognition, rather than the accumulation of experience.\nThe only significant difference between the monkey and human brain is as follows:\nthe proportion of the association cortex increased to 80% during the evolution\nof Homo erectus. But how can a mere increase in the number of non-specific\nneurons in the association cortex of Homo erectus explain the cognitive advances\nthat can be observed? The partial patterns of sensory perception that the connectome\nfeeds to the association cortex are evolved intracortically into higher cognitions\nby means of unspecialized neurons. These information-providing neural patterns\ncan only be evolved – not calculated – because they are subject to the properties\nof a complex brain system; and they can only be evolved processual because\nthe association cortex has a non-specific character – it selects information patterns\ninstead of neural structures.\nThus, the greater the number of neurons, the more pattern attractors of order acquisition\ncan be formed, and the higher the cognition. Their number was probably\nnot sufficient in Homo erectus to continuously develop complex cognition. The\nextreme time periods for innovations in Homo erectus therefore suggest that its\ncognitive advances were not due to a cumulative learning process, but primarily\nto the genetically determined increase in brain size and thus neurons. Homo erectus\nwas not human.\nBefore brain growth stopped in archaic Homo sapiens, a systemic change must\nhave taken place in the evolving cerebrum. For in the human brain – which remains\nconstant – we recognize an unlimited potential for cognition and, above all,\ncreativity that is lacking in Homo erectus.",

          "abstract": "American democracy is entering a period of structural exhaustion. The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone.

Agents use reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, A2C, A3C) with a social-welfare objective based on the inequality-averse Atkinson function, augmented by fairness regularizers (representation loss, participation fairness, envy-freeness proxy) and explicit participation costs. We report diagnostics-rich evaluations covering representation and proportionality (e.g., Gallagher, Loosemore–Hanby), fragmentation (effective number of parties), strategic behavior, coalition stability, and welfare/inequality. Classic regularities emerge—e.g., two-bloc competition under Plurality (Duverger-consistent), greater proportionality and fragmentation under PR, and differential seat allocation under D'Hondt vs Sainte-Laguë—providing face validity.

          "abstract": "The aim of this interdisciplinary study is to contribute to the field of disaster and climate conflict research. For this purpose, I qualitatively examine for the first time the impact of the devastating flood of 2010 on the conflict in Pakistan, more specifically the regional capacity of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), in the administrative units of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK). Also, I introduce the concept of state capacity into the debate, review its impact on the conflict and examine its possible contribution to the debate. I hypothesise that the concept of state capacity can explain the conflict better than the influence of disasters. This is tested with the help of a document analysis and expert interviews. Prior findings from mostly quantitative studies, such as the complex, bidirectional nature of the relationship between disasters and conflict or the concept of the unnatural disaster, were qualitatively confirmed and further explored in this study. It becomes clear that while the flood can provide benefits to the TTP and prolong the conflict, it cannot fundamentally change the outcome of the conflict. In this context, the key finding of this study is the importance of state capacity for the complex debate around disasters and climate conflict. More research in this direction is recommended, as the topic is expected to become much more relevant due to the increasing number and intensity of extreme weather events in the coming decades.",

This study investigates how one of the most stigmatised areas in the Netherlands, the Bijlmer, has been portrayed in newspaper media over a period of 35 years, and how this portrayal relates to structural changes in the district. The concepts of core and event stigma are employed to understand the temporal dimensions of stigma production. The corpus includes 22,934 articles from the five largest Dutch newspapers that referenced the Bijlmer since 1990. Hierarchical topic modelling and sentiment analysis are used to detect topical representations of the Bijlmer. The findings indicate that in the 1990s two news peaks regarding the Bijlmer crash have been important in raising its (inter)national status, whereas the Bijlmer has also suffered from core stigmatisation on various crime and social issues. In addition, the findings suggest an intricate relation between structural changes in the Bijlmer and media attention. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the relevance of core and event stigma, employing novel techniques in research on territorial stigma, and investigating the relation between structural neighbourhood conditions and media representation.",

          "abstract": "The Region of La Araucanía, located in southern Chile, is a territory of high geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic relevance. Covering an area of 31,842 km², it extends between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, encompassing a diversity of ecosystems that support agricultural, forestry, and tourism activities. The region, composed of the provinces of Cautín and Malleco, has a population of 1,010,423 inhabitants (Census 2024) and holds the highest proportion of Indigenous population in the country, with 34.5% belonging to the Mapuche people. This deeply rooted cultural presence is central to the region’s identity and to ongoing debates about autonomy and ancestral rights. However, La Araucanía faces persistent structural challenges, including high multidimensional poverty rates, pronounced urban–rural disparities in access to basic services, and an economy highly concentrated in primary sectors. This report provides a comprehensive characterization of the region, examining its productive structure, labor market, consumption patterns, foreign trade, innovation landscape, and economic projections. The aim is to contribute to the analysis of regional development from an interdisciplinary perspective that links economic, social, and territorial dimensions, offering key insights to inform public policy and sustainable development strategies within the regional context.",

          "authors": "Thi Xuan Dieu Phan",
          "abstract": "Food is central to the dignity, well-being, and quality of life of older adults living in residential aged care. Yet in many facilities, food waste remains widespread and under-addressed, often viewed as inevitable in institutional settings. This study offers a reflective, practice-based exploration of food waste in aged care, grounded in the author’s work as a catering assistant and support worker across multiple facilities in South Australia. Drawing on structured fieldnotes and direct observations, the paper identifies three main categories of food waste—plate waste, kitchen overproduction, and expired stock—and explores the operational, cultural, and behavioural factors driving these inefficiencies. Key causes include inaccurate meal ordering, overproduction habits, limited staff feedback mechanisms, and poor interdepartmental communication. The study proposes a set of low-cost, staff-informed strategies to reduce waste while enhancing care quality. These include personalised portioning, consistent ordering protocols, resident feedback loops, and systems for safe food repurposing. It also underscores the importance of supportive leadership, workplace culture, and valuing catering roles as central to person-centred care. By centring frontline staff experiences, this paper reframes food waste as not merely a logistical issue, but a matter of care quality, communication, and organisational sustainability. Findings suggest that food waste reduction can reinforce—not compete with—person-centred approaches by respecting resident preferences and improving mealtime satisfaction. This study contributes to the broader conversation on aged care reform by offering insights from daily practice. It highlights how simple, context-sensitive changes can advance both environmental and social goals in residential care.",

          "abstract": "We measure Monthly Survival Hours (MSH, or Essential Hours), the paid work time required to buy a fixed essentials basket, revealing a sharp affordability crisis: D3 renter hours spiked 50% from 117.4 hours (2019) to 175.7 hours (2022), with 2025 levels at 157.7 hours. We test two implementable policies: a Time-Indexed Minimum Wage (TIMW) that sets the wage floor by rule wmin,t = Ct/Htarget to cap essentials at 120 hours/month, and an Essential Hours Tax Credit (EHTC) that refunds gaps below 100 hours/month for low-wage cohorts via monthly advances. Using CPI components and CPS/OEWS wages across six metros, we show how TIMW stabilizes MSH near target while EHTC backstops D1–D3 renters during shocks, delivering a dual-key hours guarantee without price controls. Case studies for Phoenix, NYC, and Houston illustrate both ends of the metro spread.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: To systematically review and analyse the content of scales used to measure well-being and quality of life (QoL) among older persons. Secondary aims were to examine content overlaps between scales developed specifically for older persons (age-specific) and age-generic scales psychometrically evaluated in older populations, as well as between positively and negatively worded items and between scales targeting well-being and QoL.\nMethods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Items from included scales were categorised using a framework for well-being and QoL scales. Descriptive statistics illustrate the content distribution, and Jaccard index estimates content overlap.\nResults: A total of 744 items from 35 scales were included. Among the age-specific scales for older persons (n =19), the most common dimensions were personal circumstances, personal relationships, and physical health. For age-generic scales (n =16), activities and functioning, personal relationships, and self-acceptance were most prominent. Average content overlap was 0.42 (range 0.22–0.55) for age-specific scales, indicating moderate overlap.\nConclusion: While there is some consistency in content across age-specific well-being and QoL scales for older persons, notable heterogeneity remains. In addition, this study sheds light on the operational similarities and distinctions between scales aimed at generic and older populations.",

          "authors": "Nanna-Katrine Gram Lange",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of policy efforts, the gender gap in entrepreneurship remains persistent across national contexts. Recent research suggests that these disparities begin early in life, many years before labour market entries. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 23 Danish adolescents aged 13–15, this paper explores how gendered self-concepts and possible selves contribute to the shaping of young people’s perceptions of entrepreneurship. Using a sociological framework that combines theories of doing gender, self-concept, and future orientation, the study finds that girls’ disinterest in entrepreneurship is not rooted in lack of ambition or ability, but in identity misalignment. While girls tend to articulate detailed and socially validated futures, often linked to professions related to care, entrepreneurship appears incompatible with these roles unless it is shown to reinforce who they already want to become. In contrast, boys are more likely to describe vague or flexible future selves, leaving room for entrepreneurship to emerge as a possible option. The findings challenge deficit-based understandings of early gender gaps in entrepreneurship and point to entrepreneurship as one among several possible selves. Ultimately, entrepreneurship becomes meaningful only where it coheres with young people’s evolving sense of who they are and might become.",

          "authors": "Louise Couceiro; Rebecca Eynon; Laura Hakimi",
          "abstract": "The precise definition of digital literacy has long been contested. Although early definitions recognised the importance of traditional literacy (the ability to read and write) for engaging in digital practices (Gilster, 1997), this connection is often overlooked in recent scholarship, policy initiatives, and digital literacy frameworks. This article draws on ethnographic data from two secondary schools in England to present a case that highlights the relationship between traditional and digital literacies, underscoring the importance of acknowledging and better understanding their interplay. Situated within a socio-technical approach and complemented by Rosenblatt’s transactional theory of reading (1978, 1986, 1995) to conceptualise technology-as-text and user-as-reader, the article presents analysis of three classroom vignettes to illustrate how students’ interactions with an “adaptive” EdTech platform intended to support literacy learning are shaped by their traditional literacy skills. Our analysis identifies a series of transactional breakdowns between reader and text, each marking a moment in which no meaningful transaction can occur due to insufficient consideration of how traditional and digital literacies intersect. Framing EdTech as a straightforward solution to literacy challenges without attending to the nuanced and context-specific ways students engage with such technologies ultimately risks reinforcing the very disparities they seek to address.",

          "authors": "Chiara Binelli; Chiara Puglisi; Serena Ceola; Raya Muttarak",
          "abstract": "In recent years, Europe has experienced an increasing number of devastating floods. In 2023 alone, 26 flood events were reported in the first nine months of the year. Two of such events were the floods that hit the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna in May 2023 and Tuscany in November 2023. Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

          "abstract": "As the internet, smartphones, and review platforms transform how travelers discover urban attractions, understanding this process is critical for harnessing a sustainable urban attraction space. Yet urban discovery remains poorly understood and existing research is fragmented. To address this gap, we adapt Leiper’s tourist attraction systems framework to study urban discovery. Our grounded theory analysis on 126 interviews resulted in five distinct discovery modes: instrumental-rational, go-with-the-flow, social, flaneur, and habitual. Besides richly describing these modes, we identify personal, social, contextual, demographic, and affective factors influencing them. We illustrate how playful discovery modes—go-with-the-flow, social, and flaneur—are compatible, leading to mixed discovery modes, while the remaining modes are incompatible. These findings challenge the dominance of rational choice models by revealing a broader spectrum of discovery behaviors. They also provide a foundation for designing a more inclusive urban attraction content space and offer strategic implications for urban attraction management.",

          "authors": "Mireille Hildebrandt",
          "abstract": "In this chapter Hildebrandt investigates the link between the contestability that is key to constitutional democracies on the one hand and the falsifiability of scientific theories on the other hand, with regard to large language models (LLMs). Legally relevant decision-making that is based on the deployment of applications that involve LLMs must be contestable in a court of law. The current flavour of such contestability is focused on transparency, usually framed in terms of the explainability of the model (explainable AI). In the long run, however, the fairness and reliability of these models should be tested in a more scientific manner, based on the falsifiability of the theoretical framework that should underpin the model. This requires that researchers in the domain of LLMs learn to abduct theoretical frameworks, based on the output models of LLMs and the real world patterns they imply, while this abduction should be such that the theory can be inductively tested in a way that allows for falsification. On top of that, researchers need to conduct empirical research to enable such inductive testing. The chapter thus argues that the contestability required under the Rule of Law, should move beyond explanations of how the model generates its output, to whether the real world patterns represented in the model output can falsify the theoretical framework that should inform the model.",
