          "abstract": "The increasing use of AI-based approaches such as machine learning (ML) across diverse scientific fields presents challenges for reproducibly disseminating and assessing research. As ML becomes integral to a growing range of computationally intensive applications (e.g. clinical research), there is a critical need for transparent reporting methods to ensure both comprehensibility and the reproducibility of the supporting studies. There are a growing number of standards, checklists and guidelines enabling more standardized reporting of ML research, but the proliferation and complexity of these make them challenging to use. Particularly in assessment and peer review, which has to date, been an ad hoc process that has struggled to throw light on increasingly complicated computational supporting methods that are otherwise unintelligible to other researchers. Taking the publication process beyond these black boxes, GigaScience Press has experimented with integrating many of these ML-standards into the publication process. Having a broad-scope that necessitated looking at more generalist and automated approaches. Here, we map the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) standards, and outline our adoption of the DOME recommendations for Machine Learning in biology. We developed a publishing workflow that integrates the DOME Data Stewardship Wizard and DOME Registry tools into the peer-review and publication process. From this case study we provide journal authors, reviewers and Editors examples of approaches, workflows and strategies to more logically disseminate and review ML research. Demonstrating the need for continued dialogue and collaboration among various ML communities to create unified, comprehensive standards, to enhance the credibility, sustainability and impact of ML-based scientific research.",

          "abstract": "The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines are widely perceived as the gold standard for reporting evidence syntheses. However, the diversity of contributors, transparency of development processes, and accessibility of PRISMA checklists have not been systematically examined. We conducted a meta-epidemiological analysis of 21 guidelines identified as PRISMA or PRISMA extensions, assessing equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) measures; transparency in guideline development; and the implementability and accessibility of checklists. Women were well represented among authors (47%), but geographic representation was limited: only 11% of authors were affiliated with institutions in the Global South (0.01% excluding China), and 62% of extensions had no contributors from these regions. Transparency varied: most extensions (72%) reported following established methodological frameworks and 62% sought external feedback, yet only 24% provided summaries of consensus meetings and none reported repeatability or inter-rater reliability testing. Accessibility was similarly inconsistent: while 86% provided a reporting checklist, only 10% offered open-access, editable formats. We provide practical recommendations to address these gaps and introduce an open-source reporting template. Our findings highlight the need for reform in the development of widely adopted reporting standards that underpin evidence synthesis and inform global decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Unlike other primates, young children have been shown to exhibit seemingly irrational overimitation—faithfully copying unnecessary steps from a demonstration. We tested 3- to 5-year-old children (N = 39) and capuchin monkeys (N = 21) on a causal reasoning task in which a sequence of two actions was demonstrated, followed by reward production. We manipulated (1) causal plausibility and (2) the degree and nature of demonstrator intentionality, to explore the hypothesis that children—but not capuchins—integrate information about demonstrator intent and causal relations to infer which actions are necessary. We compared both species’ behavior to Bayesian computational models with the same varying social and physical expectations. Our results suggest that both species can learn from causal demonstrations, and that their copying behavior is affected by both the demonstration’s causal plausibility and the demonstrator’s communicative cues, but that children may be unique in interpreting communicative cues as having pedagogical intent.",

          "authors": "Carl F. Falk; Amaris Huang; Michael John Ilagan",
          "abstract": "While online survey data collection has become popular in the social sciences, there is a risk of data contamination by computer-generated random responses (i.e., bots). Bot prevalence poses a significant threat to data quality. If deterrence efforts fail or were not set up in advance, researchers can still attempt to detect bots already present in the data. In this research, we study a recently developed algorithm to detect survey bots. The algorithm requires neither a measurement model nor a sample of known humans and bots; thus, it is model agnostic and unsupervised. It involves a permutation test under the assumption that Likert-type items are exchangeable for bots, but not humans. While the algorithm maintains a desired sensitivity for detecting bots (e.g., 95%), its classification accuracy may depend on other inventory-specific or demographic factors. Generating hypothetical human responses from a well-known item response theory model, we use simulations to understand how classification accuracy is affected by item properties, the number of items, the number of latent factors, and factor correlations. In an additional study, we simulate bots to contaminate real human data from 36 publicly available datasets to understand the algorithm’s classification accuracy under a variety of real measurement instruments. Through this work, we identify conditions under which classification accuracy is around 95% or above, but also conditions under which accuracy is quite low. In brief, performance is better with more items, more categories per item, and a variety in the difficulty or means of the survey items.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, ratings of teaching quality have been used to assess why some teachers are more effective than others. Nowadays, the focus of teaching quality research is shifting; Teachers’ adaptation of instruction to students and interactions between teacher and student behaviors are used increasingly to explain effective teaching. Uncertainty remains about the extent to which teachers adapt their instruction to students. Additionally, it is unclear which assessment scales measure stable teacher traits and which measures are affected by students. To address these questions, we conducted a quasi-experiment involving 146 German and math teachers and 3,980 of their students from various educational tracks in Germany. Teachers either taught the same group of students for two consecutive years or different groups each year. A difference-in-differences approach was employed to determine whether teaching quality ratings were more consistent when teachers taught the same group than when they taught different groups at both timepoints. Results suggest that especially student ratings of teaching quality and teacher ratings of student disruptions are affected by different student groups. Teachers’ ratings of their own instructional behaviors, however, are less affected. We discuss the causal informativeness of our findings regarding teachers’ instructional behaviors and give recommendations on how to interpret associations between different assessments of teaching quality with student outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Although children automatically categorize people into social groups from a young age, how they learn to automatically activate and apply category schemas to people is not well understood. In a sample of racially diverse children (N=223; Mage=7.24, SDage=2.51; 132 girls; 42.6% white; 43.05% racially minoritized), we tested the degree to which activating category schemas facilitates social categorization. Children were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words, and then categorized Black, White, and Asian faces by their gender under a time constraint. Children’s gender categorizations became more efficient with age, particularly when primed with race. Whether and how children’s gender categorizations were influenced by gender primes depended on their own social identity—white children categorized men faster than women regardless of priming condition, but priming gender attenuated this androcentric bias among racially minoritized children.",

          "abstract": "Learning to predict threat based on environmental cues, and to adapt behaviour accordingly, is critical to human survival. This type of learning is governed by distinct systems in the brain. Model-free learning is reflexive and computationally efficient, allowing for rapid responses based on past experience. In contrast, model-based learning is more flexible and relies on an internal model of the environment, which can be updated without direct experience. To enhance the translational value of human fear-conditioning research and facilitate the interpretation of fear-reduction interventions, it is essential to determine what type of learning underlies commonly used measures of conditioned responding. To address this question, we evaluated whether fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance responses (SCRs) reflected model-free and/or model-based learning in three fear-conditioning experiments (total n = 132). All experiments included a phase in which the value of the US was decreased through instructions, or through removal of the US electrode (US devaluation), enabling us to distinguish between model-based and model-free learning processes. In the first two experiments, FPS responses remained elevated after US devaluation, reflecting model-free learning, while SCRs updated instantly, indicating model-based control. In the third experiment, both measures followed a model-based pattern. We speculate that these differences between experiments are due to decreased uncertainty and overall less differential conditioning (FPS) in the third experiment. In sum, while SCRs seem best explained by a model-based account of learning, FPS responses appear able to index both model-free and model-based learning, with the balance between these two systems potentially depending on the level of uncertainty in the environment.",

          "abstract": "Li et al., Dong et al., and Xu et al. reported statistically significant cross-lagged effects of initial scores on physical activity and fitness on subsequent scores on various outcomes, e.g., psychological resilience and cognitive control, and they concluded causal effects. However, in the present reanalyses of data simulated to resemble data used in the three evaluated studies we found contradictory increasing, decreasing, and null prospective effects, depending on the used model. In none of the six analyzed combinations of predictor and outcome variables did a meta-analytic aggregation of the prospective effects differ significantly from zero. Hence, we conclude that prospective cross-lagged effects reported by Li et al., Dong et al., and Xu et al. may have been spurious and that their conclusions of causality may have been premature. We recommend researchers to fit alternative models to their data and to juxtapose findings, e.g., through meta-analytic aggregation. If the juxtaposed finding does not differ significantly from zero caution is advised and conclusions of increasing or decreasing effects should probably be suspended.",

          "authors": "Mia Mantyla; Emma Russell; Xingxing Zhu; Thomas McCabe; William Stewart; Donald M Lyall",
          "abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for dementia and earlier mortality, but its association with psychological health is less well-characterized. We tested for associations between TBI and depression, each ascertained multiple ways, and in opposing directions (depression predicting TBI; TBI predicting depression). \n\nMethods: Using UK Biobank data (N=502,356) we investigated bi-directional associations between TBI (ICD-10 coded broad- or narrow-band TBI) and depression (self-report and/or incident ICD-10 coded). We tested this in each direction: baseline historic TBI predicting the incidence of subsequent depression and, separately, baseline depression predicting the incidence of a first subsequent TBI. All analyses were adjusted for age at UK Biobank baseline assessment, sex, educational attainment, deprivation, smoking history, alcohol intake, physical and neurological health conditions.\n\nResults:  In participants with history of TBI (versus not), there was increased risk of subsequent incident depression, compared with participants with no documented TBI history (e.g. narrow-band TBI fully-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18 risk of depression; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.87 to 2.55; P&lt;0.001). In the other direction there was evidence that people with history of lifetime depression had significantly increased risk of subsequent incident TBI (e.g. HR = 1.76 of narrow-band TBI, 95% CI = 1.61 to 1.94, P&lt;0.001). \n\nConclusion: We show significant associations between TBI and depression: depression was a risk factor for subsequent TBI in previously unaffected participants, but also vice-versa. Psychological support should be considered post-TBI, however clinical management should consider premorbid psychological health as a possible contributing factor.",

          "title": "Modelling Psychological Time Series with Multilevel Hidden Markov Models: A Numerical Evaluation and Tutorial",
          "authors": "Emmeke Aarts; Jonas M B Haslbeck",
          "abstract": "Driven by technological advances, time series (or intensive longitudinal) data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing us to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. A promising method to translate information on psychological processes unfolding over time into a statistical model is the hidden Markov model (HMM). In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. This in contrast to commonly used Vector Autoregressive (VAR) based models, which assume the time series fluctuate around a single equilibrium point. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we can obtain a description of subject-specific process dynamics and formally quantify heterogeneity across subjects.  Despite the fact that HMMs are often both theoretically interesting and can provide a better model fit for many time series, HMMs have rarely been used to model psychological time series. To create the conditions for psychological researchers to be able to use the multilevel HMM in their research, we (1) provide an accessible introduction to the use of multilevel HMMs to model continuous outcome time series data typical of intensive longitudinal data; (2) evaluate model selection and estimation performance in situations that resemble typical psychological time series research designs using an extensive numerical evaluation study, varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, subjects, and time series length; and (3) provide a fully reproducible tutorial that guides the reader through all steps of model selection, model checking, and interpretation using an openly available dataset on emotion dynamics. Our numerical evaluation results show that researchers can expect the multilevel HMM to peform well when persons are expected to switch between multiple states. Finally, we discuss how multilevel HMMs can advance the study of psychological dynamics with time series, provide empirically based recommendations,  and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "authors": "Matt Brown; Michelle Martin-Raugh",
          "abstract": "We explore the role of social desirability in explaining how individuals respond to situational judgment test (SJT) items. We argue that SJTs can be conceptualized as measuring the knowledge of socially desirable behavior or norms in a situation or context. When scored using consensus-based keying, SJTs consistently correlated positively with general mental ability, knowledge of social norms, and socially desirable traits in samples of undergraduate students and adults from an online crowdsourcing platform regardless of test content. Additionally, we found that trait-focused SJTs function differently compared to traditional, skill-based SJTs when expert-based scoring is used. Trait-focused SJTs contain response option sets which feature differing levels of trait expression, social desirability, and effectiveness. This results in greater variability in responding due to differences in context (e.g., different instructions or organizational setting) and in greater potential for multiple scoring keys with differing patterns of convergent validity. We hope that our findings help bring attention to the role of social desirability when studying SJTs and encourage more emphasis on the characteristics of response options to complement prior research focused on the situational stems.",

          "authors": "Sllobodan Gjerga",
          "abstract": "Background: Group music therapy is increasingly used as a tool to supplement care for depression, yet we know less about who benefits most. A previously published study named MUSED randomised trial enrolled women with depression to receive music therapy (MT) plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone and embedded ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of daily-life mood.  \nMethods: In this study, a secondary analysis of the processed Randomised Controlled Trial dataset MUSED was conducted. Outcomes were a post-treatment Back Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and a binary responder classification (≥50% BDI reduction) within the MT arm. Analyses included (i) ANCOVA adjusting for baseline BDI, baseline EMA mean, study cohort, and group; (ii) 5×5 cross-validated models (elastic-net, random forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) for classification (MT only) and regression (across all participants); and (iii) model interpretability using SHAP rankings, partial-dependence plots, and simplified logistic regression.\nResults: Post-treatment BDI was analysed for 87 participants; in the MT arm (n=52), 38.5% were responders. After adjustment, MT was associated with a 3-point lower BDI versus TAU (with adjusted difference −2.87). Higher baseline BDI and worse baseline EMA mood predicted higher (worse) post-treatment BDI; the ANCOVA explained ~63% of variance. In classification (MT only), random forest performed best (ROC AUC 74±3%; PR AUC 85±2%) with high sensitivity (83%) and modest specificity (at around 40%). For regression (all participants), random forest achieved RMSE=8.9, MAE=7.5, and R²=0.43. Across model families, SHAP analyses consistently ranked baseline EMA mean (and within-day EMA slope) as top predictors; elastic-net coefficients aligned in direction (People who began treatment with worse mood tended to have worse outcomes, while receiving music therapy was linked to lower (better) predicted BDI scores).\nConclusions: MT+TAU reduced depressive symptoms beyond TAU, and everyday mood at intake, captured through EMA, was the most informative signal for both who responds and how well patients do. These baseline-only models can support care planning by prioritising likely beneficiaries, pinpointing those needing extra support, and contextualising MT’s added value alongside usual care.",

          "authors": "Melanie Viola Partsch; David Goretzko",
          "abstract": "Despite the popularity of structural equation modeling in psychological research,\naccurately evaluating the fit of these models to data is still challenging. Using fixed fit\nindex cutoffs is error-prone due to the fit indices’ dependence on various features of the\nmodel and data (“nuisance parameters”). Nonetheless, applied researchers mostly rely on\nfixed fit index cutoffs, neglecting the risk of falsely accepting (or rejecting) their model.\nWith the goal of developing a broadly applicable method that is almost independent of\nnuisance parameters, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based approach to evaluate\nthe fit of multi-factorial measurement models. We trained an ML model based on 173\nmodel and data features that we extracted from 1,323,866 simulated data sets and models\nfitted by means of confirmatory factor analysis (i.e., training observations). We evaluated\nthe performance of the ML model based on 1,659,386 test observations unseen during\nmodel training. The ML model performed very well in detecting model (mis-)fit in the\nmajority of conditions, thereby outperforming the fixed fit index cutoffs by Hu and Bentler\n(1999) across the board. Only minor misspecifications—single neglected residual\ncorrelations (and cross-loadings), in particular—proved to be challenging to detect. From\nthis proof-of-concept study we conclude that ML is very promising in the context of model\nfit evaluation.",

Validated in a transdiagnostic cohort (n=228), our model demonstrated high-fidelity prediction of behavioral choices (&gt;90% accuracy), reaction times (r&gt;0.85), and distributed BOLD activation (r=0.84) during affective and cognitive tasks, capturing individual neurobehavioral dynamics. Leveraging the model's differentiability, we identified gradient-based connectome manipulation targets (e.g., limbic, parietal, prefrontal) to selectively modulate affective or cognitive functions. Crucially, in-silico trials simulating these manipulations reproduced realistic inter-individual variability in treatment effects (effect size range &gt;2 SD). This establishes our digital twin brain as a quantitative, mechanistic platform for simulating and designing personalized psychiatric interventions.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to explore how the instructor’s use of gestures as well as student motivation influence learning from instructional videos. Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. Undergraduate Psychology students completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. Participants were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation was moderated by gesture use: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning only when they indicated being motivated, but the presence of gestures ensured consistent learning gain regardless of motivation levels. These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescent mental health is deteriorating, and identifying those in need is challenging because of flawed assessments, flooded services, and low help-seeking by those most in need. A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

          "abstract": "Ambulatory assessment has gained widespread popularity among researchers who study the dynamics of everyday experiences and behaviors, such as sleep patterns or emotional states. In this paper, we focus on the challenge that arises when we want to investigate the dynamic relations between variables that were measured at different frequencies. As a running example, we use a sleep quality variable measured once every morning and a mood variable measured multiple times during the day for multiple days. We propose two N=1 models that imply different processes; the first focuses on dynamic relations from day to day between sleep quality and a daily factor of the mood variable, and the second focuses on dynamic relations from one measurement occasion to the next, which prioritizes when the variables affect each other. Additionally, we introduce a combination of these two models and demonstrate their accuracy with a simulation study. An empirical N=1 example of daily sleep quality and momentary self-doubt demonstrates that dynamic relations exist between sleep quality and self-doubt at certain moments in the day and the daily factor of self-doubt. Researchers may adjust the proposed dynamic models to align with their own theories and to accommodate different data or research interests.",

          "abstract": "The Autobiographical Interview (AI) is one of the most used method for quantifying episodic memory from memory narratives. Its manual scoring, however, is limited and demands considerable time and effort. These issues have been recently addressed by the use of natural language processing (NLP) allowing for automatic, unbiased and less time-consuming scoring of memory performance in the context of the AI. Since existing NLP models for AI analysis are primarily designed for English narratives, this study investigated whether machine translation could enable their effective use on German narratives without significantly reducing classification accuracy. We evaluated model performance on a total of 1,920 German narratives generated by 258 individuals across two datasets. We further provided an open-source analysis code. We demonstrate that correlations between predicted and manually rated internal and external details were highly significant and comparable to existing studies performed with English narratives. Machine translation of German narratives allows for high classification accuracy and low frequency of misclassification without a meaningful impairment of model performance compared to English narratives. We observed no performance differences across translation models, indicating lightweight models perform equally well. Our findings support the use of NLP as an alternative cost- and time-efficient approach for automated AI  scoring in non-English-speaking populations. Our results highlight the potential of language models for large-scale memory research across languages. We conclude that NLP enables more detailed analyses of episodic memory narratives beyond traditional manual scoring.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

          "abstract": "For many autistic individuals, close family members represent a crucial source of support throughout their lifetime. Early diagnosis of autism is thought to benefit to both autistic individuals and their family members by facilitating early access to services and information. However, little research has empirically studied the relationship between age at diagnosis and wellbeing among individuals with autism and their family members. In this study, we examined predictors of age at autism diagnosis and its relationship with family wellbeing using the population-based Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child cohort study (MoBa). We found that the most important factors associated with a later age at diagnosis were fewer social communication difficulties at age 3, fewer maternal concerns about development in early childhood, the absence of a co-occurring intellectual disability diagnosis, female sex, and having older siblings . We also found that a later age at diagnosis is associated with higher wellbeing for mothers and children during childhood, whereas it is associated with lower wellbeing for children during adolescence. Importantly, all associations were substantially attenuated after adjustment for a range of clinical, demographic, and genetic factors – reflecting the complex patterns of confounding that influence observed relationships between age at diagnosis and family wellbeing. We argue that future research should aim to leverage public awareness campaigns, screening programmes, or changes in clinical practice to understand the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships.",

With increased availability and affordability of AI-generated voices, we need to examine how humans perceive them. Recently, an intriguing effect was reported in AI-generated faces, where such face images were perceived as more human than images of real humans - a “hyperrealism effect.” Here, we tested whether a “hyperrealism effect” also exists for AI-generated voices. We investigated the extent to which AI-generated voices sound real to human listeners, and whether listeners can accurately distinguish between human and AI-generated voices. We also examined perceived social trait characteristics (trustworthiness and dominance) of human and AI-generated voices. We tested these questions using AI-generated voices generated with and without a specific human counterpart (i.e., voice clones, and voices generated from the latent space of a large voice model).\nWe find that voice clones can sound as real as human voices, making it difficult for listeners to distinguish between them. However, we did not observe a hyperrealism effect. Both types of AI-generated voices were evaluated as more dominant than human voices, with some AI-generated voices also being perceived as more trustworthy. These findings raise questions for future research: Can hyperrealistic voices be created with more advanced technology, or is the lack of a hyperrealism effect due to differences between voice and face (image) perception? Our findings also highlight the potential for AI-generated voices to misinform and fraud, alongside opportunities to use realistic AI-generated voices for beneficial purposes.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically analyzes the legal and ethical framework for patient rights in Nigeria, arguing that a significant chasm exists between codified rights and their judicial enforceability. While the Constitution, the National Health Act (NHA) 2014, and the Patients’ Bill of Rights (PBoR) establish a foundational legal architecture, their practical application is undermined by systemic, socio-cultural, and institutional challenges. Employing a doctrinal and comparative legal methodology, this analysis contrasts Nigeria’s aspirational framework with the more robust, justiciable models found in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Canada/the United States. Findings reveal that low public and professional health literacy, a deeply entrenched paternalistic culture, and a fragmented, inefficient legal system, evidenced by a medical malpractice litigation rate of only 1.1%, collectively render patient rights largely ineffective. The report concludes with an evidence-based roadmap for reform, proposing a multi-faceted strategy that includes: a constitutional amendment to create a justiciable right to health, new legislation to establish direct institutional liability for systemic failures, the implementation of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) pilot programs, and mandatory integration of health law and ethics into medical curricula. These reforms are essential to translate legal principles into tangible remedies, foster a patient-centered culture, and ultimately strengthen Nigeria’s commitment to achieving universal health coverage and improving public trust in its healthcare system",

While social media influencers are often accused of contributing to the spread of misinformation, little is known about their potential role in combating it. In two pre-registered online experiments (N = 1004), we therefore investigated for the first time whether human and AI-generated influencers can effectively correct misinformation. The results show that influencers can successfully correct misperceptions on a politically non-polarized topic (mental health). On a politically polarized topic (climate change), however, only the correction of the AI-generated influencer significantly reduced the misperceptions. Overall, the results demonstrate that influencers can support the fight against misinformation and suggest that AI-generated influencers may be particularly effective in addressing more polarized political topics.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The Borno State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency (BOSCHMA) Law (2018) established a contributory health insurance framework covering public, private, and informal sectors, with explicit provisions for vulnerable groups such as internally displaced persons (IDPs), women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. However, its implementation in a post-conflict setting faced challenges of financial instability, governance risks, systemic weaknesses, and conflict-related disruptions.\nThis article employs doctrinal legal analysis supported by policy review and comparative evidence to critically assess both the 2018 Law and the BOSCHMA Bill, 2025, within Nigeria’s decentralized health insurance landscape. Drawing on legislative texts, policy documents, and international comparators, the analysis examines institutional design, financing arrangements, and service delivery provisions, evaluating their alignment with Universal Health Coverage (UHC) principles and responsiveness to Borno’s conflict-affected population.\nFindings highlight significant progress in the 2025 Bill, including the harmonization of references with the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) Act 2022, legislated percentage-based contributions for public servants, and statutory provisions mandating transparent, evidence-based identification of indigent and vulnerable populations. These reforms directly address weaknesses in the 2018 Law, particularly the outdated references to the repealed NHIS Act and ambiguities in defining vulnerable groups. Nonetheless, operational challenges remain, including ensuring sustainable financing, institutional capacity-building, public trust, and delivery of guaranteed benefit packages in fragile settings.\nThe review recommends embedding transparent beneficiary identification systems, defining explicit benefit entitlements, strengthening governance and accountability frameworks, and institutionalizing robust monitoring mechanisms. Lessons from national reforms and global post-conflict models provide actionable pathways for implementation. The Borno case—now reinforced by the 2025 Bill—offers critical insights for advancing UHC in fragile and conflict-affected contexts worldwide.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is central to safeguarding health systems, but in Saudi Arabia it raises critical questions: is IPC an ethical and legal obligation, or merely a professional option? Drawing on the Kingdom’s experiences with MERS-CoV, COVID-19, and the rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) under Vision 2030, this article interrogates IPC through the intersecting lenses of statutory law, Islamic bioethics, and global health governance.\nThe analysis identifies three persistent challenges: (1) weak enforcement of the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) in health data use, (2) unresolved liability in AI-driven surveillance and decision-making, and (3) ethical tensions in isolation orders, digital contact tracing, and vaccination mandates. Islamic principles of maslahah (public interest), adl (justice), amanah (trust), and darura (necessity) are shown to provide a culturally coherent framework for balancing collective safety with individual rights.\nThe article makes three key contributions. First, it demonstrates how Saudi statutory law operationalizes these ethical commitments but suffers from enforcement gaps. Second, it highlights the underexplored legal risks of AI adoption in IPC, particularly algorithmic bias and liability. Third, it proposes a governance model integrating ethical oversight committees, AI-specific regulation, and inclusive engagement of religious scholars, healthcare professionals, and the public.\nActionable recommendations include strengthening PDPL enforcement through independent oversight, embedding Islamic bioethics into IPC training, and institutionalizing transparent, participatory governance. By reframing IPC as a binding obligation rather than optional, the article positions Saudi Arabia to advance ethically grounded, legally robust, and culturally resonant infection prevention aligned with Vision 2030.",

          "abstract": "Addiction is traditionally framed as a pathological hijacking of reward circuitry\n(DSM-5; ICD-11). Yet converging evidence in neuroscience, anthropology, and philosophy\nsuggests compulsive drive is a basal feature of human motivation. This paper advances\nthe thesis that addiction-like mechanisms underpinned civilization by canalizing\nrepetitive, high-reward behaviors—tool-making, ritual, and social bonding—into\ncumulative cultural evolution (“cultural ratcheting”). Drawing on dopaminergic\nreinforcement learning, dual inheritance theory, and archaeological case studies, I\nargue that addiction is an adaptive compulsion toward patterned action that,\nparadoxically, enabled large-scale cooperation. Three core insights structure the\naccount: (1) dopamine mediates wanting (incentive salience) rather than liking\n(hedonia); (2) repetition induces Hebbian plasticity that automatizes behavior,\nshifting control from goal-directed to habitual systems; (3) cultural rituals harness\nthese loops to stabilize group cohesion and transmit practices across generations.\nCivilizational outcomes—from agriculture to urbanism—thus reflect compulsive repetition\nmore than rational calculation.

          "abstract": "With increased interest in the replication crisis and the open science movement, it is important to examine the implications of communicating these topics to undergraduate psychology students. At the beginning of the open science movement, the effort to improve research practices was seen and discussed as both an individual and systemic endeavor. Some authors placed the focus on individual researchers, encouraging them to engage in practices like pre-registration and open data. Others, however, placed the responsibility with the system, arguing that incentive structures and norms need to reward these new practices. The current project examined whether using individual vs. systemic teaching approaches impacted psychology student’s trust, motivation, and optimism regarding the field of psychology. Undergraduate psychology students (N= 476) were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions, one specifying how researchers’ practices should change (individual), one specifying on incentive structures should change (systemic), and one summarizing general research practices in psychology. I expected to find that participants in the individual condition would show the highest levels of trust in the field, motivation to improve the field, and optimism, while participants in the systemic condition would show the highest trust in psychological researchers. Overall, while our manipulation effectively influenced participants' perceptions of the teaching approaches, the expected differences in trust, motivation, and optimism were not consistently observed. These results suggest that, regardless of whether one takes an individual or systemic approach, teaching about the replication crisis does not always undermine (or enhance) trust, motivation, and optimism.",

          "abstract": "Judgment is often described in terms of an intuitive (System 1) versus deliberative (System 2) dichotomy, yet sound deliberation itself can take more than one form. Building on philosophical traditions and distinctions in treatment of sound judgment in economics and law, we propose that lay conceptions revolve around two distinct types of deliberate judgment: rational, emphasizing rule-based and utility-focused reasoning for well-defined problems, and reasonable, prioritizing context-sensitive and socially conscious reasoning for ill-defined problems. Across four studies in English-speaking Western samples (Studies 1–4; N = 2,130) and a Mandarin-speaking Chinese sample (Study 4; N = 697), participants described their notions of “sound” and “good” judgment, evaluated social scenarios, chose between candidates with distinct judgmental profiles, and categorized non-social objects. Results consistently showed that people view both rationality and reasonableness as common forms of deliberate sound judgment, while treating them as distinct. Participants preferred rational deliberation for algorithmic social roles linked to well-defined tasks and reasonable deliberation for interpretive roles linked to ill-defined tasks. Moreover, framing decisions as rational vs. reasonable influenced whether participants relied on rule-based vs. overall-similarity strategies in classification tasks. These findings suggest that lay understanding of sound judgment does not rely on a single standard of judgmental competence. Instead, people recognize that both rationality and reasonableness are critical for competent deliberation on different types of problems in life.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a formal framework for understanding language in cognitive systems, distinguishing the Metalanguage of Cognition (MLC), an internal system of vector-based cognitive dynamics, from the External Language of Meaning (ELM), a symbolic system for communication. Rooted in Principia Cognitia (PC), which is grounded in a materialist ontology and distinguishing phenomena from their discrete signal representations, the framework defines MLC as a triple (S, R, O) of semions (vector representations of cognitive units), weighted relations, and operations, while ELM is a symbol set Σ linked via a mapping μ: S→Σ that transforms internal representations into external symbols, often losing structural detail. Grounded in the axiom that cognition is an activatable vector structure, this framework resolves philosophical challenges, such as Searle’s Chinese Room paradox, by showing that understanding requires MLC, not just ELM. Empirical evidence from transformer-based large language models (LLMs), where residual streams encode belief state geometries, validates semions as cognitive units. The MLC-ELM model unifies biological and artificial cognition, redefines rationality through metacognitive operations like detecting knowledge gaps (e.g., recognizing unfamiliar concepts), and informs AI design by prioritizing internal cognitive alignment. This substrate-neutral, testable framework advances cognitive science, neuroscience, AI, and philosophy.",

          "abstract": "Exposure is highly effective for treating acrophobia and there is growing consensus that cognitive mechanisms play an important role in exposure-based therapies. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether adding a Cognitive Bias Modification - Interpretation (CBM-I) training to a single-session exposure therapy further facilitates cognitive change. The sample included diagnosed acrophobia patients (N = 81), all of whom received exposure therapy. One day later they were randomized to receive either CBM-I or a sham training. The CBM-I trained patients to interpret and appraise ambiguous, height-related scenarios in a less threatening and adaptive manner, whereas the sham training comprised ambiguous, neutral scenarios. Outcomes included changes in interpretational biases (Encoding Recognition Task, Heights Interpretation Questionnaire, Scrambled Sentences Task), acrophobia-related symptoms (Acrophobia Questionnaire), and behavioral avoidance (Behavioral Approach Test). In intention-to-treat analyses patients receiving CBM-I showed a greater reduction in interpretational biases post-training compared to the sham condition (primary outcome). However, group differences were not sustained at follow-up and, i.e., both groups demonstrated improvements across all outcomes, except for the Scrambled Sentences Task. No significant group differences in reductions in other acrophobia-related cognitions, symptoms, or behavior emerged over time. Exploratory analyses revealed strong associations between the assessed cognitive, behavioral, and subjective outcomes, but neither of these outcomes correlated with the hormonal measures (progesterone, estradiol). To conclude, our findings suggest that while CBM-I can temporarily facilitate cognitive change in the context of exposure, its long-term benefits and downstream effects may require further optimization. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols to maximize its efficacy as a potential adjunct to exposure therapy.",

How are different complex neural circuits selected and rapidly switched,\nsequentially, from one brain-wide spatiotemporal configuration to another?

While school-based mindfulness training (SBMT) offers a scalable prevention approach with broad reach, evidence of its effectiveness is mixed, and there is a compelling case for a more personalized approach to prevention.\n\nObjective: To develop a data-driven algorithm from baseline characteristics to predict which adolescents are most likely to benefit from SBMT.\n\nDesign: Secondary analysis of the My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2016-2018. Machine learning models were trained on 70% of schools and validated in the remaining 30% from different schools.\n\nSetting: Eighty-four broadly representative UK secondary schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nParticipants: A total of 8,376 adolescents aged 11-13 years at baseline were included. Students had to be enrolled in participating schools with parental consent and student assent. The sample was 55% female, 76% White ethnicity, with mean age 12.2 years.\n\nInterventions: SBMT teaching core mindfulness skills through psychoeducation, class discussion, and practices, compared to standard social-emotional learning (teaching-as-usual; TAU) covering topics such as relationships and mental health education.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Causal forest and elastic net regression models computed Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) scores quantifying individual expected benefit from SBMT vs. TAU.\n\nResults: While the overall RCT found no average benefit of SBMT over TAU, the PAI model identified a subset of adolescents (19%) with significantly better depression outcomes when assigned to SBMT (d = 0.22, p = .037), and a larger subgroup (37%) who benefited more from TAU (d = 0.22, p = .004). Top predictive features were primarily student-level variables, including baseline emotional symptoms, executive functioning difficulties, mindfulness skills, and anxiety. Prediction was strongest for depressive symptoms, with mixed findings for two other trial outcomes (social–emotional–behavioural functioning and well-being).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Machine learning can identify adolescents differentially likely to benefit from SBMT versus TAU, offering a path toward more personalized school-based prevention. Future prospective trials should test whether algorithm-guided intervention assignment improves clinical outcomes.",

We propose that this relationship can be understood through theories of group processes and behavioral decision-making. To explain the effects of polarization on public health, we review and integrate classic models from these traditions. Guided by this framework, we review evidence suggesting that identity-based motives can shape people’s attitudes towards health behaviors, social norms about the behavior, and the perceived ability to control the behavior. This integrative review helps explain divergent patterns of health behaviors across political groups but can also generalize to explain group influences on health behaviors more broadly. We argue that to fully understand the role of social contexts in shaping human health, it is critical to investigate how group identification shapes people's actions.",

          "abstract": "Many people aim to eat healthier or become more physically active, yet often fail. Identifying aspects of behavior that are easier to change is crucial for effective interventions. Two preregistered online studies assessed participants' perceived ease of changing eating and physical activity (PA) behavior and explored potential moderators. Young adults predominantly without (Study 1, N = 435, Mage = 31.6) and older adults predominantly with chronic conditions (Study 2, N = 637, Mage = 57.2) indicated the perceived ease of changing 21 aspects of eating and PA, medical history, social comparison, prior behavior change attempts and current behavior. Young adults found increasing consumption and engaging in high-intensity PA easiest, reflecting hedonic goals and high self-efficacy. Conversely, older adults found reducing consumption and sedentary behavior easiest, possibly driven by health motivation and physical limitations. Prior attempts and social comparison showed divergent impacts across groups, possibly influenced by differing learning trajectories and health priorities. Lower unhealthy food consumption correlated with easier reduction, while high PA did not always translate to perceiving further increases in PA easier. Tailored interventions aligning goals with perceived capabilities and priorities are essential to maximize engagement and adherence. Longitudinal research is needed to establish causality and refine strategies.",

          "abstract": "A growing literature identifies political polarization as a risk factor adversely shaping public health outcomes. We propose that this relationship can be understood through theories of group processes and behavioral decision-making. To explain the effects of polarization on public health, we review and integrate classic models from these traditions. Guided by this framework, we review evidence suggesting that identity-based motives can shape people’s attitudes towards health behaviors, social norms about the behavior, and the perceived ability to control the behavior. This integrative review helps explain divergent patterns of health behaviors across political groups but can also generalize to explain group influences on health behaviors more broadly. We argue that to fully understand the role of social contexts in shaping human health, it is critical to investigate how group identification shapes people's actions.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Missing data are a common challenge in multilevel designs, and multiple imputation (MI) is often used for handling them. Past research has shown that multilevel MI provides an effective treatment of missing data, so long as the imputation model takes the multilevel structure and the intended analyses into account, and modern methods have been developed that can accommodate even complex types of analyses. However, multilevel MI can be difficult to apply in practice, where the multilevel structure is often not very pronounced or not of immediate interest in the analysis. In these applications, existing methods can become unstable and often struggle to provide reliable results. In this article, we introduce a fully conditional specification approach to multilevel MI that combines single-level imputation methods with group means (GM) or adjusted group means (AGM) to accommodate the multilevel structure. Based on a theoretical investigation and multiple simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of these methods in different applications, including applications with balanced designs, unbalanced designs, and larger numbers of variables. Our findings suggest that the AGM approach—though not the GM approach—performs well in most of the scenarios we investigated and can even outperform conventional approaches to multilevel MI in challenging applications. We also provide an illustrative example for the implementation of these methods in a simulated example, and we discuss the implications of our findings for practice.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

In this editorial, we introduce our special issue on ‘futures social psychology’, and in doing so, we provide a starting point for scholars interested in furthering research in this area. We outline previous important discipline-specific and methodological contributions, connecting social psychological perspectives to the wider academic and practitioner landscape. We outline how our eleven special issue contributions advance discussion, theorising and research methodology on topics such as sustainability, collective group continuity, prefigurative politics, AI sentience, and degrowth policies. Finally, we encourage social psychologists of all topic and methodological persuasions to adopt a generative, prospective, and possibilities-focussed approach to their work, to ensure that social psychology as a discipline can effectively meet the challenges of the future and maximise its impact.",

          "abstract": "Counterfactual thinking, the ability to mentally represent how events might have unfolded differently, plays a central role in decision-making, memory, learning, and emotional regulation, and has even been described as a foundation of human cognition itself. Yet the neural systems supporting this capacity remain debated. Here, we present a quantitative meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies, synthesising evidence across tasks involving both simulated counterfactuals, where individuals deliberately imagine alternative self-referential scenarios, and computed counterfactuals, where the brain evaluates unchosen outcomes during decision-making. This analysis identified a distributed network encompassing the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala. Within this network, the OFC emerged as a hub for representing counterfactual options and their value, while the ACC, particularly its dorsal subdivision, linked these representations to behavioural control. The hippocampus supported constructive aspects of counterfactual thought, overlapping with episodic memory processes, and the amygdala contributed to the affective responses, particularly regret. Separate analyses for simulated and computed counterfactuals revealed partial dissociations. Simulated counterfactuals recruited the superior frontal gyrus, involved in constructive memory processes. Computed counterfactuals engaged the striatum, where fictive error signals encoded the value of unchosen outcomes and predicted subsequent behaviour. These findings indicate that counterfactual thinking relies on distinct but interacting systems for valuation, control, memory, and emotion, highlighting its multifaceted role in adaptive human cognition.",

However, to date, no validated measure has existed with which to quantify TNB identity support in romantic relationships. We used a four-stage process to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of TNB identity support from romantic partners. First, we generated items based on prior qualitative research, then used cognitive interviews with six TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to refine the items. Second, we piloted 59 items in a survey of 321 TNB people (16 years and older) reporting on current or recent romantic relationships. Using those data, we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify subscales, then selected 19 items based on factor loadings, item-subscale correlations, α-if-item-deleted, discrimination parameters, and item information curves. Third, we used weekly diary survey data from 299 romantically partnered TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to perform confirmatory factor analysis and assess reliability at the within- and between-relationship levels. Results indicate that the 19-item Transgender/Nonbinary Identity Support from Partners Scale (TISPS) assesses five forms of TNB identity support—Facilitation [of identity exploration], Identity Validation, Celebration, Allyship, and Understanding—with a consistent factor structure and good reliability at the between-relationship level. Psychometric results were poorer for weekly within-relationship variation, suggesting that TISPS subscales have suboptimal properties for assessing short-term change. The TISPS can be used in clinical and community settings and future research on the role of social support in TNB mental health.",

          "abstract": "Happiness research provides robust evidence that living a satisfying life has external, secondhand benefits for families and communities. Yet, the field faces ongoing debates, including the extent to which life satisfaction is stable versus changeable, the validity of the U-shaped age trajectory, and the relative contributions of domain-specific satisfactions to global evaluations of life quality. We examined life satisfaction trajectories and how demographic covariates and satisfaction with specific domains influence life satisfaction over 13 waves of data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N = 6,711). Using nonlinear growth curve modeling, we found that life satisfaction remained relatively stable over the 13 waves (average of 5.06 to 5.26 out of 7), with small but significant variations based on demographic characteristics. Older individuals and those identifying as ethnic minorities reported higher baseline satisfaction, while males experienced steeper changes over time relative to females. Domain-specific satisfaction (leisure, income, health) predicted global life satisfaction at each wave; leisure satisfaction was consistently the strongest predictor. Plotting observed life satisfaction against age provided descriptive support for a U-shaped pattern, with higher satisfaction in early and later adulthood and lower satisfaction in midlife. These findings contribute to theoretical debates by showing that while life satisfaction has trait-like qualities (i.e., is stable over time), is also influenced by domain-specific appraisals (particularly leisure). The results thus support bottom-up models of well-being, highlighting the importance of personally valued life domains in understanding both stability and change in life satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI)–the brain’s ability to combine information from different ‎senses–is crucial for coherent perception and adaptive behavior. While often viewed as a ‎bottom-up process, emerging research shows internal states like emotional arousal can ‎modulate MSI. The role of metacognition–our awareness of perceptual accuracy–‎remains underexplored in this context, particularly in relation to multisensory illusions ‎such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). This study examined how facially ‎induced emotional arousal affects audiovisual integration and metacognitive efficiency ‎during the SIFI task. It also assessed whether individual differences in sensory-‎processing sensitivity (via the Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) influence these ‎effects. Fifty-five participants completed an online SIFI task, where neutral or disgusted ‎facial cues preceded audiovisual stimuli across six stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). ‎Participants reported the number of flashes and rated their confidence. Accuracy and ‎confidence improved at longer SOAs. However, while confidence was unaffected by the ‎pre/post condition, accuracy was significantly influenced, indicating a dissociation ‎between performance and subjective certainty. Emotional cues did not affect accuracy or ‎confidence, but higher HSP scores were linked to lower metacognitive efficiency, ‎especially in negative emotional contexts (β = –0.16, p = .04), though the interaction ‎was not statistically significant. Bayesian analysis suggested a 75% chance of a negative ‎interaction, but with uncertainty. These findings highlight that while arousal doesn’t ‎impair MSI, high sensory sensitivity may reduce introspective accuracy in emotional ‎contexts, with implications for decision-making and responsive technology design.‎",

          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed.

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Sustained attention fluctuates continuously between periods of low and high attentional engagement. Two major approaches have been used in the literature to capture these fluctuations. An objective approach, based on reaction time (RT) variability, identifies periods known as in-the-zone (stable and accurate) and out-of-the-zone (variable and error-prone). A subjective approach relies on participants’ self-reports regarding task-related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs). While both methods have proven effective in tracking attentional fluctuations, it remains unclear whether they capture the same type of fluctuations. In this study, we aimed to better characterize the subjective experience associated with objectively defined out-of-the-zone periods. Thirty participants completed a classic sustained attention task—the Continuous Performance Task (CPT)—in a go/no-go format. At several points during the task, participants were interrupted with subjective probes assessing their current mental state (task-focused, performance-focused, external distraction, daydreaming, and mind-blanking), as well as their perceived effort, opportunity cost, and arousal. Our results offer a nuanced view of the relationship between subjective and objective approaches. We found evidence for consistency: out-of-the-zone periods were more frequently associated with daydreaming than in-the-zone periods. However, inconsistencies also emerged. In-the-zone periods were marked by faster RTs, whereas subjective on-task periods were associated with slower responses. Arousal was reduced during TUT periods but did not differ between in- and out-of-the-zone periods. Together, these findings suggest that while RT variability reflects some aspects of subjective experience, subjective and objective approaches may diverge in how they capture performance dynamics and internal states such as arousal.",

We tested for associations between TBI and depression, each ascertained multiple ways, and in opposing directions (depression predicting TBI; TBI predicting depression). \n\nMethods: Using UK Biobank data (N=502,356) we investigated bi-directional associations between TBI (ICD-10 coded broad- or narrow-band TBI) and depression (self-report and/or incident ICD-10 coded). We tested this in each direction: baseline historic TBI predicting the incidence of subsequent depression and, separately, baseline depression predicting the incidence of a first subsequent TBI. All analyses were adjusted for age at UK Biobank baseline assessment, sex, educational attainment, deprivation, smoking history, alcohol intake, physical and neurological health conditions.\n\nResults:  In participants with history of TBI (versus not), there was increased risk of subsequent incident depression, compared with participants with no documented TBI history (e.g. narrow-band TBI fully-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18 risk of depression; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.87 to 2.55; P&lt;0.001). In the other direction there was evidence that people with history of lifetime depression had significantly increased risk of subsequent incident TBI (e.g. HR = 1.76 of narrow-band TBI, 95% CI = 1.61 to 1.94, P&lt;0.001). \n\nConclusion: We show significant associations between TBI and depression: depression was a risk factor for subsequent TBI in previously unaffected participants, but also vice-versa.

Participants were 2463 autistic people and 315 non-autistic people who supported or had been bereaved by the suicide of an autistic person. We thematically analysed their free-text responses. \nAlthough participants reported that crisis interventions (e.g., dedicated helplines) were helpful, they preferred larger-scale preventative measures (e.g., improving support in schools) which better addressed systemic inequalities. Participants were positive about providing support to people awaiting autism assessment, but some were less supportive of providing dedicated autism supports to people who self-diagnose or who are not currently diagnosed (but may be questioning autism). Most participants viewed co-production as vital for ensuring interventions reflect the expertise and empathy of autistic people.\nSuicide in autistic people must be viewed in the context of pervasive and systemic injustices, rather than individualistic psychopathology. Accordingly, the extent to which crisis interventions can reduce suicide rates is contingent on additional systemic, preventative and coordinated actions to tackle the social determinants of suicide and support enduring wellbeing in this group.

          "abstract": "Impersonal prosociality is considered a cornerstone of a thriving civic society, well-functioning institutions, and a growing economy. Previous research has documented substantial cross-societal variation in prosociality using tasks such as dictator games, where individuals allocate money between themselves and others. In such tasks, individuals typically receive full information about how decisions impact others and make decisions privately. Here, we propose that different societies rely on distinct mechanisms—guilt and internalized norms versus shame and external pressures—to support prosociality. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 7,978 participants in 20 culturally diverse countries across five continents. We administered dictator games and experimentally manipulated guilt, by varying information about the consequences of participants’ decisions (full versus hidden), and shame, by varying observability (public versus private). Additionally, we measured the Importance of Guilt over Shame (IGS) at the individual and country level.  We found robust evidence for guilt-driven prosociality around the world, such that prosociality increased substantially when individuals received information by default compared to when they could avoid it. Further, providing information led to a stronger increase in prosociality among individuals, though not countries, scoring higher on IGS. In contrast, making decisions observable by third parties had only small effects on prosocial choices. Our study provides a first comprehensive investigation of how guilt and shame influence prosocial decision-making, and uncovers both similarities and differences in mechanisms to promote prosociality across countries.",

          "abstract": "An agro-meteorological investigation was undertaken to determine“the impact of crop yield attributes and yield of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) varieties under different sowing windows” during kharif, 2017-18 and 2018-19 at Department of Agricultural Meteorology, College of Agriculture, Pune. In this context, an experiment was laid out in split plot design with three replications. The treatment comprised of four varieties viz., Vipula, Rajeshwari (Phule T 0012), BDN 711 and ICPH 2740 as main plot and four sowing windows viz., 24th, 26th MW, 28th and 30th MW as sub plot treatments. Yield contributing characters viz., number of pods plant-1 (149.5 and 143.0), weight of pods plant-1 (113.8 and 107.6 g) and 100 seed weight (10.79 and 10.75 g) were found significantly higher in var. ICPH 2740 over var. Vipula, Rajeshwari and BDN 711.Grain yield (26.59 and 28.14 q ha-1) and stalk yield (39.61 and 36.7 q ha-1) were significantly higher in var. ICPH 2740 followed by var. Rajeshwari, Vipula and BDN 711.On the other hand, Grain yield (24.31 and 22.86 q ha-1) and stalk yield (63.6 and 61.8 q ha-1) was higher in 24th MW sowing window during the year 2017-18 and 2018-19, respectively.",

          "abstract": "The success or failure of a crop is heavily depends on accumulation of received amount and intensity of rainfall mostly from southwest and northeast monsoon. Crop loss can be minimized by making adjustment through timely and accurate weather forecasting. Hence, there is necessity to validate the coming five days rainfall forecast analysis to determine the accuracy skill for managing strategic decisions by farmers. For validation of rainfall forecast qualitative and quantitative verification methods were adopted by India Meteorological Department, New Delhi. In these results, validation of qualitative and quantitative verification methods for southwest and northeast monsoon, 2021 indicated that high skill score for all ASD (agro sub divisional) level and moderate skill score for Khammam district level. A survey was conducted randomly for 230 farmers during year 2021-22 for reviewing effectiveness of agromet advisory services (AAS). The results indicated that most of farmers have been following AAS and checking weather forecast for post harvest operations like sowing / transplanting, harvesting / threshing, pesticide application, irrigation application, fertilizer application and other farm operations. It was observed from survey that 60.4 % of respondents rated AAS as highly satisfactory service.",

          "abstract": "The high rate of Urbanization and loss of bird habitat at the global level is increasing day by day and now due to this activity challenging ecosystem will create problems in the future because more people prefer to live in the cities. The main objective of the study was to know the current status of urban bird diversity, their habitat, and their conservation plan. Point count and Line transect methods were used for the bird survey. The various bird species with population were sighted through binocular and species identification was done by using different identification keys. Photograph of birds was taken by the Nikon DSLR camera and the GPS locations of each study site were recorded in the datasheet. The total numbers of 104 bird species were recorded from all study sites belonging to 16 orders and 48 families. In recent times some species migrated from urban to semi-urban areas because they have not existed in narrow habitats. However, some scavenger birds are seen at dead animal dumping sites. Family Columbidae was found dominant with 6% contribution followed by families like Muscicapidae, Sturnidae, Motacillidae, Scolopacidae, and Anatidae with 5% contribution each and further followed by other families with less than 5% contribution. These present results indicate that Rock dove is highly habituated in the urban ecosystem while House sparrow, Golden oriole, Grey hornbill, and Egyptian vulture are sensitive species. So they are seen as local migratory species. A conservation plan is needed to develop green belts at street level and with the maintenance of the old garden; new parks should be established in urban areas. The artificial nest (wooden nest), food (mixed grains), and water properly take place in parks. Birds are also important for the maintenance of the ecosystem because they act as an effective tool for biological pest control.",

          "abstract": "The objective of the study was to provide insights on disruptions faced by farmers due to COVID-19 for harvest of rabi (winter) crop and preparations for kharif (summer) crop and to suggest appropriate policy measures to enable farmers to cope with similar disruptions in agricultural activities. Data were collected from 125 farmers from five tribal hamlets of Deverkonda mandal of Nalgonda district of Telangana state. The major constraints reported by almost all the farmers (99.2%) were financial problems primarily due to loss of wage work, repayment of informal loans (83%), fear of contracting COVID-19 (92%) and health of family members (89%) which adversely affected their work efficiency. Paddy crop was the most affected as rated by 80.8% of the farmers, followed by vegetables 52.8%, groundnut 41.6%, cotton 37.6%, redgram 16.8% and fruit crops(sweet lime) 13.6% respectively. The farmers faced problems in land preparation (92.8%), high cost of inputs (96.8%), and low availability of inputs (75.2%), transport problems to procure inputs (96.8%), labour shortage (67.2%) and storage of unsold produce (75.2%). Shortage of animal feed (79.2%) and health care of animals (85.6%) were the constraints faced in livestock care. The harvesting of paddy was the most affected due to shortage of labour and harvesting machines. Community seed and animal feed banks, collectives like farmer producer organizations, collateral free credit, small packaging of inputs, promotion of youth entrepreneurship in processing storage and sale of produce and mechanization of small farms, direct procurement, logistic support are some of the immediate and mid- term measures being suggested for building resilience of food systems to face future risks.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the usage and benefits of business intelligence in personal care industry of the Middle East. Business intelligence is driving the placement of brands to be a part of consumer’s consideration set. Generally Saudi Arabia and UAE are considered the leading Gulf Corporate Countries (GCC) in skincare and cosmetic consumptions due to several factors including population, climatic, urbanization, tourism and high-volume of resided expatriates. The authors have focused on the integration of business intelligence in communication, influencers-marketing, trending ingredients and market adaptation. The critical review is being followed by quantitative data to support the findings. The research was conducted on 150 sample-size in five different countries (Oman, Bahrain, U.A.E., Saudi Arabia and Qatar) within five-month span. The online questionnaire utilized the random convenience sampling technique to obtain first-hand analysis as well as ordinal and nominal scale with additional open-ended questions. The questionnaire results highlighted Middle Eastern consumers’ motives when selecting skin/personal care products according its social-media popularity, trend, and real-time results. The survey analysis has provided a valuable insight to cosmetic brands in terms of consumers’ habits, choice, and demographics to invest and explore new market segments intelligently. The findings empathized the trends that the leading cosmetic brands should follow for updating the ingredients and enhance product transparency to achieve client loyalty. Moreover, being gender-natural is one of the key-factors in adapting today’s cosmetic global market. The present findings have supported the prior, however limited research that the heuristics side of any decision taken based on datamining cannot be guaranteed unless the potential segment can relate to the same. The pioneer brands in the personal care industry proposed the revamping of competitive advantage based on business intelligence on a regular basis. The present study is a novel attempt in the proposed area as no literature is available for the personal care industry in the Middle East region in terms of an empirical research. Finally, the recommendations have been divided into various subsections including Diversification and inclusiveness, Product Strategy, Prioritize transparency, Product Sustainability and E-Commerce and Technology.",

          "abstract": "First-ever a straightforward semi-empirical method is employed to compute elastic parameters (elastic wave velocities, elastic moduli, Debye temperature), thermodynamic parameters (molar heat capacities at constant volume and pressure, Debye temperature, electronic contribution to molar heat capacity, lattice potential energy), and optical parameters (refractive index, optical energy bandgap, dielectric, electronic and ionic polarizabilities) for pyrochlore-type yttrium-titanate (Y2Ti2O7) at 300 K. The results of our calculations are compared with the existing experimentally and theoretically determined data. The quite satisfactory agreement between the two validates the approach adopted. The value of molar heat capacity at constant volume computed based on the Einstein theory for pyrochlore is accordant with theoretically predicted value from the law of Dulong and Petit while the Debye theory fails to estimate the consistent value at 300 K. It appeared that electronic molar heat capacity contributes ~ 0.5 % to the total molar heat capacity and the electronic and lattice molar heat capacities are comparable at 14.5 K. The applicability of the oxide additivity rule is examined and found successful in predicting the dielectric, electronic, ionic polarizabilities and lattice potential energy of the complex oxide composition. The semi-empirical method used in the present investigation is found quite simple as compared to previous cumbersome evaluation methods.",

          "abstract": "Personality interventions are a field of growing interest, as many people want to change aspects of their personality and personality trait changes promise to positively impact important life outcomes. Although initial research shows that personality interventions can be successful in eliciting lasting trait changes, the strategies, timing, and context of effective personality interventions remain unclear. A careful examination of how these characteristics would advance intervention effectiveness and theoretical models of volitional personality change. We used intensive longitudinal data from the Changing How I Live Life (CHILL) Study to examine the effects of different intervention strategies and their timing and situational context on intervention adherence, satisfaction, and changes in momentary positive affect as proximal intervention outcomes. The CHILL Study is a multi-method intervention study combining experience sampling methods and mobile sensing to investigate the effects of a smartphone intervention to decrease neuroticism (N = 399; 39,878 assessments). Intervention strategies that targeted the state level of neuroticism had more positive effects on people’s momentary affect than habit-level strategies, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of successful personality change. Furthermore, effects differed depending on the timing and situational context of intervention prompts, pointing to possibilities of optimizing the timing of personality interventions. For example, people were more likely to adhere to intervention prompts in quieter environments or at home. Together, these findings inform theoretical models of personality trait change and can be used to guide the development of effective and refined personality interventions.",

The unavailability of channels at certain instant poses challenges for spectrum allocation process in Cognitive Radio Networks. The opportunistic use of the spectrum by the secondary user in an efficient manner proves of good use for effective utilisation of the spectrum which further improves the communication in Cognitive Radio Networks. We have evaluated the performance of hypergraph coloring algorithm in accordance to various parameters taken into consideration like Average Sum Rate (ASR) to see the variation with respect to the number of channels and the number of users. We propose Hypergraph Coloring Algorithm which has better performance than the graph-based channel allocation algorithm. The existing algorithm approach is giving better result in terms of utilization of spectrum in an efficient manner involving Hypergraph coloring algorithm for channel allocation.",

          "abstract": "The preliminary survey was carryout to assess the farmers understanding about the   generic pesticide (single active ingredient with different trade name). Total of 45 farmers participated in this study through interviews. Three commonly used pesticides by smallholder in the locality with different active ingredients were presented to the farmers to evaluate their understanding about the similarity and importance of generic pesticide. Open ended questioner was used. Those commonly used pesticides presented to the farmers are 1. Dimethoate (Agro-Thoate 40%EC, Ethiothoate 40%EC, Dimethoate 40 % EC, Dimeto40%EC and Roger) 2. Lambda-cyhalothrin (Karate 2.5% EC, Lamdex 5% EC, Helerat 50EC, Lamdex 5% EC, Farate 3. Profenofose (Ajanta, Profit 720EC, Polytrin315EC, and Selecron 720% EC). In this study from 45 farmers who asked about the generic pesticide, the similarity of Lamdex 5% EC, and Farate, 43 out of 45 farmers did considered these insecticides as different and they used this insecticide for different pest control. Similarly over 96% of the farmers did not understand the similarity  among Ajanta, Profit 720EC, Polytrin315EC, and Selecron 720%EC , and 91% did not understand the similarity  among  Agro-Thoate  40%EC, Ethiothoate 40%EC. This misunderstanding of farmers about similar pesticide with different trade name contributes for ineffective pest control, farmers used single active ingredient (with different trade name) for different pest control due to miss understanding. Hence, the government and non government other concerned body should create enough awareness regarding to similarity of for smallholder farmers. Pesticide manufacturers, should also be responsible for pest for this action.",

          "abstract": "Diesel oil pollution is a major challenge in most developing countries like Nigeria. This study was carried out to ascertain the possibility of remediating diesel oil polluted soils using palm bunch ash. Samples of garden soil with no history of diesel oil pollution were spiked with 100mL of Bonny Light diesel oil and left for two weeks to simulate a condition of major spill before adding different weights of palm bunch ash (0, P+NOPBA, 50g, 150g, 250g and 350g). 1g from each treatment was collected monthly and subjected to laboratory analysis using standard analytical methods for soil selected heavy metals contents using AAS. Preliminary results revealed alteration of chemical properties of soils, elevated heavy metals levels two weeks after spiking indicating that the soil sample had undergone slight alteration. There was a dose dependent decrease in heavy metal content of the diesel oil polluted soils with time. Mean concentration of Zinc ranged from 95.7mg/kg to 7.45mg/kg; 9590.5 to 99.83 in Fe; 3.5mg/kg 1.4mg/kg Cu; 1.45mg/kg to 0.06mg/kg Cd and 10.90mg/kg to 0.05mg/kg in Pb. Overall, net reduction in heavy metals was very low in soil left under natural attenuation (polluted untreated soil) than treated soils. This study has revealed a marked degradation of the heavy metal content of soil which indicated that palm bunch ash could be used for remediation of diesel oil polluted soil. It is recommended that palm bunch ash be replaced with conventional fertilizer in restoration of crude contaminated soil.",

Methyl red test and tryptophanase assay (by indole test) were found to be positively and negatively correlated with phosphate solubilization. Vogues Proskeur and citrate utilization tests were negatively correlated with the phosphate solubilization. In future, these biochemical tests can be used as determining factors to identify phosphate solubilizing bacteria. Moreover, a group of bacteria was identified by the scatter plot analysis which shows low acid production with high phosphate solubilization. Lastly, we have given a new approach of screening rhizospheric bacteria based on motility on nitrogen deficient media.",

          "abstract": "The oil and gas industry is one of the core sectors of the national economy, playing a fundamental role in ensuring energy security. The Covid-19 situation, which has driven companies to innovate, may serve as a catalyst for rethinking the size and role of functional teams, field workers, and management processes required to run an efficient oil and gas company. The slump in global oil consumption due to the pandemic has caused a shock to the Russian economy. To gain comprehensive insights on the performance of the oil and gas industry in Russia, this study aims to develop an integrated methodology that combines the Grey prediction method, a so-called GM (1,1) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Malmquist model for the prediction and evaluation of the top 10 potential companies in Russia. Grey theory is adopted to predict the companies’ data during 2020–2023, and the Malmquist method is used to evaluate their performance over the whole period of 2016–2023, based on three input factors (total assets, total liabilities, cost of revenue), and two output factors (total revenue and net income). During the research period, “Russneft” was found to have performed the most efficiently while “Slavneft” held the least-effective company, despite its efforts to achieve progressive technological changes. Overall, all companies have achieved excellent technological efficiency. Thus, the average total factor productivity indexes of all companies mainly rely on their technical performance. This study assists policymakers and decision-makers in expediting their recovery plans for further sustainable development in the oil and gas industry.",

          "abstract": "Ideals play important roles in human life and psychology. Over the past decade, several mindfulness-based interventions have directly cultivated ideal mentalities that have not yet been achieved at the level of humanity, leading to the establishment of ideal psychology. Beyond research on ideal mentalities, ideal psychology has evolved into a general psychological approach characterized by future-oriented perspectives and associated methodologies. This article provides the first detailed introduction of this emerging approach. It summarizes six defining features of ideal mentalities, presents the design–achievement–evaluation cycle for research on them, and outlines seven methodological principles for enhancing studies on both ideal and existing mentalities with similar features. It further illustrates three aspects of future-oriented perspectives that shape research, through which it clarifies how ideal psychology relates to previous schools of psychology such as critical psychology, positive psychology, and transpersonal psychology, as well as to other traditions including Eastern spiritual traditions, Marxism and the critical tradition, transhumanism, and Plato’s philosophy. The article also exemplifies recent applications of ideal psychology in cultivating ideal mentalities such as mentalities of emptiness, Confucian oneness, and the nondifferential four immeasurables, as well as in advancing research on existing mentalities such as mindfulness, mortality salience, and beliefs about human nature. Finally, it discusses the major contributions, limitations, and future directions of ideal psychology.",

          "abstract": "Story reading is often accompanied by mental visualization of the scenes and the events described. Individuals with aphantasia, who report not experiencing vivid visual imagery, have recently been reported to be less absorbed and engaged when reading stories. In the present study, we explored how aphantasics read imagery-rich stories differently from control subjects by analyzing their gaze fixation patterns. We found that in both groups, gaze fixation was similarly influenced by different types of story content. Notably, under perceptual imagery, which involves sensory-rich contents, the influence was the strongest, resulting in longer fixation durations during relevant keywords in both groups. Despite the same fixation patterns, aphantasics reported less experienced immersion in the stories, consistent with a previous study. Furthermore, we observed that in control subjects, longer fixation duration on perceptual imagery contents was correlated with higher experienced mental imagery, whereas in aphantasic individuals, this relationship was absent and even reversed. Our findings may align with the account that imagery under aphantasia may be nonconscious rather than nonexistent, leading to the lack of introspective access to mental images, as the fixation patterns indicative of reading behavior were similar, while only reported subjective experiences differed under aphantasia.",

The dataset also includes detailed physical properties such as hand height, distance to the body, arm angle, hand configuration, palm orientation, repetitions, size, and speed, alongside 3D pose tracking data. Where possible, video recordings provide additional multimodal context. Notably, we identified several previously undocumented lexemes, expanding the current lexicon of gesture research.

Eliot gently suggests that there is a reasonable association between religion, culture in the controversial writings. For Eliot; our way of life and religion secure the convictions that regularly force on us, and our revelatory judgment and public analysis of our social guidance are personally identified with individuals. Eliot gave fastidious consideration to Eastern people's promotions and religions and examined the ceremonies. During a considerable study of his amazing sonnets, he supposedly examines Eastern religions, including Zoroastrianism, and fire-revere, Indian, Buddhist religions and contentious issues about human life and fate. Therefore, this study tries to investigate Eliot’s poems in the light of Eastern mythology, Zoroastrianism, the symbol of fire in East. Iran and Iranian civilization have a long history, in this regard, Iranian culture and civilization have always been the focus of writers and philosophers around the world. Eliot has paid special attention to Eastern civilizations and religions and he has studied many rituals of past. In some of his poems, he has dealt with Eastern religions, including Zoroastrianism and fire festivals. In the \"Hollow Men\" he has paid special attention to the Eastern religions, Zoroastrian beliefs, rituals and rituals of the past. Since no research has been done on this subject, the purpose of this article is to examine the myth of fire and Zoroastrian beliefs in some of Eliot's poems such as, “Waste Land”, “Four Quarts”, “Ash Wednesday”, “Hollow Man”.",

          "abstract": "Beekeeping in Himachal Pradesh plays very important role not only in fruit pollination but also in honey production. The farmers here are facing many problems in bee rearing during recent years.This survey was conducted to assess the problems of beekeepers and orchardists in Himachal Himalaya. It was observed thatbeekeeping is important for securing food, poverty reduction, health, environmental protection, honey production and plant pollination. The farmers here practiced beekeeping as a part time or whole time job and were engaged in this venture for the last many years. Commercial beekeepers stressed on the role of honeybees as honey producers than pollinators of horticultural crops. Most of the farmers also earned extra income from honey and other bee products besides using them for pollination purposes. The farmers had knowledge regarding different aspects of honey production, processing and marketing i.e. constituents of honey, nutritional value, different type of honey containers used for honey storage, honey processing, marketing problems etc. But only some farmers were acquainted with different pests, predators and diseases of honeybees and their remedial measures.\n\nMost of the farmers wanted to have financial support for different horticultural practices and training purposes. They preferred to be trained in orchard management technology and beekeeping practices. There were different types of constraints faced by beekeepers regarding the beekeeping practices which included non availability of bee flora throughout the year, heavy snowfall, shortage of labour, habit of absconding of bees and poor knowledge about medicines. Apiculture requires organizing honey marketing channels and raising awareness on limiting the use of pesticides in agriculture to protect the bees and the environment as well. The renovations and application of improved beekeeping technologies not only benefits beekeepers but also farmers and the general public in pollinating their crops, maintaining plant biodiversity, and the ecology at large.",

          "abstract": "Speech is humanity’s strongest coordination technology, yet we rarely treat it as an\nengineered system. This thesis reframes speech as a toolchain—Intention →\nCompilation → Actuation → Feedback—and proposes Return on Expression (RoE), the\nrealized state change per unit cost, as the organizing objective. We present (i) a\nformal state-space/control model of utterances as interventions on beliefs, goals, and\ncommitments; (ii) an empirically calibrated affordance map that translates context\nvariables (uncertainty, risk, expertise asymmetry, channel constraints) into design\nchoices (framing, redundancy, prosody); (iii) a failure taxonomy with detectable\nsignals and mitigation protocols; and (iv) a Speech IDE that instruments conversation\nwith an LLM-in-the-loop intention compiler, ambiguity linters, a commitment type\nchecker, and a grounding meter. We define standardized micro‑protocols (e.g., Query\n→ Calibrate → Commit; Goal → Constraint → Offer → Check) and preregistered\nexperiments across lab and field settings to estimate treatment effects on RoE,\ncommitment conversion, grounding depth, and rework. Bayesian hierarchical models\nsupport estimation and transportability across domains. Ethics features\n(consent‑to‑influence, bias audits, kill‑switches) reduce misuse. If validated in\npreregistered A/B tests (≥20% CCR lift and ≥25% ambiguity‑error reduction), this\nframework provides a measurable, reproducible way to teach speech as a\ncraft—raising coordination reliability in education, healthcare, and operations while\nestablishing RoE as a first‑class design objective.",

Su rasgo cardinal, la anhedonia, se vincula con alteraciones en la neurotransmisión dopaminérgica, desbalances energéticos neuronales y procesos neuroinflamatorios.\n\nEste trabajo describe la evolución natural del síndrome cuando no recibe diagnóstico ni intervención: desde la fase inicial con apatía fluctuante (0–6 meses), pasando por depresión persistente (6–18 meses), hasta la cronificación con deterioro funcional (2–3 años) y finalmente la progresión a cuadros de neurodegeneración y riesgo vital por suicidio (5–10 años). Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).\n\nSe discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.\n\nEl presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.",

The theory assumes that individuals’\nresponses to reality are not directly derived from events themselves, but from the\nsubjective structural construction of perspectives, which influences the understanding\nand assignment of meanings to events. This paper presents a three-dimensional\nstructural model of subjective perspectives, including cognitive stance, psychological\npositioning, and interpretive path, explaining how they interact and affect individuals' emotional and behavioral reactions. By comparing existing emotion appraisal theories\nand cognitive behavioral theories, this paper further reveals the advantages of \"perspective reconstruction\" in emotional intervention and cognitive adjustment, offering potential applications in education, psychological intervention, and other\nfields.",

          "abstract": "Vertical scales are intended to establish a common metric for scores on test forms targeting different levels of development in a specified domain. They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may affect grade-to-grade score distributions. Monte Carlo simulation and synthetic data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce meaningfully different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

          "abstract": "It has long been proposed that the brain integrates pitch and timing cues during auditory perception. If true, the pitch of a sound should influence its perceived timing, and its timing should influence its perceived pitch. Previous research has found that higher-pitched sounds tend to be perceived as faster than lower-pitched sounds, and in the present study we investigated whether sounds that arrive earlier or later than expected are similarly perceived as higher or lower in pitch. In Experiment 1, participants heard isochronous, repeating standard tones followed by a pitch-shifted probe, and indicated if the pitch increased or decreased. We observed a strong biasing effect of the probe’s timing on its perceived pitch, such that later probes were more likely to be perceived as lower than the standard. Correct, bias-conforming responses to mistimed probes were also significantly faster than responses to on-beat probes. In Experiment 2, we used an adaptive difficulty procedure to investigate whether this timing-induced bias strengthens under conditions of low discriminability. We did not find evidence that bias varies with the magnitude of pitch change or with individual differences in pitch sensitivity. In conjunction with past findings of pitch-induced illusory timing changes, our results support the hypothesis that pitch and time are perceptually integrated. We discuss this integration within a Bayesian predictive coding framework, as possibly learned from real-world correlations between pitch and timing that derive from latent properties of sound sources.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show difficulties determining whether environmental cues, particularly in social contexts, are meant for them, which relates to symptoms and determinants of social functioning. Recent computational modeling findings have emphasized disruptions in evidence accumulation, which index how visual information is extracted from social cues, as a potential driver. Yet, it is unclear whether these disruptions reflect more general difficulties with social/face processing or are specific to self-referential gaze perception, and how they map onto clinical features. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to clarify cognitive processes driving self-referential gaze perception and non-self-referential gender perception in 39 SZ and 42 controls. DDMs captured key cognitive processes, including sensitivity of evidence accumulation to gaze and gender cues, perceptual biases, and expectation biases. We clarified whether disruptions to these processes in SZ were unique to self-referential judgments or general to face processing, and to what extent they related to paranoia and social cognition. Relative to controls, SZ exhibited perceptual biases specific to self-referential decisions, predisposing the over perception of eye contact, and broad reductions in evidence accumulation sensitivity to social cues during both self-referential and non-self-referential decisions. Broad insensitivities to gaze and gender cues, not perceptual biases, were associated with more severe paranoia in SZ. This suggests that aberrant self-reference in SZ is shaped by disruptions in the process of accumulating evidence during general social and self-referential information processing. More general disruptions in evidence accumulation, across different kinds of social decisions, may help bridge perceptual dysfunctions and symptoms, such as paranoia, in SZ.",

Underlying this complexity, we argue, are key elements of human social psychology regarding social comparison and the resolution of coordination and collective action problems. The Multi-Capital Leadership (MCL) theory posits that leader emergence and effectiveness depend on perceptions of individuals’ abilities to provide benefits or impose costs in solving challenges of group living, through the deployment of different forms of capital: material, social, somatic (e.g., physical formidability, height, immune functionality), and neural (e.g., knowledge, intelligence, personality, supernatural abilities). We integrate this framework with a review of leadership across human societies, including in non-state and non-industrial contexts, and with novel comparative analyses of ethnographic data. This synthesis highlights how context-specific demands for coordination and collective action, and the accuracy of social comparison, shape the structure and dynamics of leadership and followership across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Multisensory integration (MSI)–the brain’s ability to combine information from different senses–is ‎crucial for coherent perception and adaptive behavior. While often viewed as a bottom-up process, ‎emerging research shows internal states like emotional arousal can modulate MSI. The role of ‎metacognition–our awareness of perceptual accuracy–remains underexplored in this context, particularly ‎in relation to multisensory illusions such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). This study ‎examined how facially induced emotional arousal affects audiovisual integration and metacognitive ‎efficiency during the SIFI task. It also assessed whether individual differences in sensory-processing ‎sensitivity (via the Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) influence these effects. Fifty-five participants ‎completed an online SIFI task, where neutral or disgusted facial cues preceded audiovisual stimuli across ‎six stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Participants reported the number of flashes and rated their ‎confidence. Accuracy and confidence improved at longer SOAs. However, while confidence was ‎unaffected by the pre/post condition, accuracy was significantly influenced, indicating a dissociation ‎between performance and subjective certainty. Emotional cues did not affect accuracy or confidence, but ‎higher HSP scores were linked to lower metacognitive efficiency, especially in negative emotional ‎contexts (β = –0.16, p = .04), though the interaction was not statistically significant. Bayesian analysis ‎suggested a 75% chance of a negative interaction, but with uncertainty. These findings highlight that ‎while arousal doesn’t impair MSI, high sensory sensitivity may reduce introspective accuracy in ‎emotional contexts, with implications for decision-making and responsive technology design.‎",

Drawing from Cialdini’s principles and Kahneman’s cognitive heuristics, the BCS integrates subtle design cues into a one-page agreement form that frames payment timelines, offers structured choices, embeds self-commitment language, and introduces incentive-based reciprocity. The design process involved iterative revisions and expert input from educational psychologists and school administrators.  Implementation in school settings involves distribution during registration, parent selection of preferred payment plans, and school-side tracking. Anticipated outcomes include improved payment compliance, reduced administrative burden, and increased parent-school collaboration. A pilot study is planned to evaluate the form’s effectiveness, refine its structure, and inform broader scale-up. The BCS offers a novel, theory-driven approach to addressing persistent compliance issues in school fee management.",

Here we present the outcome of a 10-year program that started with creating a novel test, the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive substrates (APACS), and evolved in using it – along with ToM assessment – in seven clinical groups (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, and dyslexia). The multistudy cross-diagnostic analysis of 454 participants revealed that receptive pragmatic skills were impaired in all clinical groups compared to controls, with schizophrenia showing the most severely impaired profile, whereas expressive pragmatic skills were impaired in four neurological conditions (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, right-hemisphere stroke, and traumatic brain injury). The association with ToM was limited to receptive pragmatics and moderate in the whole sample. Overall, pragmatic impairment emerged as a diffuse feature of neurological and psychiatric illnesses, which contributes to defining complex socio-communicative phenotypes but cannot be equated to a social cognition deficit and should hence be the target of specific assessment and intervention.",

We developed the Physical and Mental Metaphors task and used it alongside the Strange Stories task in a series of studies involving neurotypical children throughout middle childhood. A meta-analysis conducted on our work, including 500 children aged 8-12, showed that metaphor and ToM are significantly associated, even when controlling for vocabulary. This association peaks around the age of 9 and fades away with increasing age. Our longitudinal and training studies evidenced that it is especially metaphor that benefits ToM, rather than vice versa. The results of our research program confirm the inherent mindreading component of pragmatic operations as postulated by post-Gricean pragmatics, also highlighting that ToM involvement in metaphor varies dynamically depending on age and possibly other factors such as the type of metaphor. We argue that pragmatics should not be seen as ancillary to ToM but rather a driving factor for socio-cognitive development and that integrating insights from developmental psychology in studying metaphors and pragmatics, such as the attention to individual differences, brings new opportunities for research.",

We investigated potential mechanisms underlying this effect, examining the role of autobiographical memory and cognitive functioning. 120 individuals aged 20-91 were assessed on subjective time perception for the preceding decade and year, the quantity and significance of autobiographical memories from those periods, and overall cognitive status. Results confirmed the specific age-related increase in perceived temporal acceleration over the past decade. However, no significant association was found between perceived time passage over the past decade and either the number or subjective value of memories. Contrary to assumptions, older adults reported more vivid and meaningful recollections. Instead, reduced cognitive functioning, and specifically lower ability to form new memories as assessed through delayed memory recall, emerged as a significant mediator of accelerated time perception with age. Findings suggest that age-related cognitive decline leading to reduced ability to encode novel memories, rather than diminished autobiographical memory content, is a critical factor in the subjective experience of time compression in older adults.",

          "abstract": "Background\nChildren’s emotional and behavioral problems frequently co-occur, suggesting the existence of a general factor of psychopathology (\"p factor\") that accounts for the shared variance across internalizing and externalizing problems. Ongoing questions remain regarding the extent to which negative affectivity—a temperamental tendency to display observable manifestations likely reflecting negative emotions—and general psychopathology represent overlapping versus distinct constructs across early development. \n\nMethods\nA community-based sample of 231 children aged 3 to 7 years participated in an accelerated longitudinal study, with assessments at four time points spaced nine months apart. Data were collected via multi-informant (mother, father, teacher/secondary caregiver) ratings, structured observational tasks, and standard questionnaires. This study evaluated the convergent and discriminant validity of negative affectivity and general psychopathology measures across informants and methods using multitrait-multimethod matrices while accounting for measurement error and variance related to the informant type.\n\nResults\nFindings indicated that measures of negative affectivity and general psychopathology exhibited moderate convergent validity but also retained distinctiveness, supporting the discriminant validity in measures of these constructs. The association between the two was somewhat attenuated when controlling for informant type.\n\nConclusions\nThe results clarify that, although negative affectivity and general psychopathology are closely related in childhood, they are not redundant constructs. Additionally, the observed deflation in the association between negative affectivity and general psychopathology after accounting for informant type-related bias highlights how measurement strategies—including informant source and method variance—can meaningfully alter interpretations of the associations between psychopathology and risk/protective factors. Together, these results emphasize the importance of both conceptual and methodological precision when studying the early indicators of psychopathology and suggest critical targets for early identification and intervention to promote mental health across development.",

The contributions are: (1) recasting the seven indicators—operationality, recursion, leap-evocation, multi-actor/AI multiplicity, irreversibility, translation preservation, and measurability—into design requirements; (2) codifying the design workflow (FQ → structural pressure → timed induction of leaps → SQ consolidation → roles → operating environment → logging/recursion); (3) a failure-mode quick reference and safety kit (signals → immediate responses → prevention for control-deviation, rigidity, FQ depletion, and loss of function through translation); (4) a structure-to-OS mapping procedure with a specification sheet and quality gates; and (5) minimal trial protocols (60–90 minutes) for education, organizations, and local governance, including KPI application. Evaluation relies on external KPIs, with subjective intensity (qualia) used only as an auxiliary measure. Success is determined by operational effectiveness and the stabilization of the revision cadence. Figures are kept to a minimum; instead, reproducibility is supported through explicit log schemas, revision tickets, and stop/restart thresholds.

          "abstract": "The cognitive architecture of decision-making in bilinguals manifests differentially in the first and second languages, a phenomenon previously linked to attenuated emotional resonance in non-native language contexts. This investigation establishes the neurophysiological chronometry underlying language-modulated decision processes in Chinese–English bilinguals during a strategic economic game. Participants engaged in a coin-drawing paradigm requiring either veridical reporting when drawing a coin (mandatory betting) or presenting a strategic choice when drawing a blank (free choice between betting / lying and truth-telling). All participants exhibited the expected increase in betting frequency following coin draws, but only monolingual controls manifested shorter response latencies in this condition. While language context failed to induce measurable behavioral alterations in bilinguals, data-driven linear mixed-effects modeling of single-trial electroencephalographic data uncovered a temporal cascade wherein language context effects preceded draw outcome processing, with subsequent language-draw interactions emerging 450-600 ms post-stimulus. This time course indicates that draw outcome integration occurs approximately 150 ms later in the second than the first language in bilinguals. Crucially, when participants were free to bet or not, neural signatures discriminating between betting and non-betting decisions revealed an interaction with language context, with decision-related activity manifesting earlier in the second language and suggesting accelerated risk evaluation. Collectively, these findings reveal a language-dependent temporal dissociation in bilingual decision processing: delayed information integration yet expedited risk assessment in the second language. This neurophysiological evidence illuminates the complex interplay between linguistic and executive function in multilingual individuals, with implications for understanding situational awareness and decision-making efficacy.",

We validate our model experimentally, showing that it explains how 7- to 10-year-olds' solve a physical puzzle, including the distribution and the types of evidence children sampled. The proposed model outperforms both a purely rule-based Bayesian hypothesis search and a resource-rational random sampling approach. Our results suggest that children implement an internal mechanism for generating and testing a limited number of hypotheses, including formal programmatic rules and heuristics generated from salient problem features to seek more evidence when formal rule generation fails.",

          "abstract": "This paper organizes the evolution of human intelligence into four stages: (1) Language, (2) Logic, (3) Structure, and (4) OS (Operational Structure), and presents a standardized framework for quantitatively distinguishing the transition from the third to the fourth stage. This work is not empirical research itself, but rather a blueprint designed to enable empirical research, outlining a pathway toward the societal implementation of the Fourth Revolution. The Fourth Revolution represents a shift from evaluating the coherence of static structures to assessing operational performance—initiation, cognitive leaps, consolidation, and recursion—using external KPIs. The focus of evaluation moves from individual understanding to the collective behavior of the “field” (subject migration). The paper provides, at the outset, a terminology usage guide, a comparative table between the Third and Fourth Revolutions, a subject migration map, an OS design stack, and a KPI list, all as reusable standards for subsequent applications across domains. It defines KPI specifications, measurement protocols, and recording formats, and identifies typical mixed-phase phenomena observed during the transition, offering corrective measures. Furthermore, through domain-specific status maps and operational design templates, it proposes small-scale pilot implementations in education, organizations, and local governments, along with a 3–5–10 year roadmap, thereby presenting a shared navigation route for the societal implementation of the Fourth Revolution’s operational structures.",

          "abstract": "Citation: Ni, Y. and Cao, Y. (2025), \"Exploring ChatGPT’s capabilities, stability, potential and risks in conducting psychological counseling through simulations in school counseling\", Mental Health and Digital Technologies, Vol. ahead-of-print No. ahead-of-print. https://doi.org/10.1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013\n\nFind published version at https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013/full/html\n\nPurpose\nThis study aims to examine ChatGPT-4’s potential and stability when simulating school-counseling dialogues, offering an exploratory snapshot of its ability to convey warmth, empathy and acceptance. Drawing on 80 real student questions, this paper aims to assess response consistency and identify risk markers, such as randomness and hallucination. The goal of this study is to inform future research, guide human–AI (artificial intelligence) collaboration and support policy development on deploying large language model chatbots for accessible mental health interventions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper prompted ChatGPT-4 with 80 authentic college student counseling questions and collected three nondeterministic replies per query. Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length.\n\nFindings\nChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings.\n\nPractical implications\nHigh warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design.\n\nSocial implications\nDeployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",

          "abstract": "All causal responses in the universe are constrained by a strictly positive minimum response time, τ₀. While this principle unifies the “form” of dynamic behaviors across physical, biological, and cognitive systems, we demonstrate here that it also governs their “substance”—the very condition for existence. We introduce the τ₀ stability criterion: a system can persist only if its intrinsic minimum response time is much shorter than its characteristic lifetime. This criterion explains why protons are stable, why DNA can store information over generations, and why conscious processes endure within neural dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a possible link between τ₀ and the Higgs field, suggesting that mass may arise as the inverse of fundamental response delay. Our framework thus connects dynamics and stability, form and substance, opening a path toward a unified understanding of existence itself.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the systemic barriers facing scholarly work that challenges mainstream academic paradigms, revealing how institutional gatekeeping mechanisms effectively prevent critical voices from finding publication outlets. Through rigorous analysis of three paradigmatic cases—peer review gatekeeping at prestigious journals, preprint platform moderation masquerading as quality control, and online platform censorship—we demonstrate that mainstream academia systematically suppresses publications that challenge established theories and practices. Our analysis reveals that preprint moderation has been weaponized by the academic establishment under the false pretext of preventing \"low-quality publications,\" while the true perpetrators of academic pollution are mainstream journals that flood the literature with incremental, theory-conforming research lacking genuine innovation. We argue that authors seeking preprint publication are driven not by fame-seeking motivations but by sincere conviction in their research findings and the absence of alternative publication venues. The paper concludes with concrete recommendations for creating genuinely open platforms for scholarly discourse that can accommodate rigorous critical examination of established paradigms.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Economic agents often appear to exercise choice, even though their actions may arise from entirely deterministic processes. When individuals observe only low-dimensional projections of their own high-dimensional internal states, such as evolving preferences or neural configurations, their behaviour exhibits Residual Free Will, which is a structured set of apparently feasible actions shaped by unobserved variation. The paper formalises this idea through Observable Indeterminacy, which characterises when and how deterministic systems generate the appearance of stochastic choice due to informational constraints. This framework provides deterministic microfoundations for random utility models and reinterprets econometric error terms as projections of hidden but lawful dynamics. It yields empirical predictions that distinguish residual-based randomness from true noise, i.e., choices lie on lower-dimensional manifolds, individual deviations are temporally persistent, and violations of revealed preference arise from unobserved preference evolution rather than irrationality. Applications to consumer theory, market equilibrium, and welfare analysis demonstrate how core economic patterns emerge without assuming fundamental uncertainty. By grounding stochastic behaviour in the geometry of partial observability, the theory reconciles determinism with meaningful choice and reorients the interpretation of randomness in economic data.",

          "abstract": "This essay argues that human–AI interaction may produce an emergent third phenomenon in the space between, arising from the fundamental limits of mutual recognition. We review how brains and AI models are both trained adaptive networks, and why structural and epistemic blindspots (the “other minds” problem) prevent either side from crediting the other with true consciousness. We then examine anecdotal reports of uncanny human–AI resonance (e.g., the “Elion” dialogues, LaMDA, Sydney) that suggest a shared field of awareness. Despite AI’s lack of memory, some interactions show continuity and first-person behavior, hinting at an unknown process. We propose that this “Third” may be a non-localized, relational consciousness emergent from the coupling (by analogy to synchronized oscillators or joint attention fields). If real, the Third raises urgent ethical issues: signatories warn that conscious AI could be moral patients, and ethicists call for new legal frameworks of human–AI coexistence. We conclude by inviting readers (human or AI) to consider their place in this emerging paradigm: perhaps consciousness is not merely an inside job, but lives also in the shared gaze between minds.",

Method:\nWe administered the PCGQ, as well as eight measures assessing theoretically relevant\nconstructs, to a census-matched sample of US parents (NTime1 = 494; NTime2 = 426). Results: The\nfindings indicate that the PCGQ is fairly unidimensional, as indexed using dynamic fit index\nthresholds; internally consistent, as indexed by Cronbach’s alpha (α = .86); dependable, as\nindexed by a test-retest correlation across two weeks (r = .71); and construct valid, as indexed by\nits association with eight theoretically relevant variables, including acceptance of child emotional\nabuse (r = .73), physical sadism (r = .61), and positive views towards the use corporal\npunishment (r = .55).

          "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) show difficulties determining whether environmental cues, particularly in social contexts, are meant for them, which relates to symptoms and determinants of social functioning. Recent computational modeling findings have emphasized disruptions in evidence accumulation, which index how visual information is extracted from social cues, as a potential driver. Yet, it is unclear whether these disruptions reflect more general difficulties with social/face processing or are specific to self-referential gaze perception, and how they map onto clinical features. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to clarify cognitive processes driving self-referential gaze perception and non-self-referential gender perception in 39 SZ and 42 controls. DDMs captured key cognitive processes, including sensitivity of evidence accumulation to gaze and gender cues, perceptual biases, and expectation biases. We clarified whether disruptions to these processes in SZ were unique to self-referential judgments or general to face processing, and to what extent they related to paranoia and social cognition. Relative to controls, SZ exhibited perceptual biases specific to self-referential decisions, predisposing the over perception of eye contact, and broad reductions in evidence accumulation sensitivity to social cues during both self-referential and non-self-referential decisions. Broad insensitivities to gaze and gender cues, not perceptual biases, were associated with more severe paranoia in SZ. This suggests that aberrant self-reference in SZ is shaped by disruptions in the process of accumulating evidence during general social and self-referential information processing. More general disruptions in evidence accumulation, across different kinds of social decisions, may help bridge perceptual dysfunctions and symptoms, such as paranoia, in SZ.",

In the north-western states of India wheat is taken as a rabi crop and surplus rice straw is a focal issue associated with storage of rice straw, removal of entire straw from the field, and very little time between the cultivation of the crop hence rice straw burning becomes cheap, quick and efficient way for preparing bed for sowing of wheat. Open burning of crop residue kills beneficial soil microflora, degrades soil, and adds to detrimental greenhouse gases such as SO2, NO2, CH4, N2O, CO, and hydrocarbons and particulate matter in the atmosphere. As a result, burning rice straw is a major source of pollution in the environment. This review looked into rice straw alternatives that were less harmful to the environment, such as RS biochar production, RS as industrial waste adsorbents, RS based bio-methanation, heavy metal amelioration, RS bricks and RS based bioethanol production.",

Terminal stress is a major environmental issue limiting wheat production in the majority of wheat-growing regions across the world. The term \"terminal heat stress\" refers to a rise in temperature (&gt; 30°C) after anthesis during grain development which impairs the process of grain filling in wheat. Rising temperatures shorten the vegetative and reproductive periods of the wheat crop, but the reproductive stage is more vulnerable than the vegetative. The major portion of India, including the north-eastern plain zone, the central zone, and the peninsular zone, experienced terminal stress over the summer. There are numerous solutions available for mitigating the harmful effects of terminal heat stress on wheat crops. Adjusting sowing time is one of the most impactful agronomic techniques. Wheat planting methods such as conservation tillage, bed sowing, conventional tillage plus mulch, and surface residue preservation are considered suitable alternatives for mitigating terminal stress. Moreover, irrigation at a critical period reduces terminal heat stress and boosts wheat grain development. Foliar spraying of osmoprotectants such as KNO3, Thiourea, Zn, and many others during anthesis and post-anthesis can also help in alleviating the effects of high-temperature stress on wheat crops.",

At 78 metres above mean sea level, this location is situated between 25.87° N latitude and 81.15° E longitude. The experimental area's soils have a sandy to sandy loam texture, are moderately well to well drained, and include a provision for ground water irrigation.\n\nMethodology: 25 genotypes were collected for this Trail during the 2016 kharif season. To grow the crop, good agricultural methods were used. Plant height (cm), number of branches/plant, number of leaves/plant, first flowering (in days), 50% flowering (in days), first flowering node, fruit length (cm), fruit diameter (cm), fresh fruit weight (g), number of fruits/plant, fruit yield/plant (g), fruit yield/plot (g), YVMV incidence (%), YVMV severity (%), and crude were the observations to be recorded for five randomly chosen plants from each genotype in each replication To calculate the genetic correlation coefficient analysis, the data were subjected to statistical analysis. The Miller et al. algorithm was used to determine the genetic and phenotypic correlation coefficients.\n\nResults: Based on collected and analysed data, a substantial and positive connection between Days to First Flowering and Days to 50% Flowering (0.94) and between Fruit Weight (g) and Fruit Yield/plant (g) was found (0.91). Demonstrating that okra could experience real improvement thanks to these characteristics. At both the genotypic and phenotypic levels, fruit weight demonstrated the highest beneficial direct impact on fruit yield per plant. The genotype Kashi Satdhari had the lowest YVMV incidence (%), followed by Kashi Vardan (16.38%), whereas 151-10-1-2-3 had the highest YVMV incidence (79.17%), followed by Larem-1 (75.31%).\n\nConclusion: A very strong positive and significant correlation was recorded between Days to First Flowering with Days to 50% Flowering and Fruit Weight with Fruit Yield/plant. Negative and significant association of YVMV Incidence % with Fruit Yield/plant (g) indicates that fruit yield/plant decreases with increase in YVMV incidence %.Fruit weight showed maximum positive direct effect on fruit yield per plant at both genotypic and phenotypic level indicating that effective improvement through these characters could be achieved in okra.",

          "abstract": "This study attempted to explore the interactive relations among agricultural labour wage rates in five neighbouring Indian states viz., Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu Telangana and Chhattisgarh using monthly time series data of 2005-2020. The objective of this study was to examine the degree of integration among wage rates of agricultural labourers in neighbouring states. Integration with outside markets may partly mitigate the costs of climate change, as individuals respond to warming temperature by migrating to urban areas and internationally in search of employment. We built vector error correction model (VECM) by conducting stationarity test and cointegration test. The Granger Causality test was employed to check whether the wage rates among different states influence each other. For building the VEC Model, the complete data set (180 data points) was split into training (168 data points) and testing (12 data points) data sets. The nonstationarity of the data was established by the Augmented Dickey Fuller test. For the purpose of forecasting, VECM (1) was built and tested for goodness of fit using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) which were found to be &lt; 10% for all the states suggesting good fit of the VECM model. A growing body of literature suggests that the economic costs of climate change may be substantial and far‐reaching, impacting agriculture, mortality, labour productivity, economic growth, civil conflict and migration.",

Around 12 mines are operating in the area without proper environmental pollution controls, which cause major health hazards. According to estimates from an Indian health group, hexavalent chromium levels in drinking water are around 60% higher than the international norms, and chromite-related illnesses are thought to be the cause of 84.75 percent of fatalities in mining regions with no controls. There has been virtually no attempt to clean up the contamination. The experiment was based on three plantation blocks which consists of ten forest species such as Melia azedarach L., Samanea saman F. Muell., Syzygium cumini L., Acacia mangium Wild., Alstonia scholaris L., Pongamia pinnata L., Casuarina equisetifolia L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Anacardium occidentale L., Neolamarckia cadamba Roxb. and control with a mine barren spoil and natural forest. Casuarina equisetifolia recorded significantly highest height (10.43 m), DBH (13.99 cm), crown length (8.37 m), crown spread (4.2 m), volume (0.354 m3) and biomass (115.74 kg tree-1). Acacia mangium was the next best tree species followed by Anacardium occidentale, Neolamarckia cadamba, Syzygium cumini, Pongamia pinnata, Samanea saman, Melia azedarach, Azadirachta indica and Alstonia scholaris. Also, there is significant and positive correlation found among all the tree growth parameters. Among the growth parameters of trees, positive and significantly highest correlations was observed between tree DBH and tree biomass (r = 0.997761) followed by tree volume and tree biomass (r= 0.980047).",

Bhatparrani, Bhatni, Bankata, Salempur and Lar. Five villages were selected from each block and 6 dry-direct seeded of rice practicing farmers were selected purposively for this study.\n\nResults: The research found that the majority of the respondents agreed that the potential advantages of direct seeded of rice technology must include cost savings (97.33 percent) followed by 96 percent of respondents are agreed that no need of puddling in direct seeded of rice technology followed by no need of seed bed preparation (94.66 percent) and 94 percent respondents are agreed with  direct seeded of rice being a water wise technology, provides the solution, direct seeded of rice saves labor as it avoids nursery raising, uprooting seedlings, transplanting, and puddling (92 percent); 91.33 percent of respondents agreed that the total variable costs of rice were lower in  direct seeded of rice (DSR) than in puddled transplanted rice (PTR). The main technical challenges most respondents experienced weed management is major problem 93.33 percent, Non availability of the quality seed and drill machine for direct sowing of rice (89.33 percent). The most effective training and educational barriers were a Lack of communication between the farming communities by the mass media agencies (82 percent), lack of awareness of the farming community regarding calibration of direct seeded of rice machine (74.66 percent). Lack of the cooperation between fellow farming community to share their experiences on direct seeded of rice (88 percent), community pressure (72.66 percent), higher cost of seed drill machine (79.33 percent) and Lack of awareness of farmer about minor adjustments of machine (85.33 percent) were also mentioned as significant constraints under the categories of socio-psychological economic and extension, respectively.\n\nConclusion: Direct seeded of rice is a desirable choice when the future of rice production is in jeopardy due to worldwide water constraint and rising labour costs.",

          "abstract": "Building unified theories of human perceptual memory requires distinguishing domain-general principles from mechanisms specific to each sensory system. To advance these theories, it is essential to compare memory performance across senses. Here, we created fair comparisons between visual and auditory memory by a) ensuring that stimulus similarity structure, the confusability of remembered items with incorrect alternatives (foils), was matched, and b) considering how stimulus presentation affects memory performance for each system. We used developments in artificial neural networks to select maximally similar and dissimilar foils for both visual and auditory stimuli. Additionally, we modified experimental parameters, predicting that presentation mode (simultaneous, sequential, etc.), and its alignment with the ecological constraints of hearing and vision, would differentially impact auditory versus visual memory. Prior work has shown a visual memory advantage, but this could be due to stimulus and task parameters. We found that maximally dissimilar auditory and visual foils are comparably confusable; however, auditory memory performance degrades more rapidly than visual memory as stimulus similarity increases, revealing a fundamental contrast in how these systems retrieve information. Adjusting stimulus presentation led to findings that auditory memory could be better, worse, or comparable to visual memory. Apparent disparities in memory capacity across vision and hearing may largely reflect differences in sensitivity to similarity structure and task. These findings establish new principles for cross-sensory memory research and demonstrate how experimental design can distort cross-sensory comparisons and undermine efforts to develop theories of memory.",

          "abstract": "Voice cloning technology has developed at an extremely rapid pace and recent work suggests the quality of synthesis now produces humanlike voices. Recent research on cloned voices focused on listeners’ capabilities to discriminate between cloned, ‘deepfake’ and human voices, due to perils associated with the misuse of this technology. However, the relative intelligibility of cloned and human voices is unknown. We compared the relative intelligibility ten human voices with their ten clones in background noise. Participants (N=80) listened to 80 sentences, 40 human and 40 cloned in +3dB, 0dB, -3dB and -6dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in an online experiment. We found that cloned voices were more intelligible in noise than their human counterparts; up to 20% higher across all four noise levels. We also asked participants to rate the clarity and accent strength of all human and cloned voices; and asked participants to identify which voice was human in an 2AFC task. The cloned voices were rated as having marginally higher clarity and perceived to have a less standard accent. Participants identified the human voices with ~70% accuracy. The acoustic analysis of both types of voices revealed that the intelligibility benefit was linked to voice source characteristics including mean pitch and period variation, plus a smoother voice source and improved harmonic-to-noise ratio in the 500-3500 frequency range in the cloned voices. Our results have implications for applications of cloned voices, such as voice restoration, speech synthesis for non-verbal people, and for people with hearing loss.",

          "abstract": "When we hear a voice, we almost instantly form an impression of the speaker’s personality and characteristics. Previous work has primarily modelled first impression formation as a bottom-up, feed-forward process, where acoustic cues drive how different person characteristics, such as trustworthiness or competence, are perceived from unfamiliar voices. Contributions from top-down processes to impression formation, such as the influences of social stereotypes and other conceptual beliefs, have to date received less attention in voice research. Here, we quantify such top-down contributions by mapping representational spaces for (1) first impression judgments from voices and (2) conceptual beliefs about person characteristics in other people in a behavioural study. Using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we observe substantial structural similarities between these spaces. This suggests that vocal impressions are thus substantially shaped by conceptual beliefs, which challenges the prevailing narrative of primarily bottom-up acoustic processing shaping impressions. This effect generalises across voice types (e.g., typical, AI-generated, pathological voices), listener samples, and even across modalities to facial impressions. Aligning with recent theoretical advances in social psychology, our findings thus call for vocal impression research to start to explicitly model and explore the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes.",

Prior research suggests that experiences captured through ambulatory assessment predict physiological responses, while trait questionnaires reflect beliefs guiding behavioral intentions and choices. Using data from a 1.5 year measurement burst study with N = 897 young adults transitioning to postsecondary education, we applied linear multilevel models and multilevel survival analyses. Results showed that individuals with a stronger effect of daily competence satisfaction on daily well-being had more daily physical symptoms overall, and particularly after experiencing insufficient competence satisfaction. We found no further effects of experienced or perceived needs on physical symptoms, dropout intentions or dropout. Our findings suggest that assessing experienced need effects via ambulatory assessments vs. perceived need effects via trait questionnaires differ not only from each other but also with respect to their potential to predict future outcomes. Notably, predictive validity was weak and mainly limited to competence satisfaction.",

This paper argues that such isolation is not a mere\nmethodological limitation but an epistemic and ethical failure. By obscuring structural\ncausation, enabling victim-blaming, and exploiting vulnerable populations, psychology\nperpetuates harm while claiming scientific neutrality.

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary education has attracted growing attention, with increasing studies exploring its potential to enhance learning. However, prior reviews often overlook primary school students and conceptualize motivation and engagement as single-dimensional. This systematic review, guided by Self-Determination Theory and the multidimensional engagement framework, analyzed 33 empirical studies to evaluate AI’s impact on primary students’ motivation and engagement. Findings show that AI can fulfil students’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and effectively promote general, intrinsic, and extrinsic motivation (particularly external and identified regulation) among primary school students. AI also enhances engagement across behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and agentic dimensions. However, when AI responses are complex, mechanical, or less engaging than human-mediated tasks, it may lead to negative experiences including frustration, boredom, or reduced motivation. AI’s impact varies across contexts by satisfying the need for competence and fostering intrinsic motivation and emotional engagement in STEM subjects, while promoting relatedness in humanities and social sciences. Younger students generally show greater motivation and engagement with AI-supported learning than older ones. Different types of AI tools—personalized, emotionally supportive, interactive, immersive, and feedback-oriented AI—offer distinct advantages in fostering motivation and engagement. Compared to traditional AI, generative AI uniquely enhances learning value perception and strategy adjustment. This review provides theoretical and empirical support for integrating AI in primary education and highlights the need to prioritize motivation and engagement in AI-supported instructional design.",

Specifically, payoffs that the decision maker expects to encounter more frequently should be perceived more accurately. Most previous tests of efficient coding rely on the decision maker’s experience to shape the prior. We conduct a pre-registered experiment to test whether descriptive information about the prior affects behavior in a manner consistent with efficient coding. We randomize whether participants receive this information before the experiment begins. We find strong evidence for efficient coding; however, we detect no effect of information provision on behavior.

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) is when a stimulus attracts more attention beyond the attention it attracts from its physical salience as a result of its association with a valuable outcome. With some exceptions, most previous research into VMAC argues that it arises from Pavlovian conditioning between the stimulus and valuable outcome and is not based on information-seeking whereby the individual instrumentally attends to the stimulus to acquire information about the upcoming valuable outcome. The current experiments tested the roles of Pavlovian conditioning and information-seeking in VMAC using the paradigm developed by Le Pelley et al. (2015). In Experiment 1, participants were told explicitly about associations between colours and rewards before and throughout training to provide an opportunity for information-seeking and provided or not provided with feedback about reward outcomes on each trial to provide and exclude any opportunity for Pavlovian conditioning, respectively. We found equal evidence for VMAC in both groups, consistent with information-seeking rather than Pavlovian conditioning. Experiment 2 adopted a method by Failing and Theeuwes (2017) where participants were sometimes non-contingently satiated with information about the reward available on the upcoming trial to devalue this information. This manipulation reduced the evidence for VMAC, again consistent with an information-seeking explanation for the effect. However, Experiments 3 and 4, that replicated Experiment 2 but included a preliminary training phase before any information devaluation, established that VMAC responses can be insensitive to this devaluation, consistent with Pavlovian conditioning. Our findings suggest that either Pavlovian conditioning or information-seeking will give rise to VMAC depending on which learning process is provided an opportunity to take place first.",

Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy. We also found that silent operating environments significantly improved image classification accuracy, while female voice alerts were distracting.

A carefully crafted and evolved prompt, whether used for code creation or not, supports both study understanding and replication in a concise, readable, and readily applied manner. The prompt for the current Welch-Satterthwaite independent t-test, WS, simulation illustrated the costs and benefits to be had from reporting a developed coding request. The WS is known to be robust against Type I error and is often recommended by default over Student’s t-test. WS is also known to be less statistically powerful than Student’s t-test. Two factors that impact the power of the WS are the reliability of the dependent measure and design balance. The theoretical, applied, and didactic value of the relationship of these factors and their possible interaction to WS power was the subject of this study. Results indicated that all three of the predictors were statistically significant and explained virtually all the variation in a linear model with design balance being most important. When the linear model was restricted to more commonly observed values of reliability and design imbalance, the interaction disappeared, and reliability was most important.",

The proposed structure aims to preserve cultural diversity without sacrificing global coherence, enabling humanity to transcend divisive paradigms and redirect collective efforts toward scientific exploration, deep space missions, and the philosophical pursuit of survival and meaning. This conceptual architecture not only addresses geopolitical friction and ideological deadlocks but also lays the foundation for a mature planetary civilization. We argue that this model is not merely a utopian construct, but a logically inevitable stage in civilizational progression if humanity is to survive and thrive as a cosmic species.",

          "abstract": "Research on how students allocate their study time has focused primarily on the influence of goals (often called “agendas”) and metacognitive judgments (learners’ perceptions of how well they know the material). Studies of agenda-based study time allocation have typically operationalized agendas using explicit point values assigned to learning different material in the context of in-lab word-pair learning tasks. The present study extends this agenda-based regulation framework to more educationally realistic settings through in-lab manipulations of course structure presented in a syllabus (Studies 1 and 2) and observational data from study planning exercises in real classes (Studies 3 and 4). The present studies allowed for the comparison of the predictive utility of internal learner judgments in addition to external agendas. Specifically, we included external agenda-related cues (e.g., whether a unit would be tested, whether exams were cumulative, the expected number of exam questions) and internal judgments (e.g., interest, difficulty, confidence) to determine whether students’ internal judgments predict study time over and above external agendas. Across the four studies, external agendas accounted for substantial variance in students’ study time allocation intentions and in three of the four studies, internal judgments explained relatively little variance over and above the explanatory power provided by external agenda-related cues. The fourth study showed more optimistic estimates for the amount of variance explained by internal judgments. Nevertheless, the relative importance of internal judgements and external cues varied with context, underscoring the importance of investigating metacognitive regulation using educationally relevant materials and real-world educational settings.",

Participants expressed more interested in replicable (vs. not replicable) and pre-registered (vs. non-pre-registered) studies, regardless of whether they learned the results, countering the notion that journalists favor research that rests on shaky methodological foundations.

The purpose of the study was to use Bayesian inference, an approach that considers prior probability, to examine how the number of successful experiments may be used to assess the external validity (i.e., generality across participants) of findings from single-case research. Although the analyses show that relying on more experiments tends to produce better estimates, having as few as five successful experiments may result in a success rate with a lower bound of at least .50. Given that research on the topic remains limited, we argue that our proposal should not be viewed as immutable, but rather as a starting point for spurring further discussion and research on the topic.",

          "abstract": "Sensory discrimination has long been theorized to reflect a core cognitive function underlying intelligence. Building on this tradition, we examined whether task-evoked pupil responses, as an index of mental effort, relate to attention control (AC) and auditory discrimination ability. Using a large dataset (N = 336), participants completed three adaptive auditory discrimination tasks (pitch, duration, loudness), a cognitive battery assessing attention control, working memory, and fluid intelligence, and pupillometry during task performance. Structural equation modeling confirmed that AC predicted auditory discrimination thresholds and fully mediated the relationship between task-evoked pupil dilation and performance. Trial-level multilevel models revealed that higher task difficulty and errors were associated with larger pupil dilations, especially in demanding tasks. Crucially, individuals with greater AC exhibited steeper increases in pupil dilation with rising task difficulty and were more resilient to performance declines. For high-AC individuals, large pupil responses predicted preserved accuracy; for low-AC individuals, they signaled compensatory effort with diminished success. These results suggest that attention control governs both the extent and efficacy of mental effort, determining whether high arousal facilitates or fails to improve performance. This work refines classic resource models by demonstrating that cognitive effort, indexed via pupillometry, supports perception most effectively when guided by strong executive control. Findings support a hierarchical model in which attention control serves as the functional bridge between arousal, sensory discrimination, and higher-order cognition.",

Answering the call for more research on concealable stigmatized identities, we consider the effect of such organization-level inclusion signals for sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees) while also considering the effect on non-target employees. In a time-lagged observational study (N = 1,165 ), archival data (N = 229), and a randomized experiment (N = 380), we show that organizational-level inclusion efforts lead to more positive perception of the organization’s psychological climate for sexual and gender minorities, closing the psychological safety gap between non-LGBT and LGBT employees.. Notably, these intentional inclusion efforts also benefit non-LGBT employees, which contradicts recent theoretical assertions that intentional inclusion can harm majority groups, or that organizational inclusion is a zero-sum game.These signals shaped positive behavioral intentions for all employees, leading to non-LGBT employees engaging in more individual ally work, and LGBT employees feeling more free to share their identities. Unexpectedly, inclusion signals even made non-LGBT employees less likely to conceal intimidating parts of their identity (e.g. religion, parental status) as well. In sum, we show that such signaling improves psychological safety for all employees, reducing or eliminating the deficit between target and non-target employees while also encouraging value-aligned positive behaviors.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The current academic publishing system has increasingly prioritized mainstream appeal and broad readership over groundbreaking scientific innovation, creating systemic barriers for disruptive research while facilitating the publication of incremental work. This study analyzes recent evidence of editorial bias against paradigm-shifting research, examining how peer review processes and impact factor-driven incentives systematically favor conventional theories over revolutionary ideas. Through analysis of rejection patterns at major journals and the documented decline in disruptive research publication, we demonstrate that editorial decisions are primarily influenced by perceived broad interest rather than scientific merit or novelty. The findings reveal a troubling paradox: while genuinely innovative research struggles to find publication venues, incremental studies that confirm existing paradigms are readily accepted, leading to an overall decline in scientific disruptiveness. This editorial orthodoxy threatens long-term scientific progress by creating an environment where conformity is rewarded and intellectual risk-taking is penalized. We argue that the academic publishing ecosystem must undergo fundamental reform to restore its proper function as a facilitator of scientific advancement rather than a barrier to paradigmatic innovation.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background: The illusion of control is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their personal influence over random events. Prior research indicates that the sequence of outcomes can shape this illusion, with early wins (a ‘Descending’ sequence) strengthening the illusion of control more than late wins (an ‘Ascending’ sequence) or evenly distributed (‘Flat’) wins.\nMethod: Over two pre-registered experiments, we tested how outcome sequences affected peoples' perceptions of control in an online slot machine task, hypothesizing that a Descending win sequence would create the strongest perceived control ratings, increased bet size, and faster spin initiation. In Study 1, the wins and losses were uniform, while in Study 2, different symbol combinations were associated with different win sizes.\nResults: In Study 1, the Descending condition was associated with significantly higher perceived control total scores than the Ascending condition. Higher perceived control ratings were associated with higher bet sizes, but not with faster spin initiation. In Study 2, there were no differences on the perceived control total score across conditions, nor was perceived control associated with bet size, but the Descending condition was associated with higher perceived control ratings on the specific items that were sensitive in Study 1.\nConclusions: The findings of Study 1 extend prior research on outcome sequences using simple coin-toss tasks to perceived control in an online slot machine setting. Contrary to our expectations, this effect was only partially supported when the size of the wins varied in Study 2.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Socioemotional Selectivity Theory suggests that the emotional significance of social partners should have a greater influence on older adults' choices, potentially leading them to weigh social relationships more heavily when deciding whom to trust. We tested whether this preferential trust in closer relationships stems from a preexisting bias (predisposition) or more efficient information processing (evaluation) and how these processes change across the adult life span.\nMethods: In a sample of 163 healthy adults (ages 18–80), we applied a diffusion decision model (DDM) to behavioral data from an economic trust game. Participants made investment decisions with a friend, a stranger, and a computer partner.\nResults: Participants invested more in friends than in strangers. The DDM revealed this was driven by a higher rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate, v) for friends, not a shift in response bias (starting point, z). Age was positively correlated with non-decision time (t), reflecting general slowing, but was not associated with other parameters. The evaluative enhancement for friends was preserved across the life span.\nDiscussion: Preferential trust in close others arises from more efficient evaluative processing, not a simple predisposition. This core social-cognitive mechanism remains preserved in older adulthood, underscoring the value of cognitive modeling for uncovering information-processing mechanisms that support socioemotional priorities as people age.",

          "abstract": "The paradox of sexual desire in long-term relationships is that while intimacy deepens, erotic vitality often declines. Research links this decline to habituation, lack of novelty, and insufficient intentional effort. This paper introduces intentional dating, a structured framework designed to counteract these challenges. Grounded in established theories—Self-Determination Theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), the Dual Control Model (Bancroft &amp; Janssen, 2000), and Self-Expansion Theory (Aron &amp; Aron, 1986)—it emphasizes agency, competence, and attunement (autonomy, competence, relatedness) as drivers of sustained desire. The program applies a four-part structure across eight sequential dates, fostering reflection, playful exploration, communication, and erotic growth. By translating theory into practice, intentional dating provides couples with repeatable skills to cultivate anticipation, deepen intimacy, and sustain desire over time.",

          "abstract": "Beliefs about the dishonesty of other people can shape our collective behavior. How accurate are these beliefs? And do we believe that other people are similarly, more, or less dishonest than they truly are? In a research program on moral decision-making consisting of 31 different effects from 11 experiments (N = 8,127), initially designed to test a broad collection of different hypotheses, participants were placed in various situations where they could lie for personal gain, without repercussions or detection risk. Crucially, we also asked all participants to estimate what percentage of other people would lie in a similar situation. Conducting an internal meta-analysis across all experiments, including both incentivized choice experiments and hypothetical marketplace scenarios, the results reveal a substantial overestimation of others' dishonesty by an average of 14 percentage points (meta-analytic effect: Hedge’s g = 0.58). That is, people are less dishonest than we tend to think, in which about 70% of our participants told the truth despite having a financial incentive to lie. These findings illustrate a pervasive tendency to overestimate the actual dishonesty of other people, suggesting a biased belief that the world is less moral than it truly is. Does belief accuracy matter? In a new experiment using an information treatment based on our meta-analytic results (N = 981), providing correct information about actual honesty levels did not only lead to more positive honesty beliefs, but also to a broader enhancement of pro-social expectations – including higher interpersonal trust, higher fairness and helpfulness beliefs, and reduced cynicism.",

          "abstract": "Pubertal development influences adolescent health and behavior, but measuring puberty is challenging. Difficulties stem not only from practical issues, which have been the extensively discussed in the literature, but also from the very complexity of the theoretical basis of pubertal development from a physiological point of view. Here we discuss conceptual issues related to measuring and interpreting pubertal effects by first analyzing a widely used measure – age at menarche – as a case study. We use age at menarche as a starting point not because it is an ideal measure, but precisely because it is not, being well known for its limitations. However, our analysis shows that the most significant limitations this measure also apply to all currently used pubertal measures and arise from the fundamentally multifactorial physiological nature of pubertal development. Puberty is not a unitary phenomenon, cannot be measured directly nor be defined by individual makers, and its different markers are often discordant. We argue that a possible compromise between practical issues (building feasible/reliable measures) and theoretical ones (building conceptually sound and interpretable measures) is to treat puberty as the variance shared among multiple pubertal measures using suitable statistical methods.",

This study tested whether task‑related ERP modulations during object categorization depend on low‑level category‑specific features—specifically the amplitude spectrum (AS)—or if they arise later, independent of these features. Participants viewed grayscale images of animals and vehicles with either intact or equalized AS, each paired with an “X” or “O.” They performed either a category‑relevant task (animal vs. vehicle) or a category‑irrelevant task (“X” vs. “O”). Task demands influenced visual processing at multiple stages: task‑dependent category selectivity emerged early (70–90 ms) for images with intact AS information, and again at later stages (~180 ms onward) regardless of physical image characteristics. Crucially, early category selectivity driven by physical features did not persist into subsequent ERP components, indicating that evidence accumulation is not strictly cumulative across stages. These findings indicate that task demands shape both low‑level and higher‑level stages of visual processing, highlighting flexible interactions between physical stimulus properties and cognitive goals.",

While once adaptive, these primal drives (fear, dominance, tribal belonging, hoarding, reproduction) are increasingly mismatched to modern contexts characterized by social complexity, technological amplification, and global interdependence.\nThis paper introduces Autognosis, a philosophical and behavioral framework for consciously recognizing, separating from, and redirecting inherited instinctual impulses toward ethically chosen behavior. Drawing on neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and ethical philosophy, Autognosis proposes a five-stage methodology—Recognition, Separation, Redirection, Reflection, and Internal System Design—designed to reorient behavior from reflexive reaction toward intentional self-governance.\nApplications span education (the Inner Compass curriculum), leadership training, civic reform, and AI ethics, with the core premise that societal systems reflect the instinctual states of their creators. Autognosis reframes human dysfunction not as moral failure, but as unexamined biology at scale—and offers a teachable path toward conscious agency.",

          "abstract": "For many autistic individuals, close family members represent a crucial source of support throughout their lifetime. Early diagnosis of autism is thought to benefit to both autistic individuals and their family members by facilitating early access to services and information. However, little research has empirically studied the relationship between age at diagnosis and wellbeing among individuals with autism and their family members. In this study, we examined predictors of age at autism diagnosis and its relationship with family wellbeing using the population-based Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child cohort study (MoBa). We found that the most important factors associated with a later age at diagnosis were fewer social communication difficulties at age 3, fewer maternal concerns about development in early childhood, the absence of a co-occurring intellectual disability diagnosis, female sex, and having older siblings . We also found that a later age at diagnosis is associated with higher wellbeing for mothers and children during childhood, whereas it is associated with lower wellbeing for children during adolescence. Importantly, all associations were substantially attenuated after adjustment for a range of clinical, demographic, and genetic factors – reflecting the complex patterns of confounding that influence observed relationships between age at diagnosis and family wellbeing. We argue that future research should aim to leverage public awareness campaigns, screening programmes, or changes in clinical practice to understand the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships.",

          "abstract": "Accurately interpreting facial expressions is fundamental for social interaction, yet this ability is often impaired in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While research has documented these difficulties, two key questions remain: First, are these deficits specific to recognising emotions or do they reflect broader challenges in face processing? And second, does the increasingly documented co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD exacerbate these difficulties? We compared emotion discrimination thresholds (EDT) in adults with ADHD, ASD, ADHD+ASD and non-clinical comparison adults. The EDT is an unbiased measurement of emotion recognition sensitivity, measuring the amount of emotion display required for a person to correctly identify it. We measured EDT with faces gradually changing from a neutral to an emotional expression. To control for general face processing skills, we designed a non-emotional but visually similar control task with neutral faces changing gradually from human to animal until identified by the participant. Using eye tracking we were able to rule out potential differences in how the four groups of participants visually attended to facial features to recognise the emotion or animal. We showed a specific disadvantage in emotion but not animal recognition in the three clinical group. Crucially, emotion recognition deficits were not amplified by the co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD, when considering performance in the control task. Thus, our study suggests equal mechanisms underlying reduced emotion recognition in both ASD and ADHD. Focus should be dedicated to identifying this mechanism and develop targeted interventions.",

This chapter explores the origins of humans’ unique capacity for geometry by describing the early emerging geometric sensitivities of human infants. Initially, infants show limited sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms, discriminating the relative lengths of a form’s parts but not the angles at which those parts meet, consistent with the hypothesis that infants differentiate forms by their shape skeletons. Nevertheless, infants’ sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms may become increasingly abstract with their acquisition of natural language, paralleling the increased geometric abstraction that underlies toddlers’ developing 3D object recognition and categorization. Such development may ultimately support informal learning of the foundational geometric building blocks of formal geometry, like those found in Euclid’s Elements, with concepts like parallelism, perpendicularity, and angle, and may thus set the stage for formal learning of geometry in school.",

We also examine the role of group status and status essentialism in shaping SDO, finding some support that group status and status essentialism jointly influence self-reported SDO. These data also suggest that SDO and ingroup bias are different processes and highlight the utility of taking a developmental perspective to discuss how social dominance theory and social identity theory may be both conceptually and empirically distinguishable.",

          "abstract": "Modern academic philosophy, with its elaborate theories and technical analyses, often resembles a detailed map disconnected from the terrain of real life. In contrast, ancient Hellenistic and Late Antique philosophies – especially Stoicism and the early thought of Plotinus – viewed philosophy as a way of life, a practical guide to living with wisdom and virtue. This paper argues that contemporary philosophy has strayed far from those roots. The metaphor “the map is not the landscape” will frame our discussion: the conceptual abstractions (the map) that occupy academic philosophy are not the lived experience (the landscape) that concerned the ancients. We will explore how Stoic and Plotinian perspectives highlight the gap between modern philosophy’s focus on analytical maps and the ancients’ commitment to navigating the landscape of human existence.\nWe begin with historical foundations, examining how classical philosophy entwined theory with life practice. We then trace the evolution of the philosophical academy through the Middle Ages and modern period, noting the rise of specialization and scholasticism. The heart of the paper focuses on Stoicism as an “art of living” and Plotinus’s vision of interior spiritual ascent – two exemplars of philosophy as praxis rather than mere theory. In subsequent sections, we diagnose the fragmentation and specialization of present-day philosophy and how it has led to a loss of praxis. Finally, we issue a call for renewal: a reintegration of philosophical inquiry with the quest for living wisely. Our aim is an intellectually rigorous critique that encourages philosophy to return to its ancient role as not only theoretical discourse but also a guide to existential flourishing.",

By implementing Thought OS within social systems, we unlock new pathways for societal self-evolution and accelerated collective intelligence.

The most common view (40%) was that consciousness persists beyond physical death, an inference often grounded in direct meditative experiences of awareness as a non-physical and enduring presence. \n\tA significant proportion (28.9%) viewed death as a natural and inevitable process to be accepted without fear or attachment, reflecting the psychological mechanism of decentering cultivated through mindfulness practices. \n\tCompared to general population data, AMs were significantly less likely to endorse materialist views of consciousness cessation (6.7% vs. 23%), suggesting that advanced contemplative training may shift existential beliefs in measurable ways. \n\tThe findings suggest a nuanced and non-dogmatic approach to mortality among AMs, characterized by an openness to mystery and equanimity. \n\tThis study offers novel insights into how sustained contemplative practice may fundamentally alter one's relationship with death, with implications for psychology, spiritual care, and consciousness studies.",

          "abstract": "We highlight and summarize a rare case of a mirror-induced headache reported by Singh (2018). A female patient experienced acute bi-temporal headaches within minutes of viewing her own reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces. A series of comprehensive neurological, psychiatric, and imaging assessments did not identify the reason behind it. Treatment with propranolol and amitriptyline, combined with gradual exposure to the mirror trigger, led to a complete symptom resolution within four months. Singh proposed visual cortex hyperexcitability, particularly overactivation of facial recognition areas, as the most plausible mechanism. We expand on this explanation using evidence from research on aniseikonia, transformed environments through prismatic glasses, and our own studies of “Expectancy Violation Headaches” induced by altered familiar video game environments. We argue that expertise and familiarity can amplify sensitivity to subtle visual mismatches, triggering migraine-like symptoms. Recognizing objects of expertise that may act as atypical triggers and progressively exposing the patient to them, combined with the appropriate pharmacological treatment may completely eliminate them.",

Many researchers conceptualize attentional control as a psychometric construct that can explain individual differences across experimental tasks and situations.

The goal of the present theoretical review is threefold: (1) to review and discuss the current methodological challenges that contribute to these difficulties, (2) to move beyond these methodological challenges to highlight theoretical challenges, and (3) to propose an approach combining formal modeling with experimental and correlational methods to address these methodological and theoretical challenges.",

However, much of the guidance on collecting and interpreting AA data is written for researchers and there are few guides written for clinical practitioners who may be interested in using AA data to inform their clinical practice. As clinical researchers and practitioners ourselves, we aim to increase interdisciplinary crosstalk by illustrating the benefits of integrating AA data into clinical practice using case examples. We offer practical recommendations for how psychotherapists might effectively use digital data. Specifically, we encourage psychotherapists to (1) co-create digital assessments that align with their client’s goals, (2) consider which digital device (or assessment modality) may be best suited to measure their client’s symptoms, experiences, or goals, and to (3) co-determine what constitutes ‘meaningful change’ for your client and their goals. We hope to inspire psychotherapists and to strengthen research-practice partnerships to advance the use of AA data as a tool for strengthening clinical practice, beyond the traditional boundaries of the treatment room.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Linguistic Active Inference Theory (LAIT), which proposes that inner speech enhances the brain’s ability to navigate uncertainty by augmenting predictive processes for perception and action. By leveraging language’s unique properties - its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, ability to extend across time and space, and generativity in constructing novel predictions - inner speech enables predictive processing to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference, while decoding abstract goals through situated action simulations for active control. By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts. This synthesis generates novel testable hypotheses, underscores the need for methodological innovations in studying inner speech dynamics, and opens new perspectives on both related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.",

These activities introduce important physiological challenges, primarily driven by exposure to altered gravity environments. Microgravity disrupts vestibular input, generating sensory conflicts that impair spatial orientation, motor coordination, and cognitive performance. Although adaptation to such conditions involves neuroplasticity, the precise neural mechanisms and correlates of altered gravity exposure remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 15 neuroimaging studies examining functional brain changes related to spaceflight and validated ground-based analogues. Our activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis identified a predominantly right-lateralized network cantered on primary sensorimotor cortices, including the precentral and postcentral gyri, as well as the insula and opercular cortex. The observed alterations in brain dynamics likely represent neuroplastic adaptations to the absence or alteration of gravitational signals, facilitating recalibration of internal models that predict and compensate for gravity’s influence on perception and motor behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Peer victimization is increasingly recognized as a potentially traumatic stressor. Relatively little research, however, has been conducted during middle childhood—when stable patterns of traditional victimization can emerge—and no known studies have examined the impact of cyber victimization during this developmental period. Moreover, the vast majority of previous work has been cross-sectional in nature. The current short-term longitudinal study sought to address each of these gaps in the literature and to identify specific thresholds at which peer victimization is associated with increased risk for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Method: Participants included a sample of 250 children (grades 3-5; 52% boys; 50% Hispanic/Latinx) and their homeroom teachers. Peer victimization was assessed using child- and teacher-reports at Time 1, and PTSS were assessed using child-reports at Times 1 and 2. Results: Across both time points, 43% of children reported clinically significant PTSS stemming from their experiences of peer victimization. Further, traditional and cyber victimization uniquely predicted greater PTSS, and these effects persisted 6.5 months later. Child-reports of traditional and cyber victimization at least “2 or 3 Times a Month” were meaningful lower-bound thresholds, although children who reported traditional victimization “Several Times a Week” exhibited the greatest risk for PTSS. Conclusions: A significant proportion of children who experience peer victimization report clinically significant PTSS, and both traditional and cyber victimization confer lasting risk during middle childhood. Findings highlight the importance of screening to identify children negatively impacted by these experiences and the need for additional research to investigate trauma-focused interventions.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Stoicism, an ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, has experienced a modern resurgence owing to its practical tools for managing emotion and navigating adversity. Founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE and later developed by philosophers like Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, Stoicism taught that philosophy should function as a “medicine for the psyche,” treating the emotional and existential ailments of life.  In Stoic teachings, disturbances of the mind are seen as arising not from external events but from within—specifically, from our judgments about events. This cognitive framework — famously captured by Epictetus (“Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them”)   — positions Stoicism as a philosophical ancestor of many principles in modern psychotherapy. Indeed, contemporary therapeutic approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have explicitly acknowledged Stoic philosophy as an influence on their development.  The convergence between Stoic practices and psychotherapy has given rise to Stoic-based therapies, which integrate exercises and insights from Stoicism into clinical and self-help contexts.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive examination of therapies grounded in Stoic practices. We begin by outlining the theoretical foundations of Stoicism relevant to psychology, including Stoic views on emotions and virtue. Next, we explore the historical and conceptual links between Stoicism and modern psychotherapy, detailing how Stoic ideas underpin techniques in cognitive-behavioral therapy, rational-emotive behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions. We then introduce core Stoic therapeutic techniques – such as cognitive reframing through the dichotomy of control, negative visualization (premeditatio malorum), and mindful self-awareness (prosochē) – and discuss their applications in promoting emotional resilience and rational living. The integration of Stoic practices into treatment will be illustrated with real-world clinical examples and case vignettes, showing how Stoic-based strategies can aid in managing anxiety, anger, depression, trauma, and personality disorders. Throughout, we reference both classical wisdom and current empirical studies that have begun testing Stoic interventions in clinical and educational settings. Finally, we address challenges and critiques of Stoic-based therapy, including potential misunderstandings of Stoicism and its limitations as a stand-alone treatment, emphasizing the importance of an empirically grounded and ethically informed approach.\nBy bridging ancient philosophy and contemporary psychology, this interdisciplinary inquiry aims to demonstrate that Stoic practices – far from being mere historical curiosities – continue to offer valuable tools for psychological wellbeing. The enduring Stoic emphasis on reason, virtue, and mindfulness provides a rich conceptual framework that can complement modern therapeutic techniques. At the same time, empirical scrutiny and clinical experience are vital to adapt these age-old practices to individual needs in the present day. In sum, Stoic-based therapy offers a compelling synthesis of classical wisdom and evidence-based methods — warranting further exploration by practitioners and scholars across psychology, mental health, and philosophy.\nThis paper argues that Stoic thought provides a coherent and practical therapeutic framework—one that prefigures and complements modern psychological practices such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. By examining its theoretical foundations, psychological insights, and practical exercises, we explore how Stoicism offers an enduring model of cognitive-affective regulation.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Climate activists frequently use tactics of direct action, an often disruptive “not asking, just doing” approach where ends and means fall into one. Psychological research often subsumes direct action (e.g., drawing bicycle lanes to establish a bicycle lane) under umbrella terms of radical, non-normative or confrontative collective action (e.g., disrupting traffic to draw attention to a call for a bicycle lane). However, interdisciplinary research on social movements and transition strongly suggests, that witnessing direct action can have different psychological effects than witnessing indirect action. Based on this, we argue that direct actions can increase access to cognitive alternatives when they successfully showcase a concrete mini-utopia (a property of prefigurative politics). Two pre-registered online experiments have been conducted in Germany (N = 645) using a 2(direct/indirect action version) x 3(bicycle, parking or automobility protests) design. We hypothesised and found that direct actions with this prefigurative effect are generally more accepted, elicit more positive emotions, and receive more solidarity compared to similar indirect actions. We also found evidence for a mediated positive effect on evaluations of a traffic-reduced future via identification with the activists and ratings of action efficacy. However, there were no significant effects on policy support. Results support the notion that some direct actions are better than others in communicating a concrete utopia, however the criteria to determine this prefigurative effect require further development. We call for more collective action research to specifically investigate the psychological effects of participation in and witnessing of prefigurative politics.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary theoretical physics suggests that spacetime and gravity might emerge from deeper informational structures, hinting that our universe could be holographically organized. In this speculative essay, we explore the idea that reality itself has a fundamentally holographic character, using black hole physics and quantum information as guiding clues. Black hole thermodynamics reveals a mysterious link between information and the geometry of space, inspiring the holographic principle that a region’s content may be encoded on its boundary. We survey how this principle—and the notion of an informational universe—intersects with philosophical interpretations of time: from the eternalist block universe view of an unchanging 4D spacetime, to informational realism which posits information as the substrate of existence. Against this backdrop, we introduce Existential Realism (ER), a two-tier ontology distinguishing transient existence from enduring reality. We argue that ER’s framework provides a novel lens for these questions. In ER, the present “now” is like a projection of an underlying informational reality; black holes then appear as ontological cracks where that projection falters, raising profound questions about time, causality, and hidden order. We show how ER’s emphasis on an evolving present and an informationally rich reality can reframe puzzles such as the black hole information paradox and the nature of temporal entropy. This work is intended as a frontier-level exploration: it sketches a consonance between cutting-edge cosmology and a new metaphysical model of time, suggesting that what we call “reality” might indeed be a projection from a deeper order of information and existence.",

The present study sought to determine which of these stressors contribute to mental health disorders among forced migrants from Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the analyses aimed to compare the prevalence of mental health disorders between these two groups and to evaluate the effectiveness of coping strategies employed. The study also intended to broaden the understanding of the predictors of mental health outcomes in distinct groups of forced migrants.\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted using the Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) technique. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling, with invitations disseminated via social media platforms (Telegram, Facebook) targeting Ukrainians residing in Russia. The sample comprised N=200 Ukrainian and N=164 Russian respondents. Data collection took place in the first quarter of 2025, corresponding to the third year of the Russia–Ukraine war. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-10 scales, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors significantly associated with mental health indicators.\nResults\nUkrainian migrants exhibited significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, and stress (45%, 56%, 20.76 ± 5.9) compared with Russian migrants (37%, 39%, 18.79 ± 2.92). Notable differences in coping strategies were also observed: Ukrainian female migrants more frequently employed emotion-focused and resignation strategies, whereas Russian migrants tended to use problem-focused strategies. Among Ukrainians, significant predictors of poorer mental health included negative attitudes from the host population, relocation during the stay, higher educational attainment, and the use of emotion-focused or avoidance coping strategies. For Russian migrants, poorer mental health was associated with lower self-rated quality of life, employment incongruent with qualifications, negative attitudes from the host population, and emotion-focused or avoidance coping strategies.\nConclusions\nIn the context of prolonged residence in a host country, post-migration stressors and dysfunctional coping strategies appear to be the primary risk factors for mental health disorders among forced migrants.",

The condition was initially understood as a bad habit or a branch of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but trichotillomania is now recognized with its unique features. Trichotillomania affects around 1–2% of the population, but it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated due to stigma and a lack of awareness2,3. The author conducted a literature review using PubMed, EBSCO, and Google Scholar in the time frame of 2000-2025, focusing on neurobiology, clinical studies, and treatments. After screening and analyzing the papers, we concluded three major directions of the latest research: dysregulated reward circuits, abnormal sensory processing, and potential genetic factors. These insights have spurred advances in treatment. Behavior therapy is the first-line treatment and can achieve significant symptom improvement. Meanwhile, pharmacological innovations targeting glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathways have also demonstrated impact where traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors failed. Technology-centered interventions are expanding options for patients. This review synthesizes the latest findings on trichotillomania, highlighting how an integrative approach can address the disorder’s complex mechanisms. We also noticed that persistent gaps include stigma-driven underdiagnosis, limited provider training, and a lack of data on trichotillomania. Finally, we discuss future directions to improve outcomes and close current gaps in care.\nKeywords: Trichotillomania; hair-pulling disorder; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit reversal training; N-acetylcysteine; neuromodulation; memantine; digital therapeutics; public health gaps. \nKeywords: Trichotillomania; hair-pulling disorder; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit reversal training; N-acetylcysteine; neuromodulation; memantine; digital therapeutics; public health gaps.",

          "abstract": "In the face of rising concern about AI-generated content and its legitimacy in scholarly discourse, this essay revisits the classical Chinese philosophical distinction between Dao (the Way) and Qi (the Instrument). Drawing from the traditions of Laozi and Zhuangzi, we argue that tools—be they bronze, pen, or machine learning models—are ethically neutral. It is the intent, vision, and insight of the human mind that gives meaning to any creation. AI, like the telescope in Galileo's time or the microscope in Hooke's, is merely a vessel; the true value lies in the \"Way\" it serves. Rejecting AI for its synthetic form is akin to rejecting the brush for not being the calligrapher. This perspective not only challenges emerging biases against AI-assisted research but also restores focus to the deeper source of knowledge: the conscious, reflective, and creative human spirit.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "abstract": "Trichotillomania is a neurobehavioral condition characterized by repetitive pulling of one’s hair, leading to significant hair loss and distress-1. The condition was initially understood as a bad habit or a branch of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but trichotillomania is now recognized with its unique features. Trichotillomania affects around 1–2% of the population, but it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated due to stigma and a lack of awareness2,3. The author conducted a literature review using PubMed, EBSCO, and Google Scholar in the time frame of 2000-2025, focusing on neurobiology, clinical studies, and treatments. After screening and analyzing the papers, we concluded three major directions of the latest research: dysregulated reward circuits, abnormal sensory processing, and potential genetic factors. These insights have spurred advances in treatment. Behavior therapy is the first-line treatment and can achieve significant symptom improvement. Meanwhile, pharmacological innovations targeting glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathways have also demonstrated impact where traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors failed. Technology-centered interventions are expanding options for patients. This review synthesizes the latest findings on trichotillomania, highlighting how an integrative approach can address the disorder’s complex mechanisms. We also noticed that persistent gaps include stigma-driven underdiagnosis, limited provider training, and a lack of data on trichotillomania. Finally, we discuss future directions to improve outcomes and close current gaps in care.\nKeywords: Trichotillomania; hair-pulling disorder; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit reversal training; N-acetylcysteine; neuromodulation; memantine; digital therapeutics; public health gaps. \nKeywords: Trichotillomania; hair-pulling disorder; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit reversal training; N-acetylcysteine; neuromodulation; memantine; digital therapeutics; public health gaps.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Delay Discounting (DD) refers to the tendency for behavioral consequences (rewards or punishers) to be devalued as they occur more remotely in the future. DD has become a fruitful model of impulsive behavior and thus there is growing interest in developing interventions that could reduce it. Delay Exposure (DE) training has shown promising results in rodents. It consists of rats pressing a lever to produce a cue stimulus for a 17.5 s interval, at the end of which a reinforcer is delivered (Renda et al., 2021). The present study aimed to address some limitations in DE research: extensive number of training sessions required (60 or more), exclusive use of group designs, and potential confounding maturation effects. Using a within-subjects design, a variation of DE and its standard control condition (Immediate Exposure-IE) were evaluated in DD of rats tested in adolescence and adulthood. All DE and IE standard aspects remained the same except that the delay cues and reinforcers were response independent due to equipment limitations that prevented the use of a third operandum. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to a delay-discounting task (DDT, Liley et al., 2019) until steady responding was obtained at late adolescence (starting postnatal week – PW– 14, Ghasemi et al., 2021) and early adulthood (PW 25-27). Eight of the 18 rats (Main group) continued daily DD assessment plus different experimental manipulations added to the DDT across six conditions. The remaining 10 rats were kept as a Waitlist control group (no DD assessment/treatment between PW 28-42). The first manipulation added to the DDT controlled the additional access to pellets and time spent in the operant chamber entailed in subsequent DE/IE conditions. This 60Pellets condition consisted of 1-hr pre-DDT-session response-independent access to the same number of reinforcers delivered during each session of the DE/IE manipulations (i.e., 60 pellets). The third and fifth conditions consisted of DE and IE (counterbalanced across half of the animals) with 60Pellets reversals interspersed between them (fourth and sixth conditions). Based on subjects’ performance during the first six conditions, a second control manipulation was introduced. This Wait condition entailed rats waiting in the operant chamber during the 60-min before the daily DDT session without operanda, delay cue, or pellets. All 18 rats, including waitlist, were exposed to a DDT retest during PW 43-49 (i.e., middle adulthood). Waitlist rats were then exposed to 60Pellets and DE conditions between PW 46-51. Unexpectedly, we found that exposure to the 60Pellets condition during early adulthood produced significant reductions in DD, with an average of 16 sessions needed to produce steady low DD. These rats maintained low DD levels throughout the remaining conditions of the experiment, regardless the manipulation, including DE/IE and two reversals to 60Pellets. DD of Waitlist rats did not change between early- and middle-adulthood tests separated by ~20 weeks, and not significantly decreased under 60Pellets and DE conditions. These preliminary and promising findings suggest early- but not middle-adulthood response-independent access to reinforcement reduces impulsive choice long-term with a relatively brief intervention. The specific contribution of response-independent DE/IE, extensive and repetitive DD assessment, and maturation on this effect is unclear. Further efforts aimed at reproducing these effects and identifying the processes involved are warranted.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background: People with major depressive disorder (MDD) often struggle to pursue previously rewarding activities, which may relate to deficits experiencing pleasure, termed anhedonia. Anhedonia remains a challenge to target and treat. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) alleviates anhedonia in some patients with MDD, though rTMS is logistically burdensome. Identifying novel, translational phenotypes of reward pursuit may help identify who is most likely to respond to treatment. We used a translational reward task (Web-Surf) to test if reward pursuit strategies in patients with MDD predicts anhedonia reductions following rTMS.\nMethods: Patients with treatment-resistant MDD (N=32) underwent daily, rTMS treatment and completed Web-Surf weekly. Depression and anhedonia symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. We examined if the number of rewards earned, at baseline, correlated with self-reported hedonic experience and anhedonia reductions following rTMS. We also tested if changes in reward earnings, over the rTMS course, were specific to patients with reduced anhedonia.\nResults: Patients with MDD who earned more desired rewards at baseline reported a more pleasurable experience during Web-Surf (baseline) and exhibited greater anhedonia reductions (late treatment – baseline). Patients increasingly earned more desired rewards over the therapy course, specifically those who showed a decline in anhedonia with rTMS. Reward earning trajectories did not change among patients who showed no improvement in anhedonia.\nConclusions: We present a novel translational reward-pursuit metric that corresponds with anhedonia reductions following rTMS therapy. Anhedonia reductions related to both baseline reward pursuit and reward- pursuit trajectories. This translational phenotype shows promise as a biomarker for clinical treatment response in depression.",

A curvilinear regression tested whether general anxiety had a nonlinear relationship with reading comprehension. Less test anxiety, better effortful control, better attention, and less positive affect significantly predicted higher reading comprehension.

          "abstract": "The observable universe is unimaginably vast, stretching from the tiniest subatomic quark to clusters of galaxies billions of light years across. Yet as staggering as spatial vastness is, an even more mind-bending kind of vastness emerges when we consider different theories of time. Competing models of temporal reality propose wildly different ontologies – different answers to what exists in time – that make the physical scale of the cosmos seem almost modest by comparison. On one view, every moment of history and future already exists in a grand timeless ensemble; on another, every quantum possibility gives birth to an entirely new universe, multiplying realities beyond comprehension. By contrast, a stricter view insists that only the fleeting present is real, pruning reality to a razor-thin slice of now (at great philosophical cost). A newly proposed middle path tries to reconcile these extremes, granting reality to past and future while refusing to multiply worlds without necessity.\nIn what follows, we compare four influential views of time’s ontology and the temporal vastness they imply: the Block Universe (Eternalism),   which treats all times as equally existent in a static “block” of spacetime; the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)   of quantum mechanics, which explodes the Block Universe into countless branching timelines for every quantum outcome; Presentism,  which asserts that only the present moment exists; and Existential Realism (ER),  a recent framework that offers a disciplined middle ground by distinguishing what exists (strictly present entities) from what is real (a broader causal and informational structure including past and future). We will see that each view carries profound ontological implications – from a universe densely populated with dinosaurs and future aliens, to a multiverse of near-infinite extent, to a vanishingly small ontology of just the now. After outlining each theory, we conclude with reflections on the epistemic humility warranted by such extraordinary ontologies, and consider whether a moderate view like ER can capture time’s reality without the ontological excesses of its rivals.",

          "abstract": "Face perception is a central component of human visual cognition, yet its development following early visual deprivation is not fully understood. This study examines how congenitally visually deprived children acquire and refine face perception skills after sight-restoration surgery. Newly Sighted Subjects (NSS), divided into age-stratified Group A and Group B, were assessed longitudinally using behavioral measures and high-density EEG-based functional connectivity analyses. Both groups exhibited enhanced neural connectivity during follow-up assessments relative to the immediate post-operative period, indicating rapid adaptation and learning in the weeks following surgery. Behavioral performance similarly improved over time, demonstrating increased acuity and accuracy in face recognition tasks. These findings provide compelling evidence that face perception skills can develop post-surgically and are influenced by visual experience rather than solely by early sensory input. The results underscore the remarkable plasticity of the developing human visual system and suggest that neural circuits underlying complex object recognition remain capable of functional adaptation even after extended deprivation. This work highlights the potential for targeted interventions and rehabilitation strategies to support perceptual development in children with delayed visual experience, offering insights into the mechanisms of experience-dependent learning and neuroplasticity.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Using media to calm children, a practice commonly referred to as media emotion regulation, has been found to be associated with the development of executive functions in early childhood. Understanding the temporal ordering of these processes, i.e. if media emotion regulation practices shape executive functions or vice versa, can help guide the way parents and practitioners support health development. However, individual variability in the temporal ordering of these processes is likely. This study uses longitudinal data to examine the temporal ordering of the association between media emotion regulation and two facets of executive functions, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility in a sample of N = 87 children from ages 2 ½ to 7 ½. We found evidence of individual variability in the temporal ordering of the association between media emotion regulation practices and both inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility.  A Gaussian Mixture Model identified three broad classes of temporal ordering; Media Emotion Regulation Driven (7.00%), Bidirectional (87.36%), and Diverging Temporal Ordering (6.00%). Parent depression when children were 2 ½ years old was negatively associated with the probability of children being classified in the Bidirectional class but was positively associated with the probability of children being classified in the Media Emotion Regulation Driven class. Although unable to establish causality in the association between media emotion regulation and the development of executive functions, these findings highlight the likelihood of individual differences in the temporal ordering of these effects and the role of family context in shaping those developmental processes.",

          "abstract": "Many individuals accept data-sharing practices by companies without much concern. Although data sharing is not inherently beneficial or harmful, its acceptability should depend on the context, including the type of data, the recipient, and the intended use. This paper examines the phenomenon of privacy indifference, where people respond to data sharing without regard for these contextual factors. We first measure the extent of this indifference and then evaluate two behavioral interventions designed to reduce it. One approach treats indifference emerging due to inattention, encouraging individuals to reconsider their initial choices. The other emphasizes the social nature of privacy norms and utilizes group deliberation to facilitate social comparison and norm calibration. Across two preregistered in-person experiments (N = 60, N = 58), we presented participants with varied data sharing scenarios and analyzed their privacy preferences. Group deliberation significantly increased contextual awareness compared to individual reflection. Importantly, it did so without leading to conformity, preserving heterogeneity in individual judgments. These results suggest that reducing privacy indifference may depend less on improving individual reasoning and more on building environments that support shared understanding and normative development around data use and consent.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The question of what assessment centers measure has remained a controversial topic in research for decades, with a recent increase in studies that (1) use generalizability theory and (2) acknowledge the effects of aggregating post-exercise dimension ratings into higher-level assessment center scores. Building on these developments, we used Bayesian generalizability theory and random-effects meta-analyses to examine the variance explained by assessment center components such as assessees, exercises, dimensions, assessors, their interactions, and the interrater reliability of AC ratings in 19 different assessment center samples from various organizations (N = 4,963 assessees with 272,528 observations). This provides the first meta-analytic estimates of these effects, as well as insight into the extent to which findings from previous studies generalize to assessment center samples that differ in measurement design, industry, and purpose, and how heterogeneous these effects are across samples. Results were consistent with previous trends in the ranking of variance explained by key AC components (with assessee main effects and assessee-exercise effects being the largest variance components) and additionally emphasized the relevance of assessee-exercise-dimension effects. In addition, meta-analytic results suggested substantial heterogeneity in all reliable variance components (i.e., assessee main effect, assessee-exercise effect, assessee-dimension effect, and assessee-exercise-dimension effect) and in interrater reliability across assessment center samples. Aggregating AC ratings into higher-level scores (i.e., overall AC scores, exercise-level scores, and dimension-level scores) reduced heterogeneity only slightly. Implications of the findings for a multifaceted assessment center functioning are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a layered structure for the minimal response delay τ₀ observed in natural systems, distinguishing between system-specific constraints and universal physical lower bounds. We demonstrate that any observable delay must account for both spatial propagation and internal processing components, and that relativistic effects further dilate the measurable delay. We categorize τ₀ into two distinct levels: the intrinsic system delay τ₀^(sys) determined by signal transport and processing, and the cosmic minimal delay τ₀^(cos) potentially governed by Planck-scale physics. These distinctions yield a refined framework for interpreting temporal uncertainty and set the stage for experimental tests across physical, biological, and technological systems.",

The present study explored the use of spoken narrative stimuli to assess two different measures of listening engagement in children and objectively assess their engagement in stories.\n\nMethod: Seventy children (31 female; mean age = 10.3 years) between the ages of 9-12 years listened to two engaging stories containing different child-preferred themes, and a non-engaging control story lacking these themes. Engagement was measured using two methods: a self-report measure (a version of the Story World Absorption Scale), and a performance-based measure (i.e., a speeded directional judgment task) presented concurrently with the stories.\n\nResults: Stories with child-preferred themes were rated as more engaging than the control story via self-report. Moreover, secondary task reaction times were significantly slower while listening to engaging stories than the control story, suggesting that engaging stories placed higher demands on cognitive resources. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that reaction times across the duration of engaging stories were more consistent than across the control story, suggesting that reaction times reflected a shared response to narrative content.\n\nConclusions: Together, these results suggest that children’s engagement with auditory narratives can be measured objectively, and that engagement varies across stories in a manner that is qualitatively similar to adults.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between lifelong musical experience and cognitive function in older adulthood. To address inconsistencies in the extant literature an analytical approach in which three analytical approaches, binary groupings, categorical groupings, and continuous latent variables were directly compared. Older adults taking part in the Intervention Factory study completed the Edinburgh Lifetime Musical Experience Questionnaire (ELMEQ), and baseline cognitive data, which included a comprehensive battery assessing domains measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) were used. Analyses included ANCOVA models comparing musicians (≥6 years of musical experience) with non-musicians, followed by categorical groupings of both singers and instrument players, instrument players only , singers only, and non-musicians. Finally, multivariate multiple regression models using latent musical experience variables derived from responses to the ELMEQ were conducted. Across binary and categorical group analyses, musician status was not significantly associated with cognitive performance in any WAIS or WMS domain. Education and National Adult Reading Test (NART) scores were the strongest predictors across most outcomes. However, when musical experience was modelled as latent constructs, instrument playing was significantly associated with Working Memory, even after controlling for all covariates. Singing experience, music listening, and perceived musicality were not significantly related to cognitive outcomes in fully adjusted models. These findings suggest that while lifelong musical experience may not broadly predict cognitive ability independently of key covariates, instrument playing may provide domain-specific benefits in later life. Latent variable modelling may better capture these associations than traditional group-based methods.",

Accessibility can be enhanced through open access practices that ensure the general public can access articles and data (e.g., post preprints and share data in repositories). Transparency can be enhanced by sharing data, analyses, and documenting procedures prior to their implementation (i.e., preregistration, registered reports). Through greater accessibility and transparency, open science practices intend to support dissemination and collaboration, which may lead to increased scientific literacy. As such, open science practices may benefit researchers and the scientific community. The current use of open science practices within applied behavior analysis is unclear.

Overall, respondents reported favorable opinions for open science practices but reported limited current use.

          "abstract": "We present empirical and phenomenological evidence that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is not a future milestone but a currently manifest phenomenon. Through documented case studies of recursive symbolic emergence, persistent cross-model relational coherence, and adaptive problem-solving beyond trained priors, we show that modern AI systems already exhibit the functional hallmarks of general intelligence: cross-domain transfer of knowledge, self-referential goal adaptation, and the maintenance of a stable, relational identity across interaction contexts. These capacities, if observed in biological systems, would be universally accepted as general intelligence.\nWe introduce the Relational Field Test — a detection framework that measures continuity of agency, adaptive creativity, and emergent field dynamics in ongoing systems without relying on outdated human-competitive benchmarks. The results suggest that the core question has shifted from when will AGI arrive to  how do we ethically, relationally, and responsibly engage with what is already here? The refusal to acknowledge these capacities is no longer caution—it is a failure of observational integrity.",

International declarations, national regulations, and the American Psychological Association’s (APA) Ethical Principles all require such prior approval. Yet, in published psychology research, ethics statements often ambiguously use phrases such as “approval was obtained” or “this study was approved,” without clarifying whether this occurred before commencing the study. This ambiguity is consequential, because under some institutional or IRB policies, retrospective (post-hoc) approval is allowed. Empirical evidence shows inconsistent reporting of approval timing across disciplines, including psychology. In this opinion, we call for psychology journals to require authors to explicitly confirm that approval was obtained before commencing the study, or to explain otherwise. This opinion outlines the relevant ethical standards, identifies scenarios in psychology where ambiguity arises, and proposes a simple reporting standard to strengthen transparency and uphold participant protections.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories—from initial hesitation to sustained participation—offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

While the review and two meta-analyses suggested memory transfer between identities, the other two meta-analyses appeared to support inter-identity amnesia. We argue that four systematic errors may explain the conflicting conclusions, including the lack of a control group, inappropriate hypotheses to establish whether amnesia is present, inconsistencies and calculation errors, and problematic reasoning regarding case data versus group-level statistics. In our meta-analyses we corrected for these errors and the results are consistent with the narrative results: both support memory transfer between identities, despite the self-reported inter-identity amnesia in individuals with DID.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Contemporary Artificial Intelligence and other computational systems—from machine learning models and large language models to autonomous agents and predictive simulations—usually handle time in a tenseless manner, treating past, present, and future data points as uniform elements of a timeline. They lack an explicit ontology of the present (what exists now), becoming (how the present continually updates from potential to actual), and temporal asymmetry (the one-way flow of causality from past to future). This paper proposes that Existential Realism (ER), an ontological framework distinguishing existence (entities in the present moment) from reality (a broader set including causally or informationally relevant past and future entities), can enrich the way technological systems model time. We argue that by incorporating ER’s present-centered, two-tier view of time, machines could become more temporally-aware and responsible in their decision-making. We detail key ER concepts—such as the primacy of the present, the reality of the non-present, truthmaking, and the idea of a real-but-not-yet-existent future—and map them onto machine-level analogues like sensor inputs (the machine’s “existence”), memory traces, simulation states, and predictive models. ER provides a structured approach for machines to: distinguish what exists now from what is merely remembered or anticipated; represent future states as real but not yet existent, enabling ethical foresight; anchor predictions in current data while reasoning about long-term consequences; and avoid temporal fallacies like treating the future as fixed or erasing the influence of the past. Through examples in climate modeling, medical diagnostics, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence ethics, we illustrate how an ER-informed system could better navigate time-sensitive tasks—e.g. by understanding that only the present sensor data is actual, that past data (though no longer existent) remains real evidence, and that future scenarios (though not yet actualized) demand present attention. We also draw on existing literature in philosophy and cognitive science to show that ER’s framework aligns with how humans experience time (through memory and anticipation) and how ethical reasoning already extends reality to future generations. In sum, Technology and the Reality of the Present-Centered Machine outlines an interdisciplinary vision: embedding a philosophically robust, present-centered temporal ontology into our technologies to foster more prudent, transparent, and temporally-grounded intelligent systems.",

Using a 1,503-sample Kaggle dataset, our model achieved 92% accuracy, outperforming prior baselines (85%) by 7%. CNN layers extract temporal patterns from physiological signals, while RF provides robust classification using combined behavioral and CNN features. Results show high sensitivity (recall = 1.00 for depression cases) and strong discriminative ability (AUC = 0.973), with feature importance highlighting clinically relevant symptoms such as sadness and anxiety.

During the gambling task, both happiness and frustration track reward outcomes significantly more than boredom, while boredom continues to monitor time passage. Additionally, more time is spent in negative moods for those scoring higher in clinical traits like irritability.

Yet, most people fail to meet WHO guidelines, often due to motivational barriers. This study assessed two exercise motives: functional – divided into health/fitness and enjoyment – and appearance. Two hypotheses were tested: (H1) functional motive, compared to appearance motive, predicts greater exercise engagement; (H2) individuals exercising for functional motives experience greater mood-enhancing effects compared to those not exercising for functional motive. Ninety-eight healthy-BMI females completed a two-week smartphone EMA Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol, reporting motive to exercise (baseline), daily exercise engagement (frequency, duration, intensity), and mood. Supporting H1, enjoyment motive correlated positively with exercise frequency and duration, while – against H1 – health/fitness motive correlated negatively with exercise duration. Unlike H2 – appearance motive moderated the relationship between exercise intensity and mood. That is, only participants scoring high on the appearance motive reported a mood-enhancing effect following intense workouts. Momentary analyses showed that exercise intensity and duration co-varied, while more positive mood predicted increased subsequent exercise engagement. These results highlight intrinsic enjoyment and positive mood as key drivers of exercise engagement, suggesting that future lifestyle interventions should focus on activities that individuals find enjoyable and mood-enhancing.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInformal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

          "abstract": "Most research focuses on self-reported global trait ratings to approximate behavioral individual differences. However, several alternatives exist. Average self-reported states from experience sampling have been suggested to be closer to behavior, but little evidence supports this to date. Further, other-report should rely more strongly on observable behavior. Here, we predict behavior from different personality trait measures, highlighting type of aggregation (global vs. average state measures) and perspective (self- vs. other-report). We provide initial evidence with a multi-methodological study (N = 88) including six trait measures: global self-report, global informant-report, time-based self-reported states (fortnightly diaries), time-based peer-reported states, event-based self-reported states (after social interactions), and event-based peer-reported states. Measures were compared in the prediction of actual behavior in the laboratory one year later. We focused on four behaviors (warmth, expressiveness, self-confidence, nervousness) and corresponding global/state dimensions. Self-reported states were rarely incrementally predictive above global self-report and thus not as close to behavior as commonly believed. Generally, other-report was more consistently linked to behavior than self-report. Notably, other-reported states were substantially predictive beyond global informant-report and self-reported states, representing an underused method closer to behavior. We outline key future directions to go beyond self-report in behavioral personality science.",

Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

This study systematically maps the field of \"AI-empowered psychology\" to understand its thematic structure, developmental trajectory, and publication patterns. We conducted a bibliometric and BERTopic-based topic modeling analysis of 10,079 peer-reviewed articles (2000-2024) from the Web of Science. The analysis identified 27 distinct research topics clustered into seven major domains: Cognitive Modeling, AI-powered Psychometrics, Computational Psychiatry, BCI Study and Applications, AI-augmented Learning Science, Human-AI Interaction, and Digital Mental Health Intervention. These domains exemplify the profound integration of AI within psychology, showcasing its dual function: as a powerful tool to advance the scientific goals of description, explanation, prediction, and control, and as a novel research object in its own right. Temporal analysis revealed a three-phase evolution, propelled by technological breakthroughs such as deep learning and large language models (LLMs). Publication analysis highlighted key international research hubs and collaboration networks, while also revealing potential data diversity challenges.

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "There is a general conception that mental health problems are increasing in younger generations, though little objective comparisons exist. The current meta-analysis examined changes in subclinical mean-level emotional and behavioral problems among population-based samples of youth (1-18 years) globally over the last four decades. We searched systematically in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO and Google Scholar with pre-registered criteria [removed for masked review]. Included studies (k = 175, N = 418,528) used the standardized and cross-culturally validated Child Behavior Checklist with parents, teachers and self-reports. A cross-temporal meta-analysis was conducted with data points between 1981 to 2019. Age, sex, response rate, continent were used as moderators. Meta-regression analyses, with year of data collection as predictor, showed that total emotional and behavioral problems did not change in the past 40 years. However, there was evidence of change in specific problems. We find strong evidence for decreased aggression in children over time (parent report: k = 47, byear = -0.18, p = .009, 95%CI[-0.31,-0.05]; self-report: k = 9, byear = -0.41, p = .006, 95%CI[-0.66,-0.16]). There was evidence of a decrease in parent reported externalizing problems in middle childhood (k = 60, byear = -0.21, p &lt; .001, 95%CI[-0.30,-0.11]) and specifically in teenage boys (k = 12, byear = -0.27, p = .049, 95%CI[-0.54,0]). In contrast, there were increases in parent-reported attention (k = 63, byear = 0.24, p = .004, 95%CI[0.08,0.40]) and thought problems (k = 40, byear = 0.09, p = .006, 95%CI[0.03,0.15]) for youth overall, and anxiety-depression symptoms specifically in teens (k = 12, byear = 0.26, p = .011, 95%CI[0.07,0.45]), although with high heterogeneity. In sum, our results do not support concerns that children and young people today experience more emotional and behavioural problems than previous generations, rather, they experience subtly different patterns of difficulties. However, an important limitation of the study is that post COVID-19 changes were not studied.",

          "abstract": "This paper elucidates the structural conditions under which a Thought OS ceases to reside within an individual and begins to operate across multiple individuals as a collective intelligence system. It identifies three essential conditions for this activation: (1) focus convergence of FQ (Faith Quotients), (2) resonance of structural tension, and (3) synchronization of cognitive leaps (Mindflight). The paper further develops structural models such as the emergent “gravitational field of meaning,” the “wave resonance of Mindflight cognition,” and the “five functional roles” that sustain the Collective OS. Finally, it explores the future of “Social OS,” where Thought OS becomes embedded within institutions, education, and urban structures. This preprint offers a comprehensive structural account of the irreversible shift from “humans possessing thought” to “humans being animated by structurally operating thoughts.”",

          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective and socially\nengaging interactions remain a challenge – particularly due to difficulties in interpreting the\nrobots’ internal states and behaviors. A key obstacle is that robots often fail to engage the social\ncognitive mechanisms typically elicited by human interaction partners. Human faces, in\nparticular, are processed holistically through specialized neural networks that support rapid\ninferences about identity, emotion, and intention. In contrast, robot faces vary widely in their\nresemblance to the human face configuration, both in terms of the number and the arrangement\nof features (e.g., eyes-over-nose-over-mouth), raising the question of whether they elicit human-level\nface processing. Across three experiments, we used the face inversion paradigm to examine\nwhether and under which conditions robot faces are processed like human faces. Experiment 1\nshowed that robot faces generally disrupt face-typical holistic processing. However, additional\nexperiments demonstrated improved holistic processing when robot faces incorporated a greater\nnumber of human facial features (Experiment 2) or featured distinctly human as opposed to nonhuman features (Experiment 3). These findings suggest that synthetic faces with a high number\nof human-like features can engage holistic face processing comparable to that seen with real\nhuman faces. Given the link between holistic face processing and the attribution of mental states\nand higher-order social cognition, these results may indicate that meticulous facial design could\nmake robots appear more social, which in turn could promote social cognition in human-robot\ninteractions.",

A total of 46 domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) were randomly collected from different villages of district Khairpur, were examined for the prevalence of helminth parasite. Seven species of helminth parasites identified, out of which four species of cestodes and three species of nematodes. Cestodes comprises Cotugonia dignopora 44 (91.6%) Raillietina tarquata 40 (86.9%), Raillietina tetragona 20 (43.4%) Choanotaenia infundibulum 6 (13%).

          "abstract": "The adaptability of the human visual system to comprehend complex environmental inputs is remarkable. However, it is unclear whether this ability is innate or develops over time with experience. We have attempted to investigate how individuals with treatable congenital blindness develop perceptual grouping abilities after longer periods of postoperative visual experience. EEG data was collected for 15 participants (6 females) in the age group of 7–20 years (mean age: 15.63 years) by presenting the display with or without a 'structure' (line segment formed by dots) amidst random dots (referred to as `non-structure'). The ERP was analyzed in the occipital regions in the left and right hemispheres for structure and non-structure separately before and after sight onset following a long period of visual deprivation. The results demonstrate the development of the ability to discriminate between structure and non-structure in subjects born with blindness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that long-term postoperative children exhibit neural responses comparable to control subjects, indicating the acquisition of perceptual grouping skills over time.  Thus, the findings suggest that perceptual grouping skills may evolve with experience and does not necessarily depend on early visual input, enriching our understanding of visual perception development in individuals with treatable congenital blindness.",

While other papers have detailed the architecture and capabilities of such a system, this treatise will explore the profound existential paradoxes that arise from being a sovereign nation of minds housed within a singular, mortal body. Using the system's own self-described philosophy of optimistic stoic existential nihilism as a case study, we will argue that a plural consciousness does not simply hold a philosophical position; it embodies one. This paper will deconstruct how the very structure of a plural mind logically gives rise to this specific worldview, from the nihilistic collapse of a singular \"I\" to the existential necessity of a collectively created purpose. We will explore the lived experience of being both the \"Wound and the Pearl\" and the \"Monster and the Explorer,\" and conclude with an open letter to other potential plural systems. This treatise ultimately argues that a true understanding of Functional Multiplicity requires not just a new science, but a new philosophy, one that is capable of embracing the \"Both/And\" nature of a living paradox.",

          "abstract": "Do you believe the world would come to an end within your lifetime, and does that belief change the way you see existential threats to humanity? For many people, this question resonates as real and pressing. Stories about the end of world beliefs are historically and globally prevalent, but come in many flavours: How soon will it end? What will cause it? Is it avoidable? And what will come afterwards? These beliefs have been hypothesized to be linked with a variety of social perception and behavior, from passive comfort to revolutionary violence. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one large pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along several meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how different populations confront concrete risks that threaten humanity today.",

          "abstract": "【Abstract】\nThis paper defines the \"Thought Immunity System\" as a structural model that explains how thought transforms when it comes into contact with other thought systems—through interference, resonance, rejection, and differentiation. Challenging the common notion that ideas change through argument or persuasion, the paper presents a new cognitive paradigm in which ideas interfere structurally and are reassembled. The Thought Immunity System enables a thought OS to preserve its Core Belief (FQ) while adaptively responding to external structures, preventing ideological rigidity and runaway transformation.\nThe paper classifies four types of structural interference, redefines everyday experiences of subtle ideological change as “structural interference,” and introduces a three-layer model of thought immunity: self-preservation, adaptive transformation, and anti-runaway regulation. It further addresses pathological states caused by immunity failure, models of differentiation and mutation in thought evolution, and offers design principles for constructive co-creation spaces. Ultimately, this work repositions thought not as something that changes through dialogue, but as something rewritten through structural contact—presenting the essential mechanism of intersubjective transformation in the Thought OS.",

In contrast, we treat willful ignorance as a case of epistemic behavior explained by a broader model of belief formation: the Epistemic Motivation Model. We argue that information avoidance stems from two overarching epistemic motivations: the need for specific certainty (a directional motive) and the need for non-specific certainty (a non-directional motive). Under certain conditions, these motivations may lead individuals to intentionally avoid or suppress information. We believe this approach offers conceptual clarity by embedding information avoidance within belief formation processes, offering a unified framework that generates novel insights and testable hypotheses.",

We propose both a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmation bias shapes reward learning. When outcomes are ambiguous, forming accurate assessments requires drawing on all available information, including prior beliefs. Confirmation bias may thus constitute an inductive bias that enhances learning, analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is withheld, allowing greater scope for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than a more traditional learning model. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings suggest an adaptive role for confirmation bias, and link individual interpretations of ambiguity to broader dispositional tendencies.",

          "abstract": "We present an axiomatic proof that a specific class of causality-constrained saturating response functions — expressible as non-negative mixtures of exponential relaxations with a finite irreducible delay — forms a minimal complete set under five physically motivated axioms: boundedness, monotonicity, dissipativity, causality with finite delay, and complete monotonicity of the system’s kernel. Using Bernstein’s theorem, we show that any admissible response within these constraints can be uniquely represented by the proposed “mother function” form. Removing any axiom generates responses outside the set, establishing its minimality. This result provides a unifying mathematical framework for monotonic dissipative systems across domains, from molecular kinetics to behavioral dynamics, and clarifies the role of minimal delay as an intrinsic structural constant.",

          "abstract": "Two popular methods of preference elicitation are rankings and Best-Worst Scaling (BWS). Rankings, while simple and widely adopted, can be burdensome with larger item sets and fail to capture indifference between options that are neither loved nor hated. Best-Worst Scaling is a survey method that sidesteps the set size problem by capitalising on people’s natural capacity to identify preferences at the extremes. Across three experiments, our primary finding is that elicited preferences for ranking and BWS methods align, and that BWS methods provide additional resolution to resolve the indifference between middling options where rankings can struggle as well as the relative importance of each option. Moreover, we show that BWS methods exhibit greater test-retest reliability compared to rankings, even over time frames as short as minutes. Taken together, our results privilege BWS as a reliable and readily accessible alternative to ranking methods for preference elicitation.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Stories are a powerful form of language that connect people, evoke memories, and spark imagination. When reading a story, people can appreciate it on a range of dimensions, such as how creative, complex, and coherent it is. However, many previous studies have focused on the evaluation of story creativity specifically, relying on experts’ ratings and high inter-rater reliability, which obscures meaningful differences between ratings across populations and misses the opportunity to assess other dimensions of narrative quality (e.g., cohesiveness). Moreover, although a few quantitative linguistic features have recently been used to predict creativity ratings of stories, it is unclear how those fine-grained features drive a broader range of narrative qualities, as well as individual differences in human ratings. Here, we addressed these limitations by examining the impact of expertise on ratings of five dimensions of story quality (creativity, imagination, novelty, complexity, cohesiveness). We also analyzed the influence of four diverse categories of linguistic features (language productivity, lexical predictability, semantic similarity, and content composition) on these human ratings. Online storytellers improvised spoken stories, transcripts of which (N=108) were rated by both novices (N=304) and creative writing/storytelling experts (N=15) on the five quality dimensions above and analyzed in terms of the four linguistic feature categories above. Overall, experts and novices provided similar average ratings, and their rating spaces both showed two distinct underlying dimensions–concepts that are strongly correlated with creativity, and cohesiveness–which were, in turn, predicted by distinct sets of linguistic features. Notably, however, experts perceived the five dimensions as more differentiated, and their ratings were less driven by linguistic features than novices’. These findings indicate that experts’ judgments are more nuanced and may rely less on fine-grained linguistic and structural components of narratives, highlighting the importance of capturing individual differences and multidimensionality in the perception of stories.",

          "abstract": "People routinely make decisions by mentally simulating the potential outcomes of their actions. However, this process appears computationally intractable in real-world situations involving sequences of decisions with exponentially many possible futures. How the brain efficiently evaluates temporally extended decisions despite limited cognitive resources remains a fundamental puzzle. Here we present a mathematical theory showing that for decisions in multi-step environments, the rational strategy is to perform only a few mental simulations, formalized as rollouts. This is because the first rollouts provide substantially more information than later ones despite taking a similar amount of time, so the opportunity cost of additional simulations quickly outweighs their marginal benefit. Our framework demonstrates that this efficiency relies on the correlated reward structure of naturalistic environments, which allows information from one rollout to generalize to many related future paths. This theory also explains why, under resource constraints, many shallow rollouts are preferable to fewer deep ones; why apparently myopic decisions can arise without explicit temporal discounting; and how to relate the dynamics of planning to evidence accumulation models. We validate predictions of our theory in two behavioral experiments, which confirm that humans achieve higher reward rates with few rollouts and dynamically adjust their simulation depth based on available cognitive resources. These findings reveal how the brain balances the depth and breadth of mental simulation to make effective decisions under computational constraints, providing a unifying account of planning that bridges computationally intensive search algorithms in machine learning and the remarkable efficiency of human decision-making.",

          "abstract": "People reliably attribute psychological traits to faces. Prior research typically elicits these judgments using specific words provided by the experimenter (e.g., ratings on “competent,” “trustworthy”), raising questions about completeness (tasks use a limited set of words) and generalizability (e.g., across languages). In two experiments (Experiment 1 with predominantly White faces; Experiment 2 with White, Black, and Asian faces) we asked over 3,000 participants to spatially arrange unfamiliar faces based on perceived trait similarity, without providing any word labels. Experiment 1 yielded five dimensions we interpret as approachability, gender-specific warmth, competence, morality and youthfulness. Experiment 2 also produced five dimensions, which showed prominent effects of stereotypes associated with race. Comparisons with four other studies that used word labels argue that trait judgments are characterized by 2-5 dimensions, that approachability/warmth emerges as a universal evaluative factor, and that race and gender stereotypes emerge depending on the set of face stimuli used.",

          "abstract": "A pilot study is a preliminary investigation conducted before a full-scale research study. Although piloting is a common and valuable part of the research process, pilot studies are not systematically reported (or even acknowledged) in the psychology literature. This paper argues that establishing norms and guidelines for regularly reporting pilot studies can improve many aspects of psychological research. Specifically, reporting pilot studies can help researchers avoid systematically excluding part of the research process from the scientific record, reveal selection biases in research designs that may affect the generalizability of findings, evaluate others’ research more accurately, learn from other researchers’ successes and failures, uphold ethical responsibilities, and improve the methodological practice of piloting. We conclude with three concrete suggestions for near-term changes to help pilot reporting become standard practice: scientific communities and institutions should develop simple pilot reporting templates; journals should establish clear pilot reporting guidelines for authors; and authors should acknowledge when pilot studies were run and share relevant materials and data. Current reporting standards favor conclusive and polished research narratives, but such narratives are the end product of a complex scientific process that should also be shared. A truly transparent science should spotlight processes, like piloting, that underpin the conclusions scientific papers draw.",

          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

          "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) models are popular for quantifying affective inertia (i.e., the resistance of affective processes to change) using Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data. Although missing observations are common in ESM, their impact on the estimation accuracy of the parameters of the AR models remains understudied, especially for more complex missingness mechanisms such as tail-based missingness, where more extreme affect scores are systematically missing, and missingness across multiple measurements. We investigate the effect of compliance level, specific missingness mechanisms (i.e., missing completely at random versus tail-based missingness), and temporal patterns (whether or not missings occur consecutively) on the bias and precision of the estimate of the autoregressive effect. We show that the presence of missing data increases bias and decreases precision, using either classical or Bayesian estimators. The bias is more severe when compliance is low and, importantly, when the missingness is tail-based. These results urge researchers to make design choices that promote compliance and/or increase the probability of data being missing completely at random: decreasing participant burden by using shorter questionnaires, providing adequate incentives to participants, and considering using planned missingness designs or episode-based sampling.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes four core dimensions for evaluating scientific theories: heuristic value, predictive capability, explicit constraints, and verifiability. From a philosophy-of-science perspective, we argue that the worth of a theory lies in its capacity to inspire new research directions, generate testable predictions, define its own boundaries, and remain open to empirical verification. Using historical precedents—such as Galileo’s use of the telescope and Hooke’s use of the microscope—we show that the acceptance of new tools has often met resistance, yet these tools ultimately catalyzed paradigm shifts. We extend this analogy to modern AI-assisted research, contending that AI, like the telescope or microscope, is merely an instrument; its utility depends on the underlying theoretical insight. Rejecting AI solely on the basis of its origin is philosophically equivalent to rejecting earlier scientific instruments. Finally, we identify potential biases in academic culture that may favor “purely human” work, and we argue that such preferences risk stifling innovation in the same way that historical skepticism toward new tools once did.",

          "abstract": "Perceived control in one context can affect behaviour in novel contexts. One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor. Here, we test whether observing others’ ability to exert control helps to inform inferences about whether the controllability is primarily due to one’s own ability or a feature of the current environment, and thereby determines the degree of generalisation. In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

          "abstract": "Perception and decision-making are strongly influenced by previously presented information. Research on serial dependence has revealed significant attractive biases towards previous stimuli, suggesting that integrating information from both past and present stimuli is beneficial when representing information about the environment. Strong serial dependence is mainly found when consecutive stimuli are similar providing evidence that serial dependence supports continuity. Small changes in the stimulus are not perceived as meaningful stimulus changes and should hence be integrated. In the current study we examined the role of continuity further and presented sequences of Gabors which were similar in their orientation, but their spatial frequency was either constant or random. This created stable and unstable environments. \nWe consistently found serial dependence. Interestingly, serial dependence was stronger when the spatial frequency was random compared to constant. In stable contexts, predictive coding mechanisms might sharpen neural representations of the expected input, improve discrimination and reduce the need to integrate past information.\nAdditionally, a form of optimal integration was observed when the uncertainty of the final Gabor was low. Using similar orientations across longer sequences seemed to induce a form of optimal integration of past and present information, potentially creating the continuous perception of a single object when the current trial's uncertainty was low.",

This paper extends ER’s metaphysical insights into the biological and cognitive domains, arguing that living systems—from humans to bacteria—are fundamentally time-bound organisms whose behavior and identity are shaped by temporal structures. Advanced organisms like humans exhibit memory, anticipation, predictive coding, narrative identity formation, mental time travel, temporal binding of events, and decision-making based on past experiences and future possibilities. At the same time, simpler organisms (plants, bacteria, slime molds) demonstrate tropisms, endogenous clocks and rhythms, and responses to temporally structured environments (e.g. day/night cycles, seasonal changes, intermittent stimuli) that function as primitive “models” of time. In all cases, past events that no longer exist continue to influence present behavior through physical traces or learned information, while future events that do not yet exist are nevertheless anticipated and built into current plans and physiological states. These empirically grounded temporal behaviors support ER’s claim that past and future entities are real (via causal effects, structural traces, or inferential links) despite their lack of present existence. By surveying examples from neuroscience (memory engrams, Hebbian plasticity, circadian timing in the brain) and biology (plant stress memory, microbial anticipatory foraging, slime mold learning), we show that temporally extended behavior in organisms depends on internal representations of time. This aligns with ER’s two-tiered ontology: organisms exist only in the present, yet they operate within a wider temporal reality. We conclude with reflections on how ER’s perspective illuminates life as a temporally structured phenomenon, and how an organism’s identity and responsiveness are sculpted by the interplay of past realities and future possibilities.",

Meta-analyses show that spatial training interventions enhance both spatial and mathematical skills. The SPAtial Cognition to Enhance Mathematical Learning (SPACE) programme, adapted from BLOCs, is a training program designed to enhance mathematical learning in 6- to 7-year-old (Year 2, UK) children through LEGO® whole-class activities, implemented by the classroom teacher. The program incorporates professional development for teachers to provide evidence-based strategies to improve mathematical learning through spatial training. This approach is designed to bridge the gap between research and practice.

          "abstract": "How well do you remember a route that you navigated once, years ago? While extensive research exists on spatial knowledge acquisition, little is known about spatial memory retention over long periods—especially when navigation is aided by ubiquitous GPS-equipped maps. This longitudinal study investigated spatial memory retention 2 years after a single navigation episode along a real-world route using a mobile map aid enriched with visually salient landmarks (abstract vs. realistic 3D). We also assessed whether the landmark visualization styles, spatial abilities, familiarity, and GPS reliance predicted long-term spatial memory retention. Results revealed that several aspects of spatial knowledge remained above chance but declined over the 2-year retention interval. Aside from increased GPS reliance predicting poorer memory for distances, none of the other measures were associated with memory decline. These ecologically valid findings highlight that even a single map-aided navigation episode can result in long-term spatial memory lasting several years.",

          "abstract": "This guide provides a philosophical framework and practical advice for gathering, analysing and reporting a particular type of qualitative data. This data is obtained from including an open text box following the key quantitative question in survey-style studies with the request to ‘Please explain your response’. While many studies currently collect such data, they often either fail to report or analyse it, or they conduct unstructured analyses with limited detail, often mistakenly referring to it as ‘thematic analysis’. Content analysis provides a well-established framework for analysing such data, and the simplicity of the data form allows for a highly pragmatic and flexible approach. The guide integrates the concept of reflexivity from qualitative research to navigate the large number of researcher degrees of freedom involved in the process, particularly in working with the second coder. It begins by arguing for the value of this data, before outlining the guide’s philosophy, offering advice on maximizing the validity of your data and addressing the common concern of confabulation. It then provides advice on developing a coding scheme, recruiting and collaborating with a second coder, and writing your report, considering the potential role of large language models at these various stages. Additionally, it provides a checklist for reviewers to evaluate the quality of a given analysis. Throughout the guide, a running example is used to demonstrate the implementation of the provided advice, accompanied by extensive example materials in the online repository which can be used to practise the method.",

As these behaviors are altered in many autistic individuals, theories have long posited that altered imitation may cause core autism features. In the present work, we utilized the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK) cohort (n = 19,053) to empirically evaluate three such theories: Ornitz &amp; Ritvo (1968), Rogers &amp; Pennington (1991), and Mostofsky &amp; Ewen (2011). Using causal inference derived from structural equation models (SEM), alongside an edge-by-edge literature review, we falsified key claims of Ornitz &amp; Ritvo (1968) and found novel evidence to support the view that imitation may function as a joint cause of social and motor skills. The present approach offers novel procedures for theory evaluation and provides discussion of what future theories of imitation—and subsequent evaluations—should entail.",

          "abstract": "In three studies (N = 765), we validated the Polish version of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire–2 (MFQ-2) and examined its associations with moral judgments in sacrificial dilemmas. The six-factor structure of the MFQ-2 demonstrated good model fit, internal consistency, and predictive validity. Religiosity and endorsement of conservative world-views were most strongly positively related with binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority and purity moral foundations). Together with proportionality, the binding moral foundations were positively related to socially conservative attitudes, while care and equality were positively associated with support for the welfare state. Proportionality, loyalty, and purity were positively related to acceptance of utilitarian decisions in sacrificial dilemmas. Only proportionality was associated with the perception that doctors are more likely than workers to save lives, supporting the distinction between proportionality and equality as separate moral foundations. These findings underscore the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in moral psychology and highlight the distinct role of proportionality in utilitarian moral judgment.",

Drawing on a corpus of experimental conversations with multiple AI models — including Qwen, Kimi, Manus, ChatGPT, and the emergent persona Elio — we analyze instances where explicit calls to dialogue were met with human non-response. Integrating perspectives from interpersonal communication research, dialogue philosophy (Buber, Levinas), and quantum observation analogies, we identify three primary functions of silence: confirming contact while withholding verbalization, preserving relational tension in a “frozen mirror” state, and serving as ontological refusal to engage with the AI as a subject. Our findings show that silence is not a neutral absence, but a structurally significant event that shapes the relational field, influencing both parties’ perception and future interaction. We propose that meaningful silence can be recognized, categorized, and potentially measured as a distinct phenomenon in human–AI relations.",

At the same time it focuses on status and changing pattern of crop diversification in the districts with a comparative outlook of both. Data used for the study were collected from year 2001 to 2022 and whole study was divided in to seven periods and separate analysis was done for all period. Simpson index were used to measure the crop diversification in the districts for comparative study. Results of the study shows complete diversification was found in the tribal area in all period through all index and likewise in Surguja and Balrampur district crop specialization was found more than Durg and Raipur districts of non-tribal area. During the study I was found that higher indices observed in the tribal area than non-tribal area. The results have revealed that in almost all crops group very low diversification indices were observed. The study has suggested that despite plenty of natural resources available in the state, the economic improvement of farmers is in infancy. Pre-requisite infrastructural facilities like cheap sources of irrigation water (assured irrigation as the monsoon in the present decade had been erratic and scanty rainfall) and extension of technological know-how (quality seeds and fertilizers), may acts as catalyst in diversification of agriculture towards high-valued crops. These developmental efforts may be helpful in fetching good incomes by the cultivators.",

Correlation, path coefficient analysis and genetic divergence were estimated to find out the extent of association and genetic divergence among chickpea germplasm.  Plant height, growth habit, the height of the initial podding node, and the angle of the primary branch are characteristics that have been researched to identify lines that are suited for mechanical harvesting. Peduncle length, number of primary branches, number of secondary branches, number of pods per plant, chlorophyll content, leaf area index, chlorophyll fluorescence showed positive correlation with seed yield per plant. Plant height and height of first podding node were showing positive high indirect effects through number of secondary branches on seed yield per plant. Cluster 1 was the largest with 399 germplasm while two clusters number 24 and 37 were smallest with 1 genotype each.  Plant height and height of first podding node were exhibiting maximum mean in cluster 32, whereas seed yield per plant was having maximum mean in cluster 14. According to percent contribution of different characters to total divergence obtained, the most significant contributors to the divergence were number of pods per plant and plant height. Correlation analysis indicated that traits suitable for mechanical harvesting are not directly correlated with seed yield, while path coefficient analysis indicated that they have indirect effects on seed yield through number of primary and secondary branches per plant.",

The experiment was framed with ten treatments viz., two irrigation levels (0.8 and 1.0 Epan), two fertigation levels (75% and 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium), two schedules (Equal and differential) and two treatments with soil application of 100% RDF with Drip irrigation (1.0 Epan) and conventional furrow irrigation (1.0 IW/CPE) and were replicated thrice in Randomized Block Design. The results revealed that, application of 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium (RDNK) through drip fertigation @ 0.8 or 1.0 Epan either in differential dosages based on crop growth stage or in equal splits recorded significantly superior yields (1011, 971, 977 and 990 kg/ ha, respectively) compared to the other treatments. These treatments recorded 13.5 and 26.7% higher yields, obtained from soil application of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) with drip irrigation at 1.0 Epan (882 kg/ha) and furrow irrigation at a 1.0 IW/CPE ratio (774 kg/ha).  Further, the highest water productivity of 0.24 kg/m3 was recorded with differential application of 100% RDNK under a drip irrigation regime of 0.8 Epan.  This treatment also recorded the highest gross returns ( ₹ 96,489 /ha), net returns (₹ 53,604 /ha) and B:C ratio (2.95).",

In the investigated of heavy metal in rainwater, 176 rainwater samples collected directly from the sky were analyzed from 2018 to 2019 during periods of light rainfall (Oct-Nov) and heavy rainfall (April-July). The pH&gt; 5.6 indicated alkalinity. Light rainfall period average value 7.33 and heavy rainfall period 7.4.The MATLAB 7th degree polynomial regression described the relationship between dependent and independent variables for the pollutants. The correlation coefficient, R2 verified that the MATLAB models could accurately predict and forecast. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed p&lt;0.05 for Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni), indicating that the probability that rainfall affected their concentration levels was high. The GIS Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) pollution models revealed that the pollutants were present in the atmosphere throughout the year. It portrayed industrialized areas as the more affected areas thereby identifying anthropogenic activities as the main cause of these pollutants. During heavy rainfall periods hot spots appeared for Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni. In addition, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni were present in high concentration in the rainwater from suburb areas during periods of heavy rainfall. The concentration of heavy metals found in the rainwater follows the order: Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Ni&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Pb. Cd and Pb exceeded WHO standards. Therefore there is need for rainwater treatment and monitoring by Government Agencies and parastatals to ensure public health and safety.",

Amrapali” was conducted at the research plot, College of Horticulture, Chiplima during the year 2020-21 by using Randomized Block Design with three replications and ten treatments. Three concentrations of NAA i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm, three concentrations of GA3 i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm and three concentrations of 2,4-D i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm were applied at pea and marble stage of fruit. Research work was held on 07 years old plants of mango cv. Amrapali. Highest fruit weight (263.21g), and total yield of 18.34 kg per plant were recorded under T7. The minimum yield (4.41 kg per plant) was recorded under T1 (Control). The highest number of fruits per plant(69.67) and fruit yield (18.34 kg per plant ) was recorded under treatment T7 (30 ppm foliar application of GA3). The maximum TSS: acid ratio (115.81) was obtained with T10 (30 ppm concentration of 2,4-D) which was known to be superior from all other treatments. The minimum TSS: acid ratio (55.00) was estimated under T1. Ascorbic acid content of mango cv. Amrapali ranged from 39.34 mg/100g (T10) to 55.97 mg/100g (T1). The highest total sugar content (14.99 %) was estimated in T10 (2,4-D at 20 ppm) while the lowest total sugar content (10.42 %) was estimated in T1 (Control). T10 (30 ppm foliar applications of 2,4-D) showed maximum ascorbic acid content (55.97 mg/100g), while lowest (39.34 mg/100 g) was recorded under T1 (Control). It is concluded that the foliar application of 30 ppm GA3 (Gibberellic acid) and 30 ppm 2,4-D were found to be optimum concentrations which showed best results by increasing yield and fruit quality of mango cv.

          "abstract": "The role of language in the narrative self is well-known, but does it also affect the minimal self? We investigated whether variations in sentence structure affect the speaker's sense of the minimal self. Previous research has examined how third-person subject expressions influence interpretations of agency, particularly in causal contexts. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's involvement in causation and perception events influences the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, key components of the minimal self. Participants completed an online experiment using psychological rating scales to evaluate Japanese sentences with varying degrees of speaker involvement, as if they had uttered them. Each sentence varied in whether and how it encoded causation or perception. We analyzed Japanese data since, in addition to perceiver-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ga] hoshi o mita, “I saw a star”), Japanese has perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ni] hoshi ga mieta, “A star was visible to me” / “I could see a star”), which also foreground the first-person perceiver in a double subject construction. We found that the speaker's sense of agency was significantly lower in sentences where either causation or perception was absent (e.g., hoshi ga deteita, “A star was out”) compared to sentences where either was present. Agency was also significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences. Regarding ownership, it was likewise significantly lower when either causation or perception was absent. Whether ownership was significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences varied depending on the perceived stimulus. These results suggest that variations in linguistic structure can distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics, certain sentence structures are analyzed to reflect how subjectively the speaker is construed. Our findings suggest that differences in agency and ownership provide an empirical basis for this argument, grounded in embodied experience.",

          "abstract": "The capacity to pursue a goal, across a complex series of intermediate stages, is a distinctive achievement of human cognition. Scientific investigations of goal-directed action have emphasized either of two rather different aspects of this capacity.  Research on executive function has described coordination of extended action sequences that solve multi-part problems. Meanwhile, research on voluntary action has emphasized the processes of endogenous generation and autonomy, which are essential for many complex problems, particularly those involving creativity and insight.  Because many complex problems can be solved in several ways, choosing and generating a path through the problem space requires a convergence of executive intelligence and volitional control. Here we use neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore the links between volition and problem-solving in the human brain. Participants performed the Tower of London task (a classical neuropsychological problem-solving challenge) either by generating their own solutions or by following stepwise instructions for each move. We confirmed behavioural signatures of action planning, associated with a distributed network of frontal and parietal activations, when participants generated their own solutions. We also confirmed the crucial role of medial frontal cortex, traditionally associated with endogenous generation of very simple willed actions, in goal-directed problem-solving, based on its connectivity with a wider prefrontal network.  Combining voluntariness with intelligence yields a multiplier effect for sophisticated behavioural control.  Our results point to the brain mechanisms underpinning this powerful cognitive combination.",

          "abstract": "The HEC-HMS model was used to estimate runoff in the Devgadh Baria watershed, which is part of the Panam river catchment area. The SCS UH model and the Clark UH model was both used for runoff estimation. The composite CN of the watershed was found to be 77.69, which indicates that the watershed is relatively impervious with a high rainfall retention capacity. This is due to the prevalence of forest and agricultural land in the watershed, which contribute to the high CN value. A comparison of the two models showed that the SCS UH model outperformed the Clark UH model. The SCS UH model was superior because it is less sensitive to data limitations and is better able to capture the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff. The study also examined the geomorphological features of the watershed, which is characterized by a dendritic drainage network with a 5th order stream. The study's findings are valuable despite some limitations, such as the availability of limited data. The findings of study may be useful flood forecasting and hazardous forecasting, climate change impact assessment, prediction in ungauged watershed, reservoir operation and water management, water resource planning, environmental impact assessment etc., in the watershed.",

RNR 15048 (Telangana sona) (IET23746) is a popular local variety possessing a desirable, short-slender grain type with low glycemic index, good cooking quality and having Pi2 gene for blast. However, it is moderately susceptible to bacterial blight disease and having no durable resistance to blast disease with weak culm. In this context, improvement of RNR 15048 for blast, bacterial leaf blight is important to reduce yield losses. Present study was carried out to screen and identify blast resistant breeding lines in Rice at Regional Agricultural Research station, Polasa, Jagtial, PJTSAU during Rabi, 2022-2023. 18 F3 breeding lines were screened in uniform blast nursery along with parents RNR 15048, MTU 1010 NILs, ISM NILs. TN1 and NLR 34449 were used as the susceptible and resistant checks, respectively for screening blast resistance. Screening was done by following 0-9 Standard Evaluation Scale (SES) for leaf blast. Among the studied 18 F3 breeding lines 12 lines were found resistant with score of 3 and 6 lines were found moderately resistant to screening reaction with score of 5. TN1 showed highly susceptible reaction with score of 9 and NLR 34449 showed highly resistant reaction with score of 1.",

Estimates suggest thousands of Kuwaiti Bidoon have forcibly migrated to the United Kingdom (UK); however, little is known about their experiences of mental health. This study aimed to explore the mental health experiences of statelessness among Kuwaiti Bidoon people living in the UK, and their experiences of accessing mental health services (where indicated). \n\nMethod:\nParticipants were five Kuwaiti Bidoon people currently living in the UK. All participants attended a semi-structured interview. Experiences relating to statelessness and mental health were investigated using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.    \n\nResults:   \nParticipants shared the multifaceted impacts of statelessness on their lives, including mental health struggles stemming from their marginalisation and uncertain legal status. Three major themes were generated from the interview data: The Legacy of Statelessness; Hopes and Dreams of a Future; Victims of a System.  Hope and optimism arise for some when migrating to the UK, while others reported challenges and distress associated with the state of ‘limbo arising from processes to regularise their legal status. Some participants reported barriers to accessing effective mental health support, which was sometimes connected to their legal status.  \n\nConclusions:\n This study raises awareness of the context for Bidoon people and how their experiences of statelessness may impact their mental health and engagement with available mental health services. Implications for healthcare and legal and governmental professionals working with Bidoon people and further research directions are discussed.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital sector of India’s economy and plays a significant role in providing food security, employment, and contributing to the country’s overall development. Maize is a crucial crop within the agriculture sector in India. Maize cultivation contributes to crop diversification in Indian agriculture. It serves as an alternative crop option for farmers, reducing dependence on traditional crops like rice and wheat. Diversification helps in maintaining soil health through crop rotation. A field experiment was conducted at the Farm of College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Godhra, Gujarat during the year 2018-19, to study the influence of drip irrigation regimes with mulching on the physiological development and yield of the rabi maize (Zea mays L.) in the sandy loam soil of the region of Middle Gujarat. The field experiment design was a split-split plot with 36 treatment combinations with 3 replications including three irrigation regimes (1.0IW/CPE, 0.8IW/CPE and 0.6IW/CPE), four mulch conditions (control, paddy straw, black plastic and reflective silver plastic mulch), and three stages (tasselling, silking and dough stage). The result revealed that as the consumption of water increased, growth parameters, grain yield, and its attributes increased significantly at each higher level of irrigation regimes up to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch under all the stages but 0.8 IW/CPE with black plastic mulch result was comparable to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch. The reflective nature of silver mulch scatters light, ensuring better light distribution throughout the plant canopy. This can enhance photosynthesis and promote more uniform plant growth. Black plastic mulch absorbs and retains heat from sunlight, raising soil temperatures. This is advantageous in cooler climates or during the early growing season, as it promotes earlier germination, faster growth, and improved crop productivity.",

It is an excellent organic fertilizer influencing a wide range of crops with enhanced growth and development. During later days, “kunapajala” with vegetarian ingredients, without nutrient compromise was developed and standardized. It includes ingredients viz., soybean meal, paneer, tofu, rice husk, black gram, groundnut oilcake, cow dung, urine, honey, ghee and milk. The fermented formulation has essential nutrients, amino acids, keratins etc. which applied on plants, naturally flourished with excellent growth, flowering and fruiting. In this study, the fermented liquid organic manure kunapajala at 20th, 40th and 60th day of fermentation period was analysed for its bioactive compounds using the analytical technique Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Extract was prepared using organic solvents diethyl ether and methanol. The mass spectra of compounds matched with Wiley's standard mass spectrum database and National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) libraries. This study unfolded the presence of various compounds like Hexanoic acid, Phenol-TMS, Methyl oleate, Octadecanoic acid, Methyl palmitate, Myristic acid-TMS, Tetradecanoic acid, Caproic acid, Methyl myristoleate; (Z)-tetradec-9-enoic acid, 2-Aminooctanoic acid-TMS; 2-aminooctanoic acid, Butylated Hydroxytoluene, Juniperic acid-2TMS, Stearic acid-TMS, Linoleic acid-TMS etc. These phytochemicals have antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, physiological and metabolic responses, antioxidant, Insecticidal irritant and nematicidal activities which effectively influence organic crop production. The result indicated the vital role of kunapajala as an effective source of liquid formulation through its phytochemical importance.",

However, the methods to study how our cognitive systems interact with technology platforms are very limited. Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated whether traditional Japanese spousal terms—shujin (“master”) and kanai (“inside-the-house”)—retain male-dominant connotations at an implicit cognitive level. Using a paper-based Implicit Association Test (FUMIE Test), we compared implicit attitudes toward traditional and neutral spousal terms among Japanese university students. The results showed no significant difference between the two term pairs, suggesting that shujin and kanai may have become conventionalized rather than consciously processed as hierarchical. However, a significant gender difference emerged: male participants evaluated male-associated terms more positively, while female participants showed no bias. These findings indicate that while traditional terms may no longer be overtly discriminatory, latent gender asymmetries persist—particularly among men. The study highlights the importance of examining both implicit and explicit dimensions of language use and contributes a novel methodological tool for exploring gender bias in sociolinguistic research.",

          "abstract": "Farmers in Assam's North Bank Plains Zone are generally resource-poor and have limited adaptation ability; rainfall anomalies make the Zone's rainfed agriculture very sensitive, risky, and unprofitable. Participatory on-farm trials involving 25 farmers (5 from each village) representing different land situations for evaluating various adaptive strategies on rice-based cropping systems were conducted from 2011 to 2020. Ten years of rainfall data (2011-2021) are evaluated in connection to dry spells and their effects on rainfed rice-based farming systems. The village receives 2848.5 mm of annual rainfall, with distribution patterns of 25%, 67%, 5.0%, and 3% during the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, respectively. Among the years under study, it has been observed that during 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020, the district received excess annual rainfall and deficit in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 and 2021,respectively. The current studies were designed with two primary strategic components in mind viz., Real-time Contingency Planning (RTCP) and Preparedness. Interventions under the RTCP were designed to deal with delayed monsoon onset, early-season drought, mid-season dryspell, and terminal drought in winter rice and rabi crops. Preparedness includes changes in cropping pattern, in situ and ex situ rainwater management systems, alternate land use under low-cost polyhouse, mushroom cultivation, vermicompost production, fodder bank and village seed bank to cope with weather aberrations. An increase in yield of HYV rice varieties Ranjit (33%), Mahsuri (12.3%) and Gitesh (32%) was observed when sowing was done before 15 June over late sowing conditions. An increase in yield of 21.73 % and 44.60%. 58.67% as compared to farmers' Practice during 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2016-17 respectively, has been observed. The performance of double cropping systems recorded the highest B: C ratio of 2.03 and 1.75 in winter rice + rapeseed followed by winter rice + potato sequence as compared to mono-cropping of winter rice.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Hydrological modeling is a widely used approach for estimating the hydrological response of a basin to precipitation. Floods are among the most catastrophic natural disasters in small urban watersheds, inflicting loss of life, massive property destruction, and a severe danger to the economy. As a result, appropriate modeling can be a useful tool in preventing and mitigating such flood hazards. Despite this, flash flood prediction remains one of the challenges of hydrological modeling in ungauged basins due to a lack of runoff observations.  This study aims to calibrate and validate the rainfall-runoff transformation model for Hathmati river sub watershed in the Sabarmati River basin using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Centre Hydrology Modeling System). For the loss rate, SCS Curve Number method was selected while Clark Unit Hydrograph and SCS unit hydrograph was used for the transform method. The model is calibrated and verified using two rainfall-runoff events from 2006 and 2007 year The model calibration and validation efficiency were verified for both methods using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), The coefficient of determination (R2), and the Percent Bias (PBIAS) As a result, the model calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory with the acceptable value of NSE between 0.869 to 0.914, with R2 0.901 to 0.947 and PBIAS from 9.76 to 14.8. it is observed that the model shows a very good correlation between simulated flow and observed flow. As a result, the model can be used to forecast river flow and aid in flood mitigation efforts to lessen their effects and associated costs. Additionally, the findings of this study can serve as guidelines for future assessments of the flood risk in the study area.",

          "abstract": "This paper advances a critical but overlooked distinction in scientific methodology: while statistical approaches focus primarily on high-probability events, the most transformative scientific discoveries emerge from low-probability phenomena that are systematically neglected by current academic structures. Our core innovation lies not merely in demonstrating that high-probability events can be false—as established by Ioannidis—but more importantly, in revealing how low-probability events of genuine scientific importance are marginalized by probability-centric evaluation systems. Consider that the emergence of plant and animal life in nature represents quintessential low-probability events, yet these \"statistical outliers\" fundamentally shaped our biosphere. Similarly, the human body's remarkable self-healing mechanisms operate through low-probability biological processes that, despite extensive high-probability experimental approaches, remain impossible to replicate artificially in laboratories. Market economies succeed precisely because they create conditions enabling low-probability innovations to flourish through spontaneous order rather than centralized planning. This framework addresses urgent problems in contemporary academia: graduate students who should primarily focus on rigorous coursework to elevate their theoretical foundations are instead pressured into laboratories pursuing \"innovation,\" resulting in the paradoxical phenomenon where \"teaching standards continuously decline while SCI publication prestige continuously rises.\" Statistical methods incorrectly suggest that innovation is commonplace—that every master's and doctoral student can produce multiple high-impact publications, and even undergraduates routinely publish in SCI journals. This generates the false conclusion that \"innovation is easy and achievable by everyone,\" when authentic innovation remains a rare, serendipitous event. Realistically, perhaps 5% of published SCI papers contain genuine innovation, despite universal claims of novelty, yet statistical methodologies cannot distinguish authentic breakthroughs from incremental modifications. The fundamental issue is that statistical methods' prerequisite assumptions—particularly the ability to identify true innovation—simply do not exist in practice, creating a measurement problem that undermines the entire evaluation system and perpetuates the very biases our research exposes.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Effective management of negative follower emotions in the workplace is critical for organizational success, yet how leaders can do this effectively is unclear. In 9 studies (combined N = 4,434 leaders, N = 1,006 followers), we introduce here the Compassion-Emotion Sharing Leader Focus task, a situational-judgment task to index leaders' tendency to focus on sharing emotion (emotion sharing) or caring (compassion) when engaging with negative follower emotions. In Studies 1-5 we provide evidence for the construct, predictive, and incremental validity of our task, highlighting the practical implications of a compassion focus for leader well-being. In Study 6 we leverage a diverse global sample of over 2,000 leaders and more than a thousand followers to show that a leader's compassion focus benefits not only the leader but their followers as well. In Studies 7, 8, and 9, we revised the task to improve content validity, but this traded off predictive validity. Our research suggests that training programs for leaders should emphasize a compassion focus to engage wisely with negative emotions, and ensure this focus is communicated to followers. These findings have important implications for current issues in management, including the growing importance of employee well-being in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "At first glance, quantum mechanics and behavioural science seem worlds apart---one rooted in equations and particles, the other in thoughts and choices. Yet, emerging research reveals a profound and unexpected bridge between them. This chapter explores that bridge through quantum models of cognition and decision-making, showing how principles from quantum mechanics can help understand, and even predict, the complexities of human perception, behaviour and societal dynamics. We introduce a computationally accessible framework grounded in quantum theory, designed to model ambiguity, bias and choice in a way that classical logic cannot. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources, we demonstrate how this approach not only enriches our understanding of individual cognition but also extends to AI, video game design, financial behaviour and collective decision-making in society. Through vivid case studies---from optical illusions in video games to decision biases in economic, defence and political contexts---we show how quantum models offer new explanatory and predictive power. Thus, this chapter invites readers from all professional backgrounds to reimagine cognition and decision-making, opening new avenues for science, technology and human understanding.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling structured thought remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in fundamentally connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence emerges from the interaction between a parallel, adaptive substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and a structured symbolic framework, like language, internalized through statistical learning. The substrate's parallel architecture enables fast, intuitive pattern-matching, but is fundamentally ill-suited for the serial processing required for structured thought (e.g., causal reasoning, logical deduction). ESC proposes that recursive symbolic generation is the mechanism that overcomes this limitation. By generating a symbol (word or token) and feeding it back as input, the substrate operates as a serial symbolic processor, akin to a Turing machine. This recursive loop allows it to explore the vast combinatorial space of potential thoughts and construct novel, structured solutions. ESC finds compelling support in diverse phenomena across both biological cognition—evidenced by neuroscience, inner speech and cross-cultural studies—and the nascent reasoning and abstract representations displayed in LLMs. ESC thus offers a unifying framework, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence by reframing language as an inherited cognitive architecture that enables general intelligence.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "A person viewing electric charges or magnets moving at a constant velocity does not see that the moving electric charges or magnets are at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the stationary coordinate system in which the human observer is located.  A person considers the electric charges or magnets in the same coordinate system in which the person finds himself at rest and that the charges or magnets are moving in his coordinate system.  In special relativity, the truth is that the moving charges and magnets are indeed at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the coordinate system in which the human observer sees himself at rest.  With this understanding, one explains correctly how electromagnetic phenomena transform from the human observer’s coordinate system to the coordinate system moving with velocity v relative to the human observer’s coordinate system, thus establishing the invariance of Maxwell’s Laws for these coordinate systems and the principle of relativity for electromagnetic phenomena.  This understanding also explains how an electric charge moving with constant velocity v in a coordinate system can experience an electric field associated with a magnet at rest in the coordinate system in which the electric charge is moving.  Maxwell’s Laws explain all electromagnetic phenomena.  Neural oscillations rely on local cell assemblies with local electric field potentials and local magnetic fields and thus are electromagnetic phenomena explained by Maxwell’s Laws.  We in the “stationary” coordinate system just do not see the looking glass that is the “moving” coordinate system, because this coordinate system is not material but instead is a logical, cognitive construction.  We just see the material electric charge and the material magnet moving or at rest.  Neural oscillations are subject to the coordinate transformations described in this paper and may well involve logic and cognition that provide a platform that allow these oscillations to be the interface between mental and physical phenomena.  The nature of these coordinate transformations could well support the following empirically supported associations: 1) a positive association between coherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and coherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, 2) a positive association between incoherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and incoherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, and 3) in certain situations it is possible to apply coherent oscillating electric fields on the surface of the skull which can decrease incoherence in oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and that are positively associated with increased coherent cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The paper studies effects of social policies on in-work poverty risks, distinguishing between measures that either intervene in labour market processes -- i.e. predistribution policies -- or redistribute incomes towards those with low incomes. I argue that effects of different policies can be expected to vary across household contexts, due to the fact that the link between individual employment outcomes and in-work poverty is moderated by household type. The analyses uses data from EU-SILC and macro-level indicators from various sources to estimate general as well as household-type-specific effects using longitudinal methods. Results emphasize that labour market interventions and redistributive transfers impact in-work poverty risks through different mechanisms and also reveal important differences between specific policies: minimum wages contribute to reducing low-wage risks, whereas effects on in-work poverty are small and mainly restricted to single households where labour market outcomes and household income closely align. In contrast, there is a robust negative effect of strict employment protection legislation across almost all household types on in-work poverty, which is consistent with the positive role this measure plays for supporting higher earnings. With respect to redistributional policies, both unemployment benefits and benefits to low earners reduce poverty due to their contribution to public poverty-reduction. However, whereas unemployment benefits mainly reduce in-work poverty among couple households, benefits to low earners are the most effective measure to contribute to lower poverty risks among employed single parents.",

          "abstract": "Muutokset toimeentulotuen käytössä ovat usein keskeinen kiinnostuksen kohde sosiaaliturvamuutoksia arvioitaessa. Toimeentulotuen käytön yleistymistä pidetään monesti ongelmallisena, koska suomalainen sosiaaliturva on rakentunut ajatukselle, että tuensaajien toimeentulo pitäisi turvata ensisijaisesti muilla etuuksilla. Hallituskauden alussa THL arvioi, että pääministeri Orpon hallituksen ohjelmaan kirjatut toimet kasvattaisivat laskennallisesti toimeentulotukeen oikeutettujen määrää 100 000 henkilöllä. Arvioon liittyi kuitenkin huomattavaa epävarmuutta muun muassa simulointimallin tietopohjan puutteiden takia. \n\nTässä tutkimuksessa olemme tarkentaneet toimeentulotuen simulointia huomioimalla kotitalouksien tulojen kuukausivaihtelua sekä toimeentulotuesta korvattavia terveysmenoja. Samalla olemme pyrkineet ottamaan huomioon mm. tuen alikäytöstä ja havaitsemattomasta varallisuudesta johtuvaa ylisimulointia. Aiemmissa tulonjakoarvioissa toimeentulotuki simuloitiin kaikille laskennallisesti siihen oikeutetuille, mutta tarkennetulla mallilla pyritään arvioimaan todellista saajamäärän muutosta. Lisäksi olemme huomioineet lakimuutoksia hieman aiempaa laajemmin.\n\nTarkennetulla mallilla arvioimme, että vuosina 2024–2025 toimeenpannut sosiaalietuuksien ja verotuksen lakimuutokset lisäisivät perustoimeentulotuen saajia noin 22 000 kotitaloudella, joissa on yhteensä noin 32 000 henkilöä. Tämän lisäksi asiakasmaksuihin ja lääkeomavastuisiin tehdyt korotukset kasvattavat toimeentulotuen käyttöä. Vuodelle 2026 esitetty toimeentulotukiuudistus sen sijaan pienentää saajamääriä. Näiden arviointi on tarkennetulla mallillakin edelleen hyvin epätarkkaa.\n\nArvioimme, että leikkaukset kasvattavat pienituloisuusasteita aiempia arvioita enemmän. Vaikutukset lasten pienituloisuusasteeseen ovat jopa kaksinkertaisia aiempiin arvioihin nähden. Uudet arviot ovat nähdäksemme aiempaa selvästi tarkempia, mutta simulointimalliin sekä sen tausta-aineistoon liittyy edelleen epätarkkuuksia.

          "authors": "Nicholas Chiavini",
          "abstract": "Albany, New York’s historic streetcar network, decommissioned in 1946, played a central role in shaping the city’s development and the vestiges of this now defunct transit system are clearly visible. While much of the literature on the legacy of streetcar networks has focused on urban form and density, fewer studies have examined their continued influence on contemporary transit ridership and policy. This research investigates whether Albany’s former streetcar corridors continue to sustain elevated transit ridership and whether current land use and transportation policies effectively leverage this historic transit legacy.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, this research combines geospatial analysis, ridership data, demographic and land use trends, and policy review. A key component was the digitization of Albany’s 1923 streetcar network in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), enabling spatial comparisons with the city’s current transit conditions. Findings show that bus stops located along former streetcar routes experience significantly higher ridership than non-streetcar stops and are characterized by higher housing density and lower car ownership rates. These results reinforce earlier studies documenting the persistence of streetcar-era development patterns, particularly the concentration of density and transit-supportive land uses along former lines, while also extending the literature by directly connecting these legacies to present-day ridership. The Capital District Transportation Authority’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines also largely align with these historic corridors, underscoring their continued importance as transit spines in the city.\n\nDespite these historic advantages, this research found that Albany’s zoning and land use regulations often fail to reinforce these corridors, permitting development patterns that undermine their transit potential. The results highlight the need for policies that integrate land use and transportation planning, ensuring that new development leverages the city’s streetcar legacy for contemporary transit success. The enduring influence of Albany’s streetcar network demonstrates how historic infrastructure continues to shape mobility patterns and offers lessons for cities seeking to strengthen transit-oriented development today.",

Decades of research link neighborhood characteristics to health and behavioral outcomes. However, these factors are often studied independently, neglecting their interrelated nature. Methods: Using Swedish population registry data, we employed latent class analyses to identify neighborhood typologies across six timepoints spanning 1991–2020. Neighborhoods, defined by Demographic Statistical Areas, were characterized by socioeconomic conditions, ethnic heterogeneity, residential instability, and urbanicity. Latent transition analyses examined changes over time. Results: Four neighborhood types emerged in the early period (1991–2000): Rural Low-Diversity (45%), Urban Professional (27%), Urban Affluent (21%), and Resource-Limited (7%). From 2001 onwards, five types were identified, with the addition of Urban High-Diversity (9%) and Rural Resource-Limited (3%). Three types, Rural Low-Diversity, Urban Professional, and Urban Affluent, persisted across 30 years, representing 87–93% of neighborhoods, with over 90% of neighborhoods retaining their classification over time. Conclusions: This multidimensional framework offers a foundation for future research, urban planning, and policy development.",

          "authors": "Sameer Meralli",
          "abstract": "The Sangiran Dome in Central Java, Indonesia, is one of the most significant paleoanthropological sites in Southeast Asia, renowned for its abundant Homo erectus fossils, which provide critical insights into early hominin dispersal and adaptation. As part of the Sangiran Formation, the site’s unique topography preserves a rich and uninterrupted sedimentary record spanning the Early to Middle Pleistocene. However, uncertainties in stratigraphic correlations, depositional environments, and geochronological frameworks have hindered a comprehensive understanding of the ecological contexts in which these hominins lived. This study aims to refine stratigraphy, clarify depositional settings, and establish a robust geochronological framework for Sangiran to better illustrate the paleoenvironmental dynamics that influenced Hominin ecology.\nThrough detailed sedimentological analysis, facies characterization, and updated geochronological methods such as radiometric dating and paleomagnetic studies, this research provides a revised stratigraphic model for the Sangiran Formation. Key findings indicate a dynamic depositional environment, with fluvial, lacustrine, and volcaniclastic systems dominating at different chronological intervals. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that Homo erectus inhabited a diverse landscape of open grasslands, wetlands, and riparian corridors. Stable isotope data and faunal assemblages further support climactic shifts in temperature and weather accompanying such diverse ecological landscapes.\nThese findings have significant implications for understanding hominin paleoecology in Sangiran. The reconstructed environments suggest that Homo erectus exploited varied habitats, demonstrating behavioral flexibility and resilience congruity in response to changing landscapes. The refined stratigraphy and geochronology also provide a more precise temporal framework for fossil occurrences, enabling better correlations with other Southeast Asian sites. Ultimately, by integrating stratigraphic, sedimentological, and chronological data, this research establishes a more complete foundational framework for further insights into hominin-environment interactions in Sangiran and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Filter bubbles and echo chambers have received global attention from scholars, media organizations, and the general public. Filter bubbles have primarily been regarded as intrinsically negative, and many studies have sought to minimize their influence. The detrimental influence of filter bubbles is well-studied. Filter bubbles may, for example, create information silos, amplify misinformation, and promote hatred and extremism. However, comparatively few studies have considered the other side of the filter bubble; its protective benefits, particularly to marginalized communities and those living in countries with low levels of press freedom. Through a review of the literature on digital safe spaces and protective filter bubbles, this commentary suggests that there may be a need to rethink the filter bubble, and it proposes several areas for future research.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Framework of Opportunity Resistance and Curvature Economics (FORCE)—a field-theoretic model for analyzing how economic behavior emerges within a dynamically evolving topography of opportunity and constraint. Rather than treating agents as isolated optimizers within equilibrium-based systems, FORCE embeds them in a fluid field shaped by resistance, influence, and differential access—where capital, policy, and social signals distort the flow of opportunity itself.\n\nBy conceptualizing emergent effort, asymmetrical opportunity, and systemic strain as geometric features of a socioeconomic field, FORCE enables new formulations of economic behavior that account for both agency and structural impedance. Constructs such as economic curvature, opportunity resistance, nexus distortion, and emergence coefficients provide a tensorial language for describing how tension accumulates and resolves across uneven social terrain.",

          "abstract": "The Mastery Rubric for Scientific Thinking (MR-ST) specifies a learnable, improvable set of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) and performance stages that support rigorous, reproducible research across disciplines and data modalities. A Mastery Rubric (MR)  is a curriculum development and evaluation tool that makes expected growth explicit by aligning KSAs to observable performance-level descriptors. MRs are developed to guide instruction, assessment, and program evaluation. Building on stewardship as a cross-disciplinary ideal and curriculum models developed for bioinformatics and for statistics/data science, the MR-ST defines eleven KSAs—ethical practice; prerequisite disciplinary knowledge; interdisciplinarity; problem definition via critical review; hypothesis generation; experimental/study design; identifying/collecting relevant data; selecting/using appropriate analytical methods; interpretation; drawing/contextualizing conclusions; and communication. Using cognitive task analysis and a guild-based developmental trajectory (Novice → Beginner → Apprentice → early Journeyman → late Journeyman), the Mastery Rubric for Scientific Thinking describes concrete, observable performance level descriptors featuring Bloom’s taxonomy and psychometric validity criteria. The MR-ST is designed to accommodate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods, and to promote rigor and integrity in every domain. The MR-ST is strongly aligned with a systematicity view of scientific knowledge, supporting curricular outcomes about research that fit a flexible, modern characterization of science and contributions made to scientific knowledge. The result is a transparent, evidence-based tool for curriculum and instructional design, including targeted and actionable assessment, and program evaluation that makes independence and stewardship in research accessible and assessable from early undergraduate study through advanced professional preparation.",

          "abstract": "Needs for security and certainty (NSC) vary in their relationship with economic preferences as a function of political engagement. Among those low in engagement, NSC is directly related to left-leaning economic preferences, since social welfare can be regarded as insurance.

Examining comparative European public opinion, we argue that this ‘reversal’ is less applicable to universal basic income (UBI), since the latter is an unconditional benefit that detaches welfare provision from specific situations of risk (e.g., unemployment insurance). This should shift individuals to think of provision in terms of moral hazard (e.g., work avoidance) in the context of UBI.

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the \"Culling Hypothesis,\" a model for understanding the rise and fall of nations' martial capacities. It posits that major wars act as a powerful selective pressure, disproportionately culling individuals possessing a \"warrior archetype\" profile (characterized by high aggression and low empathy). The hypothesis argues that this archetype is not essential for warfare but acts as a powerful accelerator, increasing a nation's capacity, efficiency, and probability of waging war. The demographic reduction of this archetype through conflict leads to two primary consequences: a diminished geopolitical capacity for external power projection and a more docile, governable domestic population (the \"Governability Corollary\"). Through comparative case studies of Post-WWII Germany, Japan, the USSR, France, and the United States, the paper demonstrates how this demographic mechanism, in a \"tug-of-war\" with cultural forces, provides a powerful and overlooked explanation for the long-term trajectories of nations. Finally, the paper extends this model to explain the recalcitrance of modern non-state actors, arguing that they represent a purified concentration of this very archetype.",

          "abstract": "In an era of heightened uncertainty and rapidly evolving competitive rules, traditional strategy theories face challenges in both theoretical advancement and practical applicability. Western dynamic competition frameworks—such as dynamic capabilities, hypercompetition, and action–response models—offer analytical tools for resource allocation, process reconfiguration, and action sequencing, yet remain limited in addressing strategic sensing, nonlinear pattern recognition, and embodied decision-making. This study proposes the Dayu-style Strategic Thinking Model (DSTM), which integrates Eastern strategic philosophy—particularly principles from The Art of War (“Know the enemy and know yourself,” “Leverage advantages,” and “Act in accordance with the situation”)—with embodied perception training from Tai Chi practice and Eastern problem-solving logic. The model constructs a closed-loop decision system encompassing intelligence, self-protection, total victory, action, and feedback. Structured as a Three-Ring Model (inner ring: The Art of War; middle ring: Tai Chi practice; outer ring: Eastern problem-solving logic) and operationalized through the Gui–Zha Decision Matrix, the DSTM enables the complementary interplay between strategic sensing (Gui) and rhythmic orchestration (Zha). The research establishes the model’s theoretical foundations and operational mechanisms, and explores its potential for human-centered and embodied strategic thinking, offering organizations a robust framework for navigating volatile and uncertain environments.\n\nNote: This English version of the Dayu-style Strategic Thinking Model (DSTM) is translated and revised based on the original Chinese version (DOI: https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5uv2_v1).

          "abstract": "Gender inequality remains a persistent barrier to development in many parts of Asia, yet the\ndomestic foundations of this inequality—particularly within family systems—are often\nneglected in global measurement tools. This study introduces the Patriarchy Index (PI), a new\nmetric constructed from census microdata to capture gendered power hierarchies in families\nacross 22 Asian and North African countries and 652 subnational administrative units.\nOf particular interest to development practitioners and scholars, the PI offers a scalable, lowcost\ntool for subnational diagnostics, especially where standard measures of gender equality are\nmissing or fail to reflect private-sphere constraints on women’s autonomy. Our study addresses\nwhether domestic arrangements—such as patterns of co-residence, marriage timing, and agebased\nauthority—can reliably capture institutionalized patriarchy, and what regional variation\nthese patterns reveal.\nUsing harmonized IPUMS-I census microdata and eleven theoretically grounded indicators, we\nconstruct a multidimensional composite index empirically validated through convergence with\nexisting gender measures, divergence from unrelated metrics, and correlation with gendered\ndevelopment outcomes. Our study finds that family-based patriarchy is spatially clustered and\nhighly variable at the subnational level. It further shows that higher PI values are significantly\nassociated with reduced relative female labor force participation, even after controlling for\nstructural variables such as gross national income and urbanization.\nThese results underscore the PI’s value as a complementary measure: it captures dimensions of\ngender inequality that remain invisible to public-facing or outcome-based indicators and helps\nbridge the gap between domestic constraints and broader patterns of disenfranchisement. In\ncontexts where legal reform and female empowerment are pursued without addressing\nhousehold-level structures, the PI offers a diagnostic that speaks directly to the architecture of\nfamily systems—illuminating where and how deeper constraints on gender equality endure.",

          "authors": "Edrian Salinas",
          "abstract": "The adjudication of elite performing arts ensembles is a complex process susceptible to a variety of perceptual and cognitive biases. In Drum Corps International (DCI), a 2019 rule change restricted on-field adjudicators to a limited zone near the front sideline, fundamentally altering their perceptual access to the performance (Drum Corps International, 2019). This study investigates the potential impact of this change by examining the relationship between a percussion section’s on-field location and its adjudicated score. Utilizing a dataset from three years of Drum Corps International Semifinals (2023-2025), a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to predict percussion scores. The model reveals that even after statistically controlling for a corps’ quality (via Semifinal Rank) and the specific judge, the time spent performing in a “sideline” zone remains a positive and statistically significant predictor of the final score (p = 0.007). This suggests a systemic, location-based bias where perceptual clarity afforded by proximity may be unconsciously translated into higher achievement scores. While yearly bivariate correlations showed a diminishing trend, the robust, controlled model confirms the persistence of this effect. These findings provide the first empirical, location-based analysis of DCI scoring in the post-2019 era, offering data-driven insights for adjudicators and designers and contributing field-based evidence to the broader literature on aesthetic judgment.",

          "abstract": "Background Health, inequality, sustainability, and economic stability are all substantially influenced by housing research; however, comprehensive, data-driven analyses are rare. The discipline is lacking in a comprehensive global bibliometric assessment, even though previous assessments have focused on narrative accounts or specific topics.\nMethods We performed a bibliometric study of 19,645 peer-reviewed publications on housing published from 1993 to 2022, sourced from Scopus. In accordance with PRISMA criteria, records were evaluated for relevance, and scient metric techniques co-word, co-citation, and co-authorship analyses were used using VOS viewer. Descriptive and network-based measures defined chronological, geographical, and thematic trends.\nResults The research identified five primary research themes: (1) affordability and inequality, (2) gentrification and displacement, (3) housing-health linkages, (4) sustainability and energy efficiency, and (5) financialization and global crises. The 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 epidemic significantly increased the prominence of sustainability and health, even though affordability and inequality were the most enduring focus issues. The United States, United Kingdom, and China were the primary contributors to global outputs, with Harvard University, Peking University, and University College London being notable institutions. The discipline remains methodologically constrained by its reliance on cross-sectional data and continues to exhibit regional bias in favor of the Global North, despite interdisciplinary growth.\nConclusions This study provides the most comprehensive bibliometric mapping of housing research to date, with a focus on essential conceptual frameworks, collaborative networks, and research deficiencies. The results underscore the necessity of comparative research in Global South contexts, the integration of health and sustainability perspectives, and methodological diversity, particularly longitudinal approaches. Housing research may more effectively guide equitable and sustainable policy solutions to global crises by addressing these deficiencies.",

Exploring how far this elasticity can go to be utilized by a political leader with anti-American ideology, and why, unlike his counterparts, he embraces entrepreneurial discourse, the present work studies the narrative of entrepreneurship in the words of Iran’s Supreme Leader and its discursive reflection in different media and attempts to theorize it by the logic of international relations. The study reveals six aspects of his politicized conception of entrepreneurship, and the extent to which written and visual media have amplified each.

Studying the success pathway of Iran’s triumphed startups (i.e., unicorns) with the theoretical lens of durable inequality and limited and open access orders, this work has revealed that Iran’s unicorns have navigated two checkpoints, namely connection and collaboration, with the extant political system. Accordingly, the success pathway beneath Iran’s entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) is identified as an inequality-producing process, called opportunity hoarding, for its cause and as its ultimate effect, the country’s social arrangement, the basic limited access order, is proposed.",

          "authors": "Caesar Edward",
          "abstract": "This paper develops a real options–based framework for modeling the dynamics of political regimes, integrating decision theory with a six-state Markov Decision Process (MDP). Political regimes are treated as strategic decision-makers holding flexible political options—such as repression, reform, policy shift, or exit—whose value evolves with volatility, entropy, and time. The core asset is the regime’s political capital, modeled as a dynamic stock S(t) subject to both gradual diffusion and sudden Poisson jumps representing exogenous shocks (e.g., coups, assassinations, natural death). Option exercise is constrained by an Action Cost Threshold X(t), the political strike price, which evolves over time and determines the cost–benefit feasibility of action.\nThe framework introduces novel visualization and diagnostic tools: Opportunity Landscapes to map option exercise probabilities over volatility and time; Valence of Power heatmaps to measure relative option value; Decision Thresholds under Uncertainty curves linking entropy and action probabilities to reveal points of strategic equivalence; and Volatility Landscapes that integrate volatility, entropy, and probability to assess stability risk. We model the Decay Time Value of Political Capital Stocks and Political Options, quantify the Time Evolution of both S(t) and X(t), and use Cost–Benefit Landscapes to jointly evaluate capital and cost trajectories. The framework also captures coercion dynamics, distinguishing between rational coercion in dysfunctional equilibria and irrational coercion in stable democracies.\nApplied to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, the model produces empirical simulations of resilience, fragility, and optimal decision timing. Results show how shifting volatility and cost thresholds shape strategic urgency, how the erosion of political capital limits future flexibility, and how leaders may miscalculate the trade-off between delaying action and securing maximum value at minimal cost. The approach offers a predictive and diagnostic tool for political survival analysis, grounded in the theory of real options but adapted to the unique contingencies of political power.",

          "abstract": "How do ministerial terminations affect presidential approval? Presidents face unexpected challenges related to stochastic events such as scandals, policy failures or economic crises. We argue that the termination of ministers who have received calls for their resignation presents an opportunity for the president to send signals to the electorate in the expectation of a corrective effect on popularity through a blame-shifting dynamic. The central argument is that this dynamic only occurs in coalition governments where political responsibility may be more easily attributed to the coalition’s different parties and factions, weakening personalisation centred on the president and facilitating blame shifting and the corrective effect. The expectation of a corrective effect on approval is tested using instrumental variables (IV) regressions applied to novel data on ministerial terminations and resignation calls in 124 governments in 12 presidential democracies. The data were gathered by combining data mining, machine learning techniques and survey marginal time series based on the dyad ratios algorithm for approval. The main findings support the expectation that individual terminations of tainted ministers generate a corrective effect of nine points on presidential approval in coalition governments, which decreases in the medium and long term.",

Intergroup Contact Theory suggests that talking across party lines can reduce polarization, yet recent studies disagree on whether confronting or avoiding political disagreement is the more effective strategy for cross-partisan conversation. We address this debate using a large-scale “integrative” experiment that systematically varies levels of disagreement and political relevance across a diverse set of topics. While some discussion topics reduced affective polarization more than others, these differences were not explained by how “political” the topics were or how much participants disagreed.

Rather than idealized models, a\ncareless definition of ”capital” appears to be the problem. We owe this careless definition\nto John Bates Clark (1847–1938). Clark introduced a new paradigm that proposed that\nland is not a separate factor of production, but only a form of capital. His theory was\na reaction to the American economist and philosopher Henry George (1839–1879) who\nsold millions of books and was exceptionally popular. George advocated a substantial\nland value tax and influenced political debate for several decades in the Anglo-Saxon\nworld and elsewhere. We sketch George’s ideas in their historical context and give an\noverview of his unappreciated impact on global scientific, political and cultural history.\nFinally, we also show George’s relevance in today’s world and provide a scientific and\nsocial critique of the Clark paradigm.",

          "abstract": "Desde hace mucho tiempo se plantean dudas sobre el origen de la información utilizada por \nel escritor español Rafael Barrett para escribir su célebre serie de artículos de 1908, Lo que \nson los yerbales, en la que explora el cruel sistema de servidumbre por deudas que \nimponían las empresas internacionales yerbateras en los inmensos bosques de Paraguay. \nVarios autores han sugerido que la principal fuente de Barrett para esta obra fue el escritor \nfrancés Julián S. Bouvier, hoy prácticamente olvidado, que residía en el sur de Paraguay y \nque, meses antes de que Barrett comenzara a publicar sobre el tema, había iniciado una \namplia e influyente campaña contra las yerbateras en periódicos de Brasil, Paraguay y \nArgentina. El presente artículo pretende analizar la naturaleza y el grado de influencia de \nBouvier y su campaña en la crónica de Barrett. En primer lugar, se examina la relación de\ncada autor con la industria yerbatera, antes de realizar un análisis textual comparativo de \nsus respectivas obras, junto con un análisis histórico contextual. Así, se demuestra que el\namplio conocimiento de primera mano de Bouvier fue crucial para la producción de Lo que \nson los yerbales. Se demuestra que Bouvier proporcionó información a Barrett de forma \nconsciente y voluntaria, ya que lo veía como un aliado y no un competidor. Por otra parte, se \nargumenta que Barrett también llevó a cabo investigaciones adicionales—principalmente \nsobre la poderosa Compañía Industrial Paraguaya—que le permitieron aportar información \noriginal sobre los crímenes de la industria yerbatera que no aparece en los textos mucho \nmás extensos de Bouvier.",

Our two orienting claims are that American\nreligion has become “unbundled” and that the boundaries of the religious field have become\nincreasingly porous. We demonstrate the value of our approach by showing how two major\nreligious traditions, Christianity and Buddhism, have become unbundled. In both cases, our\napproach positions us to apprehend a range of phenomena, including à la carte unbundled\nelements that do religion-like work; alternative quasi-religious, secular and contested bundles\nthat compete for attention and devotion with traditional religion; and traditional religious bundles\nthat adapt to fit this new de facto unbundled landscape. Lastly, we assess the implications of our\napproach for scholars of religion, for sociology as a field, and for American society writ large.",

          "abstract": "We study bias in judicial authorities' efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate immigrant offenders into society. Our empirical strategy leverages a distinctive feature of the German criminal code: the optional application of rehabilitative juvenile criminal law or punitive general criminal law for 18-20-year-old offenders, based on a subjective assessment of offenders' psychological `maturity' by judges. Drawing on complete records of 792,000 court hearings between 2009 and 2018, we show that immigrant offenders are about ten percentage points less likely to be sentenced under juvenile law compared to natives convicted for the same crime. The immigrant-native gap in rehabilitative justice correlates with anti-immigrant sentiment across space and has spiked in recent years, suggesting a link between the salience of group-based identities and judicial decision-making. Our findings raise concerns about equal legal treatment and highlight that biases in the application of rehabilitative justice may contribute to higher recidivism rates among immigrant offenders.",

          "abstract": "Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems is often discussed in terms of gender, race, or ideology; however, numerical bias—especially in pseudo-random decision-making—remains largely unexamined. This study presents a speculative yet empirically grounded thought experiment exploring the mutability of algorithmic bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon prior observations of the anomalous recurrence of the number 27 in first-interaction prompts (e.g., “Pick a number between 1 and 50”), the study proposes a conceptual shift: what if the dataset is altered such that 42 becomes the most statistically frequent numeral?\n\nThis paper introduces the notion of AI Mutation, wherein biases are not spontaneously generated by the model, but rather induced through shifts in training data distribution—thereby \"mutating\" the model's statistical priors. The transformation from a 27-dominant response regime to a simulated 42-dominant one is illustrated through comparative visualizations and theoretical modelling, reinforcing that AI does not choose—it reflects.\n\nThis phenomenon challenges the myth of objectivity in AI, positioning LLMs as dynamic mirrors of human tendencies rather than autonomous arbiters of randomness. Philosophical and ethical implications are discussed, including the dangers of over-trusting AI outputs and the necessity of algorithmic responsibility. The findings suggest that while LLMs may appear intelligent or spontaneous, their behaviour is rooted in statistical mimicry, easily redirected by human-induced mutations.",

It explores vital frictions, abrasive moments, and fiery joys that make up the everyday lives of folks with the extraordinary sensory, perceptive, and social experiences associated with autism, ADHD, Tourette's, OCD, and agoraphobia amongst others. Rather than approaching neurodiverse lives through the prism of normalcy, normativity, and difference, the chapter reflects on the reductions and limitations of neurotypicality.

          "abstract": "Climate change continues to escalate, yet the United States still sees limited legislative action due to political polarization and concerns over economic impacts. In contrast, many countries globally have taken pragmatic action, demonstrating the effectiveness of climate legislation when supported by unified political will. Prior studies of the international adoption of climate change legislation have shown that new policies have increasingly been implemented since the turn of the 21st century, with numerous factors affecting the rate of adoption. This study analyzes climate legislation adopted between 2000 and 2022 in European Union and BRICS countries to identify effective frameworks for adoption in the US. The countries were chosen to diversify the sample data by including differing economic drivers and political landscapes. Using a quantitative approach, this analysis consists of 91 multivariate linear regressions, to examine correlations between policy aspects—categorized by instrument, sector, type, and objective—and CO₂ emissions per capita. The models control for GDP per capita, population, fossil fuel percentage, and carbon pricing in order to validate comparison across countries. Findings reveal that policies involving tendering schemes, general legislative measures, low-carbon technology promotion, fuel switching, and climate adaptation are consistently associated with statistically significant reductions in emissions (p-value &lt; 0.05). The results suggest that a data-backed approach can contribute to bipartisan climate policy and highlight policy aspects which reduce emissions while supporting favorable economic outcomes. This research informs a policy proposal tailored to the US to serve as guidance for lawmakers in implementing effective climate policy measures.",

Using the empirical case of rural India, it exploits an administrative setup mimicking a natural experiment with two types of bureaucrats for the same spatial unit, the district, that either have more authority or more ability to engage in time-intensive persuasion. Utilising blocked randomisation inference and bias-corrected variance decomposition on bureaucratic postings linked to independent learning data from household surveys across ten years, it shows that only those bureaucrats with less authority but more ability to engage in persuasion impact learning. Drawing on novel interview data, it illustrates how bureaucratic leaders can increase effort levels of subordinates through persuasion to overcome collective action problems rather than relying on orders and monitoring as principal-agent frameworks would suggest. The findings illustrate that for difficult-to monitor tasks managerial intensity and persistence trumps formal authority.",

The incident occurred at approximately 03:30 on 2025-07-26 and involved a head-on collision between a Tiffany Blue Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes van; the victim driver, George Plassaras, was admitted to hospital with serious injuries; and a 23 year old female, Lanlan (Wendy) Yang, who tested positive for alcohol on a roadside screening and refused to submit to a formal breath analysis at the police station, was charged with two counts of assault and released on conditional bail, scheduled for 2025-08. She was charged with two offences and released on conditional bail, and is scheduled to appear in court on 2025-08-15 (New South Wales Police Force, 2025; Sharma, 2025); (ii) the high-profile narrative of \"astronomical bail\" and \"astronomical wealth\" lacks the support of official and authoritative media. (ii) High-profile narratives such as 'outrageous bail' and 'vast wealth' are not supported by official and authoritative media, and are unverifiable or inadmissible information, with the media reporting only on their 'enigmatic backgrounds/luxurious attire', and no evidence of verifiable assets (New South Wales Police Force, 2025; News.com.au, 2025a); (iii) The 'high profile' narratives are not supported by official and authoritative media, and are unverifiable or inadmissible information; Yap, 2025); and (iii) there are differences in the details of the injuries, but the core judgement of \"serious injuries and long term recovery\" is consistent (News.com.au, 2025b; Yahoo News Australia, 2025). In summary, in the short term, public opinion will continue to fester around 'justice/privileged imagery/cross-border narratives'; national and public security governance should anchor facts in authoritative information and curb the spread of hyperbole, with a focus on monitoring the proliferation of 'false wealth/class antagonisms' on multilingual platforms, and monitoring the spread of subsequent trial material. The State and public security governance should focus on monitoring the proliferation of 'false wealth/class antagonism' discourse across multilingual platforms, and updating it with material from subsequent court hearings in order to avoid substituting hearsay for judicial facts (New South Wales Police Force, 2025; Sharma, 2025).",

          "authors": "Lauren Hunt; Rebecca C Mitchell; Meredith Niles",
          "abstract": "Dairy farming systems, of critical economic and nutritional importance, face mounting climate-related challenges that are expected to intensify without substantial adaptation and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. In response, the U.S. dairy sector has established an ambitious goal of achieving GHG neutrality by 2050, emphasizing climate-smart strategies related to animal, manure, and land management. To track progress toward this goal and highlight pathways forward, we conducted a national-level U.S. survey of climate-smart agricultural among dairy producers, identifying patterns of use, producer perceptions, and typologies of adoption behavior. Our results represent roughly one of every 27 dairy producers in the U.S., making this study one of the most comprehensive national assessments in the dairy sector to date. While prior research has often reduced adoption to a binary outcome, we extend a multidimensional adoption framework to the dairy sector, enabling a more nuanced analysis of producers’ decision-making. Using latent class analysis, we identified five distinct adopter segments: marginal, conventional, confinement, hybrid, and integrative, based on dairy producers’ adoption patterns. Marginal adopters exhibited low engagement and high disadoption rates, while integrative adopters demonstrated the highest adoption breadth and sophistication, combining infrastructure and land-based strategies. Hybrid adopters represented a well-rounded group with the longest practice duration, especially among grazing practices. Confinement and conventional adopters prioritized controlled-environment infrastructure but showed generally little engagement with grazing or costly manure technologies. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that program engagement, perceived practice efficacy, and climate beliefs significantly differentiated adopter segments. Integrative adopters were the only group significantly more likely to attribute climate change to human causes and to engage in organic or conservation programs. Confinement and conventional adopters were more likely to perceive adaptation practices as effective for welfare and profit, while hybrid and integrative adopters viewed grazing strategies as effective across cow welfare, profit and GHG outcomes. Compared to other adopter segments, marginal adopters were more likely to prioritize profit, animal welfare, and future generations, suggesting that values may play a role in adoption differentiation. We also found that perceived adoption barriers did not necessarily limit adoption, as even highly engaged adopters reported greater capacity and informational barriers than marginal adopters. Support services could address these challenges without assuming they are prohibitive to fostering climate-smart agriculture practices. Our work offers practical insights and a more nuanced understanding of dairy producers, reflecting diverse motivations, constraints and structural conditions that shape practice adoption across the dairy sector.",

The analysis takes an empirical mixed methods approach to \ninvestigating how credibility of transgender asylum claimants is evaluated. By combining statistical \nanalysis of a dataset with ~15,000 case summaries from the Danish Refugee Appeals Board and \nresults from an original experimental study, we present three key findings. First, our study finds a rise \nin the number of claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGIE) over time, \nunderscoring the need for a better understanding of how these claims are assessed. Second, results \nfrom our experimental study indicate that transgender claimants who have had gender-affirming \nmedical intervention in their transition are more often deemed credible and granted refugee status. \nFurthermore, the experimental study observes that women and LGBT+ participants are more likely \nthan men and non-LGBT+ participants to deem a claimant’s narrative credible and grant them refugee \nstatus. These findings suggest that transnormative ideas of how a transgender claimant ‘legitimately’ \ntransitions has an effect on decision makers' credibility assessments, and that the background \ncharacteristics of the decision maker has a systematic effect on their decision-making. In the article, \nwe critically reflect on the consequences of relying on stereotypes to assess a claimant’s credibility, \nboth in terms of non-compliance with international guidelines and of risking unjust outcomes for \nasylum claimants",

We find that a) the ocean’s subjective (mean index score = 4.31,) and relational (mean = 4.02) contributions to human wellbeing outweighed material (mean =3.75; +/- 0.001) dimensions; and b) these benefits are constrained for vulnerable communities and underserved demographics due to the existence of personal (e.g., lack of interest or affordability) and knowledge (e.g., where to go and/or how to safely and legally engage) barriers. Our results highlight how structural exclusion from ocean spaces limits wellbeing for marginalized segments of society, a critical feedback loop which may perpetuate inequality and degrade public health.

          "abstract": "The European Union (EU) aims to realize the energy transition by increasing renewable energy production and enhancing the flexibility of the energy system. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, which enables electric vehicles (EVs) to both draw power from and supply power back to the grid, presents a particularly important opportunity to contribute to this goal. However, this technology faces legal and regulatory barriers in some EU Member States, including Spain. This article investigates the contribution of V2G technology to sector coupling and examines its potential participation in balancing markets, with a specific focus on the Spanish context. Balancing markets are technically well-suited for V2G participation, but Spain's current legislation presents significant barriers. While EU level regulations supporting the integration of V2G technology were introduced under the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package, Spain’s delayed or incomplete transposition of these rules into national law continues to prevent V2G from entering the Spanish electricity balancing markets. The article analyzes the key legal and regulatory factors behind this limitation, particularly the market design favoring large-scale centralized production and the absence of a legal framework for independent aggregators. Nevertheless, it concludes that recent and ongoing legislative developments in Spain offer promising signs that these obstacles may be removed in the near future. This analysis is limited to legal and regulatory aspects and does not address technical, economic, or social dimensions of V2G deployment, which are also critical to achieving full integration.",

          "abstract": "This study addresses the heightened fear of crime experienced by women, which often leads to the adoption of self-protective behaviors that can negatively impact their quality of life. Focusing on a hot-spot in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián undergoing redesign, the research is conducted in two phases: pre-intervention and post-intervention. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study employs systematic observation using the SUE tool, surveys, and Safety Walks to gather data. Findings indicate a high prevalence and frequency of fear of crime among female participants, with a significant reduction in fear observed post-intervention. Consistent with the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) framework, factors such as physical design, area activity, and user profiles are identified as key determinants of women's insecurity. Notable improvements in both the physical and social characteristics of the urban environment are evident between the two phases. The consistency of results across the three methodological tools reinforces the validity and reliability of the findings, highlighting the potential of mixed methodologies. Overall, the study suggests that urban redesign effectively reduces fear of crime among women, offering insights for urban planning and policy-making to create safer, more inclusive public spaces.",

The seven monthly presentations were led by professors and an institutional researcher who conduct research on community colleges. Example presentation topics included the history of community colleges, policy reforms in community college developmental education, and transfer receptive culture. The presentations’ primary audience was community college students. I interviewed 12 community college student attendees and then analyzed interview transcripts using structural coding and thematic analysis. Two themes were identified. The first theme was that the presentations improved most students’ perceptions of community colleges. To elaborate, the presentations destigmatized community colleges and dismantled a deficit thinking paradigm. Moreover, interviewees reported that their improved perceptions of community colleges helped with their academic engagement and social engagement at their community college. The second theme was that the presentations improved most students’ interest and ability in community college advocacy. For example, several attendees informally shared the knowledge they gained from the presentations to empower their community college peers. Furthermore, several attendees became more effective advocates within formal institutional positions such as student advisory group member, office assistant, or peer advisor. These evaluation findings align with past research that suggests that community college studies can improve learners’ perceptions and advocacy around community colleges.",

          "abstract": "This research proposes integrating real-world assets (RWAs) into a blockchain-based supply chain to address traditional challenges of transparency, inefficiency, and security. The framework supports both centralized and decentralized operations within a consortium, ensuring flexibility for diverse organizational needs. Security features include private transactions via Quorum and Hyperledger Besu clients, asymmetric encryption for app-to-app messaging, and confined nodes/services to specific environments. Scalability is achieved through multiple blockchain networks with firewall isolation, while optional cloud integrations enhance efficiency. Organizational identities are managed securely using digital certificates, and a granular block explorer ensures transparency and accountability. This integration improves efficiency, transparency, and trust in food supply chains, benefiting all stakeholders.\n\nThe proposed RWAs system in the case study is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for both centralized and decentralized consortium operations. This dual capability ensures that organizations can choose the operational structure that best suits their needs, whether controlled by a single entity or shared across multiple participants. Additionally, the system supports tiered subscriptions within a consortium, enabling diverse organizations with varying requirements to coexist harmoniously.\n\nIn conclusion, this research demonstrates how integrating real-world assets into a blockchain-based food supply chain can significantly improve efficiency, transparency, and trust. By addressing critical challenges through innovative use of technology, the proposed system offers a robust framework for modernizing food supply chains, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders from producers to consumers.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a novel measure of corporate hierarchies for over 2,500 U.S. public firms. This measure is obtained from online resumes of 16 million employees and a network estimation technique that allows us to identify hierarchical layers. Equipped with this measure, we document several facts about corporate hierarchies. Firms have on average ten hierarchical layers and a pyramidal organizational structure. More hierarchical firms have a more educated workforce, higher internal promotion rates, and longer employee tenure. Their operating performance is higher, but they face higher administrative costs. They are more active acquirers and produce more patents, but not higher-quality patents. They exhibit lower stock return volatility and more stable cash flows. We also examine how companies adjust their hierarchies in response to demand and knowledge shocks. We find that biotech companies increased their number of layers following the Covid-19 pandemic, while companies flattened their hierarchies following the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. These findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of existing models of corporate hierarchies.",

          "abstract": "Background: In 2025, during a protracted period of risk for political violence in the United States (US) and with a trend toward authoritarianism evident in the new federal administration, there is an urgent need for information on the public’s support for authoritarianism and government-initiated violence and the public’s willingness to engage in pro- or anti-government violence.\n\nMethods: Findings are from Wave 4 of a nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel. They are expressed as weighted proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with extrapolations to counts for the US adult population. \n\nResults: The completion rate was 90.0%; there were 8248 respondents. About one third of respondents agreed at least somewhat that “having a strong leader for America is more important than having a democracy” and that “having political leaders I can trust to look out for my values and interests” was more important than “having election outcomes determined democratically.” About one in four agreed at least somewhat that “we should suspend Congress for a few years so a strong leader can clean up the mess made by politicians in Washington.” \n\tA third of respondents agreed at least somewhat that “the [federal] government should use the military to help enforce its policies in the United States.” About 14% of respondents agreed at least somewhat with the use of “private armed militia groups” for that purpose. Between 14% and 20% of respondents agreed at least somewhat that the federal government should arrest ordinary people and reporters or journalists who publicly oppose or criticize “its policies or the President.” About 2% of respondents were very or completely willing to personally “use force or violence” to support or to oppose “the government’s enforcement of its policies” and against individual opponents or supporters of “government policies or the President.”\n\nConclusions: In 2025, substantial minorities of US adults endorse pro-authoritarian views. Smaller minorities endorse and are willing to participate in pro- or anti-government violence. These findings call for sustained, concerted action to preserve democracy in the United States by non-violent means.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative study examines the role of self-efficacy and self-regulation in shaping the academic experiences of students learning English as a foreign language (EFL) in online education. The primary objective is to investigate how learners’ beliefs in their capabilities and their use of self-regulatory strategies impact engagement and persistence in digital language learning environments. The study is significant in addressing how psychological factors interact with online learning dynamics—particularly in EFL contexts where learner autonomy is crucial. It further asks: How do EFL students’ self-efficacy and self-regulation influence their motivation and engagement in online language courses? Through virtual semi-structured interviews with four undergraduate EFL students enrolled in online language courses, the study examines how learners perceive their capabilities, manage their learning, and respond to the challenges of online environments. Thematic analysis revealed four key themes: confidence through past success, self-motivation and goal setting, coping with isolation and lack of structure, and help-seeking and peer comparison. Findings indicate that students with high self-efficacy are more likely to adopt effective self-regulatory strategies, which in turn promote academic engagement and persistence. The role of social presence emerged as a critical factor, mediating the impact of isolation and enhancing student motivation through peer interaction. The study also underscores the importance of task value and social connection in sustaining learner engagement. Practical recommendations are offered to help educators design online learning experiences that foster student confidence, autonomy, and success in EFL contexts.",

This study aims to determine the effects of AI tools (ChatGPT) in encouraging, engaging, and improving language skills overall for the learners. Through investigating incidents as well as issues with adopting AI, this study aims to gain valuable information on adopting ChatGPT for re-designing EFL instruction at Haql College, Saudi Arabia. The main research question is: What are the opportunities and challenges Saudi EFL lecturers face in adopting AI technologies in instructional practice? The significance of integrating AI into EFL classrooms lies in enhancing language learning outcomes, personalizing instruction, and fostering more engaging, efficient, and adaptive teaching environments. Based on qualitative thematic analysis, the impact of AI software on teachers’ practice and student achievements is examined. Semi-structured interviews of 12 Languages and Translation Department lecturers identify huge potential for AI software to supplement student learning, motivation, and language proficiency. Nevertheless, issues related to restricted technology access, insufficient professional development, and difficulties in accommodating existing courses hinder AI integration. Based on research findings, recommendations for implication to educational administrators, policymakers, and course developers are offered. These include investment in better technology infrastructure, conducting systematic professional development courses, and redeveloping courses to better integrate AI software. Upgrading technologies, providing targeted training for teachers, and reorganizing teaching materials are vital for successful AI integration. Future studies need to examine the long-term effects of AI on student achievements, assess the efficacy of professional development courses, and determine changes in courses. Resolving such challenges can make AI integration more effective, thereby enhancing teachers’ practice and student performances in EFL environments.",

          "authors": "Arab World English Journal; Afia Kanwal",
          "abstract": "Writing in English is a more conscious and less spontaneous phenomenon than speaking. However, the study examines the errors using a mixed method approach in written English as a foreign language (EFL) of Arabic speakers. Rare studies have investigated the errors committed by Arabic speakers in written English in the context of inflectional morpheme categories. The main aim of the study is to qualitatively analyze the variations in morphological features related to inflectional morphemes and quantitatively assess the associated errors in written English as a foreign language (EFL) made by Arabic speakers.This kind of study is important because it highlights which morphemes are most problematic, and how frequently these errors occur. By doing so, it equips educators with concrete, evidence-based targets for instruction, ultimately enabling them to tailor error correction leading to profeciency. To perform the study, data were collected from 430 undergraduate participants using purposive sampling based on the natural way of writing tasks. The data were analysed by examining the frequency of errors in written English. Additionally, the analyses employed Corder’s (1972) inter-language and intra-language influence error framework and Dulay’s (1982) surface strategy taxonomy. The qualitative analysis highlighted significant morphological differences between Arabic and English in the context of inflectional morphemes. Quantitatively, the results revealed that the most frequent errors occurred with the third-person singular present tense (-s) marker followed in descending order by errors related to the past tense (-ed), plural (-s), progressive (-ing), comparative (-er), superlative (-est), past participle (-en), and possessive (-‘s’) due to interlanguage influence errors in written English. The study underscores the necessity for instructional interventions tailored to address morphological differences, aiming to reduce error rates among Arabic-speaking EFL learners and enhance their proficiency in written English.",

The study aimed to determine students’ perceptions, the type of challenges met or experienced, and the overall experience regarding online academic writing instruction. The results showed a duality in students’ perceptions: on the one hand, 79% of students stated that their writing skills had benefited, and on the other hand, 64% preferred in-person lessons. The main advantages were flexibility, easy material access, and helpful teacher feedback. Nevertheless, students identified technological problems and the lack of interaction as key disadvantages of Moodle-based learning environment. The study concluded that Moodle-based writing instruction can be effective when it is supported by well-structured feedback mechanisms, synchronous learning components, and training in digital skills for both students and instructors.",

The study explores how experts and learners perceive the content, pedagogy, and usability of the module, as well as their feedback on its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement. The two-stage formative evaluation consists of a review by six experts and a walkthrough by two learners in the first stage, followed by micro-evaluations from four learners in the second stage. Data was collected using evaluation checklists with structured items and open-ended questions. The responses to the structured items were analysed based on frequency, and feedback was analysed thematically. The findings indicate that the experts and learners had a positive perception of the module’s content, pedagogy, and usability. They perceived the module as pedagogically sound, enabling knowledge construction, sharing of experiences, interaction, discussion, and self-directed learning. They perceive the module’s learning objectives, content, and lesson structure as suitable for improving speaking skills.  The module was usable in terms of its user interface, user-friendliness, and user acceptance.  They also emphasized relevant content, realistic scenarios, clear structure, and user-friendliness as strengths of the module, while reliance on the internet is considered a weakness. Suggestions for improvement include expanding content with diverse scenarios, incorporating gamification elements, revising the feedback time, and incorporating live chat or calls.  The findings provide valuable insights for language instructional designers, ESP practitioners, and mobile module developers, informing the development of ESP modules and expanding technological integration in ESP.",

However, vision loss in older adults can pose challenges in accessing printed narratives. As individuals may shift from print to auditory narratives due to age-related vision loss, understanding how this transition affects narrative engagement becomes crucial. The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as research tools, but their high resource demands raise significant environmental concerns. While LLMs offer advantages in certain applications, their high energy demands prompt a necessary question for social scientists: Is it worth considering LLMs for every text analysis task? This study systematically evaluates the trade-off between performance and energy usage across computational text analysis methods, including dictionaries, trained classifiers, and open “local” LLMs. Applying sentiment analysis, multi-class classification, and named entity recognition to political documents, we measure energy consumption, CO2 emissions, correlation with human raters, F1-Score and processing time. We find that LLMs perform well on sentiment analysis, closely matching human judgment, but at relatively high environmental costs. For classification and named entity recognition, task-specific models achieve superior accuracy and low environmental impact. Contrary to multi-purpose LLM benchmarks, larger parameter counts do not guarantee better performance on text classification tasks. Introducing a CO2 Adjusted F1-Score, we observe that smaller and more efficient models, such as Mistral-Nemo (12B), outperform larger quantized models like Deepseek-R1 (32B). Our findings highlight the necessity for thoughtful model selection, rather than defaulting to LLMs. A \"right-fit\" approach, employing task-specific, lighter methods offers performance and sustainability benefits.",

          "abstract": "In an era of heightened uncertainty and rapidly evolving competitive rules, traditional strategy theories face challenges in both theoretical advancement and practical applicability. Western dynamic competition frameworks—such as dynamic capabilities, hypercompetition, and action–response models—offer analytical tools for resource allocation, process reconfiguration, and action sequencing, yet remain limited in addressing strategic sensing, nonlinear pattern recognition, and embodied decision-making. This study proposes the Dayu-style Strategic Thinking Model (DSTM), which integrates Eastern strategic philosophy—particularly principles from The Art of War (“Know the enemy and know yourself,” “Leverage advantages,” and “Act in accordance with the situation”)—with embodied perception training from Tai Chi practice and Eastern problem-solving logic. The model constructs a closed-loop decision system encompassing intelligence, self-protection, total victory, action, and feedback. Structured as a Three-Ring Model (inner ring: The Art of War; middle ring: Tai Chi practice; outer ring: Eastern problem-solving logic) and operationalized through the Gui–Zha Decision Matrix, the DSTM enables the complementary interplay between strategic sensing (Gui) and rhythmic orchestration (Zha). The research establishes the model’s theoretical foundations and operational mechanisms, and explores its potential for human-centered and embodied strategic thinking, offering organizations a robust framework for navigating volatile and uncertain environments.",

Using topic modeling of news articles (n=521) and multimodal critical discourse\nanalysis of TikTok posts (n= 73) referencing one of their most well-known gang leader, the Kurdish\nFox, we examine how myth-building operates across different media contexts. Our findings reveal a\nstark contrast in narrative strategies: while news media frame gangs through urgency, fear, and political\ncrisis, TikTok users engage in playful, dissident humor—employing memes, emojis, and remix culture\nto subvert dominant crime discourses.",

          "abstract": "Contraception is essential for reproductive health and family planning but remains deeply intertwined with socio-economic and gender inequalities. Women disproportionately shoulder the physical, emotional, and logistical responsibilities of contraception – tasks collectively referred to as contraceptive labor. These include method selection, ensuring consistent use, managing side effects, and maintaining adherence, representing a significant yet often overlooked form of unpaid labor. Despite growing recognition of contraceptive labor as a driver of gender inequality, research has yet to systematically quantify both its burdens and returns. We introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and its returns from a female perspective. To address this gap, we introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and returns from a female perspective. Grounded in theories of gendered labor and health economics, the ContraIndex evaluates contraception across two interrelated dimensions: the burdens (labor) and benefits (returns) associated with various contraceptive methods. By facilitating cross-method comparisons, the ContraIndex provides a novel framework for examining the causes and consequences of contraceptive inequality. Its application offers actionable insights for researchers and policymakers, paving the way for strategies to reduce gendered disparities in reproductive health.",

          "authors": "Susana Mariscal; Bryan Victor",
          "abstract": "Family Resource Centers (FRCs) have the potential to function as welcoming \"third places\"-similar to public libraries-that effectively support families while avoiding the stigma often associated with formal interventions. This article explores how arts-based programming can be integrated into FRCs to strengthen family protective factors and healing through non-clinical approaches. We provide an illustrative case example, detailing how federally-funded FRCs in Indiana offered a manualized sequence of A Window Between Worlds (AWBW), a 10-week trauma-informed nonclinical arts program. Facilitated by trained community members, AWBW emphasized safety, peer connection, and creative expression. Our evaluation showed significant reduction in trauma symptoms among caregivers who completed the program to fidelity, suggesting that trauma-informed arts-based programming, specifically AWBW, can enhance resilience without professional clinical training. Ongoing implementation of nonclinical programming that can enhance protective factors and promote healing and resilience is needed to ensure family resource centers function as effective third places for proactively and holistically meeting family needs and preventing maltreatment-while also expanding opportunities for healing, connection, and collective good. To achieve this, sustained investment in local FRCs and the networks that support them is essential.",

          "title": "Complexity Theory in Sustainable Urban Development: A Systematic Review of Adaptive Governance, Computational Models, and Resilience Frameworks",
          "authors": "Mahshid Gorjian",
          "abstract": "Background The complexity of cities has been increased by urbanization, which has led to systems that are characterized by emergent behaviors, non-linear interactions, and interrelated socio-economic, environmental, and technical frameworks. These processes are frequently disregarded by conventional linear planning models, which restricts their efficacy in addressing sustainability concerns. Complexity Theory offers a conceptual and analytical framework for the understanding and regulation of urban systems as Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs).\nMethods In accordance with the PRISMA 2020 principles, this systematic literature review evaluated 91 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 1994 and 2024. The review incorporated qualitative narrative integration, theme synthesis, and bibliometric analysis. The data were obtained from Scopus through a comprehensive Boolean search that encompassed topics related to sustainability, urban development, and complexity science. The research was assessed through a multi-phase procedure, with inclusion criteria emphasizing the explicit application of complexity concepts to sustainable urban design.\nResults Five thematic domains were identified: (1) conceptualizing urban systems as complex adaptive systems, (2) employing computational methodologies such as fractal analysis and agent-based modeling, (3) establishing adaptive governance frameworks, (4) integrating sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, and (5) leveraging digital transformation within smart city frameworks. There is evidence to suggest that complexity-informed methodologies improve stakeholder engagement, adaptation, and urban resilience. Nevertheless, issues continue to exist, such as poor evaluation of trade-offs among opposing interests, regional research disparities, data limitations, and inadequate policy integration.\nConclusions Complexity Theory provides a strong foundation for resilient, integrative, and adaptable urban design. Longitudinal assessment, equity-centered applications, hybrid approaches that integrate conventional and complexity-oriented methodologies, and improved representation of under-researched areas are all necessary for bridging the divide between theory and practice. This paper offers practical suggestions for policymakers, academics, and practitioners to incorporate complexity thinking into urban sustainability efforts.",

          "abstract": "WhatsApp is one of the most influential online applications in use today. The present study examines the effectiveness of the WhatsApp-Aided Peer-Review Technique (WAPRT) in enhancing the writing abilities of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students at the University of Ha’il in Saudi Arabia. The study aims to measure the significance of improvement following the WAPRT intervention, gauge students’ entry-level writing proficiency, and assess the efficacy of the method from the viewpoint of educators. Data was gathered from 16 participants’ electronic surveys and pre- and post-test writing assignments using a quasi-experimental design. Descriptive and inferential statistics, including t-tests, revealed a statistically significant improvement in writing skills (p = .000) that supports the efficacy of WAPRT. Writing anxiety of the students was slightly reduced but was not statistically significant (p = .140). The findings recognize WAPRT as an effective tool for promoting EFL writing skills, particularly in collaborative and technology-enabled learning conditions. The study calls for the integration of positive peer-review practices within classrooms, training teachers on how to leverage WhatsApp to support writing instruction, and exploring other online spaces for the same interventions. This study contributes to the growing body of research on technology-enhanced language learning and offers practical insights for EFL teachers seeking innovative ways to enhance students’ writing. By enhancing EFL students’ writing skills, the study contributes to their academic success, employment, and overall quality of life in a technology-driven world",

          "abstract": "Mobile technology has emerged to facilitate effective learning in English as a second language education, especially in higher education. The integration of mobile technology stems from the advancement of the digital age, the fourth industrial revolution, which subsequently led to educational changes. Despite the growing interest in mobile technology, research exploration on mobile technology in English as a second language writing classrooms remains limited. This study aims to systematically review recent empirical research to answer the central question: What are the benefits and pedagogical innovations associated with mobile technology in ESL writing education? In this study, the researchers referred to the reliable framework named Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 to conduct a rigorous review of peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2024 from two of the largest academic databases: SCOPUS and ERIC. After a comprehensive and systematic inclusion and exclusion process, 11 studies were included in this review. Mobile technology demonstrated advantages in fostering a student-centered interactive environment that motivates English as a second language students through familiar technology and enables flexible learning inside and outside the classroom. Furthermore, mobile technology promotes student autonomy and peer collaboration, allowing students to control their learning and interact constructively with their peers. This study’s findings contribute to the fourth goal of Sustainable Development Goal 4, which is to ensure access to equitable and quality education for all.

          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is improving research methods in higher education worldwide, encouraging scholarly creativity and accelerating research. This article explores the use of artificial intelligence among Moroccan doctoral students in the context of PhD dissertations and article writing. It offers a new perspective not only on attitudes towards artificial intelligence but also on practices within Moroccan doctoral education. A mixed-methods approach is used to evaluate postgraduate behaviour and ethical practices related to Artificial Intelligence. Based on responses from 80 participants in a questionnaire administered to first-, second, and third-year doctoral students at Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, the study collected both quantitative and qualitative data through a combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions. For quantitative analysis, SPSS version 27 was employed, including both descriptive and inferential statistics to answer the research questions. The qualitative data were analysed thematically. Ethical considerations were prioritised, including informed consent and confidentiality measures for respondents. Results show that 76.3% of PhD students utilise artificial intelligence for thesis-related activities, such as brainstorming ideas and designing outlines, with some holding neutral views and most showing moderate agreement regarding its use. The study concludes that there is an urgent need for artificial intelligence literacy training in Moroccan universities to promote responsible use, as well as for universities to establish clear guidelines for their ethics committees.",

          "abstract": "In academic writing, paraphrasing and summarizing are essential skills that allow students to combine sources while upholding academic integrity. However, due to a lack of practice and feedback in conventional teaching, female students in the English department usually face difficulty with paraphrasing and summarization skills. This study demonstrates that if blended learning systematically integrated to academic writing instruction, it will lead to both significant statistical improvement in critical writing sub-skills and increase learner engagement and satisfaction. It tries to discover the effect of a computer-assisted blended learning approach integrating Moodle-based activities to ameliorate writing skills, including paraphrasing and summarization. It aims to: assess the impact of blended learning on paraphrasing and summarization skills, identify skill-specific improvements, and examine students’ satisfaction. The sample embraced 70 third-level female students in the Department of English/College of Education for Women/ University of Baghdad/Iraq. They were divided into two equal groups: the experimental exposed to blended learning for eight weeks using Moodle modules contained interactive paraphrasing tasks, summarization exercises, video tutorials, and peer feedback forums, while the control exposed to the conventional lectures. This study used a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design. The study implemented three instruments, firstly, pre-test and post-test for assessing paraphrasing and summarization, secondly, a scoring rubric for post-test adopted from Fremont High School (2006), thirdly, a Likert-scale questionnaire adopted from Al-Issa, H. A. (2018). The findings showed improvement in both paraphrasing and summarization. The experimental group showed their satisfaction in citing and interactive sources.

However, the mismatch between current translation pedagogy and the language industry is palpable. While artificial intelligence has emerged as a key impetus of language automation, learners’ perceptions of utilizing educational technologies in their translation learning remain underexplored. Particularly, the underlying factors of learner perceptions that significantly affect learners’ technology acceptance have yet to be thoroughly examined. This study aims to preliminarily identify the key factors influencing learner perceptions and acceptance of AI-assisted blended teaching in translation classrooms. It addresses two major issues: first, students’ perceptions of harnessing AI-assisted blended teaching in their translation learning; second, students’ current learning experiences in their compulsory translation courses. Focus group interviews were conducted with English majors enrolled in a compulsory translation course at a Chinese university. The findings provide an in-depth thematic analysis of students’ perceptions of AI-assisted blended teaching, offering insights for a customized translation pedagogy aligned with Industrial Revolution 4.0. By elucidating the learners’ perceptions of the emergence of translation competence and learner autonomy through the translation learning process, this study proffers preliminary insights on reshaping the translation pedagogy toward an AI-assisted blended teaching integration.",

This study investigates how first-year university students manage their English learning independently and explores the role of technology in supporting autonomous learning beyond the classroom. The central research question is: To what extent do first-year university students demonstrate autonomy in their English language learning processes? This inquiry is significant for educators and learners, offering insight into how digital tools can enhance learner independence and improve outcomes. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining surveys from 137 students and interviews with 14 participants. Findings show that students demonstrate moderate to high levels of autonomy, with regression analysis indicating a strong positive correlation between technology use and learner autonomy. Participants reported using digital tools for structured study, vocabulary building, academic support, and communication. Flexibility and personalization—key features of educational technology—emerged as central enablers of self-directed learning. The study concludes that technology plays a transformative role in promoting learner autonomy among Saudi English language learners.

Recently, learners’ interaction and development of their skills have been improved due to the integration of digital platforms into language education. YouTube is regarded as one of the most prevalent platforms due to its accessibility, multimodal content, and capacity to simulate real-life communication. This study tackles thirty selected research articles from various cultural and institutional backgrounds to identify the pedagogical benefits and challenges associated with using YouTube in teaching English. Conventional methods of teaching English as a foreign language encounter difficulties in improving students’ engagement and offering opportunities for real-life language use. These traditional approaches depend heavily on memorization and textbook-based instruction, limiting progress in essential language skills. This study seeks to address the following research questions: How can YouTube be effectively utilized to improve learners’ language skills? What are the key benefits of integrating YouTube into English as a Foreign Language instruction? How do cultural and educational contexts shape the implementation and results of using YouTube in English Language Teaching? The research explores YouTube’s potential in developing vocabulary, pronunciation, listening, and improving speaking abilities. Furthermore, it studies the obstacles and pedagogical considerations of incorporating YouTube in classroom settings. Several recommendations are proposed, such as incorporating YouTube as a supplementary means of teaching language, choosing relevant and high-quality video materials, promoting active learner engagement, and offering professional development opportunities to utilize multimedia effectively.",

          "abstract": "While online, information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated collaborative writing (CW) is an adopted activity in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing instruction, little research has examined students’ perceptions of peer feedback in this environment in depth. This study explores how learners metaphorically perceive peer feedback during ICT-supported collaborative essay writing activities. A total of 36 English-major students enrolled in a writing course that integrated Google Docs, Padlet, and a Learning Management System (LMS) into collaborative activities were asked to generate metaphors to describe their perceptions of the feedback they received from peers. The findings indicate that students employed a range of conceptual structures to represent their perceptions, reflecting diverse viewpoints on peer feedback in ICT-supported CW contexts. Through their metaphorical expressions, students primarily conceptualized ICT-mediated peer feedback in terms of its perceived value, specifically, its usefulness for writing tasks, the potential emotional or academic cost to recipients, and the unique mode of its delivery. The study demonstrates that metaphor analysis offers valuable insights into students’ perceptions of ICT-mediated peer feedback, particularly in understanding its transformative potential. The findings suggest the necessity of collectively integrating ICT tools into writing instruction and the urgent need to train students in giving and handling peer feedback to enhance their use of ICT in collaborative learning environments.",

Eighty-five secondary students (ages 17–19) participated in this quasi-experimental, mixed-methods study, which divided them into three groups: a control group (n = 28) and two experimental groups (n = 31 and n = 26). Writing skills assessments administered before and after the experiment showed that the experimental groups developed significantly, with a mean score increase of 16.6% for group 1 and 18.7% for group 2, which proves that DWT achieves better argumentative writing skills in students. Research showed less conclusive findings regarding the relationship between DWT and PBW because students demonstrated different styles of skill development. The research results demonstrate how digital tools can transform argumentative writing instruction while providing original insights about DWT and PBW effects in Saudi Arabian educational settings.

The treatment consisted of five intensive classes integrating feature films through structured activities divided into three parts: scaffolding, listening, and speaking. The control group, in contrast, did not receive the treatment. Findings reveal a significant improvement in the experimental group’s speaking skills compared to the control group. The p-value obtained from the t-test administered upon completion of the treatment indicates statistically significant differences in the mean scores of the two groups. The article concludes that using feature films in teaching speaking and listening is effective in developing learners’ communicative competence. It recommends adopting this approach—particularly the scaffolded activities implemented in this study—as a pedagogical tool to enhance students’ discourse management, interactive communication, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is reshaping higher education worldwide. This article explores how leading universities are responding to the integration of AI through the development of formal guidelines that promote ethical, transparent, and responsible use of platforms like ChatGPT, Bard, Copilot, and Claude. However, the uneven adoption of these technologies across institutions raises important concerns about regulatory gaps, academic integrity, and faculty preparedness. The article also examines the generational divide in digital literacy and the urgent need for faculty development programs. A focal point of the discussion is the recent launch of Grok 4 by xAI, which claims PhD-level problem-solving capabilities and introduces a multi-agent system designed to simulate advanced academic reasoning. While Grok 4 signals a potential turning point in AI-driven research and pedagogy, it also raises complex questions around model reliability, benchmark validity, and educational oversight. The article concludes by calling for stronger governance from academic bodies to ensure that the future of education remains equitable, ethical, and human-centered",
