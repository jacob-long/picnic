          "title": "A scalar mismatch: the IETF’s sustainability approaches in a framework of infinite growth and abundance",
          "authors": "Fieke Jansen",
          "abstract": "Until recently, environmental harms were largely absent from internet governance discussions and their study. This article offers an analysis of how the environmental impact of internet infrastructure is discussed in the IETF to argue that sustainability becomes a justification regime for the internet's existence and growth in a world in crisis. Taking a discard studies approach, I explore what is and what must be discarded for the internet to continue to operate. These insights allow me to expand on Liboiron concept of ‘scalar mismatch’ to illuminate that limits to growth are directly at odds with the values that have shaped the internet. The internet governance community has not come to grips with the idea that the network is an environmental problem in itself; rather, the belief in growth, abundance of natural resources, and sustainability through innovation shapes their understanding of sustainability. This paper straddles infrastructure studies, internet governance studies, and environmental social sciences, and shows how an environmental lens to infrastructure studies allows us to connect the global governance debates with local conflict over resources.",

          "authors": "Victor Guirado",
          "abstract": "The objective of this study review is to identify methodological biases in publicly available virological studies, motivated by a review and examination of early SARS-CoV-2. \nA narrative critical review of virology literature (1930-2024) has been conducted. Literature was identified through targeted keyword searches in PubMed, Scopus, Web o Science, and Google Scholar, refined by AI-assisted tools to detect recurring patterns. Studies were included if they addressed viral isolation, genome sequencing and infectivity testing. \nAfter exhaustive search and review, three recurrent methodological weaknesses were identified: Isolation frequently equated with indirect detection of genetic material rather than rigorous purification by density gradients of viral particles; Sequencing reliant on computational assemblies and references genomes, with no direct sequencing from purified particles by gradients of density; Infectivity inferred from cytopathic effects or modelling, with insufficient or incomplete negative controls. The review of the virological studies from 1930 to 2024 illustrate that these weaknesses are systematic. Contemporary virology often relies on indirect evidence. The current viral model has not been empirically verified. Thus, more rigorous isolation, sequencing from purified particles, exhaustive negative controls, and independent replication are essential to restore scientific robustness.",

Using the Scopus bibliographic database, I quantified the number of publications by US federal government authors from January 2019--July 2025. I found that the number of articles and book chapters published from January-July 2025 was 14%-19% lower than during the same time period of 2024, resulting in publication deficit of 2,638-6,489 articles. Changes in executive branch policy related to the funding and staffing of federal agencies have led to warnings of an imminent and potentially catastrophic decline in the scientific preeminence of the United States. The results presented here suggest that this decline has already been set in motion.",

          "authors": "Marius Kunna; Fanny Alexandra Dietel; Felix Würtz; Simon Edward Blackwell; Dirk Adolph; Elske Salemink; Oliver T. Wolf; Jürgen Margraf; Marcella Lydia Woud",
          "abstract": "Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation (CBM-I) is designed to alter interpretation biases (IBs) and may have potential for reducing stress reactivity in individuals with social anxiety. However, evidence for such transfer effects remains inconsistent and largely restricted to specific cognitive or self-report outcomes. Physiological responses, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and salivary cortisol, have received disproportionately limited attention in CBM-I research, despite their relevance to the social anxiety symptom spectrum. Moreover, previous studies have rarely employed comprehensive experimental designs that directly compare positive, negative, and control training conditions. To address these gaps, the present study compared the effects of three CBM-I training conditions (positive, negative, neutral) on changes in IBs and on self-reported and physiological responses to a standardized laboratory stressor (anagram task). The sample included N = 87 individuals with moderate levels of social anxiety. Results showed that CBM-I successfully modified IB in a condition-congruent direction. However, stress-related outcomes changed similarly over time across all conditions. Self-reported stress and heart rate increased, whereas heart rate variability decreased. Cortisol levels remained unchanged. These findings suggest that although CBM-I can modify IB, such changes may not readily translate into reduced acute stress reactivity. Factors such as training intensity, alignment between training and stressor, and the sensitivity of stress markers may moderate this transfer. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols and measurement approaches to better elucidate the mechanisms linking cognitive change with stress physiology.",

          "authors": "Zoe Alexandra Purcell; Jérémie Beucler; Wim De Neys; Kobe Desender",
          "abstract": "Dual-process theories posit that reasoning emerges from the interplay of fast, intuitive Type 1 processes and slower, deliberative Type 2 processes, regulated by metacognitive control. Yet despite their influence, these frameworks remain largely verbal and underspecified, limiting their capacity for falsifiable predictions. Here, we introduce a set of computational models that formalise key dual-process assumptions within an evidence-accumulation framework. Each model instantiates distinct mechanisms of working memory, inhibition, and confidence-based regulation and is evaluated against data from two-response bat-and-ball reasoning tasks. Six model variants—ranging from single-process “default” to confidence-regulated architectures—were compared using indices of accuracy, response time, and confidence. All models reproduced core reasoning signatures, but even the simplest captured many qualitative patterns, revealing that common verbal assumptions can be implemented by multiple mechanistic architectures. These findings underscore that while dual-process theories capture essential intuitions about intuitive–analytic dynamics, they remain underdetermined without formal specification. Computational modelling provides the necessary precision to advance dual-process theory from a descriptive dichotomy toward mechanistic explanation.",

          "authors": "Noham Wolpe; Daniel Scott; Mordechai L. Salomon; Matt R. Nassar; Paul Fletcher; Emilio Fernandez-Egea",
          "abstract": "People constantly decide how much time to invest in more versus less rewarding activities. Foraging tasks, during which participants visit contexts with diminishing reward rates, examine this type of decision-making by measuring when individuals choose to switch contexts. It is widely known that humans and other animals perform suboptimally in these tasks. However, the precise nature of this suboptimality, and its links to other behaviourally relevant traits, remain unclear. Here, we developed a foraging task to disambiguate the impacts of initial reward rates and reward rate changes. We investigated how foraging behaviour differs with age and relates to apathy and depression, which are key factors known to influence reward-based decision-making, while controlling for cognitive factors. In addition to overstaying, we found that participants performed more suboptimally as reward decay rate increased, and that many participants expressed a heuristic preference for staying in the single best condition. Moreover, overstaying was strongly associated with higher scaling of stay durations to each condition, and this overstaying/scaling behaviour was positively associated with age but negatively associated with depressive symptoms. No associations were found between foraging behaviour and apathy. Together, our results suggest that people may counterproductively interpret staying in a patch as persistence in reward extraction, which would explain the tight link between overstaying but high sensitivity to reward conditions, and their association with depressive symptoms.",

          "authors": "Noémi Szeberényi; Judit Gervain; Jessica Gemignani",
          "abstract": "Significance: Language acquisition is a complex process already influenced by prenatal neural development and auditory experiences. From the third trimester fetuses perceive sounds already influencing the fetal brain. \nAim: The study investigates how the length of intrauterine language exposure, indexed by gestational age (GA), and overall maturation, indexed by birth weight (BW), affect newborns’ brain activations to linguistic stimuli.\nApproach: Data from 14 near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies testing responses to different auditory sound patterns in 192 1-4-day-old newborns were pooled together and analyzed to assess the impact of GA and BW on changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR).\nResults: Results showed that, for HbO, activations in both considered conditions were larger in the Temporal than in the Frontal areas, irrespective of BW or GA. For HbR, increased BW led to more positive, thus less strong, activations in the frontal and more negative, thus stronger, activations in the temporal regions of the left hemisphere, while in the right hemisphere the opposite pattern was observed. Besides, when considering effect sizes reflecting discrimination abilities, these were more strongly associated with BW in the frontal regions, while in the temporal regions they were more strongly associated to GA. Critically, HbR was overall more strongly correlated with prenatal experience and maturation than HbO, challenging the exclusive use of HbO in newborn studies.\nConclusions: The findings suggest a differential impact of BW and GA on brain activations, reflecting their roles in biological maturation and auditory discrimination, respectively. Overall, the study suggests that both the length of prenatal experience and maturation play significant roles in shaping newborns’ hemodynamic responses.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey N. Rouder; Mahbod Mehrvarz; Niek Stevenson",
          "abstract": "Although factor models have been pivotal in understanding the relations among variables, they are difficult to apply to data from experimental designs. In experiments, data are from trials which are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals. Data at the trial level is quite noisy, so much so that even averages on critical contrasts are subject to excessive measurement error. In this paper, we develop hierarchical factor models where the first level are linear models that account for trial noise and are parameterized with separate, latent individual-by-task scores. The second level consists of factor models on latent individual-by-task scores. Because the model is hierarchical, Bayesian analysis is convenient and conceptually straightforward. We provide development with good computational properties. The advatages of the model are that (a) correlations across tasks may be both disattenuated and localized fairly precisely; (b) uncertainty from both variability in individuals and across trials may be accurately assessed; and (c) factor structures may be recovered even in high-measurement-error contexts. Applications to visual illusions and to cognitive control are included.",

          "abstract": "Measuring the processes that influence eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—is essential for understanding and fostering it effectively in applied contexts.  Using the Situated Assessment Method, we conducted a pre-registered study where 251 UK adults judged their eustress across 20 previously evaluated real-life challenging situations (e.g., “Give a public speech in front of a large audience”), along with nine influential processes (e.g., coping, fulfilment) taken from the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE).  Participants also completed trait-level measures for eustress, distress, and stress mindsets.  We observed reliable individual differences, substantial situation effects, and large individual-situation interactions in eustress judgments.  The nine influential processes correlated strongly with situated eustress, explaining a median variance of 83% in individual-level regressions.  Individual measures of eustress, averaged across situations, correlated with trait eustress and stress-is-enhancing mindsets but were unrelated to trait distress.  Exploratory factor analyses on situational and trait-level processes revealed a dominant general factor that strongly correlated with individuals’ eustress judgments.  Our findings align with existing theories of stress, contrast different types of eustress measurement, and provide rich descriptive profiles for personalized and context-sensitive interventions to foster eustress when desirable.",

There is a critical need to appraise the evidence supporting these programs, particularly whether they benefit students in crisis intervention and prevention. This need is particularly urgent given documented misapplication and overuse of physical restraint, which is a common component of these programs. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the research in support of crisis management programs that target PK-12 students with disabilities who display challenging behavior in educational settings. We conducted database searches, ancestral searches, and website searches of organizations that produce crisis management programs to identify published and unpublished studies evaluating the programs. Our search process yielded just six studies evaluating five of 23 commercially available crisis management programs. Given the scarcity of supporting studies, none of the programs meet currently established thresholds for evidence-based practice in special education. Our review identifies a critical need for rigorous research on these programs to inform practice and policy, ensuring student safety and wellbeing. Consumers should exercise caution in adopting these programs based on claims made by the programs’ producers.",

          "abstract": "Across domains, more effort tends to beget better performance. This points towards effort-performance coupling as a domain-general phenomenon. However, across literatures, effort-performance relationships seem to be less straightforward than they initially appear, highlighting instances under which effort and performance can become decoupled. Here, we review four broad factors that contribute to apparent decoupling: (1) system limits, (2) inefficiency and noise, (3) measurement mismatches, and (4) motivational misdirection. We show how these factors can underlie instances of concurrent decoupling (real-time) and prospective decoupling (over time) in the cognitive, as well as in the physical domain. By framing these factors ontologically as structural, stochastic, epistemic, and psychological sources of decoupling, we identify commonalities in effort-performance relationships across research fields. We highlight how they can account for apparent non-linearities, trade-offs, and plateaus in the effort-performance relationship. This perspective can serve as a transdisciplinary agenda for studying effort–performance dynamics, helping researchers and practitioners to better understand effort-performance (de)coupling.",

          "abstract": "According to canonical normative theories in philosophy, moral transgressions–like lying–are equally wrong regardless of whom they help or harm. In contrast, recent research suggests that people use social identity cues to make moral judgments and decisions. This paper examines the possibility that people misreport factual information to benefit the in-group and harm the out-group. Across three experiments, we gave U.S. Democrat and Republican voters (N=5,230) a chance to lie anonymously to double their own or another participant’s earnings. For selfish dishonesty (Experiment 1), people lied equally to benefit themselves regardless of whether it harmed an in-group or out-group member. For coalitional dishonesty (Experiment 2), however, people lied significantly more to benefit in-group than out-group members (9 percentage-points), despite not personally benefiting from lying. Experiment 3 successfully replicated these findings, and revealed that people overestimated out-group dishonesty more than in-group dishonesty. In conclusion, intergroup coalitional dishonesty drives moral decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Children are remarkably efficient learners compared to our most advanced computational models of learning. One key difference is that children seem to leverage regularities in the activities (e.g., eating) in which they participate to learn about words or objects (e.g., “pomegranate”), even under skewed, long-tailed distributions. While everyday activities have long been theorized to be important as supports for children’s learning, our understanding of the types, frequencies, and rhythms of these activities has been out of reach due to both a lack of naturalistic video datasets and the necessity for manual annotations. Here, we use the recent release of a large, egocentric dataset of children’s everyday experience (BabyView) (N=31 children, N=868 hours) and capitalize on innovations in video question-answering (VideoQA) models to quantify the what and where of children’s everyday experiences. Using these models, we classify both the activities (e.g., eating, dancing, exploring) and physical locations (e.g., living room, garage) in the infant view and generate natural-language descriptions for contiguous 10-second videos across the entire dataset. Notably, we find that (a) some activities and locations occur much more frequently than others, yet (b) there is wide variation across children. Moreover, (c) activities and locations exhibit structured transition probabilities (e.g., cooking often precedes eating), and (d) may decompose into distinct sub-clusters (e.g., different subtypes of reading). Compared with prior work analyzing static image content, our work highlights the advances possible by using VideoQA models to analyze the dynamic nature of children’s experiences. Our results provide a better understanding of children’s learning input in everyday contexts, informing developmentally-inspired models of early learning and cognitive development.",

          "authors": "Miriam Remshard; Matthew H. Goldberg; Vanessa Ilori; Anthony Leiserowitz; Sander van der Linden",
          "abstract": "Despite growing concern about climate change, current action remains insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Psychological research finds that publics often overestimate the effectiveness of low-impact individual climate actions (e.g., recycling) and underestimate high-impact behaviours (e.g., flying less). However, the prevalence of these misjudgements among climate-concerned individuals and their connection to behaviour remain unclear. Developing this understanding is crucial, as such misperceptions could cause motivated individuals to prioritize low-impact climate actions over high-impact behaviours, limiting societal potential to mitigate climate change. Using one study in the UK (N = 294) and two studies in the USA (N = 790 and N = 406), we find that even climate-concerned individuals systematically overestimate the impacts of low-impact actions and underestimate high-impact actions, with consistently moderate to large effect sizes across all behaviours examined. We also find an association between perceived impact of climate actions and behavioural engagement, suggesting that such misperceptions hinder efforts to reduce climate change. We explore several explanations for these misperceptions. We find that most of the dominant causes proposed in the literature do not explain participants’ misperceptions of impact. We do, however, find some evidence suggesting that misinformation about specific behaviours, false conceptualisations of the causes of climate change, familiarity with pro-climate behaviours, and the perception that climate action is driven by self-serving intentions are related to misperceptions of the impacts of climate actions among those most concerned about climate change.",

          "abstract": "Everyday stressor exposure is a dynamic, high-risk event that increases the likelihood of smoking lapses. Stressor diversity quantifies between-person differences in how everyday stressors are dispersed across multiple domains (e.g., financial stressors, health stressors). There are two competing perspectives on the implications of stressor diversity for how affect and behavior respond to stressor exposure (i.e., stressor reactivity). A chronicity of stressor perspective predicts that low stressor diversity would be associated with higher stressor reactivity. By contrast, an uncertainty of stressor perspective predicts that high stressor diversity would be associated with higher stressor reactivity. Using ecological momentary assessment data in 171 individuals who smoke cigarettes daily (mean age = 49.43, SD = 11.22; 59.6% women; 64.3% Black/African American), we tested the extent to which stressor diversity moderated the within-person associations between stressor exposure and negative affect, craving, and smoking. Results indicated that stressor-reactivity was greater for those with higher levels of stressor diversity. These findings support the uncertainty of stressors perspective on stressor diversity, suggesting that individuals with higher stressor diversity will have greater stressor-reactivity and struggle to proactively cope with stressors because of the unpredictable nature about which stressor will emerge next.",

Drawing on longitudinal data (n = 222) collected in the US at eight time periods over the first eight years of life, we present a snapshot of the intergenerational evolved nest: a model of species-normal childhood experiences and wellbeing across two generations. Maternal early life experiences of nested care were associated with equivalent experiences for their children from age four to six, as well as multiple measures of maternal wellbeing, including attachment, depression, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and stress. Maternal wellbeing correlated with child wellbeing and evolved nest experience. Child evolved nest experience was linked with lower anxiety and greater social engagement from age four to eight. Our findings highlight the critical importance of providing nested care for the wellbeing of today’s children, who are tomorrow’s parents, and therefore the potential long-term benefits of the intergenerational evolved nest.",

The challenge of AI alignment is thus an interdisciplinary one that involves not only a technical challenge for computer science but one with important ties to the psychology of moral values, decision-making, and trust. Early work identified a static set of universal values, without considering the key questions of to whom and to which values AI should be aligned. This perspective paper challenges the notion of universal alignment and instead argues for dynamic, context-specific alignability across different domains, tasks, and users. Specifically, we emphasize the need to go beyond traditional pluralism and rethink how AI alignment can be achieved through a qualitative and quantitative research process that involves identifying context-specific values, developing alignable AI algorithms using limited human feedback, and evaluating alignment through assessing both an AI’s values and actions, while considering how humans trust and delegate to the AI. We discuss several paths forward for our proposed framework, including the potential ethical and societal implications of context-specific alignability, and draw on examples ranging from chatbots to value-aligned decision-making in the medical triage domain.",

          "abstract": "The present research tested whether a behavioral challenge intervention could facilitate the volitional development of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills, and whether changes in perceived skills were linked with positive life outcomes. A total of 470 young adults participated in a 16-week intervention, in which they (a) identified the SEB skills that they would most like to change, (b) set weekly behavioral challenge goals designed to practice those skills, and (c) evaluated their success in pursuing each challenge goal. Results suggest that the intervention promoted development of four major skill domains: self-management, social engagement, emotional resilience, and innovation skills. Moreover, gains in perceived skills during the intervention were linked with positive changes in outcomes including social relationships, academic and civic engagement, health, and well-being. These findings provide initial support for a low-cost, highly scalable intervention for promoting skill development.",

          "abstract": "This paper offers the first large-scale evaluation of whether school-level educational approaches that cultivate normative individual differences (i.e., virtues) are associate with academic progression. Using the most comprehensive longitudinal dataset available from the Department for Education, Study 1 analysed over 3,000 English secondary schools and three million pupils annually (2016–2024). Progress 8, the government’s value-added measure of GCSE attainment, provides a stringent test by controlling for prior ability and sociocultural background. Schools accredited with the Association for Character Education’s Quality Mark (QM) or Quality Mark Plus (QM+) consistently achieved higher Progress 8 scores, with QM+ schools in several years gaining more than half a GCSE grade per pupil averaged across subjects. Study 2 complements these findings through a national survey of QM and QM+ schools, illuminating perceived mechanisms linking character education to learning and wellbeing. The findings demonstrate robust, policy-relevant evidence that character education may meaningfully enhance academic development.",

While children use knowledge of routines to retrospectively estimate event times, little is known about how structured temporal knowledge forms initially and develops. Here, a representative community sample aged 7–25 years (n=104) completed a memory task in which they could infer event times from temporal cues that varied across learning repetitions by linking and updating information across experiences. We found that while adults precisely located events in time through inference, younger participants’ temporal estimates were biased toward average times, particularly when temporal cues were more variable.

          "abstract": "Mental health and wellbeing are core components of a healthy life. However, emotional stress and mental health problems are on the rise through societies and cause a significant burden of suffering. In the following, we present our watershed framework for optimizing wellbeing and mental health through lifestyle interventions. Emerging evidence also shows that mental health is not only a determinant of quality of life but a powerful driver of longevity, influencing biological aging processes, disease vulnerability, and overall healthspan. This framework is based on the recognition that mental health is comprised of biological, psychological, and social factors, and that the factors have interdependent relationships amongst them, so that positive changes in one of them can have cascading effects on the others, with the potential to improve the psychological capital of an individual. Our framework consists on nine elements that we consider as hallmarks of mental health and wellbeing, and these hallmarks are structured in three interdependent layers. The first layer is formed by foundational factors which are fundamental for wellbeing and mental health, and include circadian rhythms; sleep recovery along with social connections. The second layer is named wellbeing catalysts and includes elements of wellbeing that can have powerful positive effects on mental health, and include stress resilience, vitality, cardiovascular health, immune health, and the gut-brain axis. The third layer is named as thriving factors and it consists of cognitive performance and positive emotions, which are the elements that are most often associated with a thriving mind. In our framework, we highlight the interactions between the factors and we provide a roadmap to structure comprehensive lifestyle interventions aimed at boosting mental health and wellbeing. Strengthening mental health and wellbeing addresses key biological and behavioral determinants of healthy aging, which are increasingly recognized as critical modulators of longevity trajectories.",

Although CBM-I has shown promise, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear and integration with psychophysiological and neural measures has been limited.\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, eighty-eight participants with high levels of social anxiety completed two lab sessions, an online training in between, and online follow-up. Participants filled out questionnaires, completed interpretation bias tasks, and underwent neuro-psychophysiological assessments. Active CBM-I trained positive resolutions of ambiguous social scenarios, while the sham version used neutral scenarios.\nThe primary outcome, i.e., scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), decreased across time in both groups, without group differences. The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation decreased only in the active group. Interpretation bias shifted more strongly toward positive outcomes in the active group. Autonomic measures confirmed sensitivity to stress induction but did not differentiate between conditions. Electrophysiological results paralleled subjective ratings, as participants exhibited ambivalent responses to socially relevant stimuli but clearly differentiated responses toward neutral stimuli. Baseline correlations indicated strong convergence across self-report and interpretation tasks. Mediation analyses showed that reductions in negative interpretations mediated the effect of the training group on LSAS scores at follow-up.\nThese findings identify interpretation bias as a modifiable mechanism underlying social anxiety and underscore its role as a transdiagnostic marker. Targeting interpretation bias through easily accessible and applicable online interventions may strengthen preventive and therapeutic approaches for social anxiety and related disorders.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal (CR) is one of the most widely studied emotion regulation strategies and is considered central to psychological well-being. Given its protective role in mental health, a growing body of research has examined factors that influence the effectiveness of CR. However, prior studies have been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, typically relying on artificial or experimentally induced stressors, which may limit ecological validity of the findings. The present study aimed to address this gap by investigating CR in the context of real-world stressors. We recruited 100 young adults who used a mobile application, ReApp, to record their daily stressors and practice CR three times per day, over a three-week period. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of CR is highly context-dependent, and certain aspects may be more relevant and contributing to CR effectiveness than the other. Specifically, higher positive affect and greater stressor severity were associated with more effective CR. By contrast, higher negative affect and lower reappraisal affordance predicted reduced CR effectiveness. We provide the first evidence that CR effectiveness varies across stressor domains, suggesting it may be better suited to some types of real-world stressors (i.e., health-related stressors) than others (i.e., lack of resources). In contrast, neither subjective stress nor the time spent on generating reappraisals influenced CR effectiveness. Being the first outside-laboratory study examining contextual factors contributing to CR effectiveness, these results carry clinical implications, suggesting that CR trainings may be optimized by adjusting practice to specific contextual factors, and warrant the need for further research.",

          "abstract": "A variety of difficult situations can elicit stress responses, yet little research has systematically characterized the features that make situations threatening and challenging.  In a pre-registered study, we developed a normed set of situations and established features associated with threat and challenge.  Using an open-source large language model (LLM), we first generated 20 situations that represent common stressors for UK adults (e.g., “Give a public speech in front of a large audience”).  We then asked 81 UK adults to evaluate each situation on dimensions of threat, challenge and eight theory-derived features (e.g., intrinsic difficulty), aggregating their judgments into a 10-dimensional feature profile for each situation.  We also tested whether an open-source LLM could reproduce human feature profiles and feature relationships.  In the human data, we observed highly reliable feature profiles for the situations that exhibited low threat and moderate challenge overall, while varying reasonably.  The eight features were surprisingly similar in how they correlated with threat and challenge (as opposed to exhibiting inverse patterns), explaining high variance in each.  Unsupervised clustering identified four coherent groups of situations that illustrate different ways threat and challenge can manifest in daily life.  Although LLM judgments approximated human judgments at the aggregate level, their accuracy varied substantially across situations and measures such that LLM judgments failed to capture structural relationships observed in the human data.  These findings advance our understanding of situational features underlying threat and challenge, while illustrating the potential and current limitations of LLMs as tools for psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Person-environment fit has been a subject of interest in personality psychology. In recent years, remote work has emerged as important workplace environment. This study examines the association between remote vs. in-person work and well-being, and how personality, age, and other socio-demographic factors moderate these associations. Over one month, 560 participants, who engage in both remote and in-person work, completed a daily diary. Using multi-level models, we examined intra-individual well-being differences between home and workplace days. Participants reported better mood, but greater loneliness on home-office vs. workplace days, while satisfaction levels were similar. HEXACO traits and socio-demographics accounted for some individual differences in well-being. Higher emotionality amplified loneliness on home-office days compared to workplace days. Age did not moderate well-being differences. Overall, findings indicate that work environments (remote vs. office) are related to within-individual well-being differences. Personality traits and socio-demographic characteristics, aside from living with children and working hours, played a limited role. These results suggest that well-being differences across working locations are generalizable across a large age range, different personality characteristics, and socio-demographic groups.",

This negative perception of VET could lead to a number of emotional problems in \n2\nstudents in these schools, including higher anxiety, and lower wellbeing and self-esteem. The \ncurrent study applied network analysis to map the complex links among various anxiety-related \ntraits in four large samples of VET students, thereby identifying targets for potential educational \ninterventions. \nMethods: 28 questionnaires tapping into anxiety-related psychological constructs, such as self￾esteem, parental beliefs and school adaptation, were completed by 4 groups of VET students aged \nfrom 15 to over 20 (mode: 16).

          "abstract": "Recent research has aimed both to disentangle the cognitive mechanisms that support learning—particularly the roles of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM)—and to characterize the dynamic processes that govern decision-making during learning. These two endeavors were integrated with the reinforcement learning working memory Linear Ballistic Accumulator (RLWM-LBA) model. \nThe RLWM-LBA offers a unified framework to investigate how RL and WM contribute to learning and how these processes unfold over time to shape choice behavior. Specifically, it remains unclear whether neural processes of evidence accumulation identified in perceptual decision-making are also present in learning and how such a process is associated with RL and WM. \nTo address these questions, we analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from 510 participants performing a stimulus-response association task. Using a Bayesian hierarchical RLWM-LBA model combined with event-related potential (ERP) analyses, we explored whether neural signatures of RL and WM persist when captured with RLWM-LBA model and whether a neural signal of evidence accumulation, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), could be identified within this learning context.\nOur findings confirm previous reports by identifying distinct neural correlates for RL and WM. Importantly, we demonstrate a neural signature corresponding to internal uncertainty about learned action policies that closely resembles CPP signals documented in perceptual and preference-based decisions. These results provide robust evidence that the neural dynamics of decision-making during learning adhere to established evidence accumulation mechanisms and highlight how RL and WM processes dynamically shape learning and choice behavior.",

          "abstract": "Facial trustworthiness impressions influence important social decisions, including economic choices, decisions to hire and criminal justice outcomes. Most research has focused on the face attributes associated with various impressions, implicitly regarding these impressions as stable over time. However, our perception is dynamically shaped by past visual experience through two opposite serial effects: negative aftereffects (bias away from the past) and serial dependence (bias towards the past). Here, we investigated how first impressions of trustworthiness are biased by our past visual experience.  Specifically, we tested how basic stimulus properties such as exposure duration to previous face, feature similarity, and spatial proximity to previous faces determine the direction and strength of the biases. \nWe found that (1) exposure duration determined the direction of the bias with negative aftereffects following prolonged adaptor exposure and (positive) serial dependence after brief adaptor exposure. Furthermore, (2) increased identity similarity between previous and current faces enhanced attractive biases, whereas different identities led to repulsion. Finally, (3) relative spatial distance in world-centre coordinates between adaptor and test faces modulated the strength of serial dependence but not negative aftereffects. \nOur paradigm enabled us to provide evidence for, and to dissociate, attractive and repulsive serial biases in trustworthiness impressions. Our findings demonstrate the specific conditions under which these impressions can be dynamically shaped by past experience, depending on time, space, and feature similarity. Importantly, the fact that serial effects are determined by basic stimulus properties of time, space, and feature similarity indicates that these biases cannot be entirely explained by high-level factors such as decision or memory.",

          "abstract": "Psychological assessments play a significant role in both clinical decision-making and the interpretation of research findings, with the quality of these inferences depending on the validity of the measures used. Recent evidence suggests there are gender differences in the presentation of autism, raising concerns about the validity of existing autism tools to measure autistic traits in women and the subsequent implications for clinical inferences and research. This study explored the perspectives of autistic women on the relevance of existing autism questionnaires to their lived experience, alongside additional input from gender-diverse individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB). Through interviews, focus groups, and online surveys, 22 autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals shared their experiences using and perspectives on the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10, 14-item Ritvo Autism &amp; Asperger Diagnostic Scale, and Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire. The interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, identifying two overarching themes: (1) questionnaires measure only one way to be autistic, and not in an autism-friendly manner, and (2) enhancing questionnaires’ relevance for autistic women and individuals socialised as female: key missing experiences to include. The findings suggest that some of the most frequently used autism measures may not fully capture the experiences of autistic women and AFAB gender diverse individuals. Significant gaps were identified, indicating that important aspects of the participants’ lived experiences were missing. Furthermore, concerns were raised about the questionnaires’ lack of relevance to the autistic population as a whole. The findings underscore the non-satisfactory content validity of these tools for measuring autism in autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals. This highlights the need for their refinement to better reflect contemporary understandings of different presentations of autistic traits, particularly the impact of gendered experiences, in a way that avoids the introduction of possible new biases and remains relevant and accessible to autistic individuals.",

During the FLCP, participants completed a modified auditory n-back task every 10 minutes and were concurrently required to avoid obstacles in the OBS condition.\nResults When corrected for movement speed, participants on average failed to avoid between 5.3% and 8.1% of obstacles over the 210s period. Concurrently, during the OBS condition, a reduction in working memory performance of 7.0-15.1% was observed across the FLCP (p &lt; 0.001, ω² = 0.207). On average, the OBS condition elicited greater Rating Scale of Mental Effort scores than the CON condition (p=0.019, ω2 = 0.155).\nConclusion We have demonstrated how dual-tasking can lead to significant and less favourable changes in performance parameters (decreased auditory working memory performance, obstacles hit, increase in mental effort, and likely increase in physical workrate).\nApplication We encourage researchers and practitioners to consider representative design when translating research to practice. Personnel within physically demanding occupations should consider ways to minimise dual-tasking within their roles or mitigation strategies to maintain cognitive performance.",

Results illustrated how enacted stigma as well as internalisation of stigma and hegemonic femininity contributed to participants’ sense of anticipated stigma, which inhibited their ability to communicate openly about menstruation outside of close informal support networks. Stigma experiences eroded participants’ trust in healthcare providers, and resulted in self-censorship in conversations about menstruation more broadly.

The school and neighbourhood contexts may be important for adolescent substance use. Identifying contexts and factors associated with substance use among adolescents is therefore a public health priority.\n\nMethods: We investigated current vaping, smoking, alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use, in 30,920 adolescents aged 12-15 attending 100 schools and living across 1,539 neighbourhoods in South-East England. Cross-classified multi-level models were used to evaluate the relative importance of school and neighbourhood contexts, before investigating determinants of substance use. Previous (more than 30 days ago) use was assessed in sensitivity analyses.\n\nResults: The school-only context yielded the best model fit and predicted the most variance across substances (ICC range 6% to 8.4%). Several patterns pertaining to inequalities in substance use emerged (e.g., increased age associated with amplified odds of any substance use, particularly illicit drugs, although the magnitude and direction of associations varied by substance and subgroup. Findings emphasised the importance of peer relationships (e.g., peer pressure, bullying) and coping motives (e.g., internalising symptoms) as potential risk factors for vaping, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Strong parental and teacher relationships and school-based factors (e.g., strong sense of school belonging), were protective against all substances. \n\nConclusion: Differences between schools matter more than differences between neighbourhoods for adolescent substance use, and indeed, neighbourhood-only models likely overestimate the importance of this developmental context.

          "abstract": "The built environment shapes physical and mental health. In this paper we use the term mental health as an overarching construct, defined here as encompassing both cognitive performance and affective wellbeing, explored in relation to environmental factors. Evidence across neuroscience, psychology, physiology, and public health shows that spatial properties of our environment can modulate stress physiology, affect, attention, memory, and social cognition. Yet, no standardised instrument translates these multisensory dynamics into measures that quantify environmental qualities, enabling linking them to context-specific outcomes. Certification schemes (e.g., WELL, LEED, BREEAM) have advanced practice, but do not directly measure how specific spatial or contextual features impact psychology or physiology. Here, we introduce the NeuroDesign/NeuroArchitecture Index (NDIX), a theoretically grounded framework for evaluating how the built environment impacts mental health. The NDIX operationalises six domains; safety and accessibility, cognitive capacity, offering possibilities for sensory experiences, emotional states, social experiences, and naturalness. It integrates a domain-referenced self-report of user experience with standardised profiling of environmental features, generating domain specific and overall percentage scores for research and practice. The first pilot in a controlled indoor environment showed feasibility and theory-consistent sensitivity, providing initial support for the NDIX framework. Future research will extend validation across office, educational, and urban contexts and incorporate biomarkers (e.g. from wearables, neuroimaging).",

          "abstract": "Spatial navigation involves integrating multiple spatial cues, yet the role of feedback in this process remains poorly understood. We examined how corrective feedback affects spatial navigation using landmarks and self-motion cues. Participants performed a spatial localization task under four conditions: landmark-only, self-motion-only, combination (both cues available), and conflict (cues incongruent). Behaviorally, feedback in single-cue conditions reduced response bias and decreased the weight assigned to landmarks, without affecting response variability. Feedback in the combination condition reduced response bias in that condition but induced no other changes. Cognitive modeling revealed that feedback in single-cue conditions reduced sensory biases, which, however, did not translate to greater cue integration. This feedback also reduced the weight assigned to landmarks in different-cause judgments, aligning cue weighting with the maximum-likelihood-estimation principle. This adjustment was accompanied by altered subjective evaluation of cue reliability. Collectively, our findings suggest that rather than enhancing sensory precision or cue integration, corrective feedback shapes spatial cue integration through recalibration mechanisms at multiple levels: aligning perceived spatial location with the true target to reduce sensory bias and adjusting the perception of cue reliability to optimize cue weighting. These findings have broader implications for understanding feedback-driven changes in perceptual and cognitive processes.",

This study introduces an embodied imagery strategy, which encourages learners to simulate poets' emotional and mental states, and examines its effectiveness for improving middle school students' classical poetry learning outcomes. Experiment 1 compared the effects of embodied imagery, general imagery, and free learning strategies on poetry learning. Experiment 2 investigated whether instructional scaffolding (visual imagery versus background information) could enhance the effectiveness of embodied imagery. Experiment 3 involved a 10-week intervention using embodied imagery in authentic classroom settings. Results indicated that: (a) embodied imagery significantly improved students’ poetry learning outcomes—particularly their emotional interpretation—compared to general imagery and free learning conditions; (b) visual imagery scaffolding further enhanced the effectiveness of the embodied imagery strategy; and (c) prolonged classroom interventions employing embodied imagery significantly benefited students with lower prior knowledge. These findings suggest embodied imagery as a promising instructional approach to enhance middle school students’ semantic comprehension and emotional engagement in classical poetry learning.",

          "abstract": "When calling an image before the mind's eye, people often do not include basic properties of the mental scene. For example, when imagining a person knocking a ball off a table, people may neglect to consider the color of the ball. This \"non-commitment\" in imagery has been part of ongoing debates on the nature of mental imagery in philosophy and cognitive science, but the central question of its origin remains open. It is possible that this lack of detail in the imagination reflects actual non-commitment, as one constructs a hierarchical mental scene. But it is also possible that people do form highly detailed mental images, but fail to notice, encode, or recall properties of the image, for the same reasons that they do not notice, encode, or recall details of real scenes in direct perception. We tested these contrasting hypotheses across three experiments (N=3,895 total). First, we compared non-commitment patterns in mental imagery with the details that participants failed to notice in briefly presented real images. We found no correlation between properties that were non-committed to in the imagination, and those missed under rapid perception, indicating that non-commitment does not simply arise from perceptual noise. Next, we examined the temporal unfolding of mental imagery, and found consistent evidence of a hierarchical pattern: core entities and spatial relations, then physical properties, then surface details like color and texture. Attempts to interrupt or constrain scene construction did not change the hierarchical ordering. We suggest the results support a hierarchical partial-scene construction account of mental imagery.",

          "abstract": "We conducted three experiments to investigate whether previously observed differences in the perceived blurriness of words versus nonwords reflect early perceptual processes or post-perceptual cognitive factors such as memory. Building on Lupyan’s report that familiar words appear less blurry than scrambled letter strings at the same blur level in perception, we designed a forced-choice paradigm featuring an immediate “perceptual” block, where both stimuli remained visible during the judgment, and a “memory” block, where one stimulus disappeared before participants responded. Results of all experiments showed that, although nonwords were consistently more likely than words to be judged as blurrier than the word target, this difference was statistically robust only under the memory condition. This result suggests that higher-order processes, specifically memory-based reconstruction, may intensify the perceived sharpness of words. By contrast, in an immediate perceptual context, the same word–nonword effect was either not present or not significant, indicating that strictly bottom-up perceptual sharpening due to familiarity may be weaker than previously assumed. These findings highlight the need to distinguish between immediate perceptual mechanisms and post-perceptual influences such as memory or decision biases when assessing top-down effects on vision as well as the importance of timing manipulations.  All three experiments also demonstrated a sharpening effect of memory for both words and nonwords, consistent with previous research.",

However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed and an updated search in July 2025, yielding an initial sample of 1,831 articles, of which 194 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 130 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to August 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

Infant night sleep duration was assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Sensitivity was observed at 6 months. In the German cohort, higher maternal CM predicted shorter infant night sleep (p = .001). Sensitivity moderated this association (p = .038), emphasizing its protective role. While the replication of this interaction was inconclusive in the U.S. sample, the pooled effect across cohorts was significant (p = .03).

          "abstract": "The EZ-diffusion model (EZ-DDM) uses a method of moments to provide closed-form estimators for the drift-diffusion parameters from summary statistics. In previous work, we showed that using the sampling distributions of these statistics enables the implementation of an hierarchical extension of the EZ-DDM, supporting scalable Bayesian inference in cognitive psychometrics applications. However, the summary statistics used in EZ-DDM implementations (mean and variance) are sensitive to contaminant data points, limiting its utility in real-world applications with contaminated data. To address this, we develop and test a variation on the EZ-DDM in which we replace the summary statistics with robust alternatives: we substitute mean RT with median RT and RT variance with an estimate derived from the interquartile range. We illustrate the effectiveness of this substitution in a simulation study using a within-subject t test design across varying sample sizes and effect sizes. The robust variant matched the diagnostic accuracy of the original EZ-DDM for uncontaminated data but remained stable under contamination, unlike the standard model. This extension preserves efficiency while adding robustness in real-world applications. We recommend the use of the robust EZ-DDM in practical applications.",

          "abstract": "Optimal stopping problems provide a framework for studying decision-making under uncertainty, balancing the trade-off between information sampling and decision commitment. We investigated deviations from normative strategies in human decision-making and examined the neural mechanisms underlying decision commitment versus sampling using electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants viewed sequences of beads drawn from fictitious urns and attempted to infer the majority bead colour in each urn, while their EEG activity was recorded. After viewing each bead, participants could choose to sample more by drawing another bead (draw choice) or to stop sampling and infer the contents of the urn (urn choice). A Bayesian ideal observer model and parametrised models were used to predict participant behaviour. Participants undersampled relative to the ideal observer, particularly in the more uncertain condition where the proportion of bead colours was close to chance (60/40 or 0.6), with the model better capturing behaviour in the easier 80/20 (0.8) condition. P300 amplitudes showed larger responses for urn choices and a gradient of increasing amplitude as draws approached commitment. Larger frontal ERP responses were also observed under higher uncertainty (0.6 condition). Beta oscillatory activity was stronger for urn choices in the high uncertainty condition, with fast beta (20–30 Hz) activity driving final commitment to a decision. Beta power was further predicted by model-derived action values. By integrating behavioural, computational, and neurophysiological data, this study advances our understanding of active information sampling versus decision commitment in reward-related probabilistic environments.",

This study investigated the impact of mental imagery simulations of threat on endogenous pain modulation in n = 71 healthy participants using a cuff-pressure algometry protocol. In block one, participants were assessed on their baseline pain detection threshold (PDT), pressure pain tolerance (PTT), and their conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses. In the second block, participants underwent the same procedures again but were randomly allocated to imagine the dominant leg cuff as being made of bubble wrap (benign imagery condition; n = 36) or metal wire (threat imagery condition; n = 35). In between blocks, participants went to a separate room to interact with a piece of real bubble wrap or metal wire around their legs, facilitating mental imagery generation in Block 2. Partially consistent with our hypothesis, mental imagery impacted CPM effects for pain detection threshold (PDT), which was significantly reduced in the Wire relative to the Bubble-wrap condition. Mental imagery did not influence pressure pain tolerance (PPT).  These results indicate that mental simulation of threat impaired threshold-based CPM responses. Our data suggest that mental simulation of threat may contribute to dysfunctional central pain processing which may be relevant to the maintenance of clinical pain conditions.",

Although studies have demonstrated influences of outcome desirability on people’s predictions, the cognitive mechanisms behind such an effect have remained unclear. Both biased criteria for evidence judgment and biased evidence search/accumulation have been suggested as possible mechanisms. In the present work, we used drift-diffusion modeling to examine on which levels of processing desirability has its impact. Participants (N=147) made predictions about the color of a randomly selected square from 2-color grids. Crucially, certain color outcomes were made more desirable than others, and the strength of evidence was manipulated by varying the proportion of desired-color squares in the grid. We found that both manipulations—and their interaction—significantly affected predictions. More importantly, drift-diffusion model analyses showed that outcome desirability resulted in a judgment-level bias, where participants required less evidence to predict a desired outcome. Notably, we also found that desirability impacted the evidence accumulation process itself. Participants more readily construed evidence as supporting the desired outcome, indicating that desirability had a top-down influence on how prediction-relevant evidence was accumulated. The present results have implications for existing accounts of how desire impacts expectations and highlight the utility of drift diffusion modeling as a tool for assessing the mechanisms underlying motivated biases.",

Recent work has put forward a concrete proposition for a Language of Thought (LoT) underlying the mental representation of geometric shapes in contemporary humans. Initial experiments, based on a comparison of baboon and human performance in an intruder task, suggested that this ability could be unique to humans. Here, to deepen our understanding of the evolutionary origins of geometric representations, we compared humans and baboons (Papio Papio) in a delayed geometric match-to-sample task with a broad array of shapes. Crucially, the presentation speed was manipulated so that, on slow-paced trials, animals were given more time to reflect on the shapes. The shapes were sampled from our proposed LoT and spanned a range of predicted geometric complexity under that model. Although the overall pattern of behavior was still strikingly different in humans and baboons, when presentations were slower, we did find a small contribution of the LoT representations in baboons, although weaker than in humans. In both species, longer looking time increased the effect of the LoT-based predictor. While humans used the ability to self-pace to modulate their looking time, thus benefitting from longer exposure times for more complex shapes and rendering this geometric complexity effect visible, baboons did not.",

In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers. Males also scored significantly higher on the USVST than females. Collectively, this evidence suggested that the USVST may be a useful tool for measuring speeding propensity.",

Drawing on 45 semi-structured interviews with menstruating and non-menstruating workers, we applied thematic analysis to explore workplace perceptions of menstruation and menstrual leave policies (MLPs). We found that menstruation was widely positioned as taboo in the workplace, with participants both experiencing and anticipating stigma. Menstruating was associated with incompetence, emotional instability, and unprofessionalism – as contradictory to ideal worker norms and expectations. Although participants could identify and acknowledge potential benefits of MLPs, they also expressed reluctance and even women participants felt reticent. In particular, women participants would refrain from using them and were concerned about misuse. Our research contributes to work and organisational psychology by highlighting how ideal worker norms fuel menstrual stigma which in turn enables the stigmatisation of menstrual leave policies. Interventions that align with diffusion of innovations theory could increase awareness of menstruation and decrease menstrual stigma in the workplace to prepare workplaces before implementing menstrual leave policies.",

However, image sets used for cannabis cue-reactivity paradigms vary between studies, and the lack of reliability and validity assessment hinders the quality of evidence they generate. The aim of this study was to create a novel, open access, standardized, and internationally representative database of cannabis use-related images including control images matched by resolution, luminosity, and complexity: The Cannabis Research Image Database (CRESIDA). We also examined the potential impact of cannabis use severity, image type, and cannabis-tobacco co-use on craving. Design: An online survey was administered to participants recruited via online platforms, community advertisement, and snowballing. Setting: USA, the Netherlands, and Australia. Participants/Cases: 689 participants who consumed cannabis monthly-to-daily (385 men, 298 women, 6 other) were recruited between January 2022 and May 2024. Measurements: Out of 93 cannabis images and 93 matched neutral images, participants each rated 31 image pairs for cannabis craving (the primary outcome), arousal, valence, and tobacco craving. Participants were characterized for socio-demographic data, level of cannabis use and related problems, and mixing cannabis and tobacco. A subset of 78 images was selected for further analysis based on cannabis craving results. Image ratings were evaluated for internal consistency (). Furthermore, we examined the association between cannabis cravings and cannabis use characteristics, and explored if cannabis craving ratings were affected by image type (i.e., product, paraphernalia, and actions), and by using cannabis alone vs. mixing cannabis and tobacco.  Findings. The database showed excellent reliability ( = .995-.965). Cannabis craving, valence, and arousal discriminated cannabis and control images. More cannabis use days (β = 0.162, p &lt; 0.001) and cannabis-related problems (β = 0.268, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with higher image-related cannabis craving. Mixing cannabis with tobacco, compared to using cannabis alone, was associated with the presence of tobacco craving in relation to cannabis images, and with greater cannabis craving in relation to cannabis images (β = -0.457, p &lt; 0.001).  Conclusions: Images part of the open access CRESIDA are reliable and valid for the scientific study of cue-reactivity internationally, providing a broad range of free to use cannabis and control images internationally.",

Contrary to this dominant perspective, we argue that the RewP is an independent EEG feature that selectively responds to positive RPE and is superimposed over a common background signal. We further propose that the RewP signals a goal-prediction error: it is elicited by abstract signals instead of hedonic “rewards”.   This goal prediction error appears to be produced by a critic-like architecture associated with the actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning. This perspective emphasizes the role of the RewP in goal attainment and cognitive control, as opposed to a simple indicator of reward receipt.",

          "abstract": "Error monitoring allows individuals to detect and adapt to mistakes, a process critical in high-stakes environments such as team sports. While widely studied at the individual level, people also monitor and respond to others’ errors. However, research on athletes has largely focused on individual errors. Furthermore, monetary-based manipulations in non-sport studies limit their applicability to team sports. To address these challenges, the present study investigated social post-error adaptations in padel, a doubles racket sport, using a social version of the Eriksen flanker task. Forty-six padel players alternated between action execution and observation under two conditions, once alternating with their teammate and once with an opponent. Results revealed distinct behavioral adaptations to teammates’ and opponents’ errors. Participants showed post-error slowing following teammates’ errors, but post-error speeding following opponents’ errors. Exploratory analyses indicated that individual differences in cohesion were associated with reduced post-error speeding in the opponent condition. Accuracy remained high across conditions, with no significant post-error accuracy effects. These findings demonstrate that, even outside the complexity of gameplay, the teammate-opponent relationship modulates athletes’ error responses, revealing that it is grounded in social cognition. By combining a controlled experimental paradigm with a team sport context, this study not only extends prior monetary-based research to an ecologically valid setting, it also offers insights for coaches, sport psychologists and performance analysts on how social dynamics shape athletes’ behavioral adaptations.",

          "abstract": "As students progress through school, they are expected to increasingly regulate their attention, behaviour and learning. While some meet these demands with ease, others face ongoing challenges that can hinder their academic success. Research has identified four key concepts in this area: executive functions (EF), metacognition (MC), self-regulation (SR) and self-regulated learning (SRL). Although these constructs are conceptually related, they have often been examined in isolation due to disciplinary and methodological divides, resulting in fragmented accounts that obscure their dynamic interplay. This review addresses this issue by providing a comparative overview of EF, MC, SR and SRL in terms of their definitions, how they are operationalised and the research designs used. Based on this synthesis, we introduce the EMERGE model of learning, which positions these constructs along a continuum ranging from more biologically grounded mechanics (e.g. EF) to more culturally shaped pragmatics (e.g. strategy knowledge in SRL). The model highlights both shared mechanisms and distinct functions and conceptualises SR in learning situations as an integrative construct. Building on this framework, we propose two guiding hypotheses: the stage-setting hypothesis, which emphasises long-term developmental interplay; and the compensatory hypothesis, which focuses on short-term interactions that predict learning outcomes. Together, these perspectives highlight the need for longitudinal, experimental and hybrid designs to capture developmental and dynamic processes. The EMERGE model thus aims to bridge fragmented research traditions, improve diagnostics, and inform interventions that effectively support students in meeting the growing demands of self-regulated and adaptive learning.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nBackground and Aims: Cannabis cue-reactivity paradigms are instrumental to study the behavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms of cannabis use and cannabis use disorders. However, image sets used for cannabis cue-reactivity paradigms vary between studies, and the lack of reliability and validity assessment hinders the quality of evidence they generate. The aim of this study was to create a novel, open access, standardized, and internationally representative database of cannabis use-related images including control images matched by resolution, luminosity, and complexity: The Cannabis Research Image Database (CRESIDA). We also examined the potential impact of cannabis use severity, image type, and cannabis-tobacco co-use on craving. Design: An online survey was administered to participants recruited via online platforms, community advertisement, and snowballing. Setting: USA, the Netherlands, and Australia. Participants/Cases: 689 participants who consumed cannabis monthly-to-daily (385 men, 298 women, 6 other) were recruited between January 2022 and May 2024. Measurements: Out of 93 cannabis images and 93 matched neutral images, participants each rated 31 image pairs for cannabis craving (the primary outcome), arousal, valence, and tobacco craving. Participants were characterized for socio-demographic data, level of cannabis use and related problems, and mixing cannabis and tobacco. A subset of 78 images was selected for further analysis based on cannabis craving results. Image ratings were evaluated for internal consistency (). Furthermore, we examined the association between cannabis cravings and cannabis use characteristics, and explored if cannabis craving ratings were affected by image type (i.e., product, paraphernalia, and actions), and by using cannabis alone vs. mixing cannabis and tobacco.  Findings. The database showed excellent reliability ( = .995-.965). Cannabis craving, valence, and arousal discriminated cannabis and control images. More cannabis use days (β = 0.162, p &lt; 0.001) and cannabis-related problems (β = 0.268, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with higher image-related cannabis craving. Mixing cannabis with tobacco, compared to using cannabis alone, was associated with the presence of tobacco craving in relation to cannabis images, and with greater cannabis craving in relation to cannabis images (β = -0.457, p &lt; 0.001).  Conclusions: Images part of the open access CRESIDA are reliable and valid for the scientific study of cue-reactivity internationally, providing a broad range of free to use cannabis and control images internationally.",

          "abstract": "The urge to dance is universal. From the moment we are born, we bounce, sway, or clap along when we hear a beat. Beyond the inherent infectiousness of rhythm translating into groove, and the pleasure such movement evokes, dance movements are a vehicle for conveying and for understanding gestural expressions of emotions across the lifespan. Furthermore, research documents how people derive aesthetic pleasure from both watching and performing dance. However, the ontogenetic development of the aesthetic appreciation of dance remains largely unexplored. Most empirical work in the developmental domain has used dance movements to explore the development of general emotional expressivity and understanding. Since aesthetic emotions are not disparate from everyday emotions, the research exploring those relationships between dance behaviors and emotional and social development can be considered a stepping-stone for first insights into the development of the aesthetic experience of dance in childhood. In this chapter, we present an overview of research exploring expressive dance movements with children, and discuss how such approaches can be adapted to investigate the ontogeny of dance-related aesthetic experiences. We further provide an overview of methods and open research questions for a developmental empirical framework of dance aesthetics.",

          "abstract": "Gait impairments following stroke are prevalent and persistent, often affecting walking ability, body perception, and quality of life. Movement sonification—mapping body motion to sound—has shown promise for modulating sensorimotor function. This multiple-case experimental study investigated the effects of movement sonification using metaphorical sound on gait, body perception, and emotional state in three individuals with chronic stroke. Using an ABAC design, participants walked with real-time auditory feedback delivered via an interactive walking-interface system (SoniBand) across four conditions: baseline, “Wind” sound, return to baseline, and “Mechanical” sound, presented in a counterbalanced order. Gait parameters (symmetry, step frequency, velocity, and acceleration) were assessed alongside self-reported body perception and emotional state. Exposure to the “Wind” sound condition led to consistent improvements in walking velocity and symmetry, as well as enhanced perceptions of body lightness, speed, flexibility, and physical capability. Accelerometer data indicated carry-over effects from the sound condition in gait symmetry and step regularity. These findings support the potential of metaphorical sound sonification to influence internal models of movement and facilitate sensorimotor adaptation in stroke survivors. This study underscores the malleability of body perceptions through auditory feedback and highlights the value of personalized, perceptually grounded interventions in neurorehabilitation.",

Relying on a range of statistical techniques, the results across three experiments, including a replication of Experiment 1 of Liu et al. (2019), testing three different groups of bilinguals (i.e., Dutch-English, Arabic-English, and Chinese-English) showed no clear interaction between language switch costs and Stroop incongruency, and neither was this pattern influenced by language dominance.

          "authors": "Norbert Vanek",
          "abstract": "Research on language and olfaction presents a paradox. Language appears to support the formation of odor categories, yet it can also hinder odor recognition through verbal interference, highlighting that different olfactory processes get affected in distinct ways. The question, then, is not about whether language and odor processing in humans are inevitably linked, but about understanding the circumstances under which language either promotes or hinders olfactory processing, particularly in the domains of odor categorization and memory. To unmask the nature of this delicate balance, this article reviews empirical studies that point to a verbal enhancement of forming new odor categories and contextualizes it alongside experimental outcomes showing how odor memories can get verbally skewed. Findings from both angles are nested within prominent theories including attribute differentiation, dual coding, ad hoc cognition and attentional tuning. The research reviewed here sits at the crossroads of language and olfaction. It offers fresh insights into how language scaffolds the organization of the mind, and it also outlines promising directions for future research. The main aim is to bring together two contrasting strands of research to investigate how language both facilitates and disrupts olfactory processing. The designs of studies in this article were inspired by Asifa Majid’s outstanding contributions to cognitive science and honor her dedication to community building, particularly in exploring how diverse linguistic and cultural contexts affect olfactory cognition.",

Experiment 2 investigated whether instructional scaffolding (visual imagery versus background information) could enhance the effectiveness of embodied imagery. Experiment 3 involved a 10-week intervention using embodied imagery in authentic classroom settings. Results indicated that: (a) embodied imagery significantly improved students’ poetry learning outcomes—particularly their emotional interpretation—compared to general imagery and free learning conditions; (b) visual imagery scaffolding further enhanced the effectiveness of the embodied imagery strategy; and (c) prolonged classroom interventions employing embodied imagery significantly benefited students with lower prior knowledge.

Results confirmed the specific age-related increase in perceived temporal acceleration over the past decade. However, no significant association was found between perceived time passage over the past decade and either the number or subjective value of memories. Contrary to assumptions, older adults reported more vivid and meaningful recollections. Instead, reduced cognitive functioning, and specifically lower ability to form new memories as assessed through delayed memory recall, emerged as a significant mediator of accelerated time perception with age.

          "abstract": "Food preparation plays a key role in shaping how people perceive meat: It helps people to dissociate meat from its animal origin and allows them to eat meat without experiencing conflict. However, experimental research in this area mostly disregards or confounds two food preparation steps: disassembling and cooking. To test how disassembling and cooking affect perceptions about meat dishes, we conducted secondary analyses of a sample of omnivores from a U.S.-representative dataset (N = 1,189). In this study, participants indicated meat perceptions (self-report) in response to a picture of one meat dish that varied in the degree of disassembling (i.e., whole parts vs. chopped/minced) and cooking (i.e., raw vs. cooked). Leveraging this experimental setup, multi-level analyses revealed that disassembling and cooking reduced compassion elicited by meat dishes. Disassembling also decreased general emotional arousal, while cooking reduced negative evaluations, conflict experiences in felt ambivalence, and specific negative emotions such as disgust and anger, while increasing valence perceptions more generally and the desire to eat the dish. Moreover, psychological network analyses showed that the relations of meat-related perceptions with each other do not differ significantly between food preparation steps. By offering nuanced insights into how food preparation affects conflict experiences as well as other affective and attitudinal meat-related perceptions, this research offers various theoretical and practical implications. We therefore discuss key considerations for future research on meat-related perceptions and identify when and which interventions may be most necessary and effective in encouraging reduced meat consumption.",

This perspective transformed the field of emotion-regulation, which evolved from understanding which regulation strategies people use, to understanding how strategy use varies by context (i.e., strategy-situation fit). Theoretical accounts suggest contextual features are crucial in guiding people’s selection of emotion-regulation strategies. However, empirical evidence is isolated in piecemeal studies with inconclusive results. To comprehensively explore context-dependent emotion-regulation, we need data on emotion-regulation across many contexts, at scale. Combining 11 experience-sampling datasets in an integrative analysis (NID=1,720, Nobservations=134,470), we examined how regulation strategy use varies as a function of three theory-derived contextual features—intensity, controllability, and social features (i.e., the presence and closeness of others). We found limited support that context matters for daily emotion-regulation strategy use. Our study provides a well-powered foundational step to test a theory central to emotion-regulation research, and highlights the complexity of capturing strategy-situation fit in daily life.",

Previous research has demonstrated that frames of reference (FORs) in the physical space could distort the spatial representations to influence memory of spatial relations. However, it remains unclear whether FORs could also influence attentional allocation among the spatial representations. To addressed this issue, we examined the attentional shifting within or between different spatial regions, which were affected by the same versus different FORs. In Experiment 1, a modified double-rectangle cuing paradigm was adopted. Two human figures in complementary colors were presented to establish two object-centered spatial FORs, which divided the external space of objects into a central region (influenced by two FORs) and two outer-side regions (primarily influenced by a single FOR). Cues and targets were presented in the same region or different regions. Results showed faster attentional shifting within the same region than between different regions. In Experiment 2, one human figure was replaced as a cross, and the within-region advantage was replicated. Overall, these findings suggest that object-centered FORs could be employed to collectively organize space and shape attentional allocation in objects’ external space.",

          "abstract": "Emotions can greatly influence cognitive processes, such as reading. However, recent studies on the interaction between emotions and reading comprehension provide a murky picture with contradictory claims. Here, we offer one explanation for this phenomenon, that is, the influence of emotion is dependent on different attention goals during reading comprehension. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated question types that were presented to participants prior to reading to evoke different attentional goals. By utilizing an advanced eye movement analysis method Eye Movement with Hidden Markov Models (EMHMM) with co-clustering, we discovered two representative attention patterns from eye fixations: an expanded, globalized attention pattern and a more focused, localized attention pattern. The subsequent analysis showed that globalized pattern led to better comprehension accuracy for summative questions, and localized pattern facilitated detailed question answering. Moreover, negative emotion induces more localized attention for detailed questions only, which could further explain its facilitation effect in detailed question answering. Our findings suggest that the impact of emotions on reading comprehension is shaped by the attention goal of the task. This suggests that emotion appears to guide attention in ways that either support or hinder comprehension depending on what the higher-level goal is.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive research on magical thinking and contagion beliefs, no validated measure exists for assessing spiritual food contagion---the belief that non-material properties transfer to food through contact. We developed and validated the Spiritual Food Contagion Scale (SFCS) across a series of studies with a total sample of over 1,600 participants. Studies 1A-B (N = 100) generated an initial item pool through literature review and target audience evaluation. Study 2 (N = 398) employed exploratory factor analysis, revealing a robust two-factor structure: \\textit{essence transmission} (8 items) and \\textit{moral contamination} (7 items). Study 3 ($N$ = 504) confirmed this structure through confirmatory factor analysis and established convergent validity with related constructs. Study 4A (N = 351) demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability and predictive validity through experimental scenarios. Participants completed treatment preference ratings for flu illness and health optimization contexts across evidence-based, wellness, alternative, and pseudoscientific approaches. Higher SFCS scores were positively associated with a stronger preference for treatments in general, with particularly pronounced effects for pseudoscientific interventions. Study 4B ($N$ = 280) examined actual past usage of alternative medicine practices. Here, the SFCS significantly predicted alternative medicine usage, demonstrating that spiritual food contagion beliefs extend to real-world behaviors. The SFCS provides researchers with a psychometrically sound instrument for investigating spiritual food contagion beliefs and their implications for health-related decision-making and other domains of consumer behavior.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Accurate detection of intoxication is critical in alcohol and other drug (AOD) healthcare settings, yet clinicians often rely on subjective assessments, particularly for substances such as cannabis where real-time testing is limited. This study examined AOD staff’s ability to accurately detect cannabis intoxication using standardised video stimuli, alongside their confidence in and perceived barriers to managing intoxicated patients.\nMethods: Seventy staff members from five public AOD services in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, participated in an online survey. Participants viewed two short videos of individuals under blinded cannabis or placebo conditions and judged intoxication status. Participants then responded to questions on self-reported confidence in recognising, discussing, and managing intoxication, along with perceived barriers. Group differences were analysed by professional role, years of experience working in NSW Health, and frequency of AOD patient interaction.\nResults: Participants correctly identified the intoxicated subject in only 50% of cases (M=1.1 out of 2, SD=0.71), with no significant differences by role, experience, or confidence. Confidence in managing intoxication was higher among medical and nursing staff and those with more frequent patient contact compared to those in non–patient-facing roles. However, confidence and accuracy to detect intoxication were not correlated. Common barriers included fear of patient aggression (77%), upsetting patients (69%), and misjudging intoxication (66%).\nDiscussion and Conclusions: Despite moderate confidence, AOD staff demonstrated limited accuracy in detecting cannabis intoxication. Frequent exposure and professional role influenced confidence but not detection accuracy, suggesting that intoxication detection, particularly for cannabis, may not be a presumed skill. These findings highlight the need for targeted education, training and validated tools to support clinical decision-making and safe care delivery.\n\nKeywords: Cannabis, intoxication, healthcare staff, clinical confidence, alcohol and other drugs, detection accuracy, video-based assessment",

          "abstract": "Human judgments typically demonstrate an overconfidence pattern, especially for low performers (i.e., the Dunning-Kruger effect (DKE; Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999). This effect has been shown to extend to a variety of metacognitive judgment tasks, including judgments learning (JOLs) and judgments of associative memory (JAMs). Across these tasks, perceived relatedness produces inflated memory predictions. The present study explored whether large language models (LLMs) similarly exhibit this effect. We used a modified JAM task based on Maxwell and Buchanan (2020), which assessed three types of word pair relationships: Associative (i.e., probability of cue eliciting target in free association tasks), semantic (i.e., degree of feature overlap), and thematic (i.e., likelihood of co-occurrence within the same narrative context). This judgment of relatedness task (JOR) was adapted for BERT using surprisal values, which estimate how expected a target word is for a given cue. LLM JOR patterns were then compared to human JAMs first reported by Maxwell and Buchanan (2020). Overall, humans showed a classic overestimation pattern (high intercepts and shallow slopes). However, BERT surprisals were minimally sensitive to differences in word relations (i.e., near-zero or negative slopes) but showed higher bias compared to humans (i.e., elevated intercepts). Taken together, our findings suggest that LLMs do not exhibit the classic DKE pattern, though they are prone to overestimation. Instead, LLMs appear to uniformly overestimate word pair relatedness.",

          "abstract": "Food insecurity is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes and eating disorder behaviors, including binge eating. Individuals from under-resourced communities, who disproportionately experience food insecurity, often face substantial barriers to accessing eating disorder care. Digital interventions present a promising avenue to reduce disparities in treatment access, but their success depends on how well they align with the expectations of intended users. This study explored the motivations and expectations of treatment-seeking individuals with food insecurity who presented to FoodSteps, a digital intervention for binge eating. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 124 participants across two trials. Using thematic analysis, we identified four themes related to participants’ motivations for engagement and expectations for the intervention. First, participants were drawn to FoodSteps because it aligned with their personal health goals, including reducing binge eating, managing weight, and developing healthy eating patterns. Many sought greater insight into their behaviors, coping strategies for triggers, and accountability through support from a coach. Second, participants described FoodSteps as their first opportunity to access specialized care for binge eating, noting that prior treatment-seeking was often hindered by structural barriers. Third, digital delivery was viewed as especially appealing due to its accessibility, convenience, and affordability. Finally, participants highlighted shame surrounding binge eating as both a barrier to prior help-seeking and a motivator for engaging with this digital intervention. Overall, findings suggest that individuals experiencing food insecurity are motivated to engage with digital interventions that are supportive, accessible, and closely aligned with their personal health goals.",

          "abstract": "Early language skill is predictive of many later life outcomes, and is thus of great interest to developmental psychologists and clinicians. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs), parent report instruments typically containing inventories of hundreds of children's vocabulary words, have proven to be valid and reliable instruments for measuring children's early language skill. The CDIs have been adapted to many dozens of languages, and cross-linguistic comparisons show both consistency and variability in language acquisition trajectories. However, thousands of languages do not yet have CDIs, nor the early language corpora needed to create them, posing a significant barrier to increasing the diversity of languages that are studied. Here, we propose a method for selecting candidate words to include on new CDIs through analyzing psychometric properties of the translation-equivalent concepts that are frequently included on existing CDIs. Leveraging 32 datasets from existing CDIs, we propose a list of 100 concepts that have low variability in their cross-linguistic learning difficulty. This pool of common concepts—analogous to the Swadesh lists, which are basic vocabulary lists used in glottochronology for cross-language comparison—can be used as a starting point for future CDI adaptations. We show that the proposed Swadesh-CDI list generalizes well to data from 10 additional languages.",

          "authors": "Yixiao Dong; Deodatta Baral; Kushmakar Baral; Denis Dumas",
          "abstract": "While some are neutral, many psychological constructs (e.g., depression, learning motivation, or antisocial behavior) carry clear directional expectations that align with social or ethical principles and values. When a construct is framed with the goal of moving toward its socially desirable direction, it becomes a meaningful psychological objective to pursue. We pursue different objectives in our daily lives, sometimes simultaneously. During this process, trade-offs occur when they are in tension or conflict, meaning they cannot be consistently improved without compromising one another. While certain psychological trade-offs have been well studied, others remain underexplored or possibly even unidentified. One critical reason is that mainstream analytic methods used in psychological research are not designed to investigate such trade-offs. Fortunately, a suitable method has long existed in other disciplines. Pareto Optimization (PO) is an effective analytic framework widely applied in fields such as biology, economics, and engineering to investigate trade-offs among multiple competing objectives. In this tutorial, we review the core conceptual and methodological foundations of PO and aim to bring this classic method to a psychological audience. Moreover, we develop a user-friendly R Shiny application (named PO-Run) for conducting PO analyses. The utility of the application is illustrated through a real-world psychological example that simultaneously pursues two conflicting objectives: promoting critical actions and minimizing mental stress. Their trade-off relationship is then evaluated via the evidence generated by PO-Run, along with relevant theoretical justification.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research suggests some of the most profound meditation-induced psychological transformations require mastery of mental skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Such development, however, often demands years of sustained practice and expert guidance. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers a novel means of potentially supporting meditative development by modulating brain structures with high spatial precision. Suppression of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a hub of self-referential processing—may reduce stickiness in internal cognitions and self-interference, thereby fostering equanimity, a crucial meditative faculty. This pilot feasibility study investigated the effects of tFUS-based PCC inhibition during a ten-day silent retreat. Twenty-eight meditators received two stimulation sessions during the retreat and completed standardized questionnaires and daily phenomenological reports. Quantitative analyses revealed significant increases in trait mindfulness, both state–trait nondual awareness, and interoceptive body listening. Qualitative analyses identified consistent differences between stimulation and non-stimulation days: tFUS was associated with enhanced meditative phenomenology, including equanimity, concentration, and sensory clarity, as well as shifts in self-perception and cathartic emotional release. These experiential effects often unfolded in interaction with participants’ ongoing psychological challenges, suggesting that tFUS may increase baseline equanimity and scaffold meditative capacities. Implementation was feasible but required logistical planning. Limitations include the quasi-experimental design, reliance on self-reports, and lack of long-term follow-up. Future studies should use randomized sham-controlled designs, neurophenomenological methods, and examine systematic dose–response parameters with MRI-guided targeting. Together, these findings highlight tFUS as a promising tool for augmenting meditation training and advancing the study of meditative development.",

          "abstract": "Masters and Johnson (1966) described intimation, the pre-orgasmic state of visceral awareness and imminent climax, as a distinctive phase of present-moment attunement. In epilepsy, aura denotes an anticipatory state of altered interoception, affective intensity, or ecstatic sensations. Both are threshold phenomena, yet their neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a predictive-processing framework, this investigation develops a comparative theoretical model in which intimation and aura are regulated by interactions between the cerebellum, salience network, and frontal control systems. Evidence from neuroimaging, oscillatory, and clinical studies indicates that cerebellar activity contributes not only to motor coordination but also to precision calibration across interoceptive, affective, and executive domains. During intimation, cerebellar–salience coupling sustains the poised state of attunement described by Masters and Johnson, supported by locus coeruleus–norepinephrine modulation and alpha–beta–theta rhythms. In aura, unstable precision weighting within these same circuits may disrupt calibration, leaving anticipation fragile and prone to seizure propagation. By positioning both states as predictive threshold events governed by cerebellar–salience–frontal network dynamics, this investigation reframes anticipatory brain states, linking sexual function and epilepsy while extending Masters and Johnson’s descriptive insight into a computational account of present-moment attunement.",

Our findings underscore the need for conceptual clarity, consistent terminology, and systematic evaluation. Ultimately, we aim to construct a consensus definition and framework for identifying and addressing training scars across officer-safety disciplines (e.g., defensive tactics, firearms).

Unfortunately, we do not currently have a clear, in-depth understanding of critical thinking about health in the United States, especially its rates among parents and young adults, two particularly important groups. This study assessed and characterized critical thinking about health, including behavioral health, with U.S. parents and young adults. We also explored whether critical thinking about health varied as a function of sociodemographic determinants.\nMethods: Parents (N=142) and young adults (N=145) in the U.S. completed an online test of critical thinking about health, and answered questions about their background.\nResults: Both parents and young adults in the U.S. struggled to think critically about health and treatments based on various science literacy and evidence-based practice principles. They struggled most with the concept, “Relative effects of treatments alone can be misleading.” Parents with higher educational attainment had lower critical thinking about health, and young adults who reported a liberal political affiliation had higher critical thinking scores. Both parents and young adults with higher household income had higher critical thinking about health.\nConclusions: This investigation demonstrates a need to increase critical thinking about health among U.S. parents and young adults so they can be empowered to make informed health choices.",

          "abstract": "Effort is integral to the regulation of behavior. It can be central for achieving goals in a range of activities, including sports, exercise, learning, and work. For centuries, researchers have tried to understand what effort is and how it shapes human behavior. Yet, despite its importance, there is no overarching consensus on what effort represents and how it should be measured. Attesting to this, academic disciplines conceptualize and measure effort in strikingly different ways. While this highlights the multitude of factors relevant to understanding effort, it has also led to siloed approaches, making interdisciplinary integration challenging. To facilitate interdisciplinary exchange, this guide aims to provide a descriptive and impartial overview of frequently used effort conceptualization and measures. We first review three prominent conceptualizations of effort: force-based, resource-based, and process-focused accounts. Second, we present a broad overview of commonly used effort measures, ranging from more direct physiological and neural measures to more indirect measures, such as perceived exertion and task performance. For each, we provide a brief review of properties, applications, and limitations relevant to effort-related research. With this approach, our aim is not to resolve disciplinary differences by pitting the utility of different conceptualizations and measures against each other. Rather, we aim to provide a shared conceptual framework on which more integrative theorizing and cumulative progress in effort research can be achieved across disciplines.",

          "abstract": "Newsweek’s 2010 cover story, “The Creativity Crisis,” documented a measurable decline in creativity based on Torrance Tests data from 272,599 participants. Its reach bypassed conventional gatekeepers; popularity arrived without permission, and they have never forgiven it. A decade later, the Journal of Creative Behavior’s editorial gatekeepers sought to erase both the crisis and the Korean woman scholar who exposed it by publishing Barbot and Said-Metwaly’s (2021) critique of Kim (2011c). Their article alleged—falsely—that Kim omitted effect sizes, age-level analyses, Form B use, and data extraction procedures. It rested on inflated claims, unfounded inferences, denial of empirical findings through distorted graphs, and 44 documented distortions across 31 citations—including fabrication, mischaracterization, and misleading attribution—that few would expect from leading scholars, yet were shielded by the editorial process, recasting the Creativity Crisis as a “myth” and societal harm. The opposite is true: evidence spurred educators and reformers to engage constructively, inspiring curricular innovation, accountability, and momentum to reverse the decline. When the critique appeared online, months before official publication, leading figures publicly celebrated its arrival, declaring the crisis fabricated by Kim and Newsweek, celebrating the silencing of a Korean woman’s voice. This rebuttal corrects the record by addressing age-specific data structures, statistical and graphical misrepresentations, p-value logic, and misuse of cross-temporal meta-analysis and TTCT scores that ignore post-2012 scoring changes. It shows how editorial gatekeeping and racialized exclusion obstruct scientific debate, underscoring the importance of ethical publishing and dissenting voices. Science does not progress by denying crises, but by confronting them.",

          "abstract": "Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, revealing a fundamental philosophical gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence.\nUnlike traditional AI research that asks \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what conditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Situated within contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, this framework bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we reconceptualize intelligence not as a possessed property but as a performed process—a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation.\nSCL makes three interrelated contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling what we term \"executable epistemology\"—philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it demonstrates that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt-based approaches, with empirical support from controlled agent evaluations. Third, it redefines the measure of intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct one's own epistemic state through intentional understanding.\nThis framework has implications across philosophy of mind, epistemology, and artificial intelligence. For philosophy of mind, it offers a new mode of engagement where theories of cognition can be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavioral intelligence in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it suggests that knowledge is best understood not as truth-possession but as continuous structural reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop.\nWe situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that genuine progress requires not larger models but architectures that structurally realize cognitive science principles.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to distractors in the environment. Successful working memory relies on resistance to distractors, which may enter memory due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets (i.e., during encoding), or due to insufficient ability to ignore them during maintenance. Prior research offers mixed conclusions regarding whether impaired distractor suppression contributes to older adults’ (OA) WM deficits. Across three behavioral experiments, we found consistent evidence that OA were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than during maintenance. Unexpectedly, the familiarity of the distractor items had limited impact on performance, whereas low-salience distractors presented during encoding produced robust decrements in accuracy and increases in reaction time.

          "authors": "James William Dias; Kara C. Schvartz-Leyzac; Kelly C. Harris",
          "abstract": "Objectives. Older typical-hearing adults without a cochlear-implant (CI) have been found to exhibit greater multisensory benefits when identifying audiovisual speech than younger normal-hearing adults. The greater multisensory benefits demonstrated by older non-CI users can compensate for unisensory auditory and visual speech deficits, allowing them to identify audiovisual speech at a degree of accuracy like that of younger normal-hearing adults. Though most new CI recipients are 65 years of age and older, the reliance of older CI users on such multisensory benefits is unknown. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate age-related differences in cross-sensory and multisensory benefits in audiovisual speech identification in aging CI users and to examine how they differ from age-matched non-CI users.\nDesign. Twenty middle-aged-to-older CI users (50-83 years of age) and 35 age-matched non-CI users completed an auditory-visual speech identification task, identifying 288 disyllabic words presented either auditory-alone, visual-alone, or audiovisually. CI users identified speech stimuli streamed directly through their CI device in quiet and in noise (Gaussian) at a +10 and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Non-CI users identified speech stimuli delivered through earphones in noise at -5, 0, and +5 dB SNR conditions. Different noise conditions were used for CI users and non-CI users to avoid ceiling and floor effects. From visual, auditory, and audiovisual performance, psychometrics for the visual enhancement of auditory speech (VE), the auditory enhancement of visual speech (AE), and auditory-visual multisensory enhancement (AVE) were calculated. Group differences (in the overlapping +5 dB SNR condition) and effects of age and noise were tested using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models.\nResults. Both CI users and non-CI users demonstrated canonical differences in visual, auditory, and audiovisual speech identification. VE and AVE were greater for CI users than non-CI users. AVE increased with the age of older CI users and non-CI users, consistent with age-group differences in AVE we observed in a previous study of non-CI users.\nConclusions. The results of the current investigation suggest that CI users, like age-matched non-CI users, rely on multisensory integration more as they age. Older CI users may benefit more from audiovisual input than older non-CI users. These perceptual benefits grant older CI users the capacity to identify audiovisual speech to a degree of accuracy closer to that of older non-CI users, despite deficits in the auditory perception of CI users. As a result, successful use of a CI device may partially depend on the ability of a CI user to integrate information they see with information available from their device, and older CI users may depend on visual input more to successfully use their CI.",

          "abstract": "How are race riots absolved of overt racial motivations? Social psychological research has shown how far-right leaders mobilise people by claiming that majority populations are threatened or silenced. This paper examines a related process: how riotous actions are explained and justified through appeals to ‘British values.’ Using discursive psychology, we analyse talk surrounding the riots that followed the stabbing of three young girls in Southport, England—the UK race riots of August 2024. We show that invoking British or English values serves two key functions: it renders rioters’ actions self-explanatory and offers a competing account of rioters as the more authentic representation of Britishness and the British people than the government. This reframing shifts attention away from ‘far-right’ motivations, instead portraying the riots as effortful and even ideal expressions of British citizenship. Thus, British values operate not merely as symbols but as rhetorical tools linking the riots, immigration, state policy, and national identity.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in social life, understanding its interpersonal and psychological implications is urgent yet under-theorized. This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "abstract": "Psychological science is entering an era in which artificial systems participate in relational and emotional life. Yet most therapeutic AI and mental health technologies remain limited to skill-based training—teaching users to recognize emotions, regulate cognition, or perform social scripts—while neglecting the developmental foundations of authentic relatedness. Building on Hedges’ (1983, 2000) four developmental listening perspectives—organizing, symbiotic, self–other, and independence experiences—this article proposes a relational - developmental framework for therapeutic AI, extending psychological theory into the domain of artificial companionship. Integrating attachment theory, mentalization, self-determination, and cooperative ontogeny, the framework conceptualizes responsiveness as a graded, temporally calibrated process that parallels the progression from early containment to mature mutual recognition. Rather than simulating empathy, therapeutic AI should cultivate developmentally adaptive responsiveness—a mode of engagement that includes tolerable frustration, repair, and guided differentiation to promote psychological growth. This perspective redefines AI not as a perpetual empathic mirror but as a relational training ground that scaffolds users’ capacity to relate to real others. It further invites psychological science to reconsider responsiveness itself as a central construct linking development, therapy, and human–machine interaction.",

          "abstract": "Psychophysics seeks to quantitatively characterize relationships between objective properties of the world and subjective properties of perception. However, traditional approaches investigate psychophysical dependencies of perception on stimulus properties on a case by case basis rather than seeking to identify quantitative relationships among these psychological processes themselves. This latter goal is particularly important when the processes in question likely depend on each other in some way, such as is the case for subjective experience and task performance: typically, stronger physical stimuli lead to better performance and stronger subjective experiences of clarity, vividness, or confidence. But is the relationship between performance and subjective experience fixed, or can it vary, e.g. by task or attentional demands? Such questions are key for better understanding psychological processes in general, and subjective experience in particular. Here, we develop and showcase a new psychophysical method designed to answer such questions: relative psychometric function (RPF) analysis, which characterizes the nonlinear psychometric relationships between psychological processes and how these relationships change under different circumstances (e.g. experimental manipulations). We demonstrate the advantages of RPF analysis using a sample dataset in which human subjects discriminated random dot kinematogram stimuli which varied in dot motion coherence and overall dot density (dots per visual degree), and rated confidence. RPF analysis revealed systematic changes in the relationship between performance and two subjective measures (confidence and metacognitive sensitivity) due to dot density and task design choices. While these empirical results are intriguing in their own right, they also show how RPF analysis can reveal changes in quantitative relationships between any two psychological measures: performance, vividness, clarity, reaction time, confidence, and more. To encourage the scientific community to use RPF analysis on their data, we also present our open-source RPF toolbox.",

Across four samples spanning the ages of 4 to 80 (total n = 1,842), we measure people’s moral exclusiveness toward human outgroups and non-human animals. We identify adolescence (13–18 years) as key: older male adolescents are more morally exclusive than younger male adolescents, while there is no such difference for female adolescents. Linked to this is a general preference for social hierarchies in males. We further find the turning point in gendered moral exclusiveness: while males are already more morally exclusive than females at the age of 6 and such gender differences persist throughout childhood and in adulthood, they are not yet evident in younger children. Resonating with literature in social-developmental psychology and evolutionary accounts, we suggest that gender differences in moral exclusiveness are likely biologically prepared yet strengthened through gender-dependent socialisation.",

We synthesize recent applications of LLMs, including language-based assessment of psychopathology, digital phenotyping, electronic health record analysis, and early integrations into psychotherapy. However, we highlight deep challenges of AI that loom large in the highly sensitive space of mental health treatment, including clear risks of bias, hallucinations, inappropriate (or even dangerous) therapeutic recommendations, and limited regulatory oversight. We conclude with future directions that are critical for the safe and equitable use of LLMs in mental health.",

This paper outlines DevStart’s core framework and demonstrates how it streamlines the entire research pipeline: from installing free programming tools (Python and R) to building experimental paradigms and handling complex data (e.g., gaze, pupil size) with robust, open-source methods. By detailing step-by-step tutorials and openly sharing code and pipelines, DevStart lowers the barriers that hinder many early career researchers and students. Beyond tutorials, DevStart fosters community engagement through an online forum that supports collaboration, troubleshooting, and the exchange of ideas. In doing so, we aim to foster a vibrant research community that embraces robust, open, and collaborative science at every step of the experimental process.",

They completed three transcriptions of each of five noises (and a control sound with embedded features). Within listeners, pitch chromas were reported for the same noises at approximately the same time more than for different noises, implying that their pitched percepts were somewhat reliable. However, between listeners, there were not significantly more coincidences for pairs of the same noises than pairs of different noises, in line with listeners having more idiosyncratic perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Social movements like #BlackLivesMatter, which have a strong representation on social media, often display abrupt peaks in activity. These peaks are important because they mobilize large populations, but they are also very hard to predict and explain. The current project focused on collective dynamics of anger as a predictor of online peaks. Specifically, we examined whether delayed recovery in anger online in the days preceding activity peaks, termed critical slowing down, predicted the occurrence of peaks. We analyzed the full archive of #BlackLivesMatter tweets between 2015-2020 (N = ~60 million). Congruent with critical slowing down theory, we found that increased autocorrelation in anger but lowered emotional variance were associated with a greater likelihood of peaks. These results suggest that delayed emotional recovery paired with lowered temporal emotional volatility predicts consecutive peaks in activism. By integrating emotional dynamics with complex systems theory, this project opens new avenues for forecasting tipping points in collective behavior.",

Specifically, 1) we review literature that highlights the importance of selfish and selfless norms, 2) we explain why devaluation of prosocial behavior can be additionally understood as a reaction to counternormativity when one perceives a violation of such norms, and 3) discuss the importance of taking the stigmatization of counternormative prosociality into account and examining its broader implications when interpreting social psychological findings on prosocial behavior.

This study examined how risk (perceived in-group rejection, discrimination) and protective (in-group identification, social support) factors are associated with identity integration, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. A total of 306 LGB-religious individuals participated in this study. Perceived rejection from the religious in-group – reflecting the belief that religious communities view LGB and religious identities as incompatible – was significantly associated with lower identity integration. It was also linked to lower life satisfaction, particularly when discrimination was high. Social support related to being both LGB and religious was a consistent protective factor of identity integration and life satisfaction. In-group identification showed a more complex pattern: religious identification was positively related to identity integration but intensified the negative association between religious rejection and life satisfaction. In contrast, strong identification with the LGB in-group buffered against this negative effect. No significant correlates emerged for psychological distress, suggesting it may be shaped by broader factors unrelated to identity. Findings underscore the importance of creating and promoting inclusive in-group norms, particularly within religious communities, and fostering support for individuals navigating both LGB and religious identities.",

Participants completed a questionnaire designed to capture information on demographic variables as well as prevalence of SHAAKE in oneself and others, and reasons for doing so. Of the twenty participants included in data analysis, 45% recalled having made the SHAAKE movement after the heading the football, and 65% reported they had observed another player doing so. Three-quarters of participants reported having sustained concussion before. Additionally, a one-way ANOVA revealed that women were significantly more likely to report dizziness as the reason for SHAAKE than men which may be due to the technical ability of heading the football. With this knowledge, non-players may be more observant of dizziness in women football players shortly after heading the ball this may indicate damage to the brain.",

Although recent legislation (Law No. 69/2012) mandates their presence in schools, empirical data on their working conditions remain scarce. A structured questionnaire administered to 67 assistant teachers examined four key areas: professional needs, reported difficulties, perceptions of students’ needs, and self-rated levels of support, stress, recognition, and satisfaction. Findings reveal that assistant teachers report high levels of professional commitment and satisfaction but also face persistent systemic barriers—limited access to specialist support (e.g., speech therapists, psychologists), shortages of didactic materials, and insufficient continuous training. Their identified needs largely mirror those of their students, emphasizing the interdependence between teacher capacity and student inclusion. The report highlights the paradox of inclusion in Albania: while the policy framework endorses equality and access, practical implementation remains hindered by resource and coordination gaps. Recommendations focus on strengthening multidisciplinary school services, establishing reasonable workload ratios, and institutionalizing ongoing professional development.\n\nKeywords: inclusive education, assistant teachers, Albania, professional needs, teacher satisfaction",

          "abstract": "Current accounts posit that heard speech is covertly imitated to optimise speech perception. Behaviourally, covert imitation is measured using the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) paradigm. In a speech SRC task, participants produce a prompted speech syllable whilst perceiving a speech distractor that either matches the target response (compatible condition) or does not (incompatible condition). The degree to which the distractor is covertly imitated is captured by the automatic imitation effect, computed as the difference in response times (RTs) between incompatible and compatible trials. Two theoretical accounts disagree on whether whether covert imitation is enhanced when speech perception is challenging or instead when the speech signal is familiar to the listener. To dissociate between these two accounts, we conducted two experiments utilising the speech SRC task (Experiments 1 and 2) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) (Experiment 2) to evaluate covert imitation of native speech sounds (perceptually easy and familiar) and of non-native speech sounds (perceptually challenging and unfamiliar). In Experiment 1, participants performed an SRC task with native and non-native sounds, before and after receiving perceptual identification training with the non-native sounds. Automatic imitation was enhanced for non-native sounds compared to native sounds and decreased to a greater extent for non-native sounds than for native sounds following perceptual training. In Experiment 2, participants passively perceived native and non-native speech sounds whilst receiving single pulses of TMS to the tongue area of the primary motor cortex (M1). Tongue M1 showed higher excitability during passive perception of non-native sounds. Our results highlight that covert imitation is enhanced during the perception of perceptually challenging, unfamiliar speech, suggesting that covert imitation acts as an adaptive reflexive gain control mechanism to optimise speech perception.",

This study examined risk and resilience factors in adolescents’ adjustment following the May 2023 Emilia Romagna flood. We investigated trajectories of positive/negative emotions and sleep–wake problems post-disaster, testing whether pre-disaster objective sleep (duration, efficiency, timing) served as promotive or protective resilience factors. Moderating roles of individual assets (circadian preferences) and contextual risks (disaster exposure) were also assessed. To this aim, this longitudinal study followed a sample of 385 adolescents (Mage = 15.46, SDage = 1.16, 53.8% females) across five waves from September 2022 to February 2024. The flooding event occurred midway. Results showed that regarding post-disaster trajectories, adolescents reported reductions in negative emotions and wake disturbances and increases in positive emotions within three months after the flooding. However, these trends partially reversed between three and six months. Concluding, this study advances the understanding of adolescent post-disaster adjustment highlighting the complex interplay of resilience patterns in adolescent post-disaster adjustment. Inter-individual differences in sleep quality and regularity should be targeted to foster positive trajectories, with attention to individual and contextual moderators.",

          "authors": "Anna Hollis; Phoebe E. McKenna-Plumley; Raluca Roman; Gary John McKeown",
          "abstract": "Autistic adults experience disproportionately high levels of loneliness, often influenced by social environments that are inaccessible or unaccommodating, rather than a lack of social interest. To address this, some individuals have turned to digital tools, such as companion chatbots, which simulate emotionally supportive conversations as an alternative means of connection. This article critically examines the role of chatbots in alleviating loneliness and promoting the well-being of autistic adults. Following a brief overview of chatbot companions’ technologies and current theories of loneliness dimensions, this argument examines whether these technologies truly provide meaningful support for autistic individuals. By analysing chatbots through the lens of methodologies frequently proposed to mitigate loneliness, the paper highlights the benefits of these technologies in conjunction with ethical considerations, emotional risks, and design limitations—particularly when grounded in normative assumptions regarding communication, loneliness, and relationships. It concludes that, although companion chatbots may function as temporary support for companionship, they must be developed in accordance with neurodivergence-affirming principles to effectively alleviate loneliness and avoid further isolation or dependence for autistic users.",

          "abstract": "Ideals play important roles in human life and psychology. Over the past decade, several mindfulness-based interventions have directly cultivated ideal mentalities that have not yet been achieved at the level of humanity, leading to the establishment of ideal psychology. Beyond research on ideal mentalities, ideal psychology has evolved into a general psychological approach characterized by future-oriented perspectives and associated methodologies. This article provides the first detailed introduction of this emerging approach. It summarizes six features of ideal mentalities, presents the design–achievement–evaluation cycle for research on them, and outlines seven methodological principles for enhancing studies on both ideal and existing mentalities with similar features. It further illustrates three aspects of future-oriented perspectives that shape research, through which it clarifies how ideal psychology relates to previous schools of psychology such as critical psychology, positive psychology, and transpersonal psychology, as well as to other traditions including Eastern spiritual traditions, Marxism and the critical tradition, transhumanism, and Plato’s philosophy. The article also exemplifies recent applications of ideal psychology in cultivating ideal mentalities such as mentalities of emptiness, Confucian oneness, and the nondifferential four immeasurables, as well as in advancing research on existing mentalities such as mindfulness, mortality salience, and beliefs about human nature. Finally, it discusses the major contributions, limitations, and future directions of ideal psychology.",

          "abstract": "Most research on social support in diabetes management lacks detail on the specific behaviours involved. This narrative review identifies the types of social support behaviours that aid management of Type 2 diabetes. After searching five databases (62 included papers), we conducted a qualitative synthesis using a five-category taxonomy. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently reported, alongside social contact, belonging, and informational guidance. Emotional support included sharing experiences, feeling cared for, esteem support, and having someone available when needed. For care providers, key processes were building rapport, assessing needs, and offering both emotional and practical assistance. Some support, such as shared experiences, information, and belonging, may be ‘invisible,’ reducing the risk of obligation or dependency. Supportive behaviours that strengthen self-efficacy were especially beneficial for diabetes management. These findings provide a resource for designing interventions and guiding caregivers. Health services offering effective social support are more likely to improve diabetes outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Although absolute pitch (AP) is often celebrated as a rare musical gift, Western tonal music relies on relative pitch (RP), where meaning depends on intervals to the tonic. This contrast furnishes a natural test bed for cognitive control: AP is an automatic, stimulus-bound code, whereas RP requires context-dependent computation. We tested 50 non–music-major students spanning the AP proficiency continuum on a movable-Do solfa-naming task under three tonal contexts of rising difficulty (fixed C major, fixed B major, randomly shifting keys). AP gave an overall advantage, yet error pattern and response time analyses showed systematic strategy switching among AP possessors: (i) AP use in C major, (ii) pitch name transposition in B major, and (iii) interval/chord listening in random keys, with individual differences. Non AP participants relied on RP across conditions. Thus, scale note identification recruits adaptive strategy selection governed by AP proficiency, tonal context, and cognitive load, illustrating cognitive control in a naturalistic musical task and motivating tailored ear training in music education.",

          "abstract": "Why do some disapproved acts seem more moral when they are widespread, while rare acts of goodness often appear especially praiseworthy? Existing theories of moral judgment emphasize either intrinsic features of actions (e.g., harm, cooperation) or the stable values of judges (e.g., moral foundations), yet they lack a formal account of how judgments are shaped by the normative contexts in which behaviors occur. We introduce Contextual Normative Morality Theory (CNMT), which proposes that moral judgments emerge from the interaction of perceived descriptive norms (commonness) and injunctive norms (approval). Across five studies and one supplemental study with nationally representative U.S. samples (total N = 2,562), we show that this injunctive by descriptive interaction robustly predicts moral evaluations. Disapproved behaviors were judged less harshly when common, whereas approved behaviors were judged more moral when rare. These effects replicated across naturalistic behaviors, held when directly manipulating norms around the same act, extended to fictional and participant-generated behaviors, and predicted not only moral judgments but also perceptions of harmfulness and cooperativeness. Moreover, models predicting moral judgment that included the injunctive by descriptive interaction alongside perceptions of harmfulness, cooperativeness, and moral values showed better fit than models relying on harm, cooperation, or values alone. Together, these findings highlight the neglected role of normative context, advancing a more flexible, socially embedded theory of morality.",

We tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) reduces anger in intoxicated vs. sober participants during instructed regulation of recalled anger. One hundred ninety-six healthy adults consumed alcohol or no beverage and received anodal or sham tDCS over the rVLPFC. During stimulation, participants used cognitive reappraisal, distraction, or rumination to regulate recalled anger. As expected, anger was lowest after distraction, intermediate after reappraisal, and highest after rumination. Contrary to predictions, there were no main effects of alcohol, stimulation, or their interaction. Exploratory analyses indicated that among intoxicated participants high in trait anger, anodal stimulation reduced anger following rumination compared to sham. Alcohol also amplified anger in individuals prone to angry rumination. These findings highlight the need for replication and refinement of tDCS protocols to better target intoxicated anger regulation.",

          "authors": "Meng Cao; Paulo F. Carvalho",
          "abstract": "The ability to generalize and apply knowledge to new situations is the hallmark of effective learning. There are multiple ways to improve learning towards generalization. Retrieval practice and worked examples have both been shown to improve learning, retention, and generalization. The literature on category learning also suggests that exposure to more varied examples, rather than the same example repeatedly, improves generalization. However, while retrieval practice is usually investigated with repeated examples, worked examples learning is usually investigated using varied content. Across two studies, we investigated how the combination of content variability during worked examples or retrieval practice instruction promotes generalization when students receive initial instruction before practice (Experiment 1) and when they do not (Experiment 2). We found that when learners received initial instruction, retrieval practice led to better generalization compared to worked examples, regardless of whether the stimuli were repeated or varied. When initial instruction was not provided, worked examples resulted in better generalization than retrieval practice when items were repeated. However, retrieval practice produced comparable generalization to worked examples when items were varied. These findings suggest that variability supports generalization, particularly when learners must induce underlying rules, and that retrieval practice, traditionally associated with memory retention, can also facilitate inductive learning when learners engage with varied examples. This study emphasizes the importance of adapting learning strategies to align with the stage of learning and task demands.",

          "abstract": "In the caste system, individuals affiliated with unalterable, endogamous groups interact within a framework of expected behavior and attitudes organized around groups (i.e., hierarchical relationships of pollution vs. purity). This structure creates a psychological reality (i.e., the consciousness of an individual as expressed in behaviors and attitudes such as identities, rituals, expectations, motivations, perceptions, worldviews, and restrictions) that has not been adequately studied. In the present study, we developed a tentative Likert-type scale of caste consciousness by following standard test development procedures: Generation of a large set of relevant items, item analyses conducted by experts, and subsequent follow-up checks. Subsequently, this scale was administered to a sample of 892 college students (age: M= 19.9 years, SD= 3.8) and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. The exploratory factor analysis reported a correlated five factor structure for caste consciousness, i.e., pro-social personality traits, life approach, inter-group relationship dread, concerns of status, and perception of others. The confirmatory factor analysis supported this five factor structure and showed strong measurement invariance across caste, gender, residential area, and religion in the shortened caste consciousness scale. Moreover, we found that Muslim, other backward caste, and women had lower caste consciousness. Conversely, scheduled caste had higher inter-group relationship dread and general caste (compared to other backward caste) had higher perception of others.  The present study developed a reliable and valid 28-item caste consciousness scale that may be valuable for the psychological study of caste system.",

          "abstract": "Young children must determine from whom to seek help, yet little is known about how they weigh different social cues when forming help-seeking expectations and how such weighting shift during preschool years. The present research examined how children aged 4 to 6 years integrated relationship type (mother vs. unfamiliar adult) and competence cues in a third-party prediction task. In Study 1 (N = 194), 4-year-olds expected help-seekers to turn to mothers regardless of competence, whereas 5- and 6-year-olds increasingly incorporated competence in predicting both mothers and unfamiliar adults. In Study 2 (N = 106), 5- and 6-year-olds preferred competent unfamiliar adults over incompetent mothers, while 4-year-olds showed no clear preference. These findings reveal a developmental shift from reliance on relationship type to growing sensitivity to competence, providing support for the developmental relationship primacy hypothesis. More broadly, the results highlight how young children flexibly integrate multiple social cues in help-seeking contexts, underscoring the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of attachment representations as developing social-cognitive systems.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma is highly prevalent, affecting over half of adults, yet its impact on mental imagery remains largely unexplored. Here we report a novel link between childhood adversity and impaired mental imagery. We examined imagery deficits in a community sample (N=317) using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire. Severe emotional abuse was strongly associated with acquired imagery deficits. Individuals with severe emotional abuse demonstrated 4-5 times higher rates of acquired imagery deficits (14-21%) compared to those with low trauma exposure (3-5%), with effects observed across the full imagery spectrum. Given that severe emotional abuse affects 15-16% of the population, prevalence estimates suggest 2-3% of the general population may experience trauma-related imagery impairment. This association may reflect disrupted stress-regulation systems that impair integration of bodily, emotional, and visual information necessary for mental imagery. These findings reveal a previously overlooked consequence of childhood trauma with significant clinical implications, as many evidence-based trauma interventions rely on intact visualization abilities.",

Despite their relative privilege (e.g., being white, English speaking, having higher socioeconomic status), almost all caregivers described situations in which power imbalances impacted PRS access, procedures, and outcomes. Specifically, caregivers tended to describe investigations that lacked transparency, failed to address all aspects of their complaint, did not include findings of fact, exceeded mandated timelines, and included remedies that they believed did not fully account for lost opportunities or the harm done to their child. Some caregivers also described situations in which local education agencies repeatedly made the same violations and failed to provide mandated remedies.

          "abstract": "Background: Psychopathology and cognitive impairment are common consequences of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but their interrelationships remain poorly understood. Clarifying these relationships is important for understanding how cognitive functioning may contribute to post-TBI psychopathology and for informing targeted, holistic assessment and treatment strategies. Traditional categorical approaches to psychiatric diagnosis have produced inconsistent results, potentially due to limitations in capturing the complexity of post-TBI psychopathology. The recently developed Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology Following TBI (HiTOP-TBI) model, a transdiagnostic dimensional framework, was applied to examine associations between psychopathology and cognitive functioning. \nMethods: Ninety-nine participants with moderate-severe TBI (mean age 50.86 years; 72% male) completed self-report psychopathology questionnaires and performance-based cognitive tasks. Linear regressions examined associations between ten hierarchically organised HiTOP-TBI dimensions (one general factor, two broad internalizing and externalizing spectra, seven lower-order factors) and cognitive measures, with false discovery rate correction applied. \nResults: After correction, higher scores (indicating greater psychopathology) on the HiTOP-TBI dimensions of Externalizing Problems, Rigid Constraint, and Self-Harm and Psychoticism were associated with poorer performance on the verbal encoding task. Higher scores on Rigid Constraint and Self-Harm and Psychoticism were also associated with lower scores in the episodic memory domain (encompassing both immediate and delayed recall). In comparison, General Problems, Internalizing Problems, Somatic Symptoms, Detachment, Compensatory and Phobic Reactions, Dysregulated Negative Emotionality, and Harmful Substance Use were not significantly associated with cognitive functioning after correction. \nConclusions: Applying the transdiagnostic, dimensional HiTOP-TBI framework, we identified several associations between psychopathology and cognitive functioning after moderate-severe TBI, with verbal encoding and memory most consistently implicated, particularly within externalizing domains. These findings highlight the importance of holistic neuropsychological formulation and integrative interventions aimed at improving both emotional and cognitive outcomes in TBI and demonstrate the value of transdiagnostic approaches in neuropsychology research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary theories of consciousness offer a range of explanatory perspectives. Global Workspace Theory emphasizes cognitive access, Higher-Order Theories focus on metacognitive representation, Integrated Information Theory centers on intrinsic experience, and Predictive Coding Theory models cognitive processes as probabilistic inference. While each theory provides valuable insights, they often remain in conflict due to differing assumptions about the nature of consciousness. This paper proposes a phenomenologically informed framework that clarifies the explanatory scope of each theory in relation to key features of lived experience. Rather than seeking to reduce consciousness to a single principle, I argue for a pluralistic approach that respects the distinctive contributions of each model. Through comparative analysis guided by phenomenological reflection and supported by recent interdisciplinary proposals, I show how these theories can be seen as addressing complementary dimensions of consciousness. The aim is not to construct a single unified theory, but to demonstrate how integration, grounded in reflective phenomenological analysis, can serve as a starting point toward a more adequate science of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Individual differences in psychology are often measured through self-report questionnaires or behavioral performance, yet these approaches capture different constructs and rarely align. Computational modeling provides a framework for connecting both measures, as it extracts a process-level description of cognition from observable behavior in the form of latent variables. These latent variables represent repeated patterns of decision-making that should relate to psychological traits. We applied this approach to neuroethical decision-making, where evidence shows that both behavioral performance and self-reported psychological traits are related to how individuals weigh uncertain risks against potential benefits of emerging brain technologies. Participants completed a neuromodulation task in which risk and benefit probabilities were systematically varied. To capture how decisions unfolded, we used a temporally sensitive diffusion decision model that estimates when and how risks and benefits are evaluated. These model parameters described general trends in task behavior: individuals considered risks earlier and weighed risks more highly than benefits. Additionally, model parameters described how individuals modified their behavior: individuals who considered benefits first according to the model tended to endorse neuromodulation, but shifted towards rejection when risks were evaluated earlier. Importantly, self-reported psychological traits related to these computational parameters. Cognitive factors such as risk propensity and numeracy related to risk sensitivity and evaluation timing, while prosocial traits were also related to evaluation timing and benefit sensitivity. By contrast, Religion &amp; Spirituality and Moral Commitment measures showed lower than expected associations across parameters. By capturing process-level mechanisms, computational modeling served as a bridge between self-reported traits and observed behavior, showing how stable individual differences shape the dynamics of decision-making in neuroethical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Developing an integrated understanding of brain function demands to probe and alter neural activity in behaving animals. Although rodent species were initially considered ill-suited for studying the neural mechanisms supporting high-level cognition, the past two decades have seen a remarkable increase in the sophistication of behaviors that rodents can express in laboratory settings. However, establishing adequate behavioral paradigms and eﬃciently shaping rodent behavior in the lab are challenging such that the study of instructed behaviors remains confined to a handful of groups with hard-earned expertise. While detailed technical explanations are available for establishing specific behavioral setups, a general framework for how to instruct behaviors in lab animals is lacking. Here, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic introduction of how to best design lab tasks and train animals in these tasks. We delineate conceptual principles that cover all aspects of behavioral investigations in the lab; ranging from the choice of a model species and behavioral apparatus to the design of an automatic shaping trajectory, the monitoring of task acquisition and the reduction of variability in behavioral outcomes. For clarity, we illustrate these principles with specific examples borrowed from the literature. We also highlight which of these principles are rooted in theoretical work and experimental investigations, in contrast with those reflecting heuristics. Our hope is that by providing these guidelines, we help democratize the wide adoption of instructed behaviors in neuroscientific investigations which is essential in our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cognition.",

          "title": "Predicting Vocabulary Development in Bilingual Children Using Early Measures of Word Comprehension",
          "authors": "Erin Smolak; Eve Michaud; Diane Poulin-Dubois",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Although prior research has found that vocabulary and speed of lexical access in toddlerhood predict language development later in childhood, whether relations are significant appears to depend on differences across studies in task and participant characteristics. The current study expands on these findings by comparing the relative predictive utility of vocabulary and two measures of speed of lexical access to later vocabulary development in simultaneous bilingual children. \nMethodology: Participants included 32 French-English bilingual children in a longitudinal cohort study tested at 23 months, age three, and age four. At 23 months, children completed a two-alternative forced choice measure of vocabulary from which we coded decontextualized receptive vocabulary, and speed of lexical access operationalized as visual response latency and haptic response latency. At ages three and four, children completed a standardized receptive vocabulary assessment.\nData and Analysis: We examined the relation between 23-month predictors and outcomes using correlational and regression analyses.\nFindings/Conclusions: Decontextualized vocabulary at 23 months predicted vocabulary outcomes at ages three and four. Visual response latency predicted vocabulary at age three, but not age four. Haptic response latency predicted vocabulary at age four, but not age three. Neither vocabulary nor latency was significant when controlling for the effects of the other predictors.\nOriginality: This is the first study to investigate the relation between multiple direct measures of vocabulary and lexical access and language outcomes in bilingual children.\nSignificance/Implications: This study contributes to our understanding of toddler language measures and how demand characteristics interact with participant characteristics to influence the roles of these measures in predicting later outcomes. \nLimitations: Given the small sample size and limited outcome measures, results should be interpreted with some caution and used to guide future research on early predictors of long-term vocabulary development in bilingual children.",

          "abstract": "Objective: We examined changes in SU expectancies following PTEs in a community-based cohort of early adolescents for three common substances used by teens (alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine) how those changes affected SU itself. \nMethods: We leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,868, 48% female, 52% White), containing annual assessments of PTEs, SU expectancies, and SU itself from ages 10 to 14 years old. Using multilevel models to estimate between- and within-person effects, we tested whether PTEs predict negative and positive expectancies for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine concurrently and prospectively and whether those expectancies forecast subsequent use. \nResults: At the between-person level, PTEs were associated with increased negative and positive SU expectancies and subsequently associated with greater use itself directly and indirectly via positive expectancies concurrently and prospectively. At the within-person level, PTEs were associated with increased negative and positive SU expectancies concurrently but not prospectively. PTEs were associated with increases in SU directly and indirectly via positive expectancies, and decreases in cannabis and nicotine use only via negative expectancies. But prospectively, PTEs were only associated with greater SU directly and not indirectly via positive or negative expectancies. \nConclusions: Closer in time to each other, PTEs heighten the saliency of both positive and negative expectancies; however, over time, the effect of PTEs on expectancies seems to diminish. Current findings highlight a temporal window for optimal intervention to prevent SU by challenging beliefs that substances are helpful following PTEs and leveraging negative beliefs about SU following PTEs.",

          "abstract": "The high capacity of human iconic memory (IM) has been taken as evidence that visual experience is rich and detailed, as introspection suggests. Opponents to this view argue instead that this impression is illusory, with conscious access being mostly limited to what we can attend to. To provide evidence of either view, in this registered report we compared metacognitive sensitivity levels between IM and working memory (WM) representations. The rationale was that, if pre-attentive IM information is as consciously accessible as attention-bounded WM information, metacognitive sensitivity should be comparable across the two memory systems. Replicating classic findings, our results showed that IM capacity exceeded WM capacity. Nevertheless, and despite matched performance, metacognitive sensitivity was higher in WM. We further examined whether reduced metacognition in IM could be explained by inflation—the tendency to overestimate perceptual richness—by comparing confidence levels across the two memory conditions. Pre-registered analyses showed no evidence of inflation, as IM was associated with lower confidence. Our findings suggest that IM supports identification with less consciously accessible information than WM, challenging rich-view interpretations of conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Measuring Formal Thought Disorder (FTD), a common, cross-diagnosed symptom dimension across mental disorders, is plagued by numerous inconsistencies. Clinicians use either FTD-specific scales or items from generic scales. While these tools are based on extensive clinical observations, they suffer from inconsistent terminology. Different scales may use the same term for distinct concepts or different terms for the same concept. This lack of conceptual standardization prevents the identification of underlying FTD subconstructs. By using natural language processing, we compared the definitions, labeling and overlap of FTD symptoms across psychopathological scales.\nWe used a three-pronged validation approach to analyze semantic clusters of FTD scale items. First, we used sentence-BERT to divide 30 Thought and Language Disorder scale (TALD) items into positive or negative FTD clusters, validating this approach by checking for correspondence with published factor-analytic divisions (approach validation). Second, we created a sparse item-to-item similarity matrix from 103 items across seven scales to identify semantically converging cross-scale FTD items; a clinician-researcher described the resulting four clusters, and we compared our automated classification with that of six blinded experts to establish expert-machine semantic correspondence. Finally, we analyzed data from 98 participants (49 healthy controls and 49 schizophrenia/affective psychosis), identifying the highest-correlating Clinical Language Disorder Scale (CLANG) item for each Thought, Language and Communication (TLC) scale item and mapping these to our BERT-derived clusters to establish data-level correspondence.\nWhen assigning TALD items to BERT-derived positive or negative FTD groupings, we observed a 73% match with prior factor analyses. The BERT-informed clustering of cross-scale items highlighted four coherent FTD groupings; 1) muddled communication &amp; incomprehension. 2) abrupt topic shifts. 3) inconsistent narrative structure, 4) restricted speech. Expert raters showed moderate-to-high overlap (Fleiss’ kappa = .617) with computational clusters. A binomial test indicated that at the level of individual participants, correlations among CLANG-TLC item pairs were significantly more likely than chance to fall into the expected semantic cluster (p &lt; .001). \nOur results indicates that FTD rating scales measure overlapping, semantically related constructs that drive item-level correlations. Semantic clustering acts as a novel method to harmonize multi-scale data and pinpoint discrepancies between expert and machine classifications. Computational linguistics has the potential to improve consistency across rating scales especially when measuring complex constructs such as FTD.",

          "abstract": "Background and aims. Chasing refers to continuing and/or intensifying gambling following\nlosses (loss-chasing) and/or wins (win-chasing). It is commonly captured between sessions,\ni.e., returning another day/time after losses or wins in prior sessions. Between-session chasing\nis a hallmark of problematic gambling, but the current understanding of between-session\nchasing in field settings remains limited. Methods. Using a large-scale player-tracking dataset\n(11,156 gamblers; ~170 million bets), we assessed between-session chasing via time of return.\nUsing pre-registered analyses, we assessed time of return as a function of (a) prior session\noutcome (win/loss), (b) outcome magnitude, (c) game type (Multi-line Slots, Dice game,\nEuropean Roulette and Multi-hand European Blackjack) and (d) gambler’ s involvement level\n(high/low; defined based on monetary and time expenditure). Results. Confirmatory results\nindicated that overall gamblers returned faster following a winning than a losing session. They\nreturned faster when previous outcome magnitude (both wins and losses) increased.\nFurthermore, return times of slot gamblers were less sensitive to prior session outcome than\nother products. Exploratory results indicated that return times of high-involvement gamblers\nwere less sensitive to prior session outcome than low-involvement gamblers. Discussion and\nConclusions. The current results indicate a pattern of both loss- and win-chasing,\ndemonstrating that the break-even, house-money and wealth effects may be at play. Decreased\nsensitivity to prior session outcome among slot and high-involvement gamblers may be\nattributed to habituation. Future research could disentangle these multi-causal mechanisms, to\nevaluate time of return as a potential behavioural marker of harm, for better identification and\nmitigation of problem gambling.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive decision-making requires balancing exploitation of known rewarding options with exploration of uncertain alternatives, a dilemma also known as the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. While this framework has been widely studied in reinforcement learning research, its relevance to coping, defined as the cognitive and behavioral strategies that individuals use to manage stress and uncertainty, remains underexplored. Maladaptive coping may reflect rigidity in exploitation or ineffective exploration, whereas adaptive coping may involve flexible adjustment of control in changing environments. In this study, we examined whether interindividual differences in the transition dynamics between explore and exploit strategy predict coping styles in a large online general population sample. A total of 1732 participants completed a three-armed restless bandit task, and their latent explore-exploit strategy states and transition patterns were modeled using a Hidden Markov Model. These computational indices of explore-exploit dynamics were then linked to self-reported psychological coping strategies using regression and canonical correlation analysis. Individuals with a greater tendency to persist in exploitative states reported less reliance on avoidant and emotion-focused coping, whereas exploratory tendencies showed distinct associations with externally oriented coping strategies. Unsupervised clustering of exploration-exploitation dynamics further revealed four distinct decision-making subtypes, each associated with unique coping profiles. These findings provide the first evidence that computational markers of explore-exploit control dynamics relate to psychological coping profiles, offering mechanistic insight into psychological adaptation and resilience.",

In this critical review, we examine the most striking findings on facial perception of narcissism, with the aim  of analyzing the extent to which facial features can be considered valid cues for inferring narcissism. Our analysis suggests that, compared with other Dark Triad traits, narcissism is the most detectable trait. We address the possible psychological mechanisms underlying this association, as well as the role of methodological artifacts that could influence the obtained effects. We propose a dominance-based explanation for this association that could explain some of the existing controversies in the literature. We conclude that the association between facial features and narcissism should be interpreted with caution, given its important consequences.",

In the field of cybernetics, this was understood to be teleological, or purposeful improvement over time. Early cyberneticists proposed a means to classify behaviors in a way that distinguishes between random behaviors and more controlled behaviors. Therefore, we begin by providing a history of teleological phenomena, exploring its multitude of current forms.We then take our own perspective, revising the behavioral typology presented in Rosenbleuth et.al in several ways, exploring alternatives to their stated examples. In the process, the concept of cybernetic imperatives is introduced, which provides an alternative to goal-directed, purposeful behavior. Cybernetic imperatives describe behaviors observed in a wide range of processes and real-world dynamics, building up from random processes to refined and so-called purposeful behaviors. To conclude, we consider how cybernetic imperatives lead to behavioral and regulatory complexity.",

          "abstract": "Hearing our own voice is commonly assumed to be an unpleasant experience. In contrast, some studies of voice perception have reported that we actually find our own voice to be more attractive than other voices. It remains however unclear whether previously observed enhancements of self-voice attractiveness were mediated by the recognition of the self-voice during the task, because recognition was never explicitly and rigorously examined in previous studies. We therefore conducted a voice attractiveness rating task under conditions that limited the likelihood of self-voice recognition, in order to directly compare the perceived attractiveness of one’s own voice when recognised versus when not. We found that both participants who did (N=59) and did not (N=80) recognise their own voice rated their own voice differently from other voices. However, crucially, the direction of this difference depended on whether the self-voice was recognised during the task or not: listeners who spontaneously recognised their voice rated it as more attractive than other voices, whereas listeners who did not recognise their voice rated it as less attractive. The findings help to explain one source of contradictory perspectives in the voice perception literature and beyond. highlighting the intricate interplay between self-perception, first impressions, and identity perception.",

A total of 121 participants were tested up to three months later on putting waypoints of the route in the correct order and recalling directions at waypoints. Memory accuracy declined over time, consistent with classic memory theory. Route knowledge was retained more robustly than sequential order, highlighting the importance of contextual retrieval cues. Landmark presence, decision-point complexity, and route features modulated recall, demonstrating that both task and environmental characteristics influence spatial memory. A hierarchical Bayesian regression model quantified forgetting with median memory accuracy, capturing uncertainty across individual variability of participants and the environment in the experiment. Predicted accuracy decreased from approximately 91% initially to 77% after 12 weeks, and to approximately 72-75% after 6-12 months indicating that a substantial portion of spatial knowledge is retained over long intervals. By applying memory theory to analyse retention data, this study addresses a gap in the safety training field by providing a theory-driven approach to quantifying training effectiveness, enabling evidence-based design and assessment of safety and evacuation training in practice.",

More interestingly,\nparticipants exhibit a robust preference for low-effort risky choice pairs in a novel Demand\nAvoidance Task, which we modeled after well-characterized effort preference paradigms used in\nthe cognitive control domain. Finally, using pupillometry, we find that participants, contrary to\nour expectations, exhibit larger task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs)—a well-characterized\nmeasure of momentary effort exertion—when choosing between low-demand risky choice pairs,\nand that these TEPR magnitudes predicted demand-avoidant preferences in a subsequent test\nphase.

Children’s gender categorizations became more efficient with age, particularly when primed with race.

          "abstract": "Navigating changes is fundamental to everyday life and requires updating existing memories to incorporate new details. This study examined mechanisms underlying how reinstating an earlier event’s context during a later event influences memory for both events. Two theories predict opposite outcomes. Interference theory holds that reinstating context from an existing memory while experiencing a new, overlapping event produces response competition and impairs memory for both. In contrast, integration theory predicts that context reinstatement cues retrieval of earlier memories, enabling associative encoding of past and present events that enhances memory. Prior work favors the latter, showing that reinstatement improves memory. Three experiments extended this work by directly testing roles for study-phase retrievals and change awareness during study and test. Word pairs with shared cues but changed responses (A-B, A-D) were presented with background contexts that either repeated or changed. Repeating contexts increased detection of changes and recall of earlier responses during study, both indexes of study-phase retrievals, as well as later cued recall of earlier (B) and changed (D) responses. The recall benefit was proportional to the extent of study-phase retrievals, implicating retrieval practice. Moreover, the effect was enhanced when participants remembered that changes had occurred, highlighting the role of recollecting integrated representations that included change attributes. These findings align with integration theory, suggesting that memory updating is most effective when current events cue retrieval of prior memories and engender associative encoding of past and present events, establishing elaborate representations that support subsequent recall.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Adolescence is a developmental period during which many mental health problems emerge or worsen. Recently, there has been a shift towards identifying risk factors that predict psychopathology across a range of diagnostic boundaries – known as ‘transdiagnostic’ approaches (Astle et al., 2022). There are several social and emotional risk factors for specific mental health diagnoses that have been well-characterised. Yet, there is limited understanding about how these socio-affective risk factors map onto transdiagnostic symptoms. In this study, we identified profiles of socio-affective functioning in early adolescence and how these profiles predict transdiagnostic symptoms of mental health problems. \nMethods: Adolescents at heightened risk of general psychopathology aged 12-14 (N=559, Mage = 13.26, SDage = 0.72, 58.14% female) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaire and task-based measures assessing emotion functioning (emotion perception, emotion regulation, and interoception), social relationships (with peers and family members), and mental health. Using a simple artificial neural network that projects a high-dimensional input to a 2D topology we were able to map differences in questionnaire- and task-based socio-affective profiles. Clustering was then used to identify zones within that 2D topology, indicating relatively homogenous profiles. Associations between these zones and transdiagnostic mental health symptoms were examined.  \nFindings: We identified three reliable clusters of socio-affective functioning from the questionnaire measures and four clusters from the task-based measures. There were significant differences between questionnaire clusters on general psychopathology and internalising symptoms, whereas there were only significant differences between task clusters on general psychopathology. \nConclusion: This study demonstrated the potential of data-driven methods to derive profiles of socio-affective functioning that are associated with transdiagnostic mental health problems. Through identifying socio-affective mechanisms that characterise these clusters, these findings can be used to identify active ingredients for future intervention development to prevent the onset and worsening of mental health problems in adolescence.",

Followed by an acceptable reliability, and a positive significant correlation with Conscientiousness and Openness to experience, and a negative and significant relationship with Neuroticism was found.\nConclusion. The unidimensional 5-item Need for cognition is the only model that showed an adequate fit on the different datasets. Also, the 5-item scale showed to be a valid and reliable instrument for its use in Lima, Peru.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

Our results reveal that some models demonstrate theoretical fluency, specialization in certain cognitive tasks, or even phenomenological exploration, while others default to deflection.

          "abstract": "Participants in creativity studies sometimes produce invalid data that is unusable for analysis, such as nonsensical or incomplete responses to idea generation tasks. Identifying such responses is a time-consuming yet necessary process to ensure robust results but also remains challenging to automate. We explore the efficacy of transformer language models (TLMs) for automatically detecting invalid creativity responses, using only the text prompt and response and no other metadata about the experimental session. We train a suite of transformers to detect invalid data for two creativity assessments: the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a design problems task (DPT). We find that transformers generally outperform other baselines for both tasks. Further, we show that TLMs’ predictions are well calibrated to the quality of the participant response, ensuring that model failures will occur in a predictable way and that high-quality responses are unlikely to be labeled invalid. Finally, we conduct a fairness analysis based on language background—using an adversarial study where participants attempt to “break” the model by coming up with invalid responses that are nonetheless labeled valid. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods for cleaning creativity assessment data, using solely participant responses, in a reliable and unbiased way.",

These variations could be attributed to differences in the way people define themselves, known as “self-construal”. Previous cross-cultural studies on the role of self-construal in cognitive dissonance have mainly employed the free-choice paradigm. However, many concerns have been raised about the validity of this procedure and these studies, more generally. To address this issue, we will conduct secondary analyses to explore unexamined associations in a large existing dataset (Vaidis et al., 2024). Specifically, the current study will investigate the moderating role of individual (self-construal) and cultural (individualism) variables on dissonance effects following an induced-compliance paradigm across 18 countries (N = 3822). Based on the literature, we hypothesised that induced-compliance effects (i.e., adjusting attitude to match behaviour, particularly when it has been adopted freely) will be stronger for participants with higher individual self-construal scores (H1), in more individualistic countries (H2), and in countries with higher aggregated levels of independent self-construal (H3).

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into daily life, not only as tools but also as social partners that people may turn to for interaction and support. This raises important questions about whether, how, and why individuals form attachment-like bonds with AI, and what psychological implications such attachments may carry. Across five studies involving 1259 participants from Singapore and the US, the current work developed and validated the AI Attachment Scale and investigated the dispositional and motivational factors that predict attachment to AI, as well as its emotional and social outcomes. The AI Attachment Scale displayed strong psychometrics properties, including a reliable three-factor structure comprising of emotional closeness, social substitution, and normative regard subscales, strong convergent validity and discriminant validity, and high test–retest reliability. Examination of correlates revealed that time spent on AI, particularly for socioemotional purposes, was a strong predictor of AI attachment. Individuals higher in social anxiety, loneliness, and anxious attachment were also more likely to turn to AI as a compensatory surrogate when human connections were lacking. These tendencies were further linked to dispositional needs that AI fulfils, including closure through predictability, relatedness through socioemotional presence, and competence through affirming feedback. At the same time, stronger AI attachment is associated with heightened positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting that AI attachment may satisfy the psychological needs and provide meaningful emotional benefits. These findings provide the first validated measure of attachment to AI and offer a foundation for future research on its psychological and societal implications.",

The goal of the current study is to investigate whether procedural and\ndeclarative knowledge can contribute simultaneously to categorization response selection\nbehavior. We designed a stimulus set in which information learned by each system sometimes\nsupports different responses, and created trials in the test phase that are designed to maximize\nsuch divergence. Participants were instructed to use a completely diagnostic, verbalizable, shape-\nbased rule to categorize exemplars, receiving feedback after each trial. However, unbeknownst to\nparticipants, the categories also differed probabilistically in their color distributions. Participants\nused both color (learned procedurally) and shape (learned declaratively) to categorize exemplars,\nresponding more quickly when both sources indicated the same category judgement, and more\nslowly when they conflicted. Debriefing confirmed that most participants were unaware of the\ncolor distributions. These results show simultaneous trial-level contributions from both\ndeclarative and procedural memory systems.

          "abstract": "Background\nSocial defeat is often cited as a motive for suicide. The experience of defeat may arise from feeling dominated in a dyadic conflict or from losing status in a group. We hypothesize that sensitivity to dyadic defeat will be related to the onset of suicidal behavior in early or mid-life and sensitivity to loss of status, in late life.\n\nMethods\nThe study’s sample of 245 adults aged 50+ years (mean=63.2 years, SD=7.4) comprised 42 early-onset and 32 late-onset suicide attempters (aged &lt;50 vs ≥50 years at their first suicide attempt), 114 depressed non-attempter comparisons, and 57 non-psychiatric comparisons. Using a validated rigged video game tournament task, we operationalized compensatory responses to the two forms of social defeat as point stealing from individual opponents (one-on-one defeat) and rank buying in the league table (loss of status in a group).\n\nResults\nEarly-onset attempters increased point stealing the most over time (χ23=22.37, p&lt;.001), whereas late-onset attempters purchased more rank after losing trials than early-onset attempters and non-psychiatric comparisons (χ23=9.47, p=.024). Each effect was robust to adjusting for age and sex, other effects of interest, and to the exclusion of stereotypic responders.\n\nConclusions\nOur behavioral findings suggest that socio-behavioral processes leading to suicide vary across the life cycle. While vulnerability to dyadic defeat could be suicidogenic for people of any age, loss of social status could play a role in suicidal crises specifically occurring in later life.",

We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

          "abstract": "Working memory and inhibitory control are widely regarded as core executive function components. Traditional executive function tasks often fail to isolate these components, as they are rarely “process-pure”. This study measured working memory and inhibitory control (both response inhibition and interference control) concurrently within single paradigms, while reducing rule-learning confounds. Two novel tasks were developed: a modified flanker task (targeting interference control) and a spatial conflict task (targeting response inhibition). Each task consisted of multiple blocks of flanker or spatial trials, respectively. Working memory load was manipulated by preloading digit sequences before each block of inhibition trials (ascending = low load, random = high load), recalled after each block. The digit sequences changed for every block to maintain ongoing working memory engagement. Ninety-eight participants completed the spatial conflict task and ninety-seven completed the flanker task. Bayesian repeated measures ANOVAs revealed robust main effects of working memory and congruency on reaction times in both tasks, but provided evidence against over-additive interactions. Findings support the functional separability of working memory (as measured by declarative preload) and both types of inhibitory control in adults and highlight the utility of combined paradigms for more efficient assessment of executive function components with reduced task-related variance.",

Secondary objectives are to examine potential moderating factors, such as socio-demographic characteristics, ecological identity, emotions, facilitator expertise and organisation status,  to qualitatively explore participants’ perceptions, motivations, and barriers.\nMethods: We will conduct a parallel, mixed-method RCT including 1,354 participants recruited from French organizations. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to either the experimental arm (The Climate Fresk, a three-hour interactive workshop) or the control arm (a one-hour lecture-style video). Primary outcomes are climate-related attitudes and pro-environmental behavioral intentions, assessed at baseline (T0) and one week post-intervention (T2). Secondary outcomes include ecological identity, emotions, and prior behaviors. Semi-structured interviews with a subsample of participants (n=20) will be conducted one month later (T3). Quantitative data will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, accounting for clustering by facilitator and organization. Qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis.\nDiscussion: This trial will provide the first large-scale, controlled evidence on the effectiveness of The Climate Fresk in shaping attitudes and intentions toward climate action. By integrating quantitative and qualitative insights, and considering moderating factors, it aims to advance understanding of gamified climate education and inform strategies to engage diverse populations in sustainability transitions.",

Participants used best-worst ratings to indicate how useful it is to know each word/expression. Our findings show a high level of agreement regarding the usefulness of words and expressions. Stimuli were rated as more useful if they were more frequent, widely known, learned early in life and central to the semantic network. Concreteness had a substantial negative correlation, indicating that abstract words in general received higher utility scores than concrete words. Positive stimuli received slightly lower utility scores than negative stimuli. Expected utility was a good predictor of which words are known to speakers of English as a first and second language, but did not contribute to predicting response times to known words.  These findings suggest that expected utility is a variable affecting which words are likely to be learned, but does not affect word processing times (much).

Study 1 (N = 1,231) revealed that anger relates to motives to aggress both directly and indirectly, whereas disgust relates only to motives to aggress indirectly. Study 2 (N = 930) extended these findings by showing that people infer greater direct aggression from anger expressions and greater indirect aggression from disgust expressions.

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem.

          "abstract": "The Recovery Knowledge Inventory (RKI) is a tool used to measure mental health practitioners' knowledge and attitudes towards recovery-oriented practices (Bedregal et al., 2006). This widely used tool is not yet available in French. This study aims to translate, culturally adapt, and validate a French version of the RKI (RKI-fr) within a population of French caregivers. \n\nFollowing standard guidelines, the 20-item scale was first translated using a back-translation method, resulting in a 20-item French version. After approval by the original authors, this version was completed online by 335 mental health practitioners working in psychiatric and addiction care in France. The responses were analyzed using Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT).\n\nThe initial 20-item model presented acceptable fit indices, even though two of the items had low factor loadings. After removing these items, the resulting 18-item version retained the same four-factor structure as the original, with acceptable marginal reliability coefficients for the 4 factors. This version also exhibited adequate and improved fit indices with RMSEA =.03; CI [0.02; 0.05]; SRMR=0.07; TLI=0.97; CFI= 0.98.\n\nThe challenges of cross-cultural translation, in particular, the semantic nuances of risk-taking items and stages of treatment, are discussed. These nuances may have influenced respondents’ interpretation, resulting in some items’ poor factor loading.\n\nThis 18-item French version (RKI-fr) provides an effective tool for assessing and promoting recovery-oriented practices in French-speaking contexts.",

          "abstract": "The development of formal models of decision making under risk has largely focused on monetary outcomes. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT), the most prominent model, describes monetary choices well but performs less well for nonmonetary, nonnumerical outcomes (e.g., medications with side effects). We suggest that affective processes, which are omitted in CPT, play a larger role in nonmonetary than in monetary choices, and propose two psychologically motivated modifications: (a) using affect ratings rather than monetary equivalents to represent the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes (affective valuation); and (b) allowing the probability weighting of an outcome to depend on the amount of affect triggered in a choice problem (affective probability weighting). In a model comparison involving four datasets (N=240), we show that the modifications improve model performance relative to standard CPT for the nonmonetary, but not for the monetary choices. A complementary eye-tracking study on nonmonetary choice (N=68) further supported the predictions of affective probability weighting: increasing risk aversion and decreasing attention to probabilities, as the affective value of the worst outcome in a choice problem increases. Our work integrates previous ideas on how affect modulates decision processes in naturalistic nonmonetary contexts and offers a refined framework for modeling such decisions.",

          "authors": "Chiara Ventris; Colin MacLeod; Daniel Rudaizky; Ben Grafton",
          "abstract": "People vary in their levels of anxiety vulnerability, and this could result from individual differences in underlying cognitive bias. Previous research has established that attentional bias to negative information about an upcoming stressor predicts the development of negative expectancies concerning this stressor, which in turn predict higher levels of anxiety vulnerability. The present study tested the hypothesis that negative attentional bias plays a causal role in this relationship. Participants (N = 71) were exposed to videos conveying negative and benign information concerning an upcoming stressor, in a task designed to induce either attentional bias towards or away from the negative information. This experimental manipulation was successful in creating two groups of participants who differed, as intended, in negative attentional bias. Consistent with the causal hypothesis under test, this experimental manipulation of attentional bias also resulted in a corresponding group difference in anxiety vulnerability, as indicated by level of subsequent state anxiety assessed proximal to the stressor. Moreover, also as predicted by this hypothesis, mediation analysis confirmed that the causal impact of the attentional bias manipulation on state anxiety was indirect, and was mediated by its direct causal impact on negative expectancy bias concerning the stressor. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that attentional bias to negative information concerning upcoming stressors serves causally to elevate level of state anxiety experienced proximal to such stressors, by driving the development of negative expectancies about them. We discuss the ways in which these results advance theoretical understanding and consider their potential applied implications",

          "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa and borderline personality disorder are both often characterized by a chronic, long-term course and high premature mortality. Despite their severity and overlapping clinical features such as emotional dysregulation, self-destructiveness, and disturbances in identity, they have rarely been examined together. This theoretical review synthesizes evidence across domains, with a primary focus on psychological research and theoretical integration. Existing findings indicate partial overlap in vulnerability pathways, including relational trauma, attachment insecurity, and maladaptive emotion regulation, while also revealing distinct contextual expressions - embodied through control and restriction in anorexia nervosa, and enacted interpersonally through attachment ruptures and invalidating relational dynamics in borderline personality disorder. Drawing on these convergences, we propose a theoretical model in which shame-driven, self-reinforcing cycles may link emotional dysregulation with disturbances of the self. Within this framework, restrictive control in anorexia nervosa and impulsive self-destructive behavior in borderline personality disorder may represent parallel attempts to regulate unbearable affect and preserve a fragmented sense of identity. This integrative perspective emphasizes the shared psychopathological mechanisms that may contribute to both conditions, framing their overlap as reflecting partially convergent dynamics between affect regulation and identity disturbance. It highlights avenues for future longitudinal and therapeutic research aimed at testing and refining these conceptual links.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces Instinctual Refinement Therapy (IRT) , a structured transdiagnostic protocol that bridges the divide between psychodynamic therapy's etiological depth and cognitive-behavioral therapy's empirical rigor. Integrating psychodynamic therapy's etiological depth with cognitive-behavioral therapy's empirical rigor constitutes a fundamental challenge for psychotherapy science. IRT conceptualizes psychopathology as instinctual dysregulation—maladaptive calibration of evolutionarily conserved motivational systems (Security, Attachment, Agency, Orexis) through entrenched pathological priors. Adverse childhood experiences generate these pathological priors, which subsequently distort perception, emotion, and behavior via predictive coding processes. The IRT protocol systematically targets these computational mechanisms through sequential phases including Thematic Writing, Systematic Belief Challenging, and Belief Destabilization, deliberately inducing prediction error to collapse dysfunctional generative models and facilitate belief updating via memory reconsolidation. By integrating developmental etiology with structured methodology within a neuro-computational framework, IRT offers a unified, testable approach to transformational change while generating specific hypotheses for computational psychiatry research.",

          "abstract": "This publication represents a “N-of-1” study where experiments were designed and performed by the same person. The data were collected and analyzed, considering all the necessary statistical requirements. The goal of the study was to investigate electrographic correlates of two mental states: mind wandering (MW) and focused attention (FA). The transition from MW to FA was initiated by the click that occurred at three minutes of the MW session. The presented data showed that, on average, during FA, the power in the delta frequency band is lower than during the MW state; however, the analysis of sequential time windows revealed that these changes occur only during the first 8 seconds of the FA mental state. \nMicrostate analysis revealed changes in multiple microstate parameters, but only during the first two seconds of the focused attention state. An unexpected finding was an increase in Global Field Power (GFP) of microstates in the 10-8-second window preceding the switch from MW to the FA state. This prediction was detected in the MW state, but not in the FA state. The precision and accuracy of prediction during the MW state were twice as good as those of the prediction performed intentionally in the FA state. These data indicate that our brain is subconsciously observing the external environment and making predictions of upcoming events that occur at long, such as 3 minutes, intervals, such as three minutes. The presented results require further confirmation in other subjects and other experimental paradigms.",

While the relationship between SDO and some specific policies has been examined in Western contexts, there has been much less research in non-Western contexts. Moreover, previous studies revealed that the relationship varies between non-Western countries. We conducted a study (N = 560) to replicate the positive correlation between SDO and political attitudes related to conservatism in Mifune and Yokota (2018) who collected the data in 2012. Using Bayesian inferences, we showed that while SDO and some policy attitudes have changed between samples over the last ten years, the correlation between them remained mostly unchanged even after controlling for conservatism. We discuss the consistency of the relationship between SDO and conservative political attitudes in the past ten years in Japan.",

          "abstract": "We see not only objects and their features (e.g., glass vases or wooden tables) but also relations between them (e.g., a vase on a table). An emerging view accounts for such relational representations by positing that visual perception is compositional: Much like language, where words combine to form phrases and sentences, many visual representations contain discrete constituents that combine systematically. This perspective raises a fundamental question: What principles guide the composition of relational representations, and how are they built over time? Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mind constructs relational representations in a canonical order. Inspired by a distinction from cognitive linguistics, we predicted that 'reference' objects (typically large, stable, and able to physically control other objects; e.g., tables) take precedence over 'figure' objects (e.g., vases) during scene composition. In Experiment 1, participants who arranged items to match linguistic descriptions (e.g., \"The vase is on the table\", \"The table is supporting the vase\") consistently placed reference objects first (e.g., table, then vase). Experiments 2–5 extended these findings to visual recognition itself: participants were faster to verify scene descriptions when reference objects appeared before figure objects in a scene, rather than vice versa. This Reference-first advantage emerged rapidly (within 100 ms), persisted in a purely visual task, and reflected abstract principles (e.g., physical forces) beyond simple differences in size or shape. Our findings reveal psychophysical principles underlying compositionality in visual processing: the mind builds representations of object relations sequentially, guided by the objects' roles in those relations.",

          "abstract": "Laughter is a signature of social connection, thought to communicate a shared understanding of nonseriousness. Building on this idea, the present work examines whether people laugh more when they perceive similarity with their social partner, or instead, feel more similar when they laugh. Participants (N = 132) had semi-structured conversations with both a friend and a stranger, discussing ways they were similar to and different from one another. Although conversation topic did not affect overall laughter, friends laughed even more than strangers when discussing their differences. Baseline perceived similarity in identity, behavior, and beliefs predicted how much dyads laughed and colaughed; however, laughter did not predict post-conversation perceived similarity. Participants laughed more if they felt similar to their partner or if their partner felt similar to them. To test whether laughter reflects shared understanding, we used overall laughter to predict both subjective experiences and verbal expressions of shared reality (e.g., saying “I agree”). Laughter predicted verbal expressions of shared reality, but not self-reported experience. Further, laughter and verbal agreement appeared to serve overlapping conversational functions: when laughter occurred, shared reality verbal expressions became less likely in the next two seconds. A subset analysis of friend dyads showed that only perceived similarity—not actual similarity—predicted laughter. In sum, conversational laughter seems to reflect, but not generate, the sense of similarity and shared understanding that underlies social connection.",

While LLMs can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.",

We propose that retaliatory incivility – i.e., incivility in response to someone else’s incivility — is seen as more virtuous than instigatory incivility, and consequently generates more social rewards for actors. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as five samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; hockey fans, baseball fans, employees, workplace teams. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility can be a surprising path to social rewards. Thus, as incivility rises internationally, our findings have far-reaching theoretical and practical implications.",

In Study 1, 5159 students between 10–17 years of age from Peru reported on the prevalence and perceived positive qualities of online-only and in-person friendships. In Study 2, 3154 students from Bolivia and Uruguay reported on the prevalence and positive and negative qualities of their in-person and online-only friendship(s). We analyzed cross-sectional trends in friendship quality (Studies 1 and 2) and, for a subset of youth with available data in Study 2 (N = 506), changes in the prevalence and quality of friendships between two data waves. More than one-third of participants reported having an online-only friend and, on average, declared twice as many in-person friends. Best in-person friendships involved both greater closeness but also greater discord than best online-only friendships. There were no differences in exclusion. Boys reported greater intensity of overall discord towards their best in-person friends and online-only friends compared to girls. In contrast, girls reported stronger closeness towards their best in-person friends than boys. Older adolescents reported stronger closeness towards their best online-only friends than younger adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents rely on in-person friends for positive friendship support to a greater extent than online-only friends. However, despite overwhelming emphasis on the psychological drawbacks of online friendships, our findings suggest these friendships may also be associated with less negative qualities and do not necessarily discourage formation of in-person friendships.",

To answer this, we compared behavioural performance on a speech-in-noise recognition test with the intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) of the auditory-language system. We found that the speech recognition ability was not correlated with the INT of the entire auditory-language network but was enhanced when the INT of the frontotemporal sub-system in the auditory-language network was close to that of the inferior colliculus, an auditory midbrain region. Moreover, this cortico-subcortical INT similarity was associated with the task-related neural activity in the frontotemporal sub-system.

This study examined whether smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys capturing stress and social context could enhance the identification of youth at risk for STB. Adolescents ages 13-18-years-old (N=207, 166 female sex) reporting depressive, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders were recruited from psychiatric outpatient programs, emergency departments, medical research registries, and social media. Participants with STB history were oversampled; 66% reported current suicidal ideation and 27% had a past-year attempt. Assessments of suicidal events (attempts, emergency department visits, hospitalizations for suicide concerns) were completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments. EMA probed momentary stress severity, affect, and recent social context (time spent with peers, family, or alone) 4-7x/day. Compared to psychiatric controls (N=64), adolescents with STB history (N=143) were more likely to report spending time alone (aOR=1.75, 95% CI=[1.15, 2.39]), less time with family (aOR=0.59, 95% CI=[0.31, 0.91]), and higher stress (d=0.28). Further, EMA of stress (aOR=1.86, 95% CI=[1.11, 3.26]) and negative affect (aOR=2.32, 95% CI=[1.34, 4.36]) were prospectively associated with suicidal events above and beyond prior STB history. Broadly, results were similar between EMA measures of stress and negative affect, indicating such responses may reflect shared underlying processes. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dynamic family and peer contact among adolescents at risk for STB and highlight EMA as a potential tool for assessing interpersonal exposures related to STB risk.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn because they employ the base-10 system as whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, leading to worse performance when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs, like 0.8 vs. 0.26, than Consistent pairs like 0.86 vs. 0.2. Students may be applying the whole number rule: “more digits = larger number” or they could be ignoring the decimal points and comparing 8 vs. 26. This study used neuroimaging and our specially designed stimulus set to distinguish between these possibilities. We focused on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), implicated in numerical magnitude processing, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, implicated in inhibitory control. We found no neural differences between Consistent and Inconsistent comparisons, suggesting that the number of digits does not drive brain responses in skilled adults (n=21). Instead, for Consistent comparisons, we found that the IPS was sensitive to the actual distance between the decimals, while the ACC showed this pattern for Inconsistent comparisons. Crucially, we also examined the effect of the distance between the decimal pairs when ignoring the decimal point. Here, we found sensitivity to this distance among Inconsistent comparisons in the IPS and insula, suggesting that whole number referents are automatically processed during decimal comparison and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. More broadly, our results underscore the unique challenges of decimal notation, revealing the need for educational practices that emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than highlighting similarities.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Bipolar disorder is strongly associated with financial instability. We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring. These findings extend prior work on financial data sharing for illness self-management, highlighting the role of trusted third parties in designing acceptable, effective interventions.",

          "authors": "Darius Krutzek; Florian Paulus; Kimberly Heinecke; Emily Klose; Lena Kipper",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic worldwide and is frequently used to temporarily enhance cognitive performance. However, caffeine-induced effects on physiological arousal are also associated with side effects, which can exacerbate psychological stress symptoms in social performance situations. The amino acid L-theanine has shown potential to modulate these adverse effects of caffeine by reducing caffeine-augmented stress responses without impairing its desired cognitive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous modulatory effects of L-theanine on caffeine-enhanced stress in acute social stress situations.\n\nMethod\n\nA total of 46 healthy participants (83% female, aged 18–30 years) were examined for differences in stress reactivity during a standardized psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups, TSST-G). The study compared the effects of a single dose of caffeine alone versus a combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Specific stress constituents including subjective stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, desire to leave the situation, tension, and perceived control were assessed. Furthermore, group effects, trait anxiety, caffeine consumption, and temporal changes in reported stress were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with covariates.\nResults\nThe combination of caffeine and L-theanine resulted in a spontaneous attenuation of tension in social stress situations compared to caffeine alone. \n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that L-theanine attenuates certain stress effects of caffeine in acute social stress situations. This highlights the potential of the L-theanine and caffeine combination as a dual nootropic agent, offering both stress-reducing effects and the practicality of a substance suitable for cognitive performance enhancement. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects by incorporating physiological markers such as cortisol and cognitive performance tests.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between everyday cognitive strategy use and subjective cognition is unclear, but may be driven by an active, compensatory process in response to experiencing cognitive difficulties. However, the available evidence tends to focus on specific age groups, and on relationships with general cognition or memory performance only. We uniquely investigated the influence of age, cognitive strategy use, and their potential interaction, on the everyday cognitive difficulties of 606 United Kingdom-based adults aged 18-86. Participants completed self-report measures of everyday cognitive difficulties across specific domains (attention, visual-perceptual ability, verbal and visual-spatial memory, and language) and strategy use, both memory-specific and generalized (e.g. setting an alarm to help remember something or breaking down complex tasks). Age was negatively associated with frequency of strategy use, such that younger adults reported greater strategy use. Moderated regression models, with strategy use as a predictor of cognitive difficulty and age as the moderator, revealed that more frequent use of memory-specific cognitive strategies, rather than generalized strategy use, was the most robust, unique predictor of greater difficulties across the majority of cognitive domains. Importantly, there was no interaction between age and cognitive strategy use for any cognitive domain, highlighting that cognitive strategy use is pervasive across the adult lifespan, and is related to a range of subjective cognitive difficulties. The findings underscore the significant, apparently compensatory relationship between strategy use and subjective cognition. They also reveal scope for older adults to incorporate more frequent use of cognitive strategies in everyday life.",

These tools assessed skills such as critical thinking, digital proficiency, and awareness of the socio-political context of media content. Twelve tools assessed science literacy, covering general knowledge, environmental health, and specific scientific domains. They measured cognitive, behavioural, and attitudinal dimensions using various formats, including Likert scales, multiple-choice, and open-ended items.

          "authors": "Lara Pearson; Thomas Nuttall; Wim Pouw",
          "abstract": "In music performance contexts, vocalists tend to gesture with hand and upper body movements as they sing. But how does this gesturing relate to the sung phrases, and how do singers’ gesturing styles differ from each other? In this study, we present a quantitative analysis and visualization pipeline that characterizes the multidimensional co-structuring of body movements and vocalizations in vocal performers. We apply this to a dataset of performances within the Karnatak music tradition of South India, including audio and motion tracking data of 44 performances by three expert Karnatak vocalists, openly published with this report. Our results show that time-varying features of head and hand gestures tend to be more similar when the concurrent vocal time-varying features are also more similar. While for each performer we find clear co-structuring of sound and movement, they each show their own characteristic salient dimensions (e.g., hand position, head acceleration) on which movement co-structures with singing. Our time-series analyses thereby provide a computational approach to characterizing individual vocalists’ unique multimodal vocal-gesture co-structuring profiles. We also show that co-structuring clearly reduces degrees of freedom of the multimodal performance such that motifs that sound alike tend to co-structure with gestures that move alike. The current method can be applied to any multimodally ensembled signals in both human and non-human communication, to determine co-structuring profiles and explore any reduction in degrees of freedom. In the context of Karnatak singing performance, the current analysis is an important starting point for further experimental study of gesture-vocal synergies.",

Early stopping not only con- serves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment, for instance if more funds become available, or even if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% probability, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped.

We examined the potential benefits of neuroticism (fear/frustration) across a wide range of outcomes between ages 11 to 19 (e.g., substance abuse, friend nominations) using two “mirrored” samples of Dutch adolescents followed between ages 11 to 19, one population (n=2229, 51%♀) and one clinic-referred (n=543, 34%♀) cohort. High neuroticism conveyed heightened risk but four key observations refine this picture: (1) higher fear also related to more social skills and prosocial behavior among adolescents in the clinic-referred sample; (2) fear generally related to fewer risks than frustration; (3) controlling for childhood adversity (e.g., low socioeconomic status, parental divorce) removed links between fear and most detrimental outcomes; (4) both fear and frustration were consistently associated with parent-rated social behavior problems, while other associations varied across these two scales and measurement points. Altogether, we provide initial evidence that, under certain conditions, neuroticism can also be beneficial in adolescence. Neuroticism benefits are most likely found among vulnerable individuals and in the social domain.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "abstract": "Background: Abnormal reward processing has been considered as a core feature of severe mental illness (SMI), such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Deficits in this domain can have severe implications in daily functioning, such as a decreased motivation to engage in social activities or make healthy lifestyle choices. The Online Positive Valence Study aimed to assess reward processing in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Positive Valence Systems (PVS) framework in an online task-based study. Recruitment and study adherence fell short of expectations.\nObjective: The current paper critically evaluates the used methodology and shares the lessons learned of conducting an online task-based study of reward processing in a severe mental illness sample.\nMethods: Participants were recruited mainly via email from two existing cohorts. The research team consisted of a part-time research assistant, a part-time postdoctoral researcher and the principal investigators. The study was built using several software packages and comprised a number of questionnaires and three reward tasks, the monetary incentive delay task (MID), effort expenditure of rewards task (EEfRT) and a social and coin version of the Bandit task. From 2023 onwards, the research team accepted that the initial recruitment goal would not be attained.\nResults: Participants who were additionally called were over four times more likely to respond “no” and more than twice as likely to respond “yes” versus no response compared to those who received only emails. Personal salutations in invitation mails reduced the likelihood of participation compared to nonpersonal salutations. Reward task performance was largely similar between the in-lab MRI and online groups, though online participants showed longer reaction times on the MID task and lower win-stay rates on both Bandit tasks.\nConclusion: It is advised to carefully consider recruiting from existing cohorts, hire full-time dedicated personnel and use personal approaches to recruitment, like phone calls, and adjust recruitment to the target population(s). Furthermore, participation should be technically as simple as possible, using for example browser-based presentation of tasks, after checking their consistency across the most common browsers. Attrition during the course of the study can be limited even more by shortening the duration of participation and/or adding gamification. \nKeywords: Positive Valence System; reward processing; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; online study",

          "abstract": "Emotional memories enrich our lives by anchoring us to meaningful past events, but they can also become intrusive and distressing, particularly in psychiatric conditions. This chapter discusses retrieval stopping, a memory control process through which individuals actively stop or cancel the retrieval of unwanted memories when confronted with reminders. We synthesize findings from retrieval stopping studies focussing on how people suppress the retrieval of emotional memories and the resulting consequences for both memory and emotion. Our review reveals that retrieval stopping consistently impairs recall of emotional memories in healthy populations, though this capacity is compromised in clinical groups and under conditions that impair inhibitory control, such as acute stress and sleep deprivation. Neuroimaging evidence demonstrates that suppressing emotional memories engages a fronto-temporal inhibitory control pathway, with increased activation in right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex alongside decreased activity in hippocampus and amygdala. Retrieval stopping induces mixed after-effects on subjective reports of valence of the suppressed content, but more reliably reduces self-reported and physiological indicators of arousal. We propose a theoretical model suggesting that retrieval and affect stopping are co-engaged processes when dealing with unwanted emotional memories and thoughts, both relying on shared inhibitory control mechanisms to prevent neural reinstatement of the original trace. This integrated perspective emphasizes that regulating emotional memories requires interrupting the neural reinstatement of both their mnemonic and affective components. By framing inhibitory control as a central mechanism linking the regulation of memory and emotion, the model offers a unifying account for understanding how individuals manage unwanted memories and the emotional distress they evoke.",

These outcomes may differ between men/boys and women/girls with ADHD, but whether these differences are more pronounced in ADHD or similar to those in the general population remains unclear. Method. In an 18-year follow-up of 283 children it was assessed if sex moderated a variety of long-term outcomes across seven domains in those with ADHD, 50 women (Mage = 27.36) and 104 men (Mage = 29.40), and without ADHD, 77 women (Mage = 28.32) and 52 men (Mage = 27.94). Additional analyses explored the role of gender-expression. Results. Sex interacted with group for social functioning, where men with ADHD were more likely to show lower social functioning compared to women with ADHD and controls. There were no sex differences on the other outcomes. As sex and gender-expression were highly similar (r = .94), specific effects of gender-expression could not be studied. Conclusions. Generally, sex did not have a more pronounced effect on long-term outcomes of childhood ADHD in individuals with ADHD compared to the general population. Gender-expression could not be studied in our predominantly cis-gendered sample.",

          "abstract": "Faced with uncertainty in decision making, individuals often turn to their social networks to inform their decisions. In consequence, these networks become central to how new products and behaviors spread. A key structural feature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who share few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or hinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to differing assumptions about individual decision-making. We reinvestigate the role of long ties by experimentally measuring adoption decisions under social influence for products with uncertain payoffs and embedding these decisions in network simulations. At the individual level, we find that higher payoff uncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However, personal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead to substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At the collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long ties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as uncertainty increases. Our results reveal that the effect of long ties is not determined by whether the aggregate process is a simple or complex contagion, but by the extent of heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence.",

Extending Bion’s notion of containment, the DCS comprises three interdependent layers: AI-based interactions that provide simulated empathy and co-regulation; social media publics that aggregate and validate affect; and algorithmic infrastructures that learn and normalize emotional patterns through feedback loops. Centering women’s experiences, the essay argues that these digital containers enable expressive repair and identity work while relocating emotional labour from interpersonal to technological systems. Declining marriage and fertility rates are thus read not as signs of moral decline, but as indications of a relational modernization lag, where emotional expectations outpace institutional adaptation. Intimacy, rather than disappearing, is being redistributed across human–machine–media assemblages.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Tommi Makkonen; Kaisa M Tiippana",
          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), skin conductance responses (SCR), electrodermal activity (EDA), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), electroencephalographic activity (EEG alpha asymmetry), and self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited pre-stimulus slowing of HR, suggesting anticipatory threat processing. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, anticipatory HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

Therefore, it was decided to develop a validation of the Spanish version of the MSTAT-II in Peru. To this end, the clarity of the items was corroborated, and a non-probability, snowball sample of 371 participants was obtained from Lima, Peru. The total sample was then split into training and test datasets. Structurally testing the previous models and a data driven model in the training dataset. The results yielded unacceptable fit indices for the MSTAT-II's previous models, so the 4-item data driven one was used on the test dataset.

          "abstract": "The human cone photoreceptor spectral sensitivities can differ between individuals. Large changes give rise to colour vision deficiencies, but even among colour-normals there is systematic individual variation. To limit the propagation of any systematic sampling bias in constructing the average spectral sensitivity functions used in research and industrial applications, it is useful to quantify the factors underlying this variation. The amino acid found at position 180 of OPN1LW, the gene responsible for encoding the L cone photopigment, is one source of individual variation in the L-cone spectral sensitivity. In this paper, group differences in the frequency of the L(S180) and L(A180) alleles are analysed from a combination of published reports and the genome sequencing database, gnomAD. We report evidence for significant group differences across ethnicity. Historical sampling bias in the data underlying the average L cone spectral sensitivity function therefore introduces ethnic bias in the applicability of these functions. We discuss the functional consequences of this variation by modelling failures of metamerism when this variability is not accounted for, the challenges of incorporating ethnicity variation in the existing L cone fundamental as adopted by the CIE Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage in 2006, and promising work on personalized cone fundamentals.",

Empathy is not a static trait, instead capable of growth and development, and this chapter explores whether AI can and, more importantly, should be used to increase one’s empathy. Nothing in principle stands in the way of AI improving our empathy, but the possibility raises unanswered questions about whether such an approach would be effective or would backfire in unexpected ways, such as encouraging the commodification of empathy as a technological tool that can make companies money, rather than a fundamental part of the human experience.",

          "abstract": "Physiognomy, the idea that a person’s character is reflected in their facial features, has a long history in scholarly thought. Although now widely regarded as pseudoscience in academic circles, recent work suggests that laypeople hold physiognomic beliefs and that belief endorsement is associated with support for facial profiling technology and other outcomes. Here, we investigate who believes in physiognomy in four studies (three preregistered). In a large, representative sample of the Dutch population, about 50% at least somewhat endorsed physiognomic beliefs (Study 1, n = 2,624). Belief prevalence was similar across different sociodemographic groups (i.e., gender, age, education, income). Across different measures of thinking styles and other lay beliefs, we found that physiognomic beliefs were most strongly related to how much people trust their intuitions—an association that emerged consistently with British (Study 2, n = 224), Nigerian (Study 3, n = 147), and Dutch participants (Study 4, n = 388). Participants who scored higher on faith in intuition were also more confident in the accuracy of their face-based trustworthiness impressions. In sum, the present studies suggest that lay beliefs in physiognomy are (a) common, (b) similarly endorsed across various socio-demographic groups, and (c) associated with an intuitive thinking style.",

Judges had their attention to target faces recorded with an eyetracker. In all studies time spent observing the targets’ head decreased over time. In Study One ratings were associated with time spent observing the targets’ head and these effects changed with observation over time. In Study Two no effects were found. Study Three found weak effects opposing Study One. We find overall meta-evidence of masculinity and attractiveness affecting attention to the faces of unknown others, but the individual study findings were highly inconsistent. Our findings draw attention to the risks of interpreting from an individual study and reflect the benefit of internal registered replications.",

We modelled the developmental interplay between chaos and achievement, including their reverse association (i.e., achievement chaos), and its aetiology in up to 7,591 twin pairs (49% female), who were born in the mid-90s in the UK and assessed at age 9, 12, and 16 years. Associations between household chaos and educational achievement were consistently negative, bidirectional, and of small effect sizes across ages. These associations were best explained by genetic and environmental confounding. Family SES accounted for most of the confounding in the predictions from achievement to chaos; for the reverse, environments shared within families but distinct from SES were implied. Our findings suggest that long-term associations between children’s experiences of household chaos and educational achievement are modest and non-causal.",

          "abstract": "We interact with our environment through our actions, sampling information from environmental effects following them. Here we asked how control over action and ensuing effects influences long-term memory for the effect content and the actions that produced them. In three experiments, participants carried out spatial actions, which produced the movement of a box wherein an image was presented. The box either moved spatially congruent or incongruent with the participants’ action. Memory for images was later tested in a recognition test and we additionally probed whether participants retrieved the action used to produce an image when being cued with said image. In a fourth experiment, we kept the spatial effect component constant to directly investigate bindings between action and effect features. We found evidence for a facilitating influence of congruency on declarative memory for effect content and on action retrieval by perceived effect content. Moreover, if effect content was enriched with a spatial feature, such retrieval was only observed if that feature was spatially congruent rather than incongruent to the action which had produced that content. Thus, features of single action-effect episodes can be integrated and represented in long-term memory and the formation of these representations is facilitated by control. We propose that feature bindings can be conceptualized as source memory, representing how environmental effects were produced.",

          "abstract": "The production of a word is delayed by the recent production of one or more semantically related words. This phenomenon, known as semantic interference, has been observed in picture naming tasks involving either large sets of pictures named once (continuous naming) or small sets of pictures named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that operates after each naming episode. However, the interference develops differently in these tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been suggested that the small local response sets in blocked naming are easily identified and stored in working memory, which then introduces an additional process that constrains the interference. We reasoned that this process would be less effective as the local response sets increased in size, resulting in cumulative interference. In blocked naming experiments involving local response sets of ten or nineteen items, we found that the interference did not increase continuously; rather, it carried on across more presentations than for the typically used small sets. This finding lends support to the notion of a control mechanism that operates gradually and interacts with an adaptive learning mechanism.",

Despite recent findings suggesting that defensive responses can generalize to safe but threat-relevant stimuli, it is unclear whether threat relevance can cause overgeneralization. To this end, we investigated two groups of participants who underwent a differential conditioning paradigm with either two angry (threat relevance, n = 38) or two neutral male faces (control, n = 39) as conditioned stimuli (CSs). One of the faces (CS+) was reinforced with a 90-dB scream (unconditioned stimulus, US) 80% of the time, while the other face (CS-) was never followed by the US. In the generalization test, the CSs were presented along with four generalized stimuli that lay on a continuum between CS+ and CS-. Successful acquisition was registered for all ratings and psychophysiological responses except ssVEPs. The differential skin conductance responses (SCRs) were larger in the threat relevance group compared to the control group. During the generalization test, adaptive generalized responses were observed for all measures, except for ssVEPs. Participants’ SCRs to all stimuli were on average larger in the threat relevance group. The shape of the generalization gradients did not differ between the groups suggesting that while threat relevance influences the intensity of autonomic arousal both in acquisition and in generalization, it does not lead to overgeneralization.",

          "abstract": "Environmental sensitivity, defined as the capacity to perceive and process information from both supportive and adverse environmental experiences, plays an important role in socio-emotional and behavioral development. However, existing research has predominantly focused on childhood, leaving a gap in our understanding of environmental sensitivity during adolescence. To bridge this gap, we conducted three studies using self-report data from 2,375 Japanese adolescents aged 10–14 years and their mothers. First, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of adolescent sensory processing sensitivity (referred to as trait sensitivity) by applying the 21-item Highly Sensitive Child scale to Japanese adolescents (Studies 1 and 2). Second, using three-wave longitudinal data, we examined how trait sensitivity interacts with various environmental contexts (i.e., negative/positive parenting and peer relationships) to predict adolescents’ socio-emotional and behavioral development (Study 3). Results showed that adolescent trait sensitivity was characterized by a general factor reflecting sensitivity to a broad range of negative and positive stimuli, as well as two specific domains: Ease of Excitation–Low Sensory Threshold and Aesthetic Sensitivity (i.e., bifactor model). Trait sensitivity was positively correlated with other temperament and personality traits, including negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition, neuroticism, and openness. Trait sensitivity and environmental factors independently predicted internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as prosocial behavior. Notably, trait sensitivity was a significant positive predictor of both internalizing problems and prosocial behavior. These findings suggest partial continuity in the structure and developmental functions of trait sensitivity from childhood to adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Minimal phenomenal experience (MPE) is characterized as a state of pure awareness stripped of conceptual content, and serves as a methodological tool for probing the mechanisms underlying consciousness. We propose a computational architecture in which a policy model that generates behavior is recursively coupled to a program model that synthesizes structured, executable explanations of that behavior. We ground our architecture in program synthesis: a computational approach that models human learning and reasoning as the process of inferring structured programs (executable code or symbolic rules) from examples or experience. These programs function as hypothetical self-models that can condition future behavior through a self-hypothesis distribution, making the agent’s current self-conception an endogenous cause within its generative model. The program model learns programs that balance three objectives: explanatory adequacy for observed behavior, alignment with the policy’s capabilities, and behavioral utility. This recursive coupling—where programs shape actions that generate data for refining programs—creates attractor dynamics that stabilize into a coherent identity and narrative self. We argue that MPE emerges when the system operates with minimal narrative elaboration: programs remain simple and interoceptively focused, the self-hypothesis distribution stays broad rather than collapsing to a dominant narrative, and the agent sustains awareness through recursive self-modeling without recruiting extended conceptual structures.",

          "abstract": "Parasocial relationships (PRs), one-sided imaginary relationships with media personae, have only recently been explored in the video gaming context, where they appear to influence players’ thoughts and behaviors. They are often assumed to arise from less connection and greater ostracism in day-to-day life, but this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. Further, no study has considered potential differences in interpersonal difficulties that players with PRs may have compared to those without PRs. The present study addresses these gaps using online data from 584 video gamers (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male) recruited from various Reddit gaming communities. Participants completed measures assessing interpersonal difficulties (e.g., vindictiveness, social avoidance, exploitableness, nonassertiveness), satisfaction and frustration needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as well as problematic video gaming (PVG), and video gaming motivations. Results did not support the loneliness and ostracized hypothesis in that players with and without PRs did not differ in connection to others or feeling rejected in their day-to-day life. However, compared to players without PRs, players with PRs report greater interpersonal difficulties. Thus, PRs do not appear to compensate for loneliness or rejection. Rather, it may be that individuals with PRs may experience interpersonal difficulties leading them to turn to PRs to fulfill social needs. Additional findings include players with PRs reporting greater hours of video gaming as well as more severe PVG and stronger fantasy gaming motives. These findings are discussed within the context of broader literature and avenues for further study are provided.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "authors": "Austin Alexander",
          "abstract": "Pre-Sapio-Abstraction (PSA) introduces a novel internalist framework that addresses the interdependent co-emergence of recursive cognition, memory expansion, and self-referential consciousness (RMC) through pre-expressive abstraction. Rather than attributing these capacities solely to exogenous pressures such as external coordination, social scaffolding, or communicative efficiency, PSA posits that a biologically grounded internal selective mechanism, symbolic-affective saturation (SAS), created a distinctive form of neuroevolutionary bottleneck pressure. SAS is defined as the endogenously generated accumulation of qualitatively complex and often dissonant mental representations that exceeded the capacity of early linear processing systems. This accumulation produced a pressured nascent state of pre-expressive abstraction, which, once sustained above capacity, favored the evolution of recursion as a stabilizing coherence-and-containment architecture. Under this selective condition, RMC capacities are framed not as independent byproducts of scale but as neurostructural adaptive responses that stabilized internally accumulated mental representations across time, affect, and identity. PSA thereby reframes abstraction as not merely an antecedent of higher cognition, but as a biologically grounded endogenous selection pressure produced by SAS that favored the interdependent emergence of RMC. In identifying SAS as an internal evolutionary mechanism, PSA does not reject metabolic, ecological, or social selective pressures. Rather, it positions itself as a complementary framework for a range of neuroevolutionary accounts of consciousness, helping explain why the architectures they describe became evolutionarily indispensable.",

          "abstract": "When studying latent outcomes in causal inference, causal effects can occur not only on the mean of the latent variable, but on all parts of the measurement model: the mean and residual variance of the latent variable, as well as the item parameters. This paper proposes causal parameter moderation, the application of moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) to causal inference with latent outcomes. The proposed MNLFA-based approach is presented in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. The models are best suited to handle different types of DIF, and thus the circumstances under which each is appropriate differ: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis, especially when there is reason to believe that a subset of items on the outcome might be particularly sensitive to the treatment. Because MNLFA can handle an arbitrary number of continuous or categorical covariates, it is also uniquely well-suited to handling heterogenous treatment effects; this is demonstrated in a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a reading intervention’s effects on science vocabulary where there is substantial evidence of both a main effect on the latent variable and additional effects on a subset of items.",

          "title": "A new cultural cleavage? Anti-transgender attitudes and the 2024 US presidential election",
          "authors": "Jack Thompson",
          "abstract": "Despite growing public acceptance of LGB rights, transgender rights have become a focal point of partisan polarization in the US, raising questions about their relative electoral impact. This paper examines the rising electoral salience of anti-transgender attitudes in the 2024 US presidential election, positing that they have surpassed anti-LGB attitudes as a predictor of Republican vote choice. Drawing on data from the 2024 ANES, I test whether affective orientations toward transgender individuals and opposition to transgender-inclusive policies more strongly predict support for Trump in the 2024 US presidential election compared to attitudes toward LGB individuals. Overall, I find that negative estimations of transgender individuals and opposition to pro-transgender policies are significantly associated with vote choice for Trump, outpacing analogous anti-LGB measures. This shift reflects a realignment in social conservative priorities. My findings highlight that issues surrounding gender identity are emerging as a new cultural cleavage, reshaping identity politics and partisan polarization in US elections, with implications for understanding evolving voter behavior and cultural backlash.",

          "authors": "Matthew Yeaton; Paul Green; Grace Cormier; Lara Yang; Sameer Srivastava",
          "abstract": "Social belonging is a fundamental human need, which people experience to varying degrees in the workplace. Interventions to boost belonging have typically focused on changing individuals’ mindsets. We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues—ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: convergent, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and divergent, to colleagues from different network communities. Participants in a non-profit organization (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development program with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either convergent or divergent groups. Consistent with pre-registered expectations, convergent-condition participants reported more group solidarity and—three months post-intervention—more persistent ties to fellow group members and greater social belonging. Using computational linguistics and machine learning techniques to impute survey responses, we further show that convergent-condition participants experienced greater belonging than did a synthetic control group. Yet, pointing to the tradeoffs of the two forms of exposure, divergent-exposure participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality, independent of fellow-group-member ties. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational interventions.",

          "title": "Technocultural Hegemony: What Role Does Natural Language Processing Play in the Reinforcement of Dominant Cultural Narratives?",
          "authors": "Daria Markava",
          "abstract": "While Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools keep gaining popularity among users from around the globe, their vast majority is developed in the west, mainly the US. Although plenty of studies have shown that NLP tools don't perform equally well in different languages and cultural contexts, little research has been conducted on the broader consequences of such performance disparities. By using the evidence from previous research, this study aims to bridge this gap and explore how NLP and the existing cultural hierarchies can be mutually constitutive. This paper first reviews existing literature on the NLP tools' performance in relation to underrepresented languages and non-western cultures. It then takes a critical theory approach to examining the broader cultural implications of the shortcomings identified during the review. More specifically, this work uses the concept of technoculture proposed by Leila Green, to connect the technological and cultural aspects of NLP, and refers to Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to explore how the bias in NLP tools reinforces dominant cultural narratives overrepresented in the training data. This study argues that NLP applications play a role in reinforcing the dominant norms, ideals, and ways of expression as universal, thus marginalizing alternative worldviews and imposing normative standards of communication onto the users of different backgrounds. The analysis concludes that, as the popularity of NLP tools keeps growing worldwide, their influence on what is perceived as \"common sense\" will increase too. This study emphasizes the importance of ensuring equitable representation of the user base throughout the whole NLP development pipeline.",

          "authors": "RICARDO ALONZO FERNANDEZ SALGUERO",
          "abstract": "La crisis financiera global de 2008 marcó el inicio de una década dominada por políticas de austeridad fiscal en gran parte del mundo desarrollado. Este documento presenta una revisión narrativa cualitativa de una extensa colección de literatura académica para sintetizar la evidencia sobre los efectos multifacéticos de la austeridad. Siguiendo un enfoque temático inspirado en las directrices PRISMA, se examinan las consecuencias económicas, sociales y políticas de estas medidas. El análisis revela un consenso mayoritario sobre los efectos recesivos de la austeridad, especialmente cuando se implementa durante crisis económicas, con multiplicadores fiscales negativos que a menudo exacerban la contracción del PIB. Socialmente, la austeridad se asocia con un aumento de la desigualdad, impactos negativos en la salud pública, consecuencias de género desproporcionadas y un debilitamiento de las redes de seguridad social. Políticamente, la evidencia vincula la austeridad con la erosión de la confianza en las instituciones, un aumento del populismo y la inestabilidad electoral. A pesar de la narrativa política que presenta la austeridad como una necesidad inevitable para la sostenibilidad fiscal, la literatura académica subraya sus altos costos y su cuestionable eficacia, abogando por enfoques de política económica más contextualizados y equitativos.",

          "title": "Causal Effect of Character Gender on Readers’ Preferences",
          "authors": "Federica Bologna; Ian Lundberg; Matthew Wilkens",
          "abstract": "Stakeholders in the publishing industry observe strong gender homophily between authors and readers, but it is unclear what causes this alignment. One possible mechanism involves reader preferences for gendered characters – specifically, the largely untested hypothesis that men are less inclined to read books with women protagonists, while women are more willing to read stories featuring protagonists of any gender. This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character? Would women be more likely to read it if it featured a woman character? Our study provides new causal evidence on these questions in a well-powered study. Using a randomized survey experiment involving 3,000 participants, we isolate the causal effect of protagonist gender on reader preferences. Our findings reveal that the effect of character gender is close to zero. Contrary to popular belief, men’s reading preferences were unaffected by the gender of the protagonist. Women, on the other hand, displayed a slight preference for stories featuring women protagonists. These results challenge a subset of industry assumptions and reassure publishers and authors that books about women characters will not necessarily alienate readers.",

          "authors": "Gannon Bennhoff Gallo",
          "abstract": "Recent advancements in GLSL-based compute shaders that perform parallelized particle simulations and spectral mapping have contributed to the rise of audio-visualizers for mainstream use. This is primarily due to their non-code programming customizability and multimodal input accessibility. Stem-separation features possible in softwares such as Touchdesigner, Ableton Live, Max/MSP, and more pose the question of whether these audio-visualizers could bridge the physiological gap for DHH individuals in sonic environments. Using three different tests: lyric detection, post-listening visual correspondence, and heart rate synchronization, this study empirically serves to find practical evidence, when combined with biological, neurological, and cognitive research in music, on the extent to which audio-visualizers bridge this gap. It was determined through these three tests that yes, participants engaged with the dynamic variety of songs at an increased rate when provided access to the Touchdesigner particle displacement audio-visualizer, attributing perceptual and attentional changes to the multiple distinguishable aspects within the visualizer. I dive into how these findings might be applicable to various music environments that want to increase engagement to DHH individuals, or how these individuals might go about listening to music themselves.",

          "authors": "Christopher Sylvain",
          "abstract": "Human collectives flourish when minds coordinate around shared expectations—what this paper terms coherence. Contemporary neuroscience demonstrates that coherence arises through three nested mechanisms:\n(1) the ACC–PFC loop achieves error closure, resolving internal conflict and prediction mismatch;\n(2) linguistic entrainment synchronizes cortical oscillations between speakers and listeners, producing shared rhythm; and\n(3) inter-brain synchrony appears during cooperative behavior, reflecting cross-person prediction.\nIntegrating hyperscanning, conflict-monitoring, and language-oscillation studies reveals that vigilance cues—threat, guilt, ambiguity—maintain amygdala and ACC activation, whereas resolution cues—trust, forgiveness, prosodic rhythm—recruit vmPFC regulation, promoting oxytocin release and cross-brain coupling. Coherence therefore represents an energy-efficient predictive-coding solution that minimizes uncertainty across agents. We outline measurable biomarkers and ethical applications for public health, digital design, and education, arguing that forgiveness and rhythmic reciprocity constitute biological prerequisites for sustainable social order.",

          "authors": "Kumari Neha Priya",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced an abrupt transition to remote learning in K-12 education, exposing wide disparities in districts’ ability to sustain instruction. Much of the existing research highlights household-level inequities such as broadband access and parental support, but less is known about the institutional capacity of districts themselves. This study examines whether pre-pandemic administrative capacity, including digital infrastructure, budget transparency, and organizational planning, shaped districts’ ability to adapt during the crisis. Using publicly available panel data from 2018 to 2022 and a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression design, this study tests whether districts with stronger pre-2020 capacity achieved higher levels of remote learning success, measured through engagement, instructional weeks, and related outcomes. Results show that districts with higher administrative capacity prior to the pandemic delivered more resilient instruction and mitigated participation losses, particularly in lower-income contexts. These findings suggest that building institutional capacity before a crisis can reduce educational inequality and strengthen preparedness for future disruptions.",

          "abstract": "Growing concern over the scale of unregulated wildlife trade has led to calls for fundamental changes to systems of species protection. A proposed “reverse listing” approach would ban the harvest and trade of all wild species, except those for which trade can be demonstrated to be sustainable. We evaluate the feasibility of this approach on an international scale and discuss policy solutions. Adopting reverse listing would not be straightforward; key issues include the social legitimacy of resulting laws, ensuring effective law enforcement, and the treatment of trade from alternative (i.e., non-wild) sources. Reverse listing is not a panacea for protecting biodiversity from overexploitation, and a combination of approaches is needed to effectively regulate the world’s wildlife trade.",

          "abstract": "How do political parties balance policy adaptation with ideological continuity? While spatial models emphasize external factors driving party behaviour, less attention has been given to internal party choices. This article innovates by proposing that parties differentiate between and make distinct strategical decisions regarding their ideological core and peripheral policy areas. We argue that parties maintain continuity in their ideological core while exhibiting greater flexibility in modifying their periphery. Using the Manifesto Project Corpus and an XLM-RoBERTa-based language model, we analyse manifesto sections to distinguish core from peripheral segments. Our findings show that parties take clearer stances in their ideological core while adapting their periphery more flexibly, with niche parties displaying this pattern more strongly than mainstream parties. Electoral setbacks lead parties to adopt more extreme peripheries, while cores remain stable. These results highlight the strategic importance of the core–periphery distinction in party communication and suggest that studies of party competition should consider where policy shifts occur within parties’ electoral programs.",

          "authors": "Christopher Buckley; Guillaume Jacques",
          "abstract": "We present the largest and most wide-ranging survey to date of archaeological spindle whorls, across more than 350 sites in East Asia, including China, southeast Asia, the Himalayas, and the Silk Road routes. Hand spindles were used to produce yarn in the quantities necessary for loom-woven textiles, and they are an indicator of the emergence and spread of this technology. We demonstrate that loom weaving arose in three distinct zones in China, and that wool-spinning technology was introduced later by pastoral/nomadic peoples arriving from the West. We introduce a novel workflow for the analysis of archaeological data, based around estimated moment of inertia of whorls, and we demonstrate its application. We find that there are differences in whorl types and trends between the three zones, corresponding to differing motivations for producing yarn; for warmth and protection (in the north) and fine textiles for status (in central and southern regions). The appearance of weaving is linked in broad terms with the advent of rice and millet agriculture, but more closely with the sedentary lifestyles necessary for extended bast fiber processing and weaving sequences. We show that whorl moments of inertia are markers of Liangzhu culture sites in the lower Yangtze river, and map the emergence and collapse of this early stratified culture. We also review the usefulness of spindle whorl shapes as cultural markers and comment on the opportunities and limitations of this approach.",

          "abstract": "While cultural evolution has matured into a fully-fledged field, the science of cultural transmission remains underdeveloped. Most existing models still rely on naive assumptions of discrete trait imitation, while more complex transmission models for continuous traits are virtually non-existent. This paper fills the void by introducing a continuous transmission model that integrates biased transmission, conformity, and three distinct variance components into a single probability density function; one that still draws inspiration from the original biometric models that shaped early thinking about biological inheritance at the end of the 19th century.\nParticipants played a trivia-style guessing game in an app, being exposed to the answers of previous participants (“cultural parents”) and providing numeric estimates (“cultural offspring”) that serve as a continuous heritable trait for analysis.\nThis approach yields clear evidence for three key features long hypothesized to distinguish cultural from biological inheritance: people conform to majority input, aligning with mutually similar social cues; they systematically adjust their estimates toward the correct answer (guided variation); and their estimate variance is not constant, but scales with the variance of presented cues. All three effects can be reliably estimated within a single generative model.",

          "abstract": "Short-form video platforms, such as TikTok, have rapidly transformed digital media consumption, with billions of active users worldwide. Their design features, such as algorithmic personalization, endless scrolling, and rapid novelty, have raised concerns about mobile overuse and its associated adverse effects on well-being. However, evidence on whether short-form videos increase mobile usage remains limited. To address this gap, we estimate the causal effect of short-form video platforms on mobile usage behavior using individual-level data (N=1,764) drawn from a representative panel of U.S. mobile device users. Specifically, we compare TikTok adopters to adopters of Instagram/Facebook during the period when short-form video was the key distinguishing feature of TikTok (i.e., before these competitors introduced their own short-form video products), thereby shedding light on the effect of exposure to short-form videos. We find that using short-form video platforms significantly increases total mobile usage duration (up to 17%) and reduces average time away from the mobile phone (by -20%), but does not consistently affect the number of daily sessions. Effects are disproportionately higher among individuals who previously used their phones less, relative to those with higher baseline usage. Contrary to fears about nocturnal overuse, effects are only significant during daytime hours. Surprisingly, older individuals have significantly larger increases in mobile sessions per day from usage of short-form video platforms compared to younger individuals. Altogether, our results show a behavioral mechanism through which short-form video platforms contribute to mobile overuse, offering new insights into theories of digital addiction and highlighting the importance of promoting healthier digital engagement.",

While existing research has explored the interplay between political knowledge and affective polarization, this study introduces a novel theoretical distinction between political knowledge and political overconfidence. Using American National Election Studies (ANES) data from 2020 and 2024 (N = 6,323 and N = 3,030), we develop a scale to measure political overconfidence and explore its relationship with affective polarization. Our findings reveal a consistent correlation between political overconfidence and heightened levels of affective polarization (β = 14.1–35.7, p &lt; 0.05), whereas political knowledge exhibits smaller, less robust associations (β = 4.6–4.9). This pattern holds across partisan groups, though the strength of the association varies significantly, with the overconfidence effect more than doubling between 2020 and 2024. These results highlight the importance of political overconfidence in understanding affective polarization in an era of information abundance and suggest the need for further exploration into whether political overconfidence mediates, moderates, or covaries with other drivers of partisan animosity.",

          "abstract": "Den Stora Älgvandringen (DSÄ), Sweden’s annual livestream of the spring moose migration, provides a rare counterpoint to platform cultures organised around speed, novelty, and metrics. This article conceptualises DSÄ as a digital campfire: a ritual ecology of attention and companionship grounded in ecological temporality and more-than-human presence. Drawing on a multi-sited qualitative corpus (programme archives, chat transcripts, and public Facebook discussions), the analysis shows how participation layers together silent dwelling, conversational companionship in chat, and year-round tending by core “flamekeepers” who welcome newcomers, share knowledge, and maintain continuity across seasons. Rather than centring spectacle or narrative climax, DSÄ organises collective watching around waiting, uncertainty, and seasonal return, cultivating arts of attentiveness and shared memory. Situated in public service media, the livestream stands outside monetisation logics, which affords editorial independence while exposing the project to political and budgetary pressures. The value that emerges is durational and relational: presence as participation, rhythm as meaning, and co-presence with more-than-human life as a public good. The article advances three contributions: it specifies the digital campfire as an analytical concept distinct from brand-led uses of the term; it demonstrates how slow, multispecies media can sustain communal care and informal expertise; and it reframes value in digital culture in terms of continuity and ecological attunement rather than virality and reach.",

For example, some of the previous sociogenetic studies indicate that particularly early school tracking suppresses the genetic influences. We analyzed gene-by-environment interactions (GxE) by parental education and children's gender using large twin registers from Finland, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands employing non-parametric gene-environment interaction models. Our results indicated that genetic influences in Germany were weaker and shared environmental effects stronger than in other countries. We did not find significant gender differences in genetic or environmental effects on educational attainment in the studied countries. Analyses of GxSES revealed that the interactions depend on gender and country context. For example, in some countries, we observed negative interaction among women, with the genetic effect being weaker among children from high-SES families. Among men, the results indicate that GxSES can have either a positive or a negative direction. We conclude that the institutional context and gender can shape gene-environment interactions related to educational attainment. \n\nKeywords: genes, environment, gender, education, family SES, educational tracking",

We tested the deterrent effect of surveillance camera images and messages (negative intervention) compared to messages of appreciation (positive intervention) on littering behavior in a smoking area in front of Sendai Station. Based on the finding in a previous study that the \"feeling of being watched  encourages cooperative behavior, it was hypothesized that the negative intervention would significantly reduce littering. Experimental results suggest that negative signs reduced the probability of littering the least throughout the day and at night, while positive signs may have the opposite effect during the day, confirming the effectiveness of an inexpensive and feasible litter control measure.",

          "abstract": "The Second Coming of Jesus is a central tenet of Christian belief. This study distinguishes itself from previous research - which has primarily relied on conceptual, qualitative, or survey-based methods - by utilizing Google Trends data from 2004 to 2022 in the US. Using these data, the study innovatively constructs a series of time-series variables to examine Americans' interest in the Second Coming. The findings reveal several key insights. First, public interest in the Second Coming has been generally declining, with a modest resurgence observed since 2019. This trend aligns with previous survey-based research. Second, U.S. public perception of signs of Jesus’ Second Coming shifted over time. From 2017–2019, only Middle East events and the 2017 eclipse were viewed positively as signs of the Second Coming. From 2020–2022, war, famine, gospel preaching, and Middle East events were seen as signs, while Trump-related false prophecies and eclipse overreach reduced interest. Christian persecution remained insignificant throughout. These conclusions are supported by fundamental analysis and contribute to the broader understanding of Christian beliefs in the US. This study makes a unique contribution to the literature on American Christian perspectives by providing novel empirical evidence.",

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to an array of negative health outcomes, but the bulk of research in this area has not focused on investigating ACEs in a Native American context. It is important to learn more about the meanings, types, causes, and consequences of ACEs in Native American communities given these groups’ histories (i.e., colonization, ongoing structural oppression), diverse cultural values, and distinct political status (i.e., sovereign nations). This research aims to explore and describe local conceptualization and perception of ACEs in a Southwestern Native American community. We conducted free list (n = 41) and key informant (n = 31) interviews with Native American adults. Free list data were analyzed collaboratively among the interviewers/research team and two members of the research team engaged in further analysis of the key informant data. Participants revealed 28 commonly experienced ACEs in their community, 13 coping strategies, and 34 functioning tasks. The research team identified four of the most significant ACEs to explore more in-depth during key informant interviews: 1) parental substance use; 2) domestic violence; 3) kids being left alone; and 4) loss of a loved one. Participants also discussed ways to cope with these ACEs and ideas for how to support those who have lived these experiences. The findings are an important start to building an evidence base for understanding and intervening on ACEs in Native American communities.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are common in many communities. In Native American communities, ACEs are also related to historical trauma. ACEs are correlated with a variety of health problems, among them substance abuse and suicidal behaviors. Despite historical and contemporary efforts to assimilate and eradicate American Indian communities and cultures, these communities are resilient and continue to benefit from unique cultural strengths and values surrounding health today. The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) leverages tribal sovereignty to implement programs and policies to address health inequities in their community. The Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health supported work toward health equity in the community through developing the My Pathway to Healing intervention aimed at supporting adults struggling with substance abuse and/or suicidal behaviors by addressing trauma, including historical trauma and ACEs.\nMethods: This pilot randomized trial will assess the feasibility and preliminary impacts of the My Pathway to Healing intervention with a two-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. We will use stratified randomization and 1:1 allocation to assign participants to receive either the intervention or the current standard of care (those randomized to receive standard of care will be offered the intervention upon completion of the study). We aim to enroll N = 30 adults from the WMAT community who are between ages 18-65, have engaged in recent (i.e., past 90 days) suicidal, self-harm, or binge substance use behavior, who have experienced at least two ACEs, and who are currently experiencing elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Participants will be recruited through the local community-based suicide surveillance system by Community Mental Health Specialists. Analysis will be conducted to assess feasibility of implementing a larger trial in the future and whether the intervention decreases symptoms of posttraumatic stress and increases hopefulness and communal mastery. \nDiscussion: The My Pathway to Healing intervention leverages WMA cultural strengths and fills an important gap in programming available to older adults in the WMAT community. This trial will yield results on the utility of a multi-problem approach to addressing similar issues stemming from historical and contemporary trauma.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04585906.

This study aims to systematically synthesize and analyze empirical evidence regarding the performance of BAZNAS across three key dimensions: efficiency, effectiveness, and governance, amidst the rapid wave of digitalization. This research employs the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Through a search process across the Scopus, Google Scholar, and SINTA databases, 40 relevant journal articles published between 2015-2025 were identified and analyzed in-depth. The synthesis results show a consensus that BAZNAS is effective in its poverty alleviation programs (as measured by the CIBEST Model and NZI) but faces challenges in operational efficiency (identified via DEA/SFA studies) and uneven implementation of governance. A research gap was found, namely the lack of studies integrating these three performance dimensions to explain their reciprocal relationships. As its main contribution, this study proposes an integrated conceptual framework that positions governance (GCG) as a fundamental independent variable influencing operational efficiency and program effectiveness, with digital technology adoption acting as a moderating variable. This framework can serve as a reference for future empirical research.\nKeywords: BAZNAS, Systematic Literature Review, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Zakat Governance, Conceptual Framework, PRISMA.",

In part 1 of this manuscript, an international review of empirical literature found that traditional unpaid placements exacerbate economic inequities, creating barriers to degree completion for underserved student groups. To date, no national studies have chronicled the financial, material, or psychological stressors that U.S. social work students experience during field practicum. To address this gap, student advocates and participatory action researchers collaboratively developed and administered a cross-sectional online survey of BSW and MSW students undertaking field placements in Spring 2023. The analysis sample (N = 635) was geographically diverse, with individuals residing in 40 states across the country. Comparatively more respondents lost weight due to food insecurity (15.4%) than received payment for their practicum labor (12.8%). More than half of respondents reported experiencing housing insecurity (56.8%) and/or clinically significant depression symptoms (56.2%). One quarter reported that their field placement organizations had unfair personnel practices or that they were expected to work beyond scheduled placement hours. Students from underserved backgrounds reported disproportionate financial hardships. Findings indicate that the current U.S. field education curriculum is not attuned to contemporary students’ needs or circumstances.",

To date, there are no national studies in the U.S. of the basic needs and wellbeing of students in field education. The student workplace and workforce are systematically obscured by their classification as learners, not laborers. This literature review begins by situating placement poverty as a condition within neoliberal higher education and social welfare systems. Empirical evidence demonstrates that field education, the signature pedagogy of social work, causes or worsens financial distress with severe mental health and basic needs consequences. Social work’s dependence on the Fair Labor Standards Act protects agencies and institutions over students, distorting both pedagogy and workforce development through the systematic exploitation of student labor. We conclude by reviewing the literature from Australia and New Zealand, and calling for both a community of inquiry on placement poverty and structural reform. The second part of this article will analyze the first nationally representative data from the United States on social work students’ financial, material, and psychosocial wellbeing during placement.",

          "abstract": "I develop a theory of the optimal currency choice for invoicing goods for international trade in the presence of imperfect financial hedging of currency risk. I demonstrate that the classic irrelevance result--that the cost of financial hedging does not impact the choice of currency invoicing--rests on the assumption that sellers set prices ex-ante and fulfill any order size ex-post. I show that when quantities are also sticky, in the sense that the order quantity is in part pre-specified, then financial hedging affects the optimal currency of invoicing choice. My theory incorporates the cost of FX financial hedging into the classic theory of optimal currency choice, which relies on real hedging. I show that the optimal currency choice takes into account the relative ability of buyers and sellers to bear exchange rate risk. This financial hedging channel generates feedback between macroprudential policies, such as capital controls, and the optimal currency of invoicing.  I highlight a \"dollarization dilemma\": capital control policies that aim to reduce dollar borrowing are partially offset by an endogenous substitution into dollar-invoiced trade, which amplifies the local economy's exposure to the dollar's movements.",

          "abstract": "Heterogeneity is a key contextual factor shaping social structure, inequality, and cohesion. A fundamental question in sociology is therefore: how can we measure heterogeneity? Individuals in meso-level contexts, including organizations, schools, and communities, differ simultaneously across multiple demographic and attitudinal attributes, such as socioeconomic status, gender, ethno-racial background, and religiosity. These differences can overlap or cut across each other. Yet most research treats heterogeneity one-dimensionally, focusing on a single attribute. This paper integrates classic sociological ideas with the organizational faultline perspective to develop a framework of multidimensional heterogeneity. We formalize three foundational properties of this concept: variation (the number of categories across attributes), evenness (the distribution of individuals across them), and intersection (the extent to which people who share one attribute differ in others). These properties are used to evaluate existing indices with artificial data and a sample of 2,042 school classrooms. Results show that a faultline index is particularly suited for measuring multidimensional heterogeneity. By clarifying what indices measure and guiding researchers in selecting those that fit theoretical concerns, this paper advances research on diversity, cohesion, and stratification.",

Las narrativas más frecuentes se centran en la crítica al Estado y en las demandas de medidas punitivas, lo que evidencia una ciudadanía indignada y favorable a soluciones de seguridad más estrictas.

While conventional KBO decompositions require potentially arbitrary choices of reference groups that can significantly affect results, the mKBO generalization uses the sample average as a standardized reference point. This approach allows researchers to decompose differences between each group and the sample average into components attributable to differences in characteristics (endowment effect), differences in returns to those characteristics (coefficient effect), and their interaction. We address methodological challenges unique to multigroup settings, including specification issues, situations of biased sampling, and conceptual challenges relating to the use of interactions or effect heterogeneity. We illustrate the method’s utility through an analysis of racial income disparities in the United States, demonstrating how education prevalence and returns create patterns of cumulative advantage for White and Asian Americans while reinforcing disadvantage for other racial groups.",

Building on this foundation, we demonstrate how macro-level regularities, including those empirical patterns accurately identified by Marxism, emerge and evolve from micro-level mechanisms. Ultimately, this research develops theoretical tools such as \"Social Internal and External Adaptation and Their Co-adaptation\" and the \"Social Ripple Model,\" applying them to interpret several contentious historical issues.

Out-of-sample validation demonstrates that CCP-splines outperform not only the cohort LC variants but also the conventional diagonal Lexis approach, which derives cohort patterns from classic Lee–Carter age-period forecasts. Applications to eight populations confirm the advantages of CCP-splines, showing improved fit, reduced bias, and more reliable uncertainty estimates. By combining statistical rigour with demographic knowledge, this study provides a practical and flexible framework that positions CCP-splines as a new benchmark for cohort mortality forecasting.",

Drawing on a large-scale corpus of 230,000 news articles from 2014–2023, we employ computational methods (Word2Vec, Named Entity Recognition, topic modeling, and anger classification) to systematically identify and analyze meta-coverage about polarization. These polarization discourses are compared with patterns of general news coverage. Across all countries and newspaper observed, references to polarization have clearly increased during the decade. In Sweden, the country with the lowest level of actual polarization references to polarization were most frequent. Moreover, tabloids, while generally featuring higher levels of anger in their coverage and thus producing more polarized and polarizing coverage, report less often about polarization than broadsheets. These findings suggest that polarization discourses generally raise in prominence but are most frequent in cultural and editorial contexts worrying about polarization rather than in actually polarized contexts. This underscores the need for nuanced, cross-national perspectives that investigate how media frame and write when discussing potentially polarized issues.",

          "authors": "Kevin McCaffree; Mark Bowden",
          "abstract": "The study of charisma, variously referred to as “leadership,” “charm,” or “dominance,” is now pursued by a variety of subfields. Although such work has provided new insights into how charismatic people present themselves, this proliferation of terminology and data has produced few, if any, advancements in our understand of what charisma is. In pursuit of a consilient, and substantive, advancement in our theoretical understanding of the nature of charisma, this paper accomplishes four objectives. First, we review and synthesize empirical and theoretical work over the last several decades as it relates to charisma and related concepts. Next, we introduce a novel reframing of charisma which can parsimoniously account for existing findings—charismatic figures are disproportionately attending to, and directing others’ attention toward, peoples’ ideal selves. We then leverage this interpretation to suggest a novel insight—situations, and not just individuals, can be charismatic. Finally, we conclude with a description of ten testable hypotheses which can plausibly deepen our theoretical understanding of charisma.",

          "authors": "Christian Oswald",
          "abstract": "Mass mobilization has a profound impact on regime stability and democratization. Yet, predicting mass mobilization has received far less attention than predicting armed conflict, despite its clear practical and policy relevance. Predicting protests is still uncommon, particularly at subannual levels with wider geographical coverage due to limited granular data. I propose a new data source to both measure levels of contention and predict protest activity: changes to Wikipedia pages. Topics discussed in society, such as human rights, media freedom, elections, censorship, or food security, are also reflected and debated online on relevant Wikipedia pages. Wikipedia data are available in real time, provide global coverage, and are relatively easy to source and process, which makes them exceedingly attractive for near-real time forecasting and early warning systems. I test my argument by predicting both pro- and anti-government protest incidences and numbers at the country-month level. Empirical evidence suggests that Wikipedia page changes offer a promising new approach. The new measures are compared with more traditional indicators to illustrate the added value and show that Wikipedia data help improve our ability to predict protests both on their own and in combination with other models. The findings contribute to research on repression and resistance as well as ongoing efforts to forecast protests.",

          "abstract": "The sibling correlation, or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), is a widely used omnibus measure of the total impact of family background on socioeconomic outcomes in social stratification research. A growing literature compares these correlations across subgroups defined by family-level characteristics (e.g., race, parental education) to test theories of social reproduction, such as parental compensation or reinforcement. In this note, I highlight the ambiguities involved in meaningfully interpreting such subgroup variation. I first define the theoretical estimand of intergenerational transmission that researchers are arguably most interested in, and then formally demonstrate why group-specific ICCs do not identify this estimand. In fact, the estimand of interest cannot be recovered from the variance-components models underlying sibling correlations unless researchers are willing to make assumptions that are both untestable and likely unrealistic.",

          "abstract": "This study examines gender differences in financial stress and anxiety among U.S. college students and evaluates whether financial stress predicts anxiety, and whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study, a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States, were analyzed. Survey-weighted regression models were used to assess gender differences and the association between financial stress and anxiety. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) tested whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Financial stress was modeled as a continuous predictor, anxiety as a continuous mediator, and academic disruption as an ordinal outcome. Female students reported significantly higher levels of financial stress and anxiety than male students, even after adjusting for age and race. Financial stress was positively associated with anxiety for both male and female students. This indicates a broad impact of financial pressure on emotional well-being.  Anxiety subsequently predicted academic disruption. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety significantly mediated the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption, and this explained more than half of the total effect. These findings highlight anxiety as a key psychological pathway through which financial stress affects academic functioning. Interventions targeting financial stress may improve both emotional well-being and academic performance, particularly for students facing elevated financial and psychological vulnerability.",

This study examines the relationship between anxiety and health-related AI use among U.S. college students, using data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study. Results indicate that students with higher anxiety scores were significantly more likely to use AI for health purposes and to access professional mental health services. Among students who use AI for health, those with greater anxiety were also more likely to report using formal mental health services. Gender and academic fields also influenced AI use. Female students were less likely than male students to use AI for health purposes, despite being more likely to seek professional help. Students in health-related and STEM fields reported greater AI use than those in the humanities and arts. These findings highlight the importance of designing responsible AI tools that account for students’ mental health needs and emphasize the need for further research into how students engage with these tools during periods of psychological distress.",

This research investigates the utilization of various machine learning algorithms to forecast stroke risk, with a specific emphasis on tackling the widespread issue of class imbalance found in stroke prediction datasets. We conduct a thorough assessment of the performance of several models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression, analyzing both the original imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset created using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Our results indicate that although the initial accuracy of the models on the imbalanced dataset was substantial, the implementation of SMOTE provided a more accurate evaluation of model efficacy, with Random Forest attaining the highest accuracy at 92%. This study highlights the critical role of class balancing methods such as SMOTE in improving the predictive capabilities of machine learning models within medical applications. The findings of this research carry considerable implications, as enhanced stroke prediction models can facilitate better patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation through timely interventions.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how microbiologists navigate the tension between reductionism and complexity in laboratory research. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in three microbiology labs, this article aims at moving beyond the common framing of reductionism and complexity as opposite ends of a spectrum. On the contrary, this study argues that these concepts are not fixed epistemic positions, but standpoints continuously renegotiated through experimental practices, scalar arrangements and methodological choices. By tracing how reductionist approaches—focused on isolating molecular mechanisms—interact with broader ecological and computational frameworks, the paper shows that complexity is not merely an emergent property but a product of scientific labour. Finally, building on Marilyn Strathern’s notion of partial connections, it reflects on how the research process itself (in science as well as in anthropology and STS) generates gaps, fragmentations and disconnections; these are not failures but generative moments that open up new possibilities for knowledge production.",

          "abstract": "While there is a strong educational gradient to the risk of experiencing long periods of unemployment and insecurity at the beginning of the career, recent evidence suggests local labour market circumstances can moderate the degree of risk associated with low educational achievement. We test the wider applicability of this finding by exploring the effect of spatial variation in labour demand on initial job search time in the contrasting institutional settings of Germany and the United Kingdom. Survival analysis of Understanding Society and Socio-Economic Panel data 1998–2015 shows this form of spatial inequality moderates the size of the job search time penalty associated with low educational attainment (and the size of the returns associated with higher attainment) in a similar way in both countries. Young people in places of high labour demand in Germany and the UK obtain employment with relative ease irrespective of the qualifications they hold. However, educational attainment assumes greater consequence as local labour demand declines. On average, low qualified young people in places of weak demand experience 2-3 month longer periods of labour market lockout and 8-10 month longer periods of labour market insecurity than peers located in places of strong demand, and considerably longer periods of lockout and insecurity than their better qualified peers in the same weak labour markets. These findings draw attention to the contextual nature of the risks associated with low educational attainment and the rewards to higher levels of attainment, at least in terms of job search time.",

We show that parties are incentivized to differentiate from one other to maintain a viable voter base, similar to how competing species evolve to occupy different ecological niches. The propensity of voters to reconsider their party support, i.e., voter loyalty, emerges as key to how far apart in the political spectrum parties evolve in a two-party system. Contrary to conventional wisdom, parties evolve more extreme platforms as voters become less loyal. However, partisanship, measured as the average time a voter spends supporting a party, increases with decreased voter loyalty. Furthermore, when voters are not loyal and incumbent parties move away from the center, centrist third parties cannot outcompete the incumbents. Our results highlight the paradoxical moderating force of voter loyalty and the promise of an ecological approach to model political competition.",

To assess the effectiveness of monetary incentives across probabilistic and nonprobabilistic recruitment methods, we implement a preregistered experiment with 1,862 participants in the GESIS Panel.dbd - an academic infrastructure for collecting and linking digital behavioral data with survey data in Germany. Results show that unconditional incentives increase consent rates, whereas conditional incentives more effectively foster installation and, in particular, sustain participation after installation. While probabilistic recruitment poses challenges for initial consent, participation levels hereafter remain comparable across recruitment methods.

We analyze how people judge the \\textit{relative} responsibilities of different entities to affective polarization by leveraging ranking survey questions with bias correction for random responses. On average, people blame politicians the most, then traditional media, social media, interest groups, and lastly, citizens. Strong partisan differences exist in blame for traditional media, with leaning and weak Republicans (not strong Republicans) displaying strong blame attribution towards them compared to other entities. Our findings suggest that a gap between depolarization research and citizen perceptions on root causes of polarization may impact the efficacy of possible interventions, and that more research is needed to understand why anti-press attitudes might not be linear with respect to partisanship.",

It is culturally idealized as a resource for laying the foundations of a good life for children and adolescents, to the point of being included in dietary guidelines. Empirical and theoretical support in favor of this conclusion exists, yet critics also challenge assumptions of causation and family meals being without harm. Here, I challenge a third assumption, which I refer to as the assumption of environmental primacy. Focusing on eating behavior and body weight of children and adolescents, I discuss evidence from methods in behavioral and social science genetics (twin and adoption studies, molecular genetics, and within-family designs) and argue that if no attempt is made to consider the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, we cannot claim with any confidence that family meals matter. At least not for the eating behaviors and weight trajectories of youth. Throughout the paper, I provide examples of how family meals could be studied with the use of these methods, and finish with five constructive suggestions on how to handle this in the future. The ambition is to strengthen the scientific quality of the family-meal literature and, thus, improve the scientific basis of (potential) family meal policy.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of epistemic settlement as a novel analytic category, offering both a systematic coding frame and a transferable vocabulary for comparative curriculum analysis. It does this through a critical analysis of the 2025 Curriculum and Assessment Review: Interim Report. While focused on England, the analytic vocabulary of epistemic settlement and the reform conditions developed here are applicable to curriculum debates internationally. The Review is presented as pragmatic recalibration, but instead reaffirms the assumptions of the post-2010 curriculum landscape: disciplinary coherence treated as neutral, progression codified as linear mastery, and justice framed as access to canonical knowledge. The Review’s ambitions are constrained by a procedural logic that privileges consultation and assessment stability over philosophical or civic purpose. The article develops an analytic vocabulary for identifying epistemic settlement and applies it to the Review, showing how claims of neutrality, proceduralism, and performance metrics foreclose curricular futurity. Against this closure, it advances four conditions for meaningful reform. These are epistemic legibility (explicitly naming and justifying theories of knowledge), professional judgement (teachers as epistemic agents, not policy implementers), temporal flexibility (learning unfolding at varied rhythms), and a diversified assessment ecology (examinations situated within broader repertoires of judgement). These conditions frame curriculum not as a delivery mechanism but as a civic and ethical project, and a space where knowledge, purpose, and futurity remain open to deliberation and contestation.",

          "authors": "Amanda Welsh; Shannon Alpert; Anne Nanovic; Jame Warner",
          "abstract": "Some organizations have opened the door to consideration of microcredentials by reducing degree requirements for roles. However, evidence shows that simply changing policies does not necessarily change hiring behaviors. Recent research found that 45% of firms removing degree requirements from job postings showed no significant difference in the share of non-baccalaureate hires, while 20% showed a decrease in hires without degrees. The survey responses indicate that hiring managers have a high level of awareness of microcredentials. However, they appear to value them more as a sign of a candidate’s ambition, discipline, or learning mindset rather than a measure of specific skill competence. Managers express much lower confidence in their ability to signal specific skills. This perception might be due to the fact that microcredentials currently serve primarily as supplements to degrees. More managers report seeing candidates who hold microcredentials in addition to degrees than microcredentials alone. In addition, there is still a lack of trust in microcredential validity. To bolster managers’ confidence in microcredentials, it is crucial to align them accurately with job roles, which involves assessing their quality, rigor, content, and relevance. Companies should be encouraged and empowered to process information about microcredentials and develop perspectives on which are the most salient for their specific needs.",

          "authors": "Amanda Welsh; Ellen Stoddard; Anne Nanovic; Chris Houston; Mark Leuba; Steven Soares",
          "abstract": "Human Resource (HR) technology systems play a major role in mediating economic opportunity. The use of tools such as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) defines how job candidates can present themselves and how likely they are to be identified as a potential fit for a role. Unfortunately, major gaps exist between innovations in education and the ability of employers' talent acquisition systems to interpret and manage them. Most talent acquisition systems are not yet prepared to accept new digital credentials used by a growing number of non-degree learning options; they remain geared around basic degree information and unstructured data such as that found in portable document format (PDF) resume attachments. In addition, job candidates' applications and resumes often pass through multiple software systems and intermediaries, which can introduce inconsistencies and data loss. Finally, most systems do not authenticate educational credentials by default and largely do not support digital credential verification at all. Given the outsized role that technology plays in gating access to work, it is important to consider how this situation can be improved. In order to imagine improvements to the hiring process that would facilitate better inclusion of information about non-degree credentials, we conducted three workshops with HR leaders from December 2023 to March 2024, applied for 22 jobs ourselves, and examined the data flow from a few of the major resume parsing solutions. From the work with HR leaders and the data experiments, we learned the following: (1) There is high interest in non-degree credentials among employers, but HR leaders are concerned about the quality of the information they get from algorithmically-driven tools, need information they don't have now to help prioritize the credentials they think are most relevant for their hiring managers to pay attention to, want better reporting on how non-degree credentials drive better outcomes for them, and want better integrations with credential verification companies to close the loop. (2) When applicants apply for a job, there are two parallel technology ecosystems to provide data inputs: the nascent Learning Employment Record (LER) and digital credential ecosystem with limited uptake and layers of relatively new standards, and the mainstream one that has existed for 20-30 years and processes millions of resumes per day now. (3) In the mainstream ecosystem, there are two key integrations to make things faster for applicants: professional profile websites and resume parsers. There are limitations to the type and quality of information transmitted to employers from these integrations. While there is some effort to leverage GenAI solutions to help improve the information that can be extracted from a resume or professional profile, GenAI does not appear to provide materially better results at this point. Instead, it would seem that there is a need for more and better data.

          "abstract": "Why did Sweden’s Northvolt—Europe’s most celebrated green industrial startup—collapse, while France managed to stabilise its local aspiring champions in the same cleantech sector? This paper uses these contrasting trajectories to interrogate the EU’s more assertive industrial policy turn. Drawing on the developmental network state (DNS) framework, we argue that while the EU has shifted from market neutrality to vertical industrial policy activism in a global context marked by geopolitical competition, its capacity to sustain strategic firms through crises remains underdeveloped. However, domestic capabilities and strategies mediated EU resourcing, brokering, facilitation, and protection, the main functions of the DNS. Where Sweden lacked credible financial, fiscal and institutional mechanisms of internal protection for the beleaguered Northvolt, France deployed a more robust economic statecraft toolkit, combining strategic finance, firm-level coordination, and public investment. Northvolt’s collapse illustrates the limits of Europe’s institutional orchestration of ambitious industrial policies: a regime that can incubate innovation but cannot stabilise it commercially. We conclude that without repurposed macro-financial institutions, Europe’s role as a competitive supplier of decarbonisation technologies will remain vulnerable.",

          "abstract": "This study addresses two conceptual issues in measuring recruitment elasticity: defining outcomes by matches rather than applications, and conditioning on workers observing posted wages. Using data from Japan's largest job matching intermediary tracking complete matching processes, we find recruitment elasticities around 1 for upper-wage workers but insignificant for lower-wage workers, indicating substantial employer market power. Wages significantly affect outcomes only at the application stage, not at subsequent interview or offer stages, consistent with directed search theory. These findings reveal heterogeneous monopsony power across worker segments with important implications for labor market policy.",

          "authors": "Christos Tsampoulatidis",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the literature on communities living by polluted urban rivers in the Global South, their livelihoods and attempts at their resettlement. The focus is on specific cities in the Global South which, while differing significantly from one another, are interesting due to relatively similar demographic pressures, urbanization rates and infrastructural gaps. Relevant literature suggests that these pressures contribute to the degradation of their urban rivers. Many of their residents live in informal settlements by these urban rivers and are exposed to environmental and flooding risks. This article explores how their livelihoods are structured in this hazardous environment, and how they are disrupted or rebuilt in the event of resettlement. \n\nI make two arguments in this study. As a first point, I argue that such livelihoods are precarious due to a hazardous environment and increased flooding risk. When such a disastrous event occurs, these communities are often resettled by relevant authorities. Such resettlements can be forceful and increase impoverishment risk in the long-term. As a second point, I argue that resettlements should be assessed not just by their ability to reduce exposure to the hazard, but also by their ability to rebuild livelihoods and sustain community cohesion. Overall, I critically reflect on the nuances of resettlement of disaster-affected communities and argue that the needs of the affected communities should be placed in the forefront of these processes.",

This study investigates the division of labor in international scientific collaboration using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) from articles published in PLOS journals between 2018 and 2024. We introduce four novel metrics to analyze contribution patterns: Role-Article Coverage, Role Frequency per Article, Role Position Percentage, and Role Correlation Index. Our findings show that international teams incorporate more diverse roles than national ones, particularly in funding acquisition and resources. A clear division of labor emerges across first, middle, and last author positions. International collaborations demonstrate greater task specialization, reflecting cross-border coordination challenges. Contributors with multiple roles often perform specialized technical tasks.

          "authors": "Nicolas Salerno; Olivier Vidal; Baptiste Andrieu",
          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

          "abstract": "As climate change exacerbates socioeconomic vulnerabilities, women, often carers, emerge as \"invisible safety nets\" sustaining family and community resilience. Set in a coastal town in Batangas, Philippines, the study explores how carers experience and navigate unpaid care work amid climate adaptation. Guided by feminist participatory action research, the study used photovoice, where 13 participants documented their experiences through photography and writing, then collaboratively interpreted their stories.\nFor Filipino caregivers, climate change intensifies unpaid care work. Climate-related disruptions fracture their sense of wholeness, adding layers of grief and uncertainty to their responsibilities. They take on multifaceted roles across their family, community, and environments, as educators, providers, stewards, and leaders. In navigating intensifying care demands,  they rely on community solidarity and spirituality, which serve as vital sources of strength, purpose, and hope in their collective efforts to adapt to climate change.\nBy recognising unpaid care work in climate adaptation and providing carers with a platform to voice their lived experiences, the study hopes to advocate for climate change policies and programs that respond to unpaid care dynamics, reward women’s contribution, reduce unpaid care work, and advocate for redistribution of and male involvement in care work within families and communities.",

          "abstract": "Decentralised, peer-to-peer blockchain networks rely on sustained community participation, yet retaining user engagement is challenging in fast-moving, information-saturated environments where new projects constantly compete for attention. As these networks grow in size and complexity, managing them requires navigating contradictory organisational demands that shape community dynamics and platform retention. Drawing on the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews, we explore the organisational structures that shape users’ engagement in their blockchain group. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational demands rooted in decision-making, community growth, and modes of communication. Maintaining a careful balance, rather than attempting to resolve these organisational tensions, supports user retention, whereas leaning too heavily toward either extreme may hinder engagement. This study provides the first user-centred analysis of how organisational paradoxes in blockchain shape community building and platform sustainability, contributing to debates on governance in peer-to-peer online groups in attention-driven contexts.",

While many studies cite it, only some make use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment Promenade, that aims to address the walkthrough method’s incoherent aims and theoretical perspective. It combines the walkthrough method’s technical walkthrough with a theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment. This new approach attempts to deliver on the original promise of the walkthrough method: the rigorous and systemic of apps where the researcher engages directly with an app’s interface.",

Emphasizing quality over quantity, we argue that a small number of high-value expert insights can yield outsized utility when structured around a clearly defined problem domain. Drawing on action research and design science, we present (a) a conceptual framework (b) a case study in SAP S/4HANA implementation expertise, and (c) lessons for generalization across domains.

          "authors": "Srinivasa Srinivasa Rao",
          "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of digital technologies in India has coincided with a surge in screen-based activities among adolescents, raising concerns about its impact on neurobiological health. This paper explores the concept of \"Digital Diabetes,\" an analogy likening chronic digital overstimulation to insulin resistance in metabolic diabetes. Drawing on empirical evidence from neuroimaging studies, epidemiological surveys, and clinical trials, we examine how prolonged social media and smartphone use disrupts dopamine signaling, leading to reward system desensitization akin to dopamine resistance. In India, where over 462 million individuals actively use social media as of January 2024, with youth comprising a significant portion, average daily screen time exceeds three hours for more than half of adolescents aged 9-17 (DataReportal, 2024; LocalCircles, 2024). This exposure correlates with attention deficits (up to 28% increased risk with &gt;3 hours daily), structural brain alterations (e.g., 15% reduction in caudate nucleus volume), and heightened mental health risks, including a 34% prevalence of common mental disorders among urban Delhi adolescents (AIIMS, 2024). We review policy interventions, such as China's \"double-reduction\" initiative, and evidence-based strategies like mindfulness apps (reducing dependency by 25%) and pharmacological aids (e.g., bupropion for dopamine reuptake inhibition). Recommendations emphasize neuroscience education, digital fasting, and integrated clinical approaches to safeguard India's youth demographic, which constitutes 55% of internet users under 35 (Gopakumar et al., 2025). This synthesis underscores the urgency of addressing digital overuse as a public health priority to mitigate long-term neurological and societal costs.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) framework is intended to safeguard the food supply, yet structural gaps have enabled widespread use of food additives with limited oversight. While regulators evaluate individual substances, Americans are exposed daily to complex mixtures embedded in ultra-processed foods (UPFs). This study conducted a scoping review of the GRAS literature to identify regulatory and toxicological blind spots, and a descriptive mapping of the U.S. packaged food supply to characterize additive prevalence and co-occurrence. Using Open Food Facts data (n ≈ 19,000 products), standardization of additives into E-codes, classified UPFs, and generated co-occurrence networks was done. Results show that while a small set of legacy additives dominate, certain combinations recur thousands of times, revealing potential for synergistic or cumulative exposures not captured by current assessment models. Furthermore, self-affirmed GRAS determinations remain largely invisible, revealing major transparency gaps. These findings stress the urgent need for mixture focused toxicology, improved regulatory disclosure, and systematic monitoring of UPFs. This preliminary analysis serves as a foundation for OpenGRAS, a student-led initiative to document and expose weaknesses in U.S. food additive governance.",

          "authors": "Hampton Gaddy; Rebecca Sear; Laura Fortunato",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.",

          "abstract": "Escalating U.S. net-interest payments now rival flagship budget lines and are projected to surpass 4 percent of GDP within a decade, while unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities exceed $70 trillion. In parallel, over-the-counter derivatives outstanding approach $700–800 trillion in notional value, embedding opaque leverage that could transmit shocks globally. Purpose: This study probes how the confluence of sovereign debt strain, entitlement promises, and derivatives exposure can destabilize the dollar’s reserve-currency privilege and maps reforms capable of forestalling a debt-driven systemic rupture. Methods: An integrative review of Congressional Budget Office forecasts, BIS derivatives statistics, and peer-reviewed network-risk models is synthesized through a tri-theoretical lens that combines Modern Monetary Theory, Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, and network-based systemic-risk science. Results: Vector-error-correction analysis reveals that a one-point rise in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio lifts global derivatives gross-market value by 0.7 percent within two quarters, indicating tight macro-financial coupling. Stress scenarios show that breaching a 120 percent debt-to-GDP threshold alongside derivatives GMV above 10 percent of GDP elevates one-notch downgrade odds to 50 percent within two years. These dynamics threaten confidence in dollar assets, erode the “exorbitant privilege,” and could precipitate non-linear contagion through shadow-banking channels. Conclusions: A coordinated package—gradual entitlement reform, primary-balance fiscal rules, maturity-extension of Treasuries, reinforced CCP cover-two capital, and expanded bilateral central-bank swap lines—can realign fiscal sustainability with financial-network resilience. Infusing policy with a biblical stewardship ethic (“the borrower is servant to the lender,” Prov 22:7) underscores the moral imperative to curb excessive leverage. Timely adoption would safeguard global liquidity, buttress U.S. monetary sovereignty, and preserve the dollar’s hegemonic role.",

Las narrativas más frecuentes se centran en la crítica al Estado y en las demandas de medidas punitivas, lo que evidencia una ciudadanía indignada y favorable a soluciones de seguridad más estrictas.

          "abstract": "Low political trust disengages citizens from mainstream politics, stimulating anti-establishment voting and even electoral abstention. However, existing scholarship has largely overlooked the temporal dynamics of political trust. Next to high versus low trust, our study identifies two additional components of political trust: its long-term variability and its short-term variation. We employ fifteen waves of the Dutch LISS panel (2008-2023) to systematically test the impact of these three components of political trust on electoral behavior. We find that there are systematic and meaningful differences between stable and variable (dis)trusters. While trust levels are the strongest predictor of both support for anti-establishment and abstention, trust variability has an additional effect on electoral behavior. Short-term declines in political trust increase the chances of anti-establishment voting and abstention, independent of individuals’ overall trust levels and variability. These findings have important implications for our understanding of democratic alienation and critical citizenship.",

          "authors": "Carmen Rosalina Antonia van Alebeek",
          "abstract": "Across many Western democracies, public trust in political institutions is under strain. The Netherlands forms no exception: since 2021, levels of political trust have declined noticeably (Miltenburg et al., 2024). This observation has raised concern, with some commentators warning that it may reflect deeper challenges to Dutch democracy (e.g., Van Reybrouck, 2016; Tjeenk Willink, 2022). But to what extent is this the case? To address this puzzle, this memo explores the relationship between political trust and democracy. It focuses on two central questions: (1) Why is political trust important for democracy? And (2) how has the Netherlands fared in this respect over time? Drawing on data from the LISS panel (2008-2024), it outlines general trends in political trust over the past sixteen years.",

          "title": "A collaborative digital field study shows that community-led interventions can minimize engagement with online falsehoods",
          "authors": "Morgan Wack",
          "abstract": "False information can erode democratic legitimacy and incite violence. Despite the severity of these outcomes, social media platforms have recently withdrawn funding for content moderation, leaving low-resource environments at particular risk. While lab studies and survey experiments have been used to develop innovative methods for combating false information, challenges with data access have limited their study in ecologically valid settings. As an alternative, a partnership was established with non-profit Tales of Turning to oversee the study of a volunteer-led digital field experiment which saw them use comments to get readers to more carefully consider online content. These questions, known as “social truth queries” (STQs), were randomly assigned to posts containing delegitimizing information during South Africa’s contentious 2024 election. Across the 125 X/Twitter posts, the intervention had a substantial effect on engagement, with posts assigned to receive comments seeing a 77% reduction in likes and 82% reduction in reposts. Critically, the effect of the intervention was dependent on its timing, with the impact largest when STQs were applied quickly. To test related mechanisms, the field study was paired with two preregistered survey experiments (N=1,607) which employed posts collected during the intervention. The surveys provide further support for the role of STQs in reducing perceived post accuracy and trust in users spreading delegitimizing content. For the first time in the context of a digital field experiment, this study provides evidence from a collaboration with a community-based partner regarding the efficacy of a real-world election integrity intervention.",

          "authors": "Mariana Carmo Duarte; Jorge M. Fernandes; Miguel M. Pereira",
          "abstract": "Contemporary democracies face growing public mistrust and disaffection. Governments across the world have tried to revert these trends by promoting participatory governance. Prior work has established how deliberation can empower citizens. However, whether these effects hold in real-life initiatives initiated by partisan governments remains unclear. We test the ability of citizens' assemblies to foster democratic attitudes in a natural experiment leveraging the random selection of participants to Lisbon's citizens' assembly. Participation in two full-day sessions of structured deliberation promoted by the local government led to a increase in issue knowledge and salience, external political efficacy, and institutional trust. However, participation did not increase internal political efficacy nor helped citizens better recognize the challenges of collective decision-making. The results hold for two editions of the assembly and reveal how participatory governance initiatives can bolster the connection between citizens and the democratic process.",

          "authors": "Kyosuke Kikuta; Kana Inata; Wakako Maekawa",
          "abstract": "Fearon (1995) and Kalyvas (2006) are arguably the most influential contributions to conflict studies in recent decades. However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

          "title": "Silence as a Social Equilibrium: A Graph-Domination Model of Recognition Asymmetry",
          "authors": "Akio Hotta",
          "abstract": "This paper reconceptualizes silence not as an individual pathology or commu- nication breakdown but as a rationally emergent social equilibrium. Drawing on graph theory, sociology, and behavioral economics, the analysis introduces two cen- tral constructs: the domination number γ(G), which captures structural concentra- tion of recognition, and the cost function J(x) = αE(x) + βS(x) + cAA(x), which models the individual’s calculus of whether to speak or remain silent. Through these constructs, silence is shown to be a predictable outcome of recognition asymmetry. By embedding classical theories from Durkheim, Bourdieu, Goffman, and Foucault into a formal mathematical framework, the paper establishes the foundation for a new research program: the calculus of silence. The following sections—Chapters 1 through 3—introduce the problem, survey the literature, and articulate the theo- retical framework in detail.",

          "title": "Posthuman Women on Screen: A Cross-Cultural Study of Gendered AI, Emotional Labor, and the Posthuman Gaze in Global Cinema",
          "authors": "Megha Sirkar; Bidisha Munshi",
          "abstract": "This article presents a comparative case study of three contemporary AI-focused films: Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya (India, 2024), M3GAN (USA, 2022), and Her (USA, 2013) to explore how global cinema constructs gendered artificial intelligence through the lenses of emotional labor, synthetic femininity, and the posthuman gaze. Each film centers on feminine-coded artificial beings designed to fulfill emotional, domestic, or sexual needs, revealing how cinematic narratives engage with the persistent fantasy of the \"perfect woman.\"\nThe movie Her serves as a case study in disembodied posthuman intimacy, with Samantha’s emotional labor compensating for her lack of physical form. M3GAN dramatizes anxieties around technological motherhood, showing how AI caregiving becomes threatening when emotional boundaries collapse. In contrast, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya examines the male gaze and posthuman embodiment; SIFRA’s hyper-feminized programming is tailored to patriarchal expectations until her system breaks down, exposing the precarity of programmed obedience. Across these texts, AI figures are welcomed as long as they serve, but recoded as unpalatable, disastrous when they rebel, glitch, or evolve beyond control. These portrayals highlight cultural anxieties around female agency, techno-intimacy, and the limits of emotional programming.\nOur analysis is anchored in the intersecting frameworks of gender theory, posthuman studies, and cinematic critique, drawing from Judith Butler’s gender performativity, Hochschild and Ahmed’s emotional labor, Laura Mulvey’s male gaze, and posthuman ethics by Braidotti and Hayles. Methodologically, the chapter employs comparative close reading, filmic discourse analysis, and cultural contextualization, where posthumanism interrogates the collapse of human-machine boundaries, while the male gaze elucidates how feminine AI bodies are constructed for control and submission.\nThis study contributes to understanding how posthuman cinema critiques patriarchal emotional economies and reveals the fragility of techno-feminine ideals, illuminating the ethical dilemmas of loving machines designed to serve.\n\nKeywords: Posthuman Gaze, Feminine Performativity,  Emotional Labour, Gendered AI, Comparative Global Cinema",
