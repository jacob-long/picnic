          "authors": "Zezhong Wang; Sheelagh Carpendale",
          "abstract": "We explore input data comics as a medium to foster active engagement with data input through visual storytelling. They integrate the richness of human experience, narrative, and visual communication into the data collection process, producing contextualized narratives. Through three examples, we illustrate how input data comics foster engagement, support interpretation, and create space for participatory storytelling experiences between the comic creator and the audience. We explore seven purposes through which input data comics can transform data into participatory and reflective experiences. These purposes parallel those of input visualizations: Individual Reflection, Public Group Reflection, Public Activity Documentation, Data Discussion, Survey, Planning, and Organizing. This suggests the broad potential applications of input data comics in the future.",

Using the Trustworthiness in Randomised Clinical Trials (TRACT) checklist, five concerns in 5 domains out of 7 were identified. Four concerns are considered major due to retrospective registration, significance and inconsistencies in summary data presented, fast recruitment of patients and major discrepancies in data as well as methodology that exist between the conference abstract and the published trail. These serious and multiple concerns suggest the urgent need for reliable investigation of the trustworthiness of the POSTAL study.

          "authors": "Gabriela Dârzan",
          "abstract": "Modern health and social science research faces well-documented challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and practical feasibility. A significant proportion of studies cannot be replicated, and incomplete reporting leads to wasted resources. Equally, many promising interventions fail to translate into practice due to unrecognized feasibility obstacles in planning and implementation. This article introduces S-FIPR (Software for Feasibility and Integrity of Research Projects), which is an integrated digital platform designed to improve research project rigor, transparency, and viability from inception to dissemination. We outline the background reproducibility and feasibility gaps that motivate the development of S-FIPR, then describe the platform’s concept, including its user roles, workflows, and core functional blocks. A central innovation is the Feasibility Index (F-Index), a composite score assessing proposals across multiple domains with full auditability and explainability. We detail S-FIPR’s approach to responsible AI governance, such as model cards and bias mitigation, ensuring AI features remain transparent and advisory. The platform’s alignment with international standards - CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, FAIR data principles, and GDPR - is mapped, underscoring compliance with best practices in reporting, data management, and privacy. An evaluation plan is presented, leveraging usability scales and technology acceptance frameworks (TAM/UTAUT) to assess user experience and key adoption metrics. We discuss ethical and legal considerations, including research ethics oversight and data protection. Finally, we address current limitations and outline a roadmap from a minimum viable product (MVP) through pilot studies to broader scale-up. By embedding evidence-based safeguards and guidance into the research lifecycle, S-FIPR aims to bolster the integrity and feasibility of health research projects in the digital era. \nKeywords: Research integrity, Feasibility, Reproducibility, Digital platform, F-Index, AI governance, CONSORT, FAIR data, Usability, Health research",

          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer",
          "abstract": "The importance of open research information, particularly publication metadata, is widely recognised. Crossref is one of the most important infrastructures for registering open metadata as part of DOI record registration. It is widely known, however, that the metadata of many publications is far from complete, with many publishers making certain metadata openly available, but failing to do so for other metadata elements. \n\nOf course, publishers' ability to register this metadata with Crossref depends on their capacity to capture and retain this data in their production workflows. Manuscript submission systems are an important, yet largely overlooked, factor in the extent to which publishers make metadata available through Crossref. \n\nIn this paper, we present the results of an analysis investigating the correlation between the level of metadata that publishers deposit with Crossref and the submission systems that they deploy for their journals. We have looked at the 153 publishers with the largest amounts of publications in Crossref and concentrate on the four most commonly used systems: Editorial Manager, ScholarOne, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and eJournalPress. \n\nWe show that some submission systems appear better suited to capturing certain metadata elements. However, there are always cases where publishers using the same system differ widely in the level of metadata they register, suggesting that technology is not the only prohibiting factor and other considerations are at play.",

          "authors": "Amanda Kay Montoya; Gareth Ong Yu; John Tawa",
          "abstract": "Analytical flexibility describes the multiple defensible data analytic options researchers can pursue in a given study. Analytical flexibility can include practices like applying different methods for data cleaning, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests. Analytical flexibility is increasingly important for students to learn about because it impacts low replicability and credibility. Registered reports reduce analytical flexibility by submitting a manuscript to a journal in two stages, where journals provide an in-principle acceptance after Stage 1, committing to publishing the results. We describe and demonstrate an activity for psychology undergraduate courses to explore analytical flexibility within a registered report. Students read a first-stage registered report, received the data, and implemented the analysis plan as described. Analysts generate a product summarizing their results, and compare with the final Stage 2 and other analysts. This activity helps students to achieve multiple important learning outcomes focused on the impact of analytical flexibility on research conclusions, advantages and limitations of open science practice, and implementation of statistical methods in a real data context. This type of project could be an excellent option for a final project in an advanced undergraduate research methods or statistics course.",

          "abstract": "The habit-intention interaction effect tested in behavior prediction studies is a prominent example of statistical moderation analysis in health psychology. Motivated by the mixed empirical findings concerning the effect and long-standing criticisms on estimating and interpreting interaction effects, I used a computational modeling approach to evaluate whether the habit-intention interaction effect estimated from statistical analysis is adequate for inferring the underlying cognitive mechanism assumed by contemporary habit theories. By manipulating the presence or absence of a habit-moderating mechanism in the data-generating model, statistical analyses were performed on the simulated data to examine the correspondence of the estimated interaction effect to the manipulation. Results suggest that while the conventional statistical approach can be indicative of the underlying mechanism, the direction and size of the estimated effect are often misleading in relation to the substantive theory. I identified the cause of the problem from a causal perspective (i.e., intention as a common cause of habit strength and behavior) and discussed potential remedies.",

          "abstract": "Because most validated personality measures were designed to capture relatively general and stable characteristics, they do not specify a particular timeframe for respondents to consider. It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

          "abstract": "Auditory feedback plays a critical role in developing and maintaining fluent speech. Although children are theorized to rely heavily on their auditory feedback, previous experimental studies are inconsistent, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. This study examines the role of individual differences in attention and sensory processing abilities on auditory feedback control of speech in children. To this end, 53 children ages 4-11 completed a frequency altered feedback (FAF) task where the pitch of their auditory feedback was manipulated and responses to the manipulation were measured to provide an index of the child’s reliance on their auditory feedback. To measure attention and sensory processing abilities, children completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), and their parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) parent-report, respectively. Overall SSP scores, and scores in auditory, tactile, and sensory seeking domains were found to be associated with larger compensatory responses to FAF, while poorer SART performance was associated with slower vocal responses to down shifts. These results suggest that for children, greater sensory processing differences may promote increased reliance on auditory feedback for speech motor control, while attentional differences may be more important in the temporal processing of FAF.",

          "abstract": "Psychologists — from computational modellers to social and personality researchers to cognitive neuroscientists and from experimentalists to methodologists to theoreticians — can fall prey to exaggerated claims about artificial intelligence (AI). In social psychology, as in psychology generally, we see arguments taken at face value for: a) the displacement of experimental participants with opaque AI products; the outsourcing of b) programming, c) writing, and even d) scientific theorising to such models; and the notion that e) human-technology interactions could be on the same footing as human-human (e.g., client-therapist, student-teacher, patient-doctor, friendship, or romantic) relationships. But if our colleagues are, accidentally or otherwise, promoting such ideas in exchange for salary, grants, or citations, how are we as academic psychologists meant to react? Formal models, from statistics and computational methods broadly, have a potential obfuscatory power that is weaponisable, laying serious traps for the uncritical adopters, with even the term 'AI' having murky referents. Herein, we concretise the term AI and counter the five related proposals above — from the clearly insidious to those whose ethical neutrality is skin-deep and whose functionality is a mirage. Ultimately, contemporary AI is research misconduct.",

          "abstract": "What political party or what presidential candidate a person supports is often used by adults to divide their social world. However, little is known about whether young children also engage in such tendencies, or whether political groups are even socially meaningful for young children. To trace the beginnings of these tendencies, the current study investigated whether 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children use political markers, such as political party affiliation and support for presidential candidates, to guide their social preferences. We also examined children’s ability to report their political affiliation, whether their political affiliation matched their parents’, how accurate they are at reporting their parents’ political affiliations, and whether having parent-child conversations about politics predicted children’s political affiliation and social preferences. We found that children as young as 6 years of age showed ingroup preferences for individuals who shared their own or their parents' political affiliations – especially based on support for presidential candidates. Notably, even if children could not report their own presidential candidate choice or were inaccurate at predicting their parents' presidential candidate choice, children still preferred people who supported the same presidential candidate as their parents. Further, children who had conversations with their parents about politics were more likely to prefer people who matched their parents’ political affiliations. This study provides the first empirical evidence that 6- to 12-year-old children are using political markers to form ingroup preferences and show rudimentary forms of political partisanship.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "authors": "John Thomas West; Neil Mulligan; Kristen A Lindquist",
          "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability. Theoretical perspectives within cognitive science have guided research on how affective dimensions such as valence and arousal impact aspects of memory such as accuracy, subjective vividness, consolidation, and retrieval. Here we argue that well-established theories of emotion from affective science represent a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion that builds upon existing perspectives in this area while generating several novel hypotheses and avenues of investigation. Following psychological constructionism, we conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The Constructionist Model of Emotional Memory (CMEM) highlights new directions for future emotional memory research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",

It compliments standard group-level change estimates and is central to evaluating clinical significance for interventions. In principle, the RCI provides common criteria for evaluating individual change. However, current practices use sample-specific estimates to create these criteria. Because sample estimates are subject to sampling error, these criteria are also subject to sampling error and therefore differ across studies. We illustrate how current practices can lead to differing criteria for reliable change and use simulations to identify the impact of sampling error on the RCI. Excessive error in the RCI began for the average sample when N &lt; 30, and samples only comfortably avoided the risk of excessive error when N &gt; 100. Finally, small errors in estimating a measure’s reliability sometimes had profound effects on the RCI. Recommendations on use of the RCI are provided.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with schizophrenia have prominent impairments in social cognition that contribute to poor functional outcomes. Gaze processing – the social-cognitive ability to accurately perceive human eye gaze direction – is similarly abnormal in schizophrenia and associated with social functioning. Though gaze processing has known neural underpinnings in cerebral social-processing brain regions, emerging data suggest that the posterior cerebellum plays a key but often neglected role in social-cognitive function. Elucidating the bi-directional cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics underlying social cognition is critical to identifying a novel treatment target.  \n\nMethods: 39 individuals with schizophrenia and 33 non-clinical control (NCC) participants completed an eye-contact detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dynamic causal modeling was used to delineate the dynamics between posterior cerebellum (Crus II) and three cerebral social processing nodes (inferior parietal lobule, anterior insula, and fusiform gyrus) regions and to quantify abnormal effective connectivity in SZ. A confirmatory replication analysis using an independent sample (SZ=27, NCC=22) was conducted to confirm the results. \n\nResults: Model structure comparison revealed overwhelming evidence that cerebellar connections to cerebral social processing nodes are vital to explaining gaze processing in NCC (ln(BF)=98.84) and SZ (ln(BF)=46.85). Relative to NCC, SZ showed less upregulation of cerebellar outputs during gaze processing (t(68)=2.853, p=.006) and this decreased upregulation was associated with social dysfunction (ρ=-.251, p=.034). These results were replicated in the independent sample.\n\nConclusions: Replicated across two independent samples, people with schizophrenia have altered cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics during gaze processing that is linked to social functioning. Given the accessibility of the cerebellum from the scalp for non-invasive brain stimulation relative to many cerebral social-cognitive regions, our findings have critical implications for translational interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conditions associated with perinatal inflammation have been identified as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, data linking early inflammatory biomarkers with later ADHD symptoms remain scarce. The acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key marker of systemic inflammation. To date, no studies have examined the association between CRP levels in cord blood (reflecting neonatal inflammation) and subsequent childhood ADHD symptoms. Here, we aimed to investigate whether elevated cord blood CRP concentrations are associated with child’s ADHD symptoms at age 5. \nMethods: We analyzed data from 1019 and 831 mother–child pairs enrolled in the ELFE and EDEN prospective birth cohorts, respectively. CRP levels in cord blood were measured using an immunoassay. ADHD symptoms were assessed at age 5 using the hyperactivity–inattention subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Outcomes included both continuous scores and categorical thresholds: borderline (≥6) and abnormal (≥7) hyperactivity–inattention symptoms. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were conducted within each cohort to assess associations between elevated CRP levels (≥75th percentile) and ADHD symptoms. Results were then pooled using meta-analytic methods.\nResults: Borderline hyperactivity–inattention scores were observed in 21% of children in the ELFE cohort and 14% in EDEN. After adjusting for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as child characteristics at birth, elevated cord blood CRP was significantly associated with higher odds of ADHD symptoms: borderline scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.86), abnormal scores (aOR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.06–2.08), and increased continuous symptom scores (β = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.04–0.54). \nConclusions: Higher CRP concentrations in cord blood are associated with greater ADHD symptom severity at age 5. These findings support the hypothesis that early-life inflammation may contribute to the developmental origins of ADHD and suggest that CRP could serve as a potential early biomarker of neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",

          "authors": "Giuliana Carrao Macedo; Martin Wiener",
          "abstract": "Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration, with a variety of features, including both high and low level, shaping temporal responses. For example, the size, memorability, or numerosity of stimuli lead to longer perceived intervals, thus highlighting the malleability of time perception. However, little is known about how stimulus shape may influence temporal perception.  This feature is critical, as shape morphometry forms a general basis by which these other features may exert their influence on perceived duration.  To investigate this, we conducted a series of three experiments looking at how specific characteristics of shapes are significant factors in the manipulation of time perception.  We initially observed that greater shape angularity led to more precise time estimates, independent of shape identity.  Next, we found that shapes and symbols with greater edginess, vertical asymmetry, and thickness led to longer perceived durations.  Finally, we discovered that shapes built with higher numbers of geometrical primitives were perceived as longer, more precisely, and responded to more quickly, and were influenced by how subjectively meaningful they were to individual participants.  Our findings suggest that certain aspects of shapes are able to manipulate time perception due to innate geometric qualities within the visual cortex itself.",

          "authors": "Pablo Dapica; Julio Santiago; Pablo Solana",
          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted. All in all, the literature on space-valence body-specificity appears reasonably solid, although there is still room for improvement.",

          "abstract": "Background: Successful peer interactions impact the well-being of autistic and non-autistic youth. Social gaze is important in social interactions as it facilitates detecting information from and signaling information to the social partner. However, while previous work has identified differences between autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze patterns while viewing social videos, no work to-date has directly measured differences in autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze during face-to-face peer interactions.\nMethods: Autistic and non-autistic youth ages 11-15 years completed a face-to-face social interaction with a novel peer while wearing mobile eye-tracking glasses to measure gaze. The interaction consisted of three tasks: a getting-to-know-you conversation, a vacation-planning task, and a video-watching task. Fixations to the face were compared between autistic and non-autistic youth across the three contexts.\nResults: Autistic youth fixated less on their partner’s face than non-autistic youth, and these gaze differences varied across interaction contexts. Gaze differences between autistic and non-autistic youth were most pronounced during the unstructured initial getting-to-know-you conversation and absent during the structured video-watching task.\nConclusions: Context impacts gaze for autistic and non-autistic youth, such that the social attention patterns of autistic youth differ the most from their non-autistic peers during unstructured initial conversations. These gaze differences provide autistic youth with reduced opportunities to sense and signal information about their social environments, emphasizing that supports for peer interactions may be especially crucial when navigating these initial, unstructured meetings. In turn, reduced gaze signaling may also impact peers’ understanding of autistic youth, with implications for the development of autism acceptance programming that incorporates acknowledging and accepting potential gaze differences.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to fitspiration content on social media has been linked to increased body dissatisfaction and negative mood. Although often portrayed as a healthier alternative to thinspiration, fitspiration frequently features slim, toned bodies and may reinforce appearance-related concerns. A recent trend, curvy fitspiration—featuring curvier women promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle—has shown promise in reducing body dissatisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the effect of Fitspiration content on weight concern, feeling fat, body dissatisfaction and negative mood depending on the body shape being observed (thin or curvy). Participants included 71 women who completed, before and after the exposure to images, 4 visuoanalogical scales. The variable feeling of fatness increased after exposure to fitspiration content featuring thin bodies and decreased after exposure to curvyfitspiration. Body dissatisfaction showed a significant time effect, increasing after exposure regardless of the experimental condition. Weight concern didn´t have a significant effect after exposure. Mood was significantly higher in the fitspiration condition with a slim body, regardless of the time of measurement. These results suggest that fitspiration's influence is shaped not only by body type but by its emphasis on appearance and the dynamics of social comparison and digital validation.",

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. This work goes beyond purely legalistic or formalist accounts of rules, showing that people’s intuitions about rule violations are shaped not only by codification but also by descriptive normativity, moral wrongness, and perceived legitimacy of enforcement.",

Traditional cognitive assessments often lack reliability and require lengthy in-person visits, limiting scalability for younger, trial-ready populations.\nObjectives: To evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and validity of high-frequency remote digital cognitive assessments in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD).\nParticipants: 162 mutation carriers and non-carriers from DIAN-TU from 20 international sites (Ages 19-69 years).\nMeasurements: Participants completed remote assessments via personal smartphones, prompted four times daily for seven days (approximately 3 minutes per session), and conventional in-clinic cognitive testing at baseline. Adherence, test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and sensitivity to clinical impairment were evaluated.\nResults: Average adherence was 41%. Despite this, remote measures demonstrated excellent reliability (ICCs &gt; 0.90 after 10 sessions) and strong construct validity, with tasks loading onto memory, attention, and executive function domains. Model fit was poorer in symptomatic individuals (CDR &gt; 0), consistent with cognitive dedifferentiation during disease progression. Both remote and traditional composites were sensitive to clinical impairment, with similar effect sizes and increasing group differences near expected symptom onset.\nConclusions: High-frequency remote cognitive assessment is feasible, reliable, and valid in a relatively young international ADAD cohort. This approach offers substantial advantages for clinical trials, including reduced participant burden, improved accessibility, and enhanced reliability, supporting its integration into early-intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,909) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

          "abstract": "In adverse listening conditions, speech recognition scores are generally higher when listeners can also see the talker’s mouth. Because bilinguals tend to be more detrimentally affected than monolinguals in audio-only noisy conditions, they may stand to benefit more than monolinguals from a second modality. At the same time, the ability to leverage visual cues may be limited by the amount of exposure a listener has to the target language, which varies among bilinguals. In this study, we aimed to understand whether the benefit of audiovisual speech cues is modulated by listeners’ language experiences. To that end, we measured speech recognition accuracy in noise in both audiovisual and audio-only modalities among monolingual and bilingual listeners. We also collected subjective effort and subjective mental fatigue ratings from participants throughout the experiment to evaluate the relationship between audiovisual speech perception and listening effort for different listeners. Our results show that more active use of another language results in less accurate speech recognition in noise for English, but does not modulate the benefit of the audiovisual speech signal.",

This preregistered, seven-day experience-sampling study examined how perceived appropriateness varies across situations. One hundred forty-two adults completed three surveys per day (2,670 surveys total; 3,821 vocalisations), rating appropriateness alongside situational cues and psychological situation characteristics. The results showed that laughter and sighs were most often judged appropriate, whereas screams and retches were least. Appropriateness was higher at home and in social places (e.g., parties) than in work/school or public settings (e.g., library), and higher with close ties than with weak ties or strangers. Psychological characteristics showed that formality and power were associated with lower appropriateness, whereas sociality and positivity were associated with higher appropriateness. Effects were vocalisation-specific: for example, laughter was considered more appropriate in positive, social, and brisk contexts, but less appropriate in formal and high-power contexts. By charting when and where vocalisations are judged acceptable, these findings outline situational principles of vocal display rules in everyday life.",

While extant literature shows that evaluations of someone's moral character can affect subsequent moral judgments, there is contradictory evidence on whether character information affects judgments in a way that is domain-general or domain-specific. Does receiving information about any morally bad character trait increase blame, or only information about traits that are similar to the subsequent act?  In two experiments (preregistered; N = 1320), we investigated how incidental information about an agent's moral character can influence moral and causal judgments. We consistently found that participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more of a cause, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect of character was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Overall, our findings support an account of moral judgment in which character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments of a subsequent act, challenging the domain-specific view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act should influence blame.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) often includes heterogenous items, as when one uses it while assembling a desk from sets of boards, knobs, bolts, and washers. Here we investigate how WM capacity is limited when recalling multiple sets of items, for which performance surpasses the usual limits observed in single-set procedures. We presented participants (N = 181) with up to four sets of items for serial recall, usually of different stimulus types in the same trial (colors, characters, locations, and/or shapes). Conditions differed in the total number of items, the number of sets, and/or item types across sets in a trial. For uniformity in analyses, Set 1 was kept constant at three items of a type and was usually recalled first, free of output interference. In Experiment 1, recall of Set 1 was not only limited by the total number of items, but also by the number of sets in a trial. Experiment 2 ruled out interference as an alternative explanation. Experiments 3-4 showed the dependency of the results on clearly grouped presentation of the sets. The results suggest that groups of items are associated as newly-formed, often incomplete chunks offloaded from the focus of attention (FoA) to an activated portion of long-term memory (aLTM) for later retrieval. This offloading process would spare capacity but not without cost; a fraction of an item was lost from Set 1 for each subsequent item recalled. We present a dual-stage theory in which pointers held in the capacity-limited FoA allow retrieval of chunks from aLTM.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Lotfi; Reza Ebrahimpour; Sajjad Zabbah",
          "abstract": "Perceptual decisions often rely on integrating multiple discrete pieces of sensory evidence over time. Previous studies have shown that these integration strategies are dynamic and can give rise to temporal biases such as the recency effect, where more recent information receives greater weight in the decision process. While some have attributed the recency effect to memory leak, recent findings suggest it may instead reflect a strategic modulation of attention. In this study, we investigated whether attention increases uniformly over time or selectively in response to the amount of accumulated evidence. Using a direction discrimination task with single-, double-, and triple-pulse random dot motion stimuli, we tested competing models of evidence integration and attentional allocation. Consistent with prior work, we observed marginally better performance in weak-strong double-pulse trials compared to strong-weak ones. Notably, in triple-pulse trials, improved performance was evident only when considering the first and third pulses, but not the first two or last two, arguing against a uniform time-based increase in attention. Crucially, when the first two pulses were treated as a unit, a weak-strong pattern relative to the third pulse produced significantly higher accuracy. These findings support a model in which attention increases not over time, but over evidence: reduced early evidence leads to increased attentional allocation to later samples. Our results provide further insight into the adaptive nature of perceptual decision-making and the role of online attentional strategies in optimizing performance in environments with discrete, time-separated sensory events.",

Cognitive control frameworks distinguish different subcomponents, such as inhibition, updating, shifting, proactive and reactive control. A comprehensive overview of how these subcomponents develop in aging is lacking, with research typically focusing on small samples treated as a homogenous age group, targeting a single subcomponent, or using heterogenous tasks across studies. In the current study, young adults (N=75) and three cohorts of older adults (N=231) completed an extensive test battery assessing multiple subcomponents of cognitive control. Results showed improved response inhibition and interference control in older vs. young adults, decreased updating and shifting with age, and preserved proactive control in older adults. These findings show that changes in cognitive control subcomponents follow different onsets and trajectories, highlighting the importance of including them in cognitive aging research. Longitudinal follow-up studies can help uncover inter- and intra-individual changes in subcomponents with aging.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever to produce hyperrealistic but entirely false imagery. One especially harmful use is the creation of non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes depicting real people. While such content clearly violates privacy, its broader political implications remain underexplored. This paper investigates how sexually explicit AI-generated imagery affects\npublic perceptions of politicians and broader democratic outcomes. Drawing on a pre-registered survey experiment in the U.S. (N = 1904), we exposed participants to either explicit, private, or control images of a fictitious male or female politician embedded in a mock social media feed. The results indicate that explicit deepfakes significantly diminish candidate evaluations, particularly with respect to affect, trustworthiness, perceived competence, and leadership qualities. Exposure to AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) further leads to lower voting intentions for the targeted politician, illustrating how reputational harm can translate into electoral consequences. Contrary to expectations, male politicians were more strongly affected by these negative shifts in perception. However, we find no evidence that exposure to such content reduces participants’ own political ambition. These findings highlight the reputational risks posed by synthetic intimate media and highlight the urgent need to mitigate its potential threats to democratic processes.",

          "authors": "Anthony Montgomery",
          "abstract": "Organizational psychology has traditionally focused on internal dynamics, neglecting the broader social structures in which organizations are embedded. This limitation is particularly evident in research on job burnout. While burnout is often framed as a symptom of organizational dysfunction, it also reflects wider systemic forces—economic instability, political regulation, cultural expectations, and ecological stressors—that influence how individuals navigate the competing demands of performance and wellbeing. Current models underestimate these contextual and historical influences due to their peripheral position in organizational analysis. This paper introduces a new open systems theory of burnout that delineates how sublethal forces interact with organizational processes to deplete employee energy and increase burnout. It proposes nine core propositions through which external environmental factors shape burnout experiences and argues for a paradigm shift toward systemic, context-aware models. The paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework and challenges for future research.",

          "abstract": "Homophone errors (e.g., there/their) are not uncommon in typing, but it is debated whether they simply reveal poor spelling knowledge or signal competition in the production system. We tested the idea that competition underlies the greater difficulty associated with producing homophone, compared to non-homophone, targets. Using computational simulations, we showed that competition alone is sufficient to produce interference during homophone production, and that such interference is exacerbated by increasing lexical competition. These predictions were confirmed in two experiments, a typing-to-dictation task (Experiment 1) and a question-answering task (Experiment 2). We further showed the homophone effect was insensitive to the syntactic category: we found a robust homophone interference effect of a comparable magnitude for same-category (e.g., flower-flour) and different-category (e.g., idol-idle) homophones. Collectively, these results show that lexical selection in typing is similar to speaking in terms of the processes arising from representational overlap, but distinct from it in terms of the influence of syntax.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Trust in science plays a crucial role in addressing major societal challenges, from climate change to global health. In a wide range of countries, most people tend to trust science. However this trust might seem irrational, since people tend to know little about science. Here, we argue that people need not possess much knowledge or understanding of science to rationally trust it. We propose a cognitive model of trust in science—the rational impression account—according to which people come to trust science by relying on a suite of basic cognitive mechanisms: First, people infer competence from possessing rare knowledge; Second, people infer accuracy from consensus; Third, people’s impressions can persist after they forget what generated them. The rational impression account stresses the importance of science education and communication in fostering public trust in science.",

However, how the magnitude of this Cognate Facilitation Effect (CFE) changes with age and its task-dependent manifestations remain unclear. Clarifying these patterns may benefit educators with evidence-based strategies to support learners across different stages and tasks. This systematic review synthesizes studies on CFE in school-aged second and foreign language learners between 1987 and 2024 (n = 36). The results showed that, firstly, the CFE follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory. It increases during early literacy (ages 6–9), peaking in middle childhood (ages 9–10), and declining thereafter. Secondly, facilitation is robust in comprehension tasks but more variable in production, where overlap can induce interference. Furthermore, we evaluate psycholinguistic models and propose integrating speech-production models to account for the interference effect of cognate production. These findings suggest educational implications: cognates can help support vocabulary development in early literacy, but more refined strategies are needed as learners advance.\n\nKeywords: cognates; cross-linguistic transfer; literacy development; psycholinguistics",

          "abstract": "Background: Practitioner ratings of their adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy or counseling practices in working with autistic youth could be an efficient method for tracking the success of efforts to implement effective practices in community behavioral health service settings. Tools of this sort that generalize across multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been developed to date. In this study, a practitioner self-report measure of adherence to EBPs for autistic youth was developed and evaluated. Method: A multiple baseline study of seven behavioral health practitioners was conducted to determine if internet-based self-directed training on Modular EBPs for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA; meya.ucla.edu), a free internet-based practitioner training app, would facilitate an increase in clinician adherence to EBP techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral intervention practices. Practitioners made self-ratings on the MEYA Integrity Scale-Practitioner Version (MEYA-IS-PV). Expert coders unaware of phase or study hypotheses also rated the therapists’ adherence to EBPs for each session. Caregivers rated youth outcomes at each session on the Youth Top Problems scale. Results: Linear mixed models showed that MEYA-IS-PV scores corresponded to expert ratings of adherence, increased following the onset of training in EBPs, and predicted improvements in youth behavioral health. Visual analysis of the multiple baseline data confirmed that 5 of 7 practitioners increased their self-reported adherence in EBPs once training began. Conclusion: Self-ratings of adherence are promising for examining adherence to EBPs in psychotherapy or counseling for autistic youth.",

          "authors": "Olivia Fischer; Renato Frey",
          "abstract": "Polarization has become a major concern in behavioral science and popular media, as it may affect many important areas of life. For instance, how polarized are people's perceptions of risks, such as regarding (not) imposing mitigation measures during a pandemic? Answering this question is surprisingly challenging: Whereas multiple theoretical views of polarization and their respective mathematical operationalizations coexist, the latter are often used interchangebly as measures of \"polarization\". This may be indicative of a jingle fallacy, because it is unknown whether the diverse ways of quantifying polarization in people's perceptions of important societal matters empirically converge. In study 1 we thus ran a reanalysis of a large dataset from the World Values Survey covering diverse topics of societal relevance (N = 93,214), finding only moderate empirical convergence between six operationalizations of polarization. In study 2 we applied the same approach focusing specifically on people's risk perceptions of COVID-19 mitigation measures (N = 768), and found a similar pattern of low convergence between different operationalizations of polarization. Yet, according to one operationalization with a clear threshold for polarization, risk perceptions were polarized in 11 out of 12 experimental conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to carefully consider how polarization is operationalized to avoid broad generalizations, keeping in mind that some operationalizations may speak to specific theoretical conceptualizations. To raise awareness for this concern and support behavioral science researchers in conducting similar analyses with their own datasets, we provide a novel online tool available at https://shiny.cbdr-lab.net/polarization.",

While we were interested in re-formulating from a humanistic psychological perspective, after Rogers’ original conditions of worth concept (1957, 1959), the behavioral formulation of conditional regard, we also tested and provided evidence for the hypothesis that autistic people experience heightened conditions of worth relative to non-autistic people. We validated through a brief online survey (n = 162, including 109 autistic and 53 non-autistic individuals) two distinct sets of items, one retrospective for the adolescent period between ages 12 and 17 and the other for adulthood, to assess the extent to which individuals perceive conditions of worth. The items were then correlated with an array of individual difference variables. Perceived emotional safety recalled as an adolescent and felt as an adult, perceived psychological control of one’s parental figure when an adolescent, adult fear of criticism and rejection, adult masking or camouflaging of parts of oneself, adult incongruence or inauthenticity, adult acceptance of external influence, and adult self-alienation were all positively correlated in support of the measures’ convergent and predictive validity. Adult self-esteem, unconditional positive self-regard, adolescence-perceived parental autonomy support, authentic adult living, and congruence or authenticity were all, with some exceptions, negatively correlated in theoretically expected directions. Perfectionism was also variously correlated. Implications and applications are offered for academics as well as mental health practitioners.",

We found a wisdom of the crowd within effect in both experiments, which was significant after two responses, and larger with three. Surprisingly, the delay did not offer additional benefit.

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

It challenges rational choice theories by showing that preference can change by having an irrelevant option in the choice set. The attraction effect is typically studied in situations where individuals have full access to option information during choice. However, in many real-life situations, people must make choices based on their memory of the options. In three experiments (N = 379), we investigated the attraction effect when people had to rely on their memory when making choices. We show initially that relying on memory eliminated the attraction effect, but also that the attraction effect was recovered with improvements in memory. The results suggest that memory accuracy may be a boundary condition of the attraction effect. We also observed improvements in decoy avoidance and choice accuracy with improvements in memory. Our results are consistent with the representational noise hypothesis (Spektor et al., 2021) where noise (e.g., due to forgetting) disrupts how people represent the relationships among options.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

The findings revealed that participants in the game condition reported higher enjoyment and greater triggered situational interest, indicating that the game enhances the positive affective experience of engaging with historical content and sparks learners’ interest. However, our hypothesis that knowledge test performance would be higher in the game condition was not supported. Instead, knowledge test scores were higher in the text condition. No statistically significant effects emerged for instructional framing or for the interaction between format and framing on the outcomes. Additional analyses of behavioural data showed that text participants engaged more extensively with codex entries, and that codex engagement strongly predicted knowledge outcomes across both formats. This suggests that knowledge outcomes depend on the visibility and integration of supplemental materials, and learners’ engagement with them. Overall, this study contributes to research on digital history learning by offering a controlled comparison of identical content delivered through game and text and shedding light on the role of instructional framing.",

          "abstract": "Revising explanations allows learners to develop a coherent understanding of scientific phenomena by integrating different ideas, a key learning outcome according to the Knowledge Integration (KI) Framework. We explored the design of critique activities and analyzed how peer critique helps 1305 middle school students to revise science explanations. Students wrote a science explanation about thermodynamics in an online learning environment, critiqued the explanation of a fictitious peer and then, revised their own explanation. For the critique activity, they were randomly assigned to three conditions that differed in the characteristics of the fictitious peer’s explanation. Specifically, students either critiqued a peer’s explanation that describes intuitive ideas (intuitive), combines intuitive and scientifically normative ideas (partial), or connects several scientifically normative ideas (linked). We found that critique was valuable in each condition as students showed more integrated understanding in their revised responses to the explanation question compared to their initial response. Students in the linked condition received the highest KI scores. Students who started with a higher KI score had an advantage over those with a lower KI score in all conditions. This difference was strongest in the intuitive condition, indicating that the intuitive condition was the least beneficial for students with lower prior knowledge. Qualitative analysis of the types of revisions students made revealed that, in all conditions, students often adopted ideas from the answer they critiqued. When they adopted the intuitive idea, they were less likely to improve their explanation than when they adopted the link. These results illustrate the importance of critique for promoting integrated understanding. They reveal the need for more frequent and more powerful instruction to build skepticism when confronted with potentially unreliable information, e.g. by comparing two explanations with contrasting ideas.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

Study 1 (N=500) shows that greater use of problem decomposition in group discussions predicts lower error. Study 2 (N=240) provides causal evidence: instructing groups to apply problem decomposition leads to higher accuracy than combining initial estimates.

Recent work using \nthe Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task underscores the critical role of categorization consistency \n(trial-by-trial response variability around the mean response function) as a critical predictor of \nreal-world outcomes such as language and reading abilities. Yet, the mechanisms that \ncontribute to categorization consistency remain unknown. One hypothesis is that higher-level \nlinguistic factors, such as lexical knowledge, may stabilize the percept by cleaning up lower-\nlevel perceptual noise. The first aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining \nwhether categorization consistency is modulated by lexicality (word vs. nonword). Forty-eight \nadult American English listeners completed a VAS task involving both word (e.g., batch-patch) \nand matched nonword (e.g., bazg-pazg) continua. Listeners’ categorization consistency for the \nword continua was significantly higher than for the nonword continua. This suggests that \ncategorization consistency is, indeed, affected by higher-level linguistic factors. The second aim \nwas to investigate whether individuals’ broader language abilities influence their reliance on \nlexical information during speech categorization. Although individuals with greater language \nability showed more consistent categorization, language scores did not modulate the lexical \neffect on categorization consistency.

At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between heritable and acquired traits. In a large-scale study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge.

We conducted an 8-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) experiment (n=20) and a 4-hour partial sleep deprivation (PSD) experiment (n=44) to examine their effects on ideological extremism and affective polarization. Results revealed a significant increase in ideological extremism following TSD in between-subjects analysis (Cohen's f² = 0.48), while no significant effects were observed with the PSD protocol compared to the regular sleep (RS) condition. Importantly, moderation analyses revealed that political orientation significantly influenced susceptibility to sleep deprivation effects, with different patterns emerging in between-subjects versus within-subjects analyses. Left-wing participants showed greater vulnerability to increased ideological extremism under sleep deprivation in between-subjects comparisons, while this effect was found for right-leaning individuals in within-subjects analyses. No significant effects were observed on affective polarization in either protocol. These findings provide initial evidence that sleep deprivation can contribute to political polarization by increasing ideological extremism, particularly when considering political orientation as a moderating factor. The study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between sleep and political cognition in distinct sociopolitical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Supporting wellbeing within education settings is vital. Whole school approaches present a holistic and integrated mechanism that recognise school staff, the school community and pupils. The Well Schools whole school approach to supporting teacher and pupil wellbeing provides a framework that guides planning, policy and practice while allowing for bespoke and socially valid approaches suitable for each school community. \nMethod. A case study approach explored how schools adopted the Well Schools framework, and what practices and provision schools were offering as part of Well Schools. Second, it aimed to identify the perceived impact of embedding the Well Schools approach for schools, teachers and pupils. 10 case study schools were recruited that were implementing Well Schools and that represented diversity in setting type, varying locations across the UK and school demographics. Data was collected via interviews (n = 16) with school leaders and class teachers that focused on their experiences and engagement with the whole school approach with particular attention to the process of implementation. \nFindings. Six themes were identified covering how Well Schools was being implemented, what drove this and the impact it was having: 1) staff enrichment, 2) pupil enrichment, 3) motivation, 4) capability, 5) awareness and engagement, and 6) sustainability. Findings suggest the value of supporting staff and pupil wellbeing were central to an effective learning environment that supported wellbeing. Well Schools offered the opportunity for schools to build relationships, collaborate and learn from a network of schools. This network and the engagement with like-minded schools was identified as a reason why some schools were attracted to the whole school approach.\nConclusion. Promoting Well Schools can help other schools adopt better practices for health, wellbeing and identify ways of developing holistic wellbeing at the school, teacher and pupil levels. Such continued engagement further exemplifies the feasibility, acceptability and positive impact the case study schools reported regarding Well Schools.",

          "authors": "Samuel Poelker-Wells; Danielle Fearon-Drake; Francesca Filbey",
          "abstract": "Background: The primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system (eCB), which declines with age, potentially reducing its ability to regulate homeostasis and altering responses to cannabis. Indeed, animal studies suggest age-related differences in response to cannabis that result in mixed effects in older individuals. Importantly, biological sex modifies the eCB system, which complicates interpreting these effects. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand how individual variation in human endocannabinoid system function due to age and sex influences cannabis’s effects in middle-aged and older adults. Methods:  Self-reported measures of cannabis use behaviors, memory, mental and physical health, cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptom severity, and sleep quality were collected from 107 adults (age range= 35-78, 54 females) who use cannabis. Partial correlations examined associations between age and outcomes controlling for years of use. Biological sex was assessed as a moderator. Results: Regression analyses revealed a significant age × sex interaction for CUD symptoms and mental health scores. Specifically, CUD symptom severity decreased, and mental health scores improved with age in females but not in males. Sensitivity analysis suggested that participants who reported medical-only use exhibited a steeper decline in CUD symptom severity with age than recreational-only or hybrid-use participants. Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on cannabis use in aging populations and underscores the need to consider age, sex, and reason for use when evaluating cannabis-related outcomes such as CUD risk in the emerging demographic of middle-aged and older adults who use cannabis.",

          "abstract": "Speeding can be conceptualised as a social dilemma that requires attention to engineering factors such as traffic and roadway conditions as well as psychological traits and individual attributes. These traits and attributes shape whether regulatory and physical signals are internalised as binding constraints, yet most existing studies overlook them. In particular, drivers’ Social Value Orientation (SVO) can substantially influence speeding and moderate the effects of other factors. To address this gap, we examined stated preferences to exceed speed limits, and their determinants including SVO, across urban scenarios in the West Midlands (WM), Athens, and Valencia. We used an ordered discrete choice model with random parameters and heterogeneity in means to capture unobserved and latent psychological heterogeneity. Results indicated that road design, traffic density, and speed enforcement were associated with self-reported speeding, with effects varying by context and driver traits. Higher SVO was linked to greater compliance in the WM, mixed effects in Valencia, and norm-congruent behaviour in Athens that could legitimise moderate speeding. Older drivers in Athens reported greater responsiveness to cameras. Age moderated self-reports: in WM and Athens, the stated likelihood of speeding linked to drivers’ violation history declined with age; the gender gap widened with age in WM but narrowed in Athens. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the effects of engineering and enforcement are not uniform across all drivers. Their impact is mediated by local norms, perceived credibility, and socially embedded understandings of considerate driving, underscoring the need to integrate social and psychological dimensions into traffic safety interventions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia, the strong diminution or complete absence of mental imagery, challenges long-standing views of imagery as central to cognition. Competing accounts variously explain the phenomenon as a failure of sensory reactivation or as unconscious mental imagery. Here, we propose a new framework, the integration model of aphantasia, which argues that reactivated sensory information must undergo multi-stage integration to yield imagery experience. Against unconscious imagery accounts, we argue that the neural activations observed in aphantasics are not imagery but sensory precursors: rudimentary sensory codes that lack perceptual status. Only when sensory precursors are locally integrated do they become perceptual representations, and only when these are further integrated with interoceptive signals do they give rise to conscious imagery experience. We present the integration model as a dual-stream framework that unifies recent attention- and interoception-based accounts, situate the model within existing theories of mental imagery and aphantasia, and highlight its clinical relevance. In doing so, we reframe the debate on unconscious imagery and draw attention to the role of multi-stage integration as a key mechanism underlying mental imagery and its absence across different subtypes of aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Despite the theoretical arguments and recent empirical evidence indicating retest correlations to be particularly suitable reliability estimates, usual retest intervals (e.g., two weeks; one month) will underestimate the reliability of measures over the within-session interval in which inter-test relationships are regularly estimated.  Consequently, we argue that within-session retest correlations may be particularly useful for estimating the reliability of measures over this interval. Specifically, we show evidence that within-session retest correlations: (1) provide the common upper-limit of internal consistency and retest reliability estimates, and consequently (2) are considerably less susceptible to producing disattenuated correlations greater than 1 in magnitude; (3) better track variation in scale validity correlations than common reliability estimators such as coefficient alpha; and (4) can be estimated for single-item measures. We illustrate this using data collected from several samples on two personality inventories, the Inventory of Individual Differences in the Lexicon (IIDL; Wood, Nye, &amp; Saucier, 2010) and Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2017).  Results suggest that reliability is typically underestimated and thus overadjusted for in meta-analytic and structural equation modeling contexts, and that greater use of these estimates is thus likely to slow the momentum toward broader constructs and provide sturdier psychometric ground for the measurement of narrower constructs or nuances. More generally, we detail how within-session retest correlations draw better attention to the crucial role of the time interval separating measurements toward determining the appropriate estimates to use when adjusting for the measurement unreliability affecting zero-order correlations.",

          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "authors": "Cope Feurer; John E. McGeary; Chelsie Benca-Bachman; Brandon Gibb",
          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed for the creation of polygenic scores (PGSs) reflecting genetic liability for depression, yet recent work suggests that these PGSs may also reflect greater genetic propensity towards higher levels of stress exposure. The current study sought to extend prior findings to examine whether an established depression PGS (DEP-PGS) is associated with greater stress exposure at the neighborhood level in a sample of preadolescent children. This study included 278 children of European ancestry between the ages of 7 and 11 (45.3% female) and their parent. Parents and children completed clinical interviews and questionnaires and children provided genetic samples. Children’s neighborhoods were defined based on their current home address and geocoded indices of neighborhood adversity (i.e., area socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, opportunity) were matched to zip codes. As hypothesized, children with greater genetic liability for depression as reflected by DEP-PGSs were more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by greater adversity. Findings were maintained when statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and parent’s and children’s histories of depression and anxiety. The current findings build upon prior research highlighting depression-relevant gene-environment correlations and extend this work to provide evidence that DEP-PGSs may capture genetic liability for exposure to stressful contexts at the neighborhood level. Future research is needed to replicate findings in diverse samples and to examine whether neighborhood-level adversity mediates the relation between DEP-PGSs and future depression risk in youth.",

Ancorado nessa visão dinâmico-complexa, em diálogo com o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala (Flege, 1995; Flege; Bohn, 2021), este estudo objetiva investigar o desenvolvimento, entre aprendizes brasileiros de inglês, do padrão de pre-fortis clipping de vogais diante de plosivas finais. Três participantes foram acompanhados longitudinalmente em 12 coletas ao longo de 13 semanas. Entre a primeira e a segunda coleta, receberam insumos distintos: nenhum tipo de intervenção pedagógica referente à pronúncia (Participante 1), treinamento perceptual (Participante 2), e treinamento perceptual associado à instrução explícita de pronúncia (Participante 3). As produções da forma-alvo foram analisadas acusticamente e submetidas a Análises de Picos com simulações de Monte Carlo e a Análises de Pontos de Mudança. Os resultados apontam padrões individuais de variabilidade e mudança possivelmente ligados aos tratamentos pedagógicos. Os achados reforçam a pertinência de estudos de processo para o desenvolvimento fonético-fonológico em LNN e a compatibilidade entre a TSDC e o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala, além de evidenciar ganhos do uso complementar dos dois métodos de análise",

          "abstract": "Successful learning often emerges through social interaction: what are the neural and behavioural systems that support this process? This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with detailed behavioural and physiological measures in 27 unconstrained social learning interactions. Learning was supported by teacher-learner inter-brain synchrony (INS), over regions important for mutual understanding (temporo-parietal junction, TPJ) and communicative coordination (ventral premotor, PMv). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the INS-learning association in oppositive ways, motivating a dual-process model: during knowledge-building phases, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low INS in regions for mutual understanding (TPJ) and coordination (right PMv), and high INS in language-related areas (left PMv). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high INS over TPJ. Cross-brain general linear modelling (xGLM) revealed asymmetric neural dependencies linked to speaking and teaching roles in the left-hemisphere language network. These effects remained after controlling for nodding, gaze, and breathing, indicating that INS reflects true social-cognitive alignment beyond sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated and nonlinear brain–body dynamics and positions INS as a marker of mutual prediction during communicative social interaction.",

          "abstract": "Attention control predicts academic achievement, professional success, and health outcomes. However, the neural basis of stable, trait-level differences in attention control remains unclear. Prior research has emphasized momentary fluctuations in attentional engagement, often overlooking enduring individual differences. Here, we applied the quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis of infraslow fMRI dynamics in a large sample (N = 191) to test whether trait attention control is reflected in network-level brain activity as well as the locus coeruleus. Using latent-variable measures of attention control, working memory capacity, and fluid intelligence, we isolated the unique contribution of attention control across rest, 1-back, and 3-back conditions. Under heightened cognitive demand, individuals with higher attention control exhibited more flexible coordination of the frontoparietal control network (FPCN): they showed stronger decoupling from the default mode network (DMN), enhanced coupling with the dorsal attention network (DAN), and greater engagement with the locus coeruleus (LC). Even at rest, high attention individuals demonstrated stronger FPCN-DAN coupling, and little to no correlation between FPCN-DMN, indicating that attentional capacity is reflected in both task-evoked reconfiguration and baseline network architecture. These findings reveal how attention control, as a trait, is instantiated in the brain’s dynamic architecture.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety and math achievement are reciprocally related, which likely impacts individuals’ agency; their educational and career trajectories in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; and countries’ economic growth in these areas. Previous meta-analyses on this relationship have faced limitations from studies using small convenience samples and have encountered methodological issues, such as variance restriction, low statistical power, and ecological bias. To address these challenges, the present research synthesis is the first to use a comprehensive collection of representative individual participant data (IPD) from International Large-Scale Assessments (ILSAs). This analysis incorporated cumulative evidence from 1980 to 2022, including 452 probability samples from 90 countries, and covered student and adult populations. The meta-analytic average correlation between math anxiety and math achievement was r = –.26. Moderator analyses revealed novel evidence that this relationship is sensitive to construct characteristics as well as individual and contextual factors. Specifically, the negative relationship was weaker for the worry facet of math anxiety compared with its affective facet and its cognitive interference facet, and it was weaker following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the negative relationship was stronger for individuals with average and high levels of math achievement and in countries with higher Gross Domestic Product per capita. Gender differences in the relationship were largely negligible after 2010, although female individuals exhibited a stronger negative relationship in the 1980s and 1990s than male individuals. In summary, synthesizing IPD from ILSAs provided novel, nuanced, and robust evidence for research, practice, and policy.",

          "authors": "Tatsuya Daikoku",
          "abstract": "Creativity in human societies is sustained not by isolated minds but by embodied, collective intelligence. Using music as a model system, we show that creativity rests on the dynamic tuning of uncertainty: moderate, time-varying surprise—often felt as internal bodily sensations—sparks exploration, while group synchrony stabilizes what is new. Because creativity itself is value-neutral, its fate depends on the co-occurrence of ethics, morality, and empathy. Ethical norms bound admissible deviation, and empathic perspective-taking—amplified by bodily and physiological coupling—acts as a social “precision weight” that admits, reshapes, or rejects novelty. From these ingredients emerges field-level intelligence: a process in which groups preserve diversity, selectively integrate deviations, and maintain “just-right” uncertainty under partially connected social structures. This framing explains the resilience of creativity across generations and sets an agenda for empirical work: quantify uncertainty dynamics in embodied interaction, test how ethical and empathic cues regulate admissibility, and identify network conditions that best sustain socially shared creativity. This framing clarifies why creativity endures and suggests a concrete empirical agenda.",

In particular, we show that group judgments are more accurate than the average of a comparable number of individual judgments, and that group judgments can be as accurate as the judgments of the best individual member of the nominal groups (i.e., the person with the lowest judgment error). Additionally, our meta-analytic results substantiate two different mechanisms that lead to synergy in quantitative group judgment. On the one hand, group members can learn from each other and, thereby, increase their individual accuracy (G-I transfer). On the other hand, when controlling for G-I transfer, group members are also able to identify the more accurate judgments and assign more weight to them (differential weighting).",

          "abstract": "Importance: Versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire such as PHQ-2, PHQ-8, and PHQ-9 are among the leading assessment tools for depression in research and clinical practice. However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

Indeed, some even see 'sparks of artificial general intelligence' in their apparently boundless faculty for conversation and reasoning, Their sophisticated emergent faculties, which were not initially anticipated by their designers, has ignited an urgent debate about whether and under which circumstances we should attribute consciousness to artificial entities in general and  LLMs in particular. The current consensus, rooted in computational functionalism, proposes that consciousness should be ascribed based on a principle of computational equivalence. The objective of this opinion piece is to criticize this current approach and argue in favor of an alternative “behavioral inference principle”, whereby consciousness is attributed if it is useful to explain (and predict) a given set of behavioral observations.  We believe that a behavioral inference principle will provide an epistemologically valid and operationalizable criteria to assess machine consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Social norms influence a wide spectrum of behaviors, yet their role in motivating political action remains underexplored. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes three norm types: (1) social approval of activists’ goals, (2) social approval of their actions, and (3) social engagement in those actions. We test how these norms and their consistent or inconsistent combinations shape willingness to participate in political action and perceptions of the cause’s importance and feasibility. Six preregistered experiments examined these effects in both hypothetical and real-world contexts, in Poland and the U.S., using between-person and within-person designs. Study 1 showed that information about one norm type spilled over to inferences about the others, underscoring the need to examine norms in combination. Across Studies 2–6, consistently high levels across all three norm types in most cases produced the strongest action intentions, while consistently low levels produced the weakest. Inconsistent combinations yielded more nuanced effects, with reduced approval of goals especially likely to undermine action intentions, and withdrawal of action approval playing a comparatively weaker role. Manipulations of social norms also influenced perceived importance and expectancy of the cause, which mediated their effects on collective action intentions. Taken together, these findings integrate normative and motivational theories and offer practical suggestions for implementing norm-based interventions in social campaigns.",

This study tested a model of how perfectionism, via its effect on self-compassion, stress and coping, can affect health outcomes such as health-related quality of life and intuitive eating for people with long-term conditions, which had not been previously tested in a sample of people with CKD. To address this gap, structural equation modelling was used to model the association between these constructs in a sample of kidney transplant recipients (n=354) and a non-CKD comparison group (n=400). Results showed that ‘maladaptive’ perfectionism significantly predicted lower levels of self-compassion, coping, intuitive eating and health-related quality of life, and higher levels of stress. However, self-compassion was found to buffer this effect, demonstrating that higher levels of this positive self-attitude could help to ameliorate the negative associations between maladaptive perfectionism and health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases play a critical role in the maintenance of specific phobias, yet reliable assessment tools remain scarce. This study examined the psychometric properties of three novel measures designed to evaluate interpretational processing biases in acrophobia: the Scrambled Sentences Task (SST), the Encoding Recognition Test (ERT), and the German version of the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). Using an online cross-sectional design, the convergent and divergent validity as well as the reliability of these tasks were assessed. The sample included N = 286 participants with mild to severe acrophobia. Overall, all measures demonstrated good convergent validity, and their weak associations with non-acrophobia-related questionnaires support divergent validity. The measures also showed high internal consistency and moderate to high parallel forms of reliability, indicating strong reliability overall. Consistent intercorrelations among the tasks further support their coherence in assessing interpretation bias. Finally, regression analyses revealed that the SST and HIQ were the strongest predictors of acrophobic symptoms, suggesting that each task may tap into distinct facets of interpretation bias despite their overlap. These findings offer empirically grounded insights that can inform future research, especially within intervention contexts. For example, embedding these bias measures in randomized controlled trials could illuminate their role in identifying and precisely tracking cognitive markers during therapy, enabling more targeted interventions in acrophobia treatment.",

Across countries, positive beliefs (e.g., competence, autonomy, trust) were associated with higher SES, whereas negative beliefs (e.g., insecurity, unworthiness, pessimism) were linked to lower SES. These associations replicated across SES indicators (education, income, wealth) and explained up to 20% of variance in SES outcomes.

          "abstract": "Human behaviour is largely driven by the desire to maximize pleasure. Music, in both perception and production, is a uniquely powerful source of pleasure, engaging cognitive, bodily, psychological, and social processes. This paper focuses on groove, an everyday, effortless form of sensorimotor musical experience. While previous studies have solely  examined groove as pleasurable urge to move, this paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding groove as a multidimensional source of musical pleasure. Extending beyond prior two-dimensional accounts, the framework incorporates immersive and social aspects of the experience. Gathering research findings across disciplines, four sources of pleasure are identified, operating at the cognitive, psychological, behavioural, and social levels: (1) pleasure arising from processing of the music, especially linked to the balance of prediction and surprise in musical structure; (2) immersive pleasure associated with a flow-like, altered attentional experience; (3) movement pleasure generated through (desire for) bodily synchronization and sensorimotor reward; and (4) pleasure rooted in social connection, synchrony, bonding, and collective participation. These interconnected levels are supported by neurochemical mechanisms that modulate attention, arousal, timing, and reward, anchoring the pleasures of groove in embodied brain–body dynamics and reflecting its biopsychosocial nature. This framework offers a more nuanced account of why groove is such a powerful, rewarding and everyday human experience. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the current work informs applied domains by highlighting various sources of pleasure that provide internal motivation, offering insights for designing music-based interventions in therapy, education, and well-being, and suggesting directions for future empirical testing.",

Study 1, a pre-registered study on intergroup relations in the turbulent Bangsamoro region of the Philippines (N = 816), found that identity fusion was positively associated with outgroup trust when the outgroup was perceived positively. Study 2 (N = 1,576) replicated these results across Gambia (n = 236), Pakistan (n = 505), Tanzania (n = 337), and Uganda (n = 498) , while also finding that perceptions of the relationship itself (e.g., whether cooperation was judged beneficial to the ingroup) similarly moderated the effect of identity fusion on willingness to cooperate. These results suggest that identity fusion can have positive consequences for intergroup relations, depending on contextual perceptions.",

Current theoretical accounts invoke specific structures of preference or cost to elucidate the occurrence of procrastination. We propose a theoretical model of procrastination that does not invoke a specific structure of preference, and instead relies on an unavoidable aspect of any projection into the future, namely, that the time it takes to complete a task is variable. This model captures the basic phenomenology of procrastination and predicts a phenomenon that we demonstrate empirically, the \"deadline-time-arrival effect\": decision makers (DMs) who live closer to their destinations (e.g., schools or offices) tend to arrive later than those who live farther. The same theory explains other instantiations of procrastination, such as repeatedly postponing the initiation of a task as the deadline for completion approaches—e.g., delaying the planned drafting of a grant application.

          "authors": "Benjamin PUTOIS; Florian Lecuelle",
          "abstract": "Behavioral insomnia of the limit-setting type is very common. It is characterized by delayed sleep onset due to oppositional behavior at bedtime and the child's dependence on parental presence to fall asleep. This condition reduces the child's total sleep time, increases daytime irritability, and lowers frustration tolerance. It also leads to parental exhaustion, as parents are deprived of their evening time and are frequently required to wake during the night. This article presents a standardized clinical protocol for children over 3 years of age, incorporating a token economy system, reinforcement strategies, and the use of a symbolic mediator.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, increasing skepticism regarding oxytocin’s (OT) influence on social behavior arose. Low power, HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known), and replication failures have clouded the field. Here, we directly address these concerns with a high-powered, preregistered study that offers robust evidence for a causal effect of OT on trust among individuals with a low disposition to trust. We recruited 359 low-trusting individuals who participated in a trust game under strict anonymity conditions. Results show that OT administration significantly increased trusting behavior by roughly 15%, with consistent effects across regression models with and without controls for personality traits. A pooled data analysis incorporating a previous sample (n=219) of low-trusting individuals further strengthens this conclusion, yielding a statistically significant 16.9% increase in trust. Crucially, no interaction effect was found between OT and the degree of dispositional trust, suggesting OT’s effect is uniform across the low-trusting spectrum. These findings present a strong case for OT’s selective trust-enhancing role. By isolating OT’s impact within a well-defined subpopulation and experimental context, this study provides a critical pivot in the debate over neurobiological mechanisms of trust.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how individuals form beliefs about their own creativity – referred to as the creative self-concept (CSC) – requires examining the informational sources that shape these self-assessments. In this paper, we introduce and validate the Sources of Creative Self-Concept Scale (SoCSC), a questionnaire adapted from self-efficacy research, designed to assess four theorized sources of CSC: mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. A sample of 558 adults completed measures of CSC (both global and trait-like) and the SoCSC. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor model aligned with the proposed sources. All sources were significantly associated with CSC, with social persuasion emerging as the strongest individual predictor. However, structural equation modeling revealed that a general factor – reflecting shared variance across all sources – accounted for the majority of the variance in CSC. This finding suggests a dynamic interplay between personal experiences, observed models, social feedback, and affective responses in shaping creative self-perceptions. The results are discussed in the context of Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy.",

Sign-trackers (ST) attribute both incentive and predictive values to these cues, while goal-trackers (GT) assign solely predictive value, orienting their attention rapidly toward the forthcoming reward. Although animal studies report sign-tracking and goal-tracking as stable, trait-like learning styles often related to maladaptive behaviors, human research has produced inconsistent results, raising questions about the reliability and the stability of this behavior. To address these issues, we investigated the test-retest reliability and stability of the classification over a four-month period of the eye-gaze index most commonly used in human sign- and goal-tracking literature. Our findings revealed good capacity for detecting sign-tracking behavior, but limited consistency in identifying goal-tracking behavior, resulting in suboptimal overall reliability. These results raise the possibility that goal-tracking may be either genuinely rare in the population or poorly captured by the current index. Overall, while the gaze index holds promise for identifying ST behavior, methodological refinements or alternative approaches may be needed to reliably detect GT behavior and improve the utility of this measure in future research.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Background: Workplace gaslighting is an underexplored psychosocial stressor that may exacerbate burnout and turnover among employees. Aim: This study examined associations between gaslighting, job burnout, and turnover intention in Greek workers using a cross-sectional design. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2025 with a sample (N = 291) of workers based on convenience sampling. Data from networking via professional social media Information was obtained using an online survey shared among professional social media groups. Workplace gaslighting was assessed using the Gaslighting at Work Scale (GWS), job burnout using the Single-Item Burnout Measure, and turnover intention on a reliable six-point Likert scale. Demographic information consisted of gender, age, education level, and years of work experience (potential confounders). Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between workplace gaslighting and the two outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Results: Participants were mainly female (77%), and the mean age was 42.2 years (SD = 10.3), with a mean duration of work experience of 16.7 years (SD = 9.5). High job burnout (mean = 6.8) and turnover intentions (mean = 3.1) were reported. There were significant positive correlations between workplace gaslighting and burnout (r = 0.230, p &lt; 0.01) and workplace gaslighting and turnover intention (r = 0.385, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses, workplace gaslighting was positively associated with job burnout (b = 0.616, 95% CI = 0.466–0.765, p &lt; 0.001) and turnover intention (b = 0.581, 95% CI = 0.414–0.748, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Workplace gaslighting was strongly associated with both burnout and turnover intention in workers. These results highlight the negative effects of gaslighting at work, and direct to the relevance of organizational interventions geared to prevent gaslighting in order to achieve employee well-being while diminishing staff turnover.",

          "abstract": "Pupil dilation responses are reliable physiological markers of arousal in reaction to unexpected events across sensory modalities. However, a direct comparison across modalities has not yet been conducted. In this study, we address this gap by examining pupil responses to regular and random sequences of visual dots and auditory tones, as well as transitions between these sequences. In Experiment 1, we showed dilation responses when a regular sequence of visual dots changed to a random sequence, but not to the reverse transition. A transition between two different regular sequences led to less dilation on average. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings, confirming the reliability of the observed dilation patterns. In Experiment 3, we compared the pupil responses when sequences and transitions were presented in visual versus auditory modalities. We observed strong cross-modal similarity in pupil sizes, particularly for transitions between regular and random sequences. Notably, these similarities persisted even during baseline trials, when no explicit transition occurred. We also decomposed the time-series pupil size to approximate phasic pupil dilation events. The patterns of dilation events aligned with the overall dilation, with modality-specific dilation event size differences primarily in the context of transitions between different regular sequences. Overall, our findings suggest that pupil-linked arousal reflects imperfect inference of statistical structure and its violations, exhibiting substantial similarity across modalities.",

          "abstract": "Millions of people now use AI-powered chatbots to support their mental health, yet little is known about whether such interactions can effectively enhance psychological well-being. We conducted a preregistered experiment on a large, diverse sample (N = 2,922) to test four AI chatbots, each prompted to employ a multi-step strategy drawn from prior psychological research on sources of happiness and meaning in life. Chatbots encouraged participants to either (a) savor positive life experiences, (b) express gratitude toward a friend or family member, (c) reflect on sources of meaning in their life, or, (d) reframe their life story as a “hero’s journey.” All four chatbots led to improvements on a broad range of psychological well-being outcomes – including affective well-being, meaning in life, life satisfaction, anxiety, and depressed mood – relative to a control chatbot condition. These results generalized to key subpopulations, including those with high baseline levels of anxiety or depression. Chatbot interactions increased interest in seeing a human therapist, including among those who were previously unwilling or had never attended therapy. A separate, nationally representative survey (N = 3,056) found that half of U.S. adults expressed interest in using empirically validated AI chatbots for mental health support. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven well-being chatbots grounded in psychological research offer a scalable and effective way to produce short-term increases in several aspects of psychological well-being. Importantly, these results do not generalize to all AI-based emotional support.",

          "abstract": "Skill acquisition in social contexts depends on learners’ ability to attune to the behaviors of their partners, whose actions help structure environments that guide attention and shape the learning of adaptive behaviors. While greater coupling is often associated with learning and collaborative problem-solving, recent perspectives suggest that the dynamics of interpersonal coupling are more complex, arising from the interplay of two opposing forces – integration and individualization – which define social interaction as a metastable system. This study examined how these dynamics influence performance and solution insight in a two-person problem-solving game with a latent solution that, when discovered, enables superior performance. Using multidimensional cross-recurrence quantification analysis (MdCRQA), participants who discovered and exploited the latent solution exhibited greater perceptual-motor coupling during the pre-discovery period than non-discoverers. Coupling declined after discovery, with further reductions linked to successful task performance, consistent with the metastable view of social interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that AI agents embodying the decision policies of pre-discoverers can, when working with novice human participants, scaffold environments that increases the likelihood of participants discovering the latent solution. These findings are discussed in the context of designing human-compatible AI agents that facilitate the self-organization of adaptive behaviors in humans.",

          "abstract": "Ambiguity avoidance in decision-making may reflect either stable preferences for certainty or uncertainty in beliefs formed through limited experience. Prior studies have commonly used the max–min expected utility (MMEU) model to interpret ambiguity-related decisions, but MMEU confounds preferences with beliefs by focusing on the range of possible probabilities rather than how individuals form them. We conducted two experiments (N = 53; N = 298) using a Linked Colored Lottery Task to evaluate whether ambiguity avoidance reflects stable preferences or beliefs about outcome distributions. Participants first learned to associate colors with distinct outcome distributions by sampling from them and then made incentivized choices between options that varied in ambiguity. This design allowed us to observe how beliefs about distributional variance influenced decisions and to distinguish whether choices reflected belief construction processes versus uncertainty evaluation. We compared models based on MMEU and on subjective recursive expected utility (SREU), which explicitly separates beliefs from preferences. In both experiments, model comparison favored SREU, and participants with more dispersed inferred beliefs were more likely to avoid ambiguous options. Sampling patterns and memory for outcomes showed similar effects. Apparent age-related differences in ambiguity avoidance were also better explained by belief variance than by preferences. These results suggest that ambiguity avoidance often reflects perceived imprecision in learned beliefs rather than an inherent aversion to uncertainty–a cognitive rather than affective phenomenon. This distinction clarifies whether individual differences in choice behavior stem from how people form beliefs or from how they evaluate outcomes, with implications for understanding decision-making across learning, memory, and uncertainty processing domains.",

Previous studies have obtained mixed findings, in part because the typical free response time paradigm lacks the specificity required to disentangle component processes underlying inhibitory control. Here, we apply a novel forced-response paradigm and a computational model to disentangle these processes to test if aging results in overall speed differences or a selective deficit in inhibitory control. 50 older adults and 57 younger adults completed a “forced-response” arrow flanker task. We find strong evidence that older adults demonstrate a global slowing of processing, without any selective deficit in inhibitory control. Furthermore, we demonstrate global slowing is sufficient to explain the mixed findings in previous free RT studies. Overall, these results highlight the utility of using a theory-informed, fine-grained approach to study inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "Current attempts to test whether AI systems are conscious fall into two families: (i) theory-driven criteria imported from cognitive or neuroscientific models (e.g., global broadcasting, higher-order representation, integrated information), and (ii) behavioral or verbal-report tests in the spirit of the Turing paradigm. The former are theory-dependent namely, their verdicts presuppose the correctness of contested explanatory accounts and thus cannot independently ground attributions of phenomenal consciousness. The latter are counterfeit-vulnerable. For example,  advanced language models can mimic first-person discourse, inviting anthropomorphic bias without evidencing phenomenality. We propose a substrate-independent sufficiency criterion that avoids both pitfalls by operating under informational control. If a system trained without any explicit or implicit consciousness-related data can, nonetheless, when prompted, articulate the defining properties of phenomenal consciousness including ineffability, physical irreducibility, intentionality, and unity, then we should attribute consciousness to it with the same degree of confidence we attribute to other humans. We operationalize this criterion for large language models via a test framework comprising: (1) training-data filtering to remove consciousness leakage; (2) a staged evaluation with prerequisite semantic checks and two options for probing (structured property-specific tasks or an open-ended prompt for high-ability models); and (3) a baseline comparison between restricted and unrestricted models under expert judgment, preceded by an intelligence pre-check to avoid confounds. Our proposal does not claim necessary conditions or solve the hard problem. It offers a logically rigorous, counterfeit-resistant path to empirically adjudicate attributions of phenomenal consciousness in artificial systems.",

Psychedelic treatment is thought to impact personality traits, psychological flexibility, and expectations, however these non-pharmacological variables may also influence the initial decision to participate. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the willingness to participate in a psychedelic trial. \nMethods: A cohort of chronic pain patients (N = 988) completed a survey assessing their interest in participating in a psychedelic clinical trial and the Big Five personality traits. A subset (N = 235) were re-surveyed for additional data on psychological flexibility and outcome expectations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to measure the associations between these factors and participants’ willingness to participate.\nResults: Trait openness to experience, and positive outcome expectations, were associated with a greater likelihood of willingness to participate, while negative outcome expectations predicted lower willingness. When controlling for all variables, negative expectancy emerged as the strongest and only significant predictor.\nConclusions: The results show that negative outcome expectations play a role in who chooses to participate in psychedelic clinical trials, suggesting that current trials are biased toward including participants who are more risk tolerant. As psychedelic therapies enter mainstream medical practice, broader populations undergoing psychedelic treatment may not see the same therapeutic outcomes observed in current trials. These findings highlight the need to account for expectancy effects in study enrollment to prevent overestimation of efficacy and improve generalizability.\nKeywords: psychedelics, willingness to participate, expectations, personality, openness",

Yet, previous studies linking personality dynamics to outcomes only examined these associations cross-sectionally, making it unclear whether person-specific dynamics also predict more distal outcomes. In this exploratory study, we investigated prospective associations between individual differences in person-specific dynamics, conceptualized as personality network parameters, with 13 life outcomes over two years. Our findings indicated that node and edge properties in the network were the most robust predictors of distal outcomes, hinting that the accumulation of specific node dynamics over time may link personality traits to outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for personality theory and for policy and intervention.",

          "title": "Why Incels Capture Attention: A Cultural Attraction Theory Perspective",
          "authors": "William Costello; Alberto Acerbi",
          "abstract": "Incels (involuntary celibates) are a misogynistic online subculture whose members define themselves by a perceived inability to form sexual or romantic relationships. Despite rare but high-profile instances of ideological violence, most empirical research shows that they struggle primarily with poor mental health rather than engage in organized extremism. Yet the group commands disproportionate public attention, illustrated most recently by Netflix’s Adolescence, which quickly became the platform’s most-watched mini-series of all time and sparked intense political discussion despite being fictional. Beyond this, the incel motif recurs in artistic depictions across film and musical lyrics and has entered common parlance as a popular insult directed at men. Why are incels so captivating? Drawing on cultural attraction theory and evolutionary psychology, we argue that incel narratives resonate with evolved cognitive biases that make them particularly “sticky.” These include biases towards sex-related content, moral violations, negativity, coalitional threat, protectiveness of women, and morbid curiosity toward dangerous young men. Incels also qualify as minimally counterintuitive, violating gendered expectations by centering their identity on male sexual exclusion. These features render incel discourse especially memorable and transmissible. We conclude by considering the implications of this cultural virality for media, policy-makers, and public discourse, highlighting the risks of letting cultural attraction rather than empirical accuracy shape responses to incels.",

Results revealed seven latent profiles that varied in the number and type of explanations endorsed, as well as the degree of certainty associated with each.

This article reviews the factors that contributed to the crisis, outlines the necessary role of transparency in distinguishing rigorous from flawed research, and documents the limited uptake of open science practices in clinical journals and graduate training. We argue that transparency is an ethical as well as methodological imperative and propose a competency-based model for embedding open science principles into doctoral education.

          "abstract": "In today’s media landscape, there are an ever-expanding number of communication channels that people can use to communicate within their interpersonal relationships. This study, grounded in Media Multiplexity Theory, investigates how communication channels are used during everyday meaningful social interactions and their impact on close friendships. Using data from an intensive longitudinal field study (N = 1,423 young adults; 27,644 experience sampling observations), we found that young adults used more communication channels during meaningful interactions within their strong tie relationships (e.g., close friends, friends, romantic partners), and tended to have such interactions with strong ties via phone calls or direct messages. In contrast, meaningful interactions with weak ties tended to occur in-person or via video calls. Findings from a social network survey indicated that the odds of the friendship being maintained several months later were higher for those who used more communication channels when having meaningful interactions with their close friends. Overall, the findings support and extend Media Multiplexity Theory by examining communication channels use within dyadic relationships for high quality social interactions and its impact on the maintenance of close friendships, which has implications for how people navigate social connections in an increasingly digital environment.",

          "abstract": "Humor interventions can reduce mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Largely unexamined is the therapeutic potential of humor to support recovery from addiction, despite the increasing prevalence of narratives in culture and media (stand-up comedy, TV shows) involving recovery and comedy. The therapeutic potential of humor and key therapeutic targets of recovery (i.e., cognitive, reward, and social) may possess a powerful synergy that could garner enjoyment, cognitive flexibility, and meaning during recovery. The goal of this Think Piece is to describe key processes involved in recovery, link these processes to key processes involved in humor, and then describe existing humor interventions that could be adapted for recovery. Key processes include cognitive deficits and bias in addiction and cognitive reframing and cognitive flexibility through humor; the importance of nondrug reward in recovery and the uniquely rewarding properties of humor (like an “aha!” moment); the importance of social connectedness in recovery and the unique social function of humor in camaraderie and belonging. Humor interventions could be adapted for recovery, including humor-coping training to reframe difficult situations, humor induction (e.g., stand-up comedy clips) to uplift mood, the use of humor to boost effects of other treatments (i.e. Contingency Management, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and to enhance engagement with interventions. We conclude with areas of investigation such as understanding heterogeneity in the types of comedy people prefer, disentangling therapeutic and non-therapeutic humor styles, technology-delivered humor interventions, dynamic and context-dependent aspects of humor, and the timing of therapeutic humor during recovery.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

          "abstract": "Creativity is fundamentally a collaborative process. Yet as generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into creative work, understanding how AI reshapes collaboration has become critical. This pre-registered study directly compares human-human and human-AI collaboration dynamics across two creative tasks: the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and creative short story writing. Participants were randomly assigned to pairs in either human-human (N = 68 pairs) or human-AI (GPT-4o; N = 72 pairs) conditions, with partners alternating turns as first responders to examine how initiation order shapes the creative process over time. Our findings reveal that the apparent \"AI advantage\" in creative collaboration is illusory, driven primarily by increased AI verbosity rather than enhanced creativity. Critically, collaboration with AI partners negatively impacted humans' own creative responses compared to human-human partnerships, with human-AI collaboration failing to enhance idea originality or diversity relative to human-human collaboration. Human partners demonstrated superior collaborative effectiveness that strengthened over time, indicating that current generative AI systems, while producing more verbose outputs, do not replicate the collective creativity characteristic of human-human collaboration. These results challenge assumptions about AI’s creative potential, with direct implications for AI system design and collaborative creative practice.",

          "abstract": "The term \"immersion\" is frequently used to describe and evaluate technologies within the field of extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Over the past few decades, extensive research has been conducted on immersion. However, there remains a lack of consistency in how the term is defined and applied in the literature. Additionally, there is no clear and consistent conceptual hierarchy of related terms across different measurement models. To address these issues, this paper explores the multidimensionality of immersion, as well as associated concepts such as presence and involvement. From this, a unified conceptual model of immersive experience is proposed for future studies in XR. The model defines physical presence, social presence, self presence and involvement as the core dimensions of an immersive experience, which arise from sensorimotor, task/motor and narrative engagement. Plausibility, interactivity, and interestingness are identified as key properties of immersive systems and content that fascilitate engagement, each of which is influenced by subjective factors: internal reference, skills/knowledge and personal preference, respectively. This model provides a comprensive framework for researchers to measure immersive experiences more consistently and build a coherent body of research in XR.",

Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we reconceptualize intelligent agents as active perspectives distinguished solely by their perceived objects. Extending ideas from the field of Diverse Intelligences, we flesh out a theory of Selves as essentially perspectives on objects held in mind. Our model is compatible with a very broad range of material composition and provenance for agents (encompassing evolved, engineered, and hybrid beings), and comprises perspectives upon both features of the physical world and the contents of a putative space of patterns containing both low- and high-agency forms (a.k.a., minds). This framework opens pathways for AGI development that, at crucial junctures, do not depend on the self-construction and self-transcendence cycles that otherwise characterize biological evolution. Context dependent, shareable, and ultimately unbounded in space and time, the emerging agents are in principle capable of responding to stress challenges with universal care, thus transforming our understanding of intelligence itself.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Focused Attention (FA) and Open Monitoring (OM) meditation are theorized to confer distinct neurobehavioral influences, yet the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study leveraged computational modeling to formally test and distinguish how these two distinctive mindfulness states modulate theoretical processes of attention control. Methods: Specifically, we analyzed flanker task data from a prior study in which twenty-nine novice non-meditating participants completed a fully within-subject crossover protocol, involving brief state inductions of FA, OM, and active control. We then fit a Shrinking Spotlight (SSP) computational model to quantify parameters of attentional scope, decision thresholds, and non-decision related processing. Results: As hypothesized, FA decreased the maximum “width” of the attentional spotlight compared to both OM and control conditions, while slowing the rate of narrowing. In contrast, open monitoring accelerated the rate of attention narrowing and increased nondecision time. Conclusions: These results indicate that FA narrows attentional scope, possibly reducing initial distraction but with limitations to rapidly recalibrate attention beyond the initial scope of focus. In contrast, OM appears to improve the speed of selecting relevant targets, while slowing the speed of perceptual-motor encoding and motor execution. Together, these findings provide model-based evidence for the distinct attentional mechanisms of FA and OM and illustrate the utility of computational cognitive modeling for testing key theories within mindfulness science.",

While prior research has focused on simple choices involving the trade-off between motor or cognitive effort and monetary reward, real-life decisions of people with apathy likely reflect biases affecting many other dimensions of value. Additionally, the extent to which mood symptoms that frequently co-occur with apathy also contribute to biases in decision making is unclear. To address these gaps, we developed a novel online task completed by 158 older adults who rated everyday activities (e.g., watching TV, going to the park) across 19 value attributes (e.g., enjoyment, social obligation), and made a series of choices between different activities. A factor analysis of attribute ratings identified three latent factors representing reward, effort, and obligation, which strongly predicted choices and choice response times. Apathy was selectively associated with an overweighting of effort-related attributes while controlling for impulsivity and depression, with no effect on the weighting of reward or obligation. Interestingly, impulsivity, which correlated positively with apathy, was associated with an underweighting of effort. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling supported these findings: apathy and impulsivity modulated the influence of effort on drift rate in opposite directions, altering evidence accumulation toward or away from high-effort options. Overall, these results suggest that everyday decisions depend on the integration of a wide range of value attributes and that apathy is associated with a selective overweighting of the perceived cost of effort.",

If the decline continues, we risk the return of endemic measles, along with other vaccine- preventable diseases. Evidence-based, scalable approaches to support hesitant parents are needed.\n\n*Methods*: We ran a preregistered two-arm online randomized controlled trial (Prolific, August- September 2025) among MMR-hesitant U.S. parents. Participants with baseline intention ≤ 6 (1–7 scale) were randomized 1:1 to: (i) Experimental, a timer-gated four-panel MMR carousel followed by an LLM-guided motivational interview, or (ii) Active Control, a format-matched car seat safety carousel and chat. The primary outcome was post-intervention MMR intention adjusted for baseline using ANCOVA (HC3 robust SEs). Sensitivity included a rank-inverse-normal (RIN) transform and exclusion of two borderline low-quality cases. An exploratory analysis of the durability of the effect used delayed post-intent from a follow-up survey on a separate sample of participants.\n\n*Results*: Among N = 180 randomized participants, the adjusted arm effect (Treatment vs Control) was β ≈ 1.03 points (95% CI 0.72–1.34) on the 1–7 scale. In the follow-up sample (N = 66), the adjusted effect was positive and of similar magnitude (β ≈ 1.09; 95% CI 0.52–1.66). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent inferences.\n\n*Conclusions*: A brief appointment-framed MMR content review plus LLM conversation produced a clear increase in vaccination intention relative to a structure-matched active control, with encouraging signs of short-term durability.

As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls.

          "abstract": "Counterfactual thinking -- thinking about how things could have gone differently -- is a fundamental cognitive capacity that underlies many aspects of our everyday lives; it allows us to learn from past mistakes, evaluate our own and others' actions, and imagine a world beyond the here and now. Yet, prior work has yielded a strikingly wide developmental window for the onset of counterfactual thinking: as early as 2, and as late as 12. There are at least two reasons for this: reliance on counterfactual language (which can underestimate children's competence), and a failure to distinguish counterfactual thinking from hypothetical thinking (which can overestimate children's competence). The current work presents a novel paradigm for probing genuine counterfactual thinking that does not require counterfactual language. After watching a scenario where Granny drops two items that are caught by two different characters, participants are asked which of the two characters Granny should thank. Across three experiments that implement different versions of the task to rule out alternative accounts, we find that the capacity for genuine counterfactual thinking may be present by around age 5, while younger children may succeed on tasks that can be solved via hypothetical thinking. By offering an intuitive and practical method for assessing counterfactual thinking without counterfactual language, the current work opens up a range of empirical questions about the interplay between the development of counterfactual thinking and other cognitive capacities.",

In this paper, randomly selected pairs of variables that showed cross-sectional correlations between .20 and .70 in a large longitudinal study were analyzed using the cross-lagged-panel-model. Results showed that in 98% of these randomly selected pairs, evidence for significant causal effects emerged. The median effect size of these randomly selected effects was larger than the median effect from the literature. Alternative models that account for stable-trait or state variance led to fewer significant effects.

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "The use of noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation methods—such as transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—has grown significantly over the past two decades. Evidence indicates that the dose-response relationship in brain stimulation is neither straightforward nor monotonic, with outcomes influenced by factors such as the brain state, anatomical variability, and neurophysiological mechanisms. Despite advancements in the field, there is still no consensus on standards for estimating and reporting delivered and received stimulation doses or defining dose-response relationships. This paper addresses these gaps by discussing four key areas: (1) factors influencing the delivered dose (stimulation parameters applied at the scalp), (2) quantification of the received dose (electric or acoustic fields delivered to brain tissue), (3) characterization of physiological, behavioral, and molecular responses to specific delivered/received doses, and (4) the dose-response relationship, which describes how variations in dose modulate brain function and behavior. Drawing on evidence from human and animal studies conducted in silico, in vitro, and in vivo, we outline challenges, propose solutions, and summarize current consensus standards. By promoting rigorous methodologies and transparent reporting, this paper aims to advance the reproducibility, safety, and efficacy of research on dose-response assessment in transcranial brain stimulation and its clinical applications.",

This study aimed to validate its French version and use it to identify emotional profiles among young French people (18-30 years old, N=1650). Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature. This study thus provides a validated instrument assessing climate emotions in French-speaking contexts, with potential applications in interventions and research settings – including the study of climate emotion profiles.",

          "abstract": "The Reversed Congruency Effect (RCE) typically observed with gaze targets has been rarely demonstrated with non-social stimuli like arrows targets. In a novel approach, we conducted two pre-registered experiments to investigate whether the RCE can be elicited using non-social stimuli (arrows) when directional information is visually masked. Participants performed a spatial Stroop task with arrows varying in perceptual complexity due to overlapping visual masks. Direction and spatial location were either congruent or incongruent. Remarkably, highly masked arrows elicited an RCE, with faster responses on incongruent trials. Distributional analyses showed reduced interference among the fastest responses and larger RCE in middle quantiles. Additionally, increased errors for both congruent and incongruent conditions were observed in the fastest responses, with congruent trials showing higher error rates, as previously observed with gaze targets. These findings suggest that the RCE reflects a dynamic interplay between early response capture and inhibitory control, shaped by the visual features of masked stimuli. Critically, they raise the possibility that similar perceptual constraints contribute to the RCE observed with gaze targets, offering a potential non-social mechanism underlying this effect. Our results highlight how visual complexity can modulate automatic activation and control processes, underscoring the value of distributional methods for revealing the temporal dynamics of interference.\n\nDraft version 1, 01/10/25.

          "abstract": "Does Automatic Morphological Processing Uniquely Contribute to the Reading Abilities of Middle School Students?\n\nPurpose: Morphological processing is theorized to contribute to skilled reading via the processing of high-level regularities (e.g., semantics). However, morphemes also may contribute to skilled reading via relatively low-level regularities: orthography and phonology. Evidence suggests that middle school marks the shift from effortful use of knowledge of morphological structure during word reading to its automatic activation, thus supporting the development of reading fluency and comprehension. Consequently, this study asked whether automatic morphological processing contributes unique variance to these reading outcomes in middle school students. \n\nMethod: Participants were 80 seventh- and eighth-grade students (n female = 42, n male = 38; mean age = 12.76 years). Four assessments measured decoding, oral reading fluency, and comprehension. Four computer-administered experimental tasks (each with a masked and unmasked version) indexed automaticity and knowledge in reading morphologically complex and simple words. Three analysis approaches were used in a conceptual replication of previous studies (Roembke et al., 2019; 2021): mixed ANOVAs, commonality analyses, and hierarchical regressions.\n\nResults: Only automaticity with morphologically complex words contributed unique variance to comprehension, and it also contributed unique variance to fluency. This was shown on a task that required the mapping of morpho-orthographic to morpho-phonological regularities. Automaticity with morphologically simple words most consistently contributed unique variance to decoding and fluency. \n\nConclusions: Results suggest that middle school students automatically apply morpho-orthographic to morpho-phonological regularities to support fluency and comprehension. However, there was no evidence that they automatically map morpho-orthographic to morpho-semantic regularities to uniquely influence these outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The reversed congruency effect (RCE), typically observed with gaze stimuli, reflects slower and less accurate responses to congruent than incongruent trials, in contrast to the standard congruency effect (SCE; faster for congruent than incongruent trials) observed with arrows. This phenomenon has been interpreted as evidence that gaze engages unique social and perceptual mechanisms. The present study examined whether the RCE could also be elicited with non-social stimuli designed to mimic the asymmetric contrast between pupil and sclera. Across two preregistered experiments, we manipulated the contrast polarity of arrow targets: in gaze-similar arrows, a darker arrowhead and lighter tail paralleled the pupil-sclera configuration, whereas in gaze-opposite arrows this relation was reversed. We also varied perceptual context by embedding stimuli in complex backgrounds. Both manipulations influenced response speed and accuracy, eliciting the SCE, with complex backgrounds producing slower, less accurate performance and reduced SCEs. Distributional analyses further revealed modulations of early response dynamics but no evidence of an RCE. Target-specific effects also emerged, with gaze-similar arrows harder to process yet eliciting smaller SCEs than gaze-opposite arrows. These findings suggest that contrast polarity and perceptual complexity alone are insufficient to reproduce gaze-induced RCEs, underscoring the unique role of gaze in spatial conflict resolution.\n\nAuthor note: Draft version 1, 01/10/25.

Empathy is not a static trait, instead capable of growth and development, and this chapter explores whether AI can and, more importantly, should be used to increase one’s empathy. Nothing in principle stands in the way of AI improving our empathy, but the possibility raises unanswered questions about whether such an approach would be effective or would backfire in unexpected ways, such as encouraging the commodification of empathy as a technological tool that can make companies money, rather than a fundamental part of the human experience.",

It is important for researchers using the NCA to be aware of its susceptibility to spurious findings in order not to overinterpret findings. We recommend researchers using the NCA to scrutinize their findings by estimating ranges of spuriousness, i.e., effects that could be expected due to the correlation between variables. If the estimated necessity effect does not fall above the range of spuriousness, conclusions of necessity should probably be suspended.",

Here, we investigated whether dyadic similarities in participants’ personalities are related to similarities in their face-judgements. 307 participants based in the UK rated 24 faces on six traits. Participants also rated themselves on social-traits and completed a personality questionnaire. We computed dissimilarities between pairs of participants for face-judgements, self-rated-social-traits, and personality-traits, resulting in three separate dissimilarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we showed that both the self-rated-social-traits and personality-traits matrices were significantly correlated with the face-judgements matrix. Importantly, these associations were stable when controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and location. These findings show that people who are more similar to each other also perceive others in a similar manner, and could form the basis for how we gravitate towards others and build friendships.",

We conducted two U.S. studies (N ≈ 7,000) using local income inequality to test these two assumptions and downstream consequences. Confirming the first assumption, residents of more unequal areas reported stronger and more frequent upward and downward economic comparisons. These associations were mediated by perceived competitiveness. Challenging the second assumption, income inequality was associated with a mix of emotional responses to comparison: Inequality consistently predicted resentment when comparing with better-off others and compassion when comparing with worse-off others. Inequality also predicted shame, hope, relief, contempt, and anxiety in one study but not the other. Finally, inequality predicted support for redistribution, an association mediated by resentment and compassion. Together, the findings confirm that income inequality fuels social comparison but reveal that its emotional and attitudinal consequences are more nuanced than commonly assumed.",

This shows that there are fundamental flaws in the way we (used to) go about doing empirical work. The current chapter discusses three methodological hallmarks that have emerged from the critical discourse surrounding the replication crisis: reproducibility, replication, and preregistration. It has become clear that they deserve to be regarded as integral elements of the scientific process, and the aim of this chapter is to help authors improve their work in the light of these insights. Following some initial terminological clarifications, we first turn to various aspects related to reproducibility, ranging from the FAIR principles for data sharing and data publication to computational tools and workflows ensuring the recoverability of statistical results. The focus then shifts to replication and replicability, with an outline of the continuum from direct to conceptual replication as well as advice on how to facilitate attempts by others to replicate our work. We also consider design, analysis and interpretation strategies that may be used to increase the replicability of our statistical conclusions and the linguistic claims they inspire. Finally, we discuss the essential role played by preregistration, where the researcher specifies their linguistic hypotheses and data analysis protocol prior to data acquisition; this form of academic self-discipline has culminated in the emergence of Registered Reports, a new publication format that is beginning to gain ground across the linguistic and cognitive sciences.",

In this study, we used a morphed shape dimension to separately measure generalization of fear (learning when an aversive stimulus is present) and generalization of safety (learning when an aversive stimulus is absent) in participants classified as high or low in trait anxiety. In two experiments, we found that high trait anxious participants undergeneralized safety learning relative to low trait anxious participants, but there were no differences in overgeneralization of fear. A control group who learned about a neutral outcome did not show this pattern of results, and the aversiveness of the outcome predicted undergeneralization of safety learning, but did not predict overgeneralization of fear learning. Our findings suggest that overgeneralization of fear in clinically or high trait-anxious participants may be partly driven by undergeneralization of safety learning. Therefore, promoting generalization of safety learning may be a useful strategy to reduce the spread of fear.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "Empathy plays a central role in human emotional relationships. Empathic accuracy, the ability to accurately infer another person’s emotional state, varies by informational modality and, in humans, is often intertwined with emotional and motivational processes. This study examines whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini - demonstrate empathic accuracy, and how their accuracy compares to that of humans when presented with only the semantic content (transcripts of recorded videos) of ecological, complex autobiographical emotional narratives. We compared the empathic accuracy of LLMs’ to that of human participants (N = 127, randomly sampled students, both in-lab and online) who either read the same transcripts or watched the original videos, which enabled them to use facial and bodily expressions, as well as paralinguistic cues, in addition to semantics. LLMs were able to infer emotional states from semantic content alone with a precision that is equal to or surpasses human performance. This was true both generally and when analyzing positive and negative emotions separately. Theoretically, these findings suggest that semantic information alone can support high empathic accuracy, though humans may not fully leverage this potential. Practical implications are discussed regarding the use of LLMs in introspective and emotional contexts, while raising critical concerns about privacy, ethical risks, and the potential reshaping of emotional understanding, intimacy, and human connection in an increasingly AI-mediated world.",

Using incentivized experimental data from a representative sample of English adults over the age of 50, we find that a higher genetic propensity for educational success is associated with lower risk aversion and greater patience—but only among those who experienced more advantaged childhood environments. Among participants who experienced an adverse early-life environment, risk aversion increases with genetic resources, whereas the positive relationship between genetic resources and patience is significantly attenuated. These findings suggest that early-life conditions can channel genetic resources in ways that are contextually adaptive. Concurrently, the results indicate that environmental inequality shapes the realization of genetic potential in ways that reinforce patterns of social immobility, thereby intensifying concerns regarding the systematic underutilization of potential arising from constraints on household resources.",

          "abstract": "Background\nSome people experience mood changes when hungry. However, the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical conditions, such as depression and eating disorders, is understudied. Therefore, we devised a questionnaire to measure hunger-related mood dysregulation.\nMethods\nWe developed and validated the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in adults and adolescents in the community, and adults with a history of mental health disorder (N = 1,119). We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms. In the mood drift task, the irritability subscale (MEAL-i) demonstrated a significant interaction with time, such that individuals with higher MEAL-i scores reported steeper decreases in happiness (B = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.16–-0.06) and steeper increases in boredom (B = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00–0.12) and frustration (B = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05–0.19).\nConclusions\nThe MEAL measures individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, is associated with mental health, self-reported functioning, and predicts faster worsening of mood during experimentally induced frustration.",

          "abstract": "Understanding language in real-world interaction requires methods that integrate auditory, visual, and neural signals. We present a proof-of-concept study combining mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to investigate referential selection during dyadic communication. Using a simplified version of the director task, pairs of participants engaged in naturalistic object-movement instructions while EEG and gaze data were recorded and synchronized via LabStreamingLayer. This approach allowed us to calculate overlap-corrected, regression-based event-related potentials (rERPs) time-locked to spoken nouns and to participants’ fixations, focusing on the N400/P300 (300–500 ms) and later (500–800 ms) time windows. Our results show that gaze behavior and fixation-related potentials provide crucial information for interpreting language-related ERPs: targets competing with occluded referents elicited stronger P300 effects, suggesting higher attentional demands, while fixation timing systematically modulated neural responses. Contrary to predictions, competitors received little visual attention, indicating that participants prioritized direct task-relevant information. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data integration for understanding attentional and predictive mechanisms in real-world communication. Importantly, we demonstrate that established analytic techniques, such as artifact subspace reconstruction, independent component analysis, and linear deconvolution for ERP calculation, are applicable to noisy, naturalistic data sets. This study thus provides a methodological framework for linking gaze and neural activity during interactive language processing beyond laboratory constraints.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of implicit and automatic gender stereotyping at the intersection of language and face processing, focusing on the bidirectional flow of gender-stereotypical information and previously observed asymmetries in stereotype processing. We recorded response times (RTs) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to a target face (male, female) preceded by stereotypically associated words (e.g., conducente “driver”, badante “caregiver”), or to stereotypically associated target words preceded by a face (male, female). Participants performed a gender categorization task on target faces and a lexical decision task on target words/non-words. RTs showed typical priming effects for target faces, but an asymmetrical priming effect for target words: faster responses to stereotypically female words preceded by a gender-congruent face, whereas faster responses to stereotypically male words preceded by a gender-incongruent face. ERPs showed a gender stereotype asymmetry for target faces and only partially for target words. Female faces elicited a larger P300 and LPP when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words; male faces elicited a larger N400 when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words. Similarly, stereotypically male words elicited a larger P300 when preceded by a gender-incongruent than congruent face. Our findings reveal robust neural asymmetries in gender stereotype processing, extending beyond language, underscoring the need to treat female- and male-related biases as distinct cognitive phenomena in both future research and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research faces a fundamental challenge - the Precision-Breadth-Simplicity (PBS) impossible trinity. While experimental findings are often precise and simple, they tend to be narrow in scope. Conversely, broad and simple concepts frequently lack precision. Developing theories that are both precise and broad is scientifically valuable but inevitably introduces complexity, which conflicts with humans’ cognitive limitations in processing complexity. To address this impossible trinity, I propose a comprehensive exploration (CE) approach—a data-guided theory-building framework that involves: (1) designing experimental conditions in a stimulus-driven way, with minimal upfront theoretical specification; (2) conducting experiments with tens of millions of observations (e.g., 40 million responses in Huang, 2025a); (3) modeling the results through iterative improvements; and (4) producing the outcome: a moderately complex quantitative information-processing model to integrate diverse empirical findings. Inspired by similar strategies that drove breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (e.g., ImageNet’s role in advancing object recognition), the CE approach offers a promising path toward more integrative psychological theories. Initial implementations in visual working memory research demonstrate both its practicality and potential to transform how we study mental processes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",

          "abstract": "Background There is growing interest in the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) as a means for quantifying how individuals’ affective experiences fluctuate over time, and how such dynamics relate to mental health outcomes. A plethora of methods exist for precisely quantifying these affect dynamics, but recent work pooling data from multiple studies has suggested that most of the variance in outcome measures of depression, borderline symptoms, and life satisfaction is captured by simple measures, such as the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) of affect ratings over time. Ever-more sophisticated approaches for measuring affect dynamics may offer little value for understanding mental health. Here, we examined a broad array of mental health outcomes and affect dynamic measures within a single cohort to comprehensively evaluate whether EMA-derived measures of affect dynamics are associated with specific psychopathological experiences.\n\nMethods  314 adults (97 males; 18–45 years of age) completed 28 days of EMA, which included once-daily ratings on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)-10 and daily measures of stress, sleep, and alcohol use. We calculated 16 established affect dynamics measures (M, SD, relative SD, mean-squared successive differences, autoregression, intraclass correlation, and Gini coefficient for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), as well as emotion network density and PA–NA correlation) in addition to six additional measures derived using dynamic network analyses of participant responses (promiscuity and flexibility for the entire network, PA, and NA). Predictive power was assessed using cross-validated linear regression models predicting 117 outcomes spanning five cross-sectional psychometric questionnaires and EMA-based longitudinal behavioral measures. We compared models that included each complex measure against baseline models using only M or M + SD scores quantifying PA and NA.\n\nResults Across all 117 outcomes, no complex affect dynamics measures improved cross?validated R² by more than 5.3 % beyond the M and SD of PA and NA. \n\nConclusion Elaborate measures of affect dynamics, as indexed by the PANAS-10, offer minimal incremental explanatory power in predicting psychopathology beyond basic summary statistics of daily affect. These findings question the added value of increasingly complex measures of affect dynamics for predicting standard psychological and behavioral outcomes.",

However, these associations have predominantly been examined for children who struggle with decoding aspects of reading. This study asked whether children with reading comprehension weaknesses relative to their decoding skills also show higher prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems. \n\nMethod: Preregistered analyses compared the externalising and internalising scores of 931 children with comprehension weaknesses and 4422 typical readers previously identified from Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (James et al., 2023), with additional exploratory analyses to further compare to 1353 children with decoding weaknesses. Multilevel growth models were used to compare parent-report scores at ages 9, 11, and 13, alongside self-reported internalising scores at ages 10, 12 and 13. \n\nResults: Children with comprehension weaknesses showed no differences in the prevalence or trajectory of internalising and externalising symptoms to their peers without reading difficulties. Exploratory analyses confirmed that children with comprehension weaknesses had fewer externalising problems than those with decoding weaknesses, and that females in this group had fewer self-reported depressive symptoms at the first test point.  \n\nConclusion: Associations between reading difficulties and behavioural or emotional problems are largely constrained to decoding weaknesses. Children with relative reading comprehension weaknesses do not appear to share this broader risk profile.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research suggests some of the most profound meditation-induced psychological transformations require mastery of mental skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Such development, however, often demands years of sustained practice and expert guidance. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers a novel means of potentially supporting meditative development by modulating brain structures with high spatial precision. Suppression of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a hub of self-referential processing—may reduce stickiness in internal cognitions and self-interference, thereby fostering equanimity, a crucial meditative faculty. This pilot feasibility study investigated the effects of tFUS-based PCC inhibition during a ten-day silent retreat. Twenty-eight meditators received two stimulation sessions during the retreat and completed standardized questionnaires and daily phenomenological reports. Quantitative analyses revealed significant increases in trait mindfulness, both state–trait nondual awareness, and interoceptive body listening. Qualitative analyses identified consistent differences between stimulation and non-stimulation days: tFUS was associated with enhanced meditative phenomenology, including equanimity, concentration, and sensory clarity, as well as shifts in self-perception and cathartic emotional release. These experiential effects often unfolded in interaction with participants’ ongoing psychological challenges, suggesting that tFUS may increase baseline equanimity and scaffold meditative capacities. Implementation was feasible but required logistical planning. Limitations include the quasi-experimental design, reliance on self-reports, and lack of long-term follow-up. Future studies should use randomized sham-controlled designs, neurophenomenological methods, and examine systematic dose–response parameters with MRI-guided targeting. Together, these findings highlight tFUS as a promising tool for augmenting meditation training and advancing the study of meditative development.",

Guided by theories of femmephobia and dirty femininity, we explored cis-men’s perceptions of menstruation in the workplace in three European countries: Croatia, Germany, and Italy. Semi-structured interviews with 21 cis-men office workers were thematically analysed, uncovering pervasive beliefs and attitudes that sustain and reproduce menstrual stigma. Participants characterised menstruation as irrelevant to the workplace – and even taboo. They felt uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed that it should remain hidden, especially at work. They regularly represented their menstruating colleagues as emotionally unstable, weak, and less competent, reinforcing femmephobic stereotypes. Our findings extend applications of femmephobia to the devaluation and regulation of menstruating bodies in the workplace, and broaden the concept of dirty femininity to include menstruation. To promote inclusive workspaces, interventions should foster dialogue and build empathy between menstruators and non-menstruators, alongside educational initiatives that dismantle patriarchal systems, refute menstruation as taboo, and reduce menstrual stigma at work.",

          "abstract": "Continuous flash suppression (CFS) is a popular method for suppressing visual stimuli from awareness for extended periods. It involves a dynamic, high-contrast masking stimulus presented one eye which suppresses a target stimulus presented to the other. The strength of suppression is usually inferred from how long it takes for the target to breakthrough from suppression into awareness (the bCFS threshold). A new variant known as ‘tracking CFS’ (tCFS) directly measures the strength of suppression by measuring both breakthrough and suppression thresholds. Here, we employ the tCFS paradigm while varying the temporal frequency of the masking stimulus. Our data reveal two clear results: (i) CFS exhibits a clear temporal frequency tuning, with bCFS thresholds peaking for masks modulating at ~1 Hz; (ii) suppression depth (the difference between breakthrough and suppression thresholds) remains constant despite changes in bCFS. The first result confirms an earlier finding that peak bCFS occurs for very low temporal frequencies. The second result provides a valuable insight in showing that bCFS changes occur completely independently of suppression strength, which remains constant. In this study, suppression averaged 13 dB, around 2–3 times stronger than suppression reported in binocular rivalry studies.",

          "abstract": "Substance use among individuals with chronic pain represents an escalating public health crisis. Although opioid use and misuse dominate clinical attention amid the ongoing epidemic, cannabis legalization across the United States has introduced new complexities regarding cannabis use and opioid co-use patterns, potentially amplifying addiction risk in vulnerable populations. Despite growing concern, longitudinal research examining how psychosocial risk factors predict distinct patterns of opioid use, cannabis use, and co-use remains limited. This study employed latent growth modeling (LGM) to investigate trajectories of cognitive-affective risk factors and their differential prediction of substance use patterns among community-dwelling adults with chronic pain. Participants (n = 133; ages 19-67, M = 41.74, SD = 12.92; 55.88% women; 61.76% White) completed a 30-day ecological momentary assessment protocol to monitor stress, pain intensity, psychological distress, pain catastrophizing (helplessness, magnification, and rumination), substance cravings, and use behaviors. LGMs demonstrated an acceptable fit and explained a substantial variance in the observed variables. Substance use patterns remained relatively stable across the 30-day observation period. Critically, cognitive-affective pathways (both intercepts and slopes) consistently predicted opioid use across all risk factors. Cannabis use showed weaker associations, indicated only by helplessness trajectories and pain intensity intercepts. Most notably, elevated cognitive-affective pathways were inversely associated with co-use patterns across all risk factors. These findings challenge assumptions about polysubstance use primacy in chronic pain populations, suggesting that opioid use represents the predominant, persistent pattern driven by cognitive-affective mechanisms, while cannabis use and co-use appear more transient and less systematically predicted by these risk factors.",

In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks.

          "abstract": "Persistent negative feelings such as stress, loneliness, fatigue, pain, irritability, anxiety, and\ndepressed mood are more than temporary discomforts. When they endure, even at subclinical\nlevels, they predict disease, disability, and premature mortality as strongly as many traditional\nmedical and social risks. Yet decades of evidence have not yet been organized into a framework\nthat recognizes these states as determinants of health in their own right. This article advances the\nconcept of Affective Determinants of Health (ADoHs), a category parallel to Social\nDeterminants of Health (SDOH). We define affectivity as the systemic capacity to feel, affects as\nits phenomenal instances, and affective determinants as the subset of affects that meet criteria for\ndeterminant status.\n\nA novel contribution of this framework is the recognition that persistent affects function not only\nas indicators of strain, suffering, and distress, but as stressors themselves, producing cumulative\nbiological and psychosocial strain. To explain their operation, we introduce a Three-Channel\nModel of biological, behavioral, and coping pathways and describe the construct of cumulative\naffective load, which parallels allostatic load. By consolidating diverse evidence, we argue that\nsystematic recognition of ADoHs as transdiagnostic determinants can improve early detection,\nprevention, and intervention across clinical care, population health, workplaces, education, and\npolicy. Recognizing ADoHs highlights both the costs of neglect and the opportunity to address\nthe affective foundations of health, equity, and human functioning.\n\nKeywords: affective determinants of health, affectivity, social determinants of health (SDOH),\nemotion, health disparities",

Across two studies (N=1,534), we examined how naturally diverse vocalizations influence prosocial behavior. In Study 1, authentic videos of crying individuals were synched with typical crying, atypical crying, typical laughter, or no vocalization. When participants were asked to make affective inferences (Study 1A), vocalization type influenced their perceived valence judgments. However, when participants made donation decisions without explicit inference instructions (Study 1B), vocalization type did not impact donations, except when audiovisual signals were affectively conflicting. In Study 2, we examined the role of explicit inferences of affect in facilitating the link between naturalistic expressions and prosocial behaviors. We found that when participants first made explicit inferences about others’ affective states, they donated more money overall and their helping behaviors were more sensitive to vocalization types. However, when participants donated without providing explicit inferences first, their helping behaviors were less influenced by vocal cues and donation amounts were lower overall. Collectively, these findings highlight the role of explicit inferential processing in establishing the link between naturalistic emotional expressions and social behavior.",

          "abstract": "The paired lexical decision task is a common task used for studying online speech processing. Several key priming effects underlying the composition of the mental lexicon have been found using this priming paradigm, non-exhaustively including orthographic priming effects, semantic priming effects, and phonological priming. This study revisits the effects of orthographic priming in an auditory lexical decision task with English heteronymic pairs, word pairs that share the same orthographic form but have distinct phonological codes. Although heteronymic pairs present an ideal condition for orthographic priming effects to surface, heteronyms are often related to each other semantically, making it difficult to isolate possible orthographic effects from semantic priming effects. To this end, we present a novel methodology for using language models to generate semantically matched prime target controls to compare reaction times against. Using these semantically matched controls, we gather reaction time results from a sample of 29 English speaking university student and conduct Bayesian Regression analysis on 153 heteronymic prime target pairs and 343 control pairs. We find no significant difference in reaction times between heteronymic pairs and semantically matched pairs.",

          "abstract": "Incorporating gamelike elements into courses can increase student engagement and motivation, especially when the game involves freedom, choice, and storytelling. In this paper, I describe the \"meaningful gamification\" of an upper-level decision science course using the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. The course was organized into a seminar and a game component such that students spent the first class of each week in a traditional lecture and the second class of each week applying evidence-based solutions to problems within their Dungeons and Dragons games. Reception of the class was universally positive, and students reported high levels of engagement. Importantly, students reported that the opportunity to practice course concepts in-game made it more likely that they would be able to apply them in real life. In this paper, I share the structure, goals, and logistics of the course so that other instructors can use the framework to adapt their own courses.",

          "authors": "Peggy L. St. Jacques",
          "abstract": "Subjective features of memory are often treated as secondary to the objective content of remembered events. However, growing evidence suggests that these features actively shape how memories are constructed, experienced, and used. Rather than treating visual perspective as a peripheral correlate of subjectivity, this review positions it as a key mechanism that shapes the memory. Because perspective can be flexibly controlled and reliably measured, it offers a unique window into how retrieval goals interact with mental simulation to produce vivid and emotionally resonant recollections. Drawing on behavioral and neuroimaging research, this review shows that visual perspective determines the spatial framing of memory, and the emotional and sensory qualities of recollection. Focusing on the posterior parietal cortex, it outlines distinct roles for the angular gyrus (AG) and the precuneus in supporting perspective-dependent retrieval. The AG contributes to the selection and maintenance of a retrieval perspective, integrating perceptual and conceptual features into a coherent scene. In contrast, the precuneus supports spatial transformation and modulates the vividness, emotional tone, and embodied character of recollection, particularly when individuals recall events from a non-dominant or shifted perspective. Together, these findings position visual perspective as a central mechanism in the construction of subjectivity. Understanding how perspective shapes the process of remembering provides insight into how memory supports emotion regulation, mental simulation, and the continuity of the self across time.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) present a paradox for theories of consciousness.\nDefined by phenomenological simplicity, they are nonetheless accompanied by unexpectedly high\nneural signal diversity. Traditionally, entropy has been interpreted as a marker of\nphenomenological richness, exemplified by psychedelic states. Yet MPEs such as advanced\nabsorptive meditation (jhāna) or 5-MeO-DMT exhibit high entropy despite radically reduced\nexperiential content. This tension—the entropy–content paradox—challenges the entropic brain\nhypothesis and calls for a refined framework. We propose that entropy does not directly index the\nrichness of conscious content, but rather the grain of inference by which the brain resolves\nvariability. Psychedelics exemplify a fine-grained regime, in which loosened constraints amplify\nfluctuations into proliferating content, whereas MPEs exemplify a coarse-grained regime, in which\nrigid stabilization smooths over variability into contentless awareness. Both regimes elevate\nentropy, but they diverge in phenomenology and perturbational signatures. Recognizing this\ndissociation refines the entropic brain hypothesis and positions MPEs as decisive test cases for\ncomputational theories of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Friendships help people achieve many fundamental adaptive functions. As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls.

In two state-based experiments, harmonic locking emerged as a system-wide property of brain-body coordination, associated with cognitive demand, task-related physiological arousal, and negative affect valence. Cardiorespiratory rhythms coupled to low-frequency, network-level brain rhythms, which in turn coupled to higher-frequency brain activity, enabled by a coordinated, oppositional modulation of low- and high-frequency rhythms. The converging effects of cognitive demand, physiological arousal, and negatively-valenced affect suggest a conceptual and functional overlap, potentially unified as constituent elements of state stress. A third, meta-analytical experiment found individual differences in perceived stress and interoceptive sensitivity to physiological arousal predicted latent expression of brain-body coupling. Finally, distinct elements of the stress response engaged distinct modes of synchrony, contingent on arousal activation: a purely cognitive stress promoted theta-anchored intra-brain coupling; stress accompanied by cardiorespiratory activation promoted delta-anchored brain-body coupling. Together, this study identified harmonic locking as a stress-responsive, hierarchically-organized substrate of brain-body coordination.",

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), where dopaminergic dysfunction is a core feature, alterations in corticobulbar excitability may provide insights into both motor and motivational deficits. Objective. This study investigated whether motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the submental muscle (SbM) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) differentiate PD patients from matched healthy controls, and whether SbM excitability is modulated by acute dopaminergic stimulation. Methods. Twenty-two participants (10 PD patients, 12 healthy controls) were tested using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients underwent stimulation in both OFF (≥12 h levodopa withdrawal) and ON (1 h after levodopa) conditions. MEP amplitude, onset latency, and elicitation rate were extracted. Linear and generalized linear mixed models tested between- and within-group effects. Results. At baseline, patients showed a higher proportion of elicited MEPs in ECR compared to controls (p = 0.045), but no differences for SbM. Within patients, levodopa intake was associated with longer SbM onset latency (p = 0.012), reduced SbM elicitation rate (p = 0.034), and a robust increase in ECR amplitude (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions. These findings suggest a dissociation between control (ECR) and target (SbM) excitability, SbM results differently sensitive to dopaminergic state, supporting its potential linkage to broader dopaminergic network, comprising corticobulbar and motivational function that are disfunctional in PD.\nKeywords: corticobulbar tract; submental EMG; Parkinson’s disease; transcranial magnetic stimulation; motor evoked potentials; motivational arousal.",

Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward\ncriticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of\nmeditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the\n“jhānas”, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and\nphysiological data during these practices and quantified the signal’s dynamical properties using\nLempel–Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations.

Relative to mindfulness, jhāna was associated with\npronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across\nmultiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites.\nSpectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic 1/f component and a frequency-specific reorganization\nof long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and\nheightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during\njhāna. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhāna with minimal phenomenal\nexperiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness.\nAccordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the\nabsorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence continues to advance, people increasingly expect humanoid robots to demonstrate sophisticated social behaviours. To meet these expectations, it is crucial to design robots that align with human models of social cognition. This study explores the extent to which humans co-represent actions performed by social robots and how prior attitudes influence this process. We use the social inhibition of return (SIOR) paradigm, where individuals are slower to respond to targets in locations previously acted upon by themselves or by a partner. In a within-subjects design, participants engaged first with a robot co-actor and then with another human co-actor. Overall, our findings suggest that interacting with a robot fosters positive perceptions of the robot and evokes co-representation of their actions. Additionally, we found a trade-off between self- and social-inhibitory processes when interacting with a robot, in contrast to interactions with humans. Furthermore, prior attitudes, particularly the tendency to attribute human-like qualities to robots, were paradoxically found to reduce the SIOR effect.  We discuss these results in relation to the uncanny valley effect, as well as broader implications for how human and robot factors that drive people’s co-representation of robot behavior may support more natural and effective human—robot cooperation.",

A new United States Video Speed Test (USVST) was developed. The new test used ten video clips, each 8 seconds in duration, which participants viewed before indicating how much slower or faster they would drive in the same scenario. In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers. Males also scored significantly higher on the USVST than females. Collectively, this evidence suggested that the USVST may be a useful tool for measuring speeding propensity.",

Submental muscle (SbM) surface EMG may thus provide a convenient physiological window on motivational states during foods selection (Sato et al., 2021; Ferraioli and Vicario 2024). Objective. To test, in healthy participants, whether SbM activity recorded during an immersive virtual‑reality (VR) supermarket varies as a function of food motivational category (Daily, Hedonic, Dislike) and whether SbM contributes to the prediction of self‑reported preference, along with personality traits, like impulsivity in monetary choice, measured by Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ; Kaplan et al., 2016). Methods. Fourteen adults completed a VR shopping task selecting 10 products per three different conditions. SbM was recorded continuously and summarized within pre‑selection (−550/−200 ms) and post‑selection (T0/+550 ms) windows, as specified in our published protocol (Ferraioli et al., 2025). Linear mixed‑effects models (LME) examined effects of Condition and Phase on SbM. A separate LME predicted Preference from SbM, Condition, and impulsivity (MCQ). Results. SbM was higher in Hedonic vs Daily (β=0.342, p=.022), with no main effect of Phase (p=.774) and no Condition×Phase interactions. Preference was positively associated with SbM (β=0.441, p=.043) and strongly reduced in Dislike (β=−5.760, p&lt;.001); MCQ had no effect. Conclusions. Our preliminary analyses on an ecologically valid VR environment, showed SbM differentiates motivational categories and independently predicts reported preference, supporting SbM as a candidate biomarker of motivational arousal and complementing the broader CB‑excitability program (Ferraioli et al., 2025).\nKeywords: corticobulbar tract; submental EMG (SbM); virtual reality; food preference; motivational arousal; linear mixed‑effects models.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of human experience is that of being a bounded and embodied agent. This basic sense of self typically operates implicitly, yet traditional contemplative accounts alongside recent work in philosophy, phenomenology and neuroscience suggests that it can be attenuated or even fully dissolved while retaining awareness. Here we present an extended analysis of data from a large-scale neurophenomenological study investigating such minimal modes of awareness, in which 46 long-term meditators alternated between resting-state and meditative conditions of self-boundary (SB) dissolution and maintenance during magnetoencephalography. Results show global increases in broadband entropy rate and directed information transfer in both meditation conditions compared to rest. Spectral decomposition of both measures reveals that broadband effects are driven mostly by high-frequency activity, and that information transfer and entropy rates exhibit qualitatively different spectral patterns. Although these global changes don’t clearly differentiate meditative self-boundary dissolution, localized reductions in information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid and post cingulate and in high-beta entropy rate in sensorimotor and posterior-medial cortices did differentiate the meditation conditions. Furthermore, a relative reduction of broadband orbitofrontal cortex entropy rate, and broadband information transfer from occipital, cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas, both correlated strongly with SB-dissolution phenomenology. Together with a previously reported neural correlate from the same dataset of reduced high-beta power in the posterior-medial cortex, these two neural correlates synergistically explained over half the variance in phenomenological dissolution scores (R² = 0.52), exhibiting a neurophenomenological association of unprecedented strength. By integrating nuanced phenomenology with multiscale neural metrics, our findings provide novel insight into self-attenuation and advance the empirical investigation of minimal phenomenal experience.",

These arise from multiple experimental procedures and animal species. To assess any proposed theory of associative learning, decisions must be made about which behavioral phenomena to account for. However, there is currently no systematic approach to prioritize observations within this body of evidence. Here, we propose a set of benchmarks that theories should explain: phenomena that are robust across experiments, generalize across procedural variations, and occur under broad but clearly specified circumstances. We queried the expert community for phenomena to be included, reviewed the relevant literature, graded the phenomena into four categories of robustness and generality, and compared our gradings with a second survey of the expert community. We identified 94 benchmark phenomena, of which 16 are domain- and species-general and hence should be explained by any theory claiming generality, and 30 are species- and/or domain-specific but highly robust across procedures. Strikingly, some textbook phenomena that have motivated influential and general associative learning theories are not among these. The remaining 48 phenomena were either tied to particular experimental procedures or of inconclusive generality. Some of their boundary conditions appear to be informally known across laboratories but rarely investigated in a systematic manner. Thus, our review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current evidence, which will direct theorizing towards high-priority phenomena while also re-focusing research into areas in which evidence is lacking.",

          "abstract": "The sensitive period for phonetic learning, normally considered to be between 6 to 12 months of age, has been demonstrated as one of the earliest milestones for language development. Infant speech processing towards the end of the sensitive period has been shown to predict individual language development trajectories up to school entry and most recently, risk of speech and language disorders, suggesting its potential clinical relevance. Yet, this literature is largely limited to typically developing infants with regard to their family histories of speech and language delays or disorders. The current study begins to fill the gap by investigating associations between neural markers of the sensitive period, family history risk factors, and language outcomes by gathering extensive information from a large group of infants. Specifically, family information includes an extensive parental survey of family background and clinical history, a comprehensive assessment of language skills for one older sibling by a research speech-language pathologist (SLP), and a daylong audio recording in infants’ homes for assessing their language environment. The study design focuses on comparing neural predictors of language development in infants with or without first-degree family history of speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., High vs. Low-risk infants). Infants’ neural speech processing is measured three times using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) at 6 months, 12 months, and 14 months of age. Infants’ language development is tracked until school entry by both parental surveys (MB-CDI) and the same comprehensive assessment protocol with a research SLP. This protocol documents the study design and methodological details for data collection and preprocessing. This study will allow our research team to start tackling important questions regarding early predictors of speech and language delays and disorders (e.g., late-talking, Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)) and contribute significant value to the broader field.",

Research indicates that the quality rather than the quantity of these elements predict therapeutic outcomes in CBT. However, it remains unclear which factors facilitate the post-treatment implementation and continuation of individually helpful elements. This study investigated whether the quality of \"bridging elements\" predicts their implementation in the post-treatment phase. Bridging elements were defined as any element of previous therapy that a patient has experienced as helpful and that helps maintain treatment effects from the patient's perspective after treatment termination. Criteria were derived from the literature to rate the quality of patients' open-ended descriptions of their bridging-elements. A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted with 120 inpatients who had been previously treated with CBT. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that a quality score composed of four quality criteria significantly predicted implementation of bridging elements even after controlling for motivational factors, while none of the single quality criteria alone was predictive at four-month follow-up. Prior to treatment termination individually helpful bridging elements should be identified to foster enduring change. Specific attention should be paid to defining high-quality bridging skills, which should be specific, time-limited, independent from others, action-oriented, measurable, and frequently applicable.",

          "abstract": "Youth who are simultaneously engaged in both the juvenile justice and child welfare systems—commonly referred to as dually involved youth—face disproportionately high rates of trauma exposure, psychiatric comorbidity, and adverse developmental outcomes. Traditional accounts of juvenile impulsivity often emphasize sensation seeking or underdeveloped executive function, portraying defiance as a product of poor judgment or deliberate noncompliance. Emerging evidence, however, highlights the role of negative urgency, defined as rash action in response to distress, as a more precise explanatory construct. This paper develops and applies the concept of the Urgency Loop, a cyclical process in which trauma-induced emotional dysregulation drives impulsive actions aimed at short-term relief, producing long-term negative consequences that reinforce distress and perpetuate maladaptive patterns.\n\nDrawing from neuroscience, developmental psychology, and criminology, the Urgency Loop framework situates behaviors such as runaway episodes, aggression, and substance use not as thrill-seeking but as relief-seeking adaptations to overwhelming affective states. This reorientation challenges prevailing juvenile justice interpretations of 'willful defiance,' which often justify punitive sanctions and surveillance. Instead, the framework underscores how trauma reshapes limbic–prefrontal circuitry, heightens vulnerability to negative urgency, and interacts with systemic responses to exacerbate cycles of involvement.\n\nThis manuscript reviews theoretical models of impulsivity, empirical findings on trauma and neurodevelopment, and critiques of trauma-informed practice. It further explores implications for juvenile justice reform, including the potential utility of ecological momentary assessment, ethical considerations of pharmacological interventions, and the need for more nuanced adjudicative approaches.

          "abstract": "People with pronounced narcissistic traits exhibit marked problems in their intersubjective experiences, yet a more detailed view on how different aspects of interpersonal functioning relate to grandiose and vulnerable narcissism is lacking. We conducted a preregistered questionnaire study of 956 participants to examine how vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic traits differ in relation to mentalizing capacity, tendency to trust in socially transmitted information (epistemic trust), belongingness needs, and experiences of internal and external shame. Our findings confirmed hypotheses, differentiating distinct inter- and intrapersonal patterns between narcissistic subtypes: Individuals high in vulnerable narcissism displayed compromised mentalizing and were associated with increased epistemic mistrust and credulity, higher need for belonging, and heightened experiences of internal and external shame. Conversely, grandiose narcissistic traits predicted lower belongingness needs, reduced shame experiences, and higher epistemic mistrust without credulity or clear deficits in mentalizing abilities. These results clarify clinically meaningful distinctions within narcissistic presentations, highlighting vulnerable narcissisms pronounced interpersonal instability and grandiose narcissisms defensive self-regulation. The findings emphasize the importance of differentiating narcissistic subtypes to inform targeted therapeutic strategies addressing specific emotional and relational impairments.",

          "abstract": "The ubiquity of over-optimism, overconfidence, wishful thinking and desirability biases suggest that a universal motivational mechanism distorts all decisions and judgments uniformly. Here, we investigate this intuition, by assessing the relative effects of incentives on two types of probabilistic judgments: beliefs about externally generated hypotheses, versus confidence in one’s own decisions. Across four perceptual decision-making experiments, we manipulate the agency of decisions over ambiguous states-of-the-world and the monetary incentives for accurate probabilistic judgments about decision accuracy. Results show that incentives consistently bias participants’ reports, but, contrary to the uniform motivational bias intuition, substantially more for confidence than belief judgments. Modelling probabilistic judgments as an incentive-dependent weighting of evidence that is congruent with a (covert) decision rationalizes this apparent discrepancy. We conclude that gain versus loss prospects modulate how we integrate evidence confirming our endorsed hypothesis, shedding light on the formation of beliefs and confidence, and their interaction with motivational processes.",

          "abstract": "Exploitation is a pervasive yet under-theorized phenomenon shaping interactions from intimate relationships to global institutions. Existing approaches typically examine narrow domains—manipulation in interpersonal contexts, cheating in economic games, or corruption in political systems—without an integrative account. The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor in the acceptance and safe deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). In recent years, it has remained a prominent topic of discussion, with market data indicating that public trust in these technologies remains suboptimal. As a result, researchers have explored various strategies to enhance trust in AVs. One such strategy involves anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices. Initially, it was assumed that incorporating anthropomorphic features would enhance trust in AVs. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes from 5903 participants from seven databases were included in this meta-analysis.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

We localized two effects to R DLPFC (1) a simple single-dissociation of higher activity in RB categorization, and (2) a negative relationship between overall task performance and the magnitude of neural activation.

Across four experiments, listeners heard various speakers describe two characters while their eye-movements were measured to these referents. Afterwards, listeners provided judgments about the speaker’s intent. Eye-movements revealed frequency effects for literal but not ironic meanings, systematic reference restriction for ironic but not “opposite” speakers, and late-emerging conflicts between literal and ironic meanings. Judgments revealed intuitions about the pragmatic function of irony and relations to truth conditions. These findings demonstrate that ironic interpretations are not directly retrieved from conventionalized representations in the lexicon. Instead, they involve real-time reasoning about utterance semantics and speaker intentions, and that these dual processes yield distinct signatures during comprehension.",

The model is specified by three behavioral indices—associative-distance density, analytic-verification ratio, and convergence latency—and mapped onto a neural motif in which Default Mode Network (DMN) activity alternates with Central Executive Network (CEN) activity on a sub-second timescale. A review of recent fMRI, EEG, and causal stimulation studies shows that (i) DMN–CEN coupling increases with idea originality, (ii) rapid network switching predicts insight accuracy, and (iii) dual site neuromodulation that balances the two networks boosts creative output without loss of practicality. System 3 also reframes cognitive biases as scalable heuristics that expand the search space when monitored by metacognitive confidence signals, and positions dopamine and serotonin as chemical gain controls on the generate–evaluate loop. Practical applications range from AI assisted ideation and precision neurofeedback to cautious exploration of pharmacological and genetic levers. An ethical framework is proposed to safeguard psychological integrity, authenticity, and equity as such interventions mature. Finally, developmental data suggest that the generative component matures early in adolescence, whereas evaluative gating and full-loop metacognition continue to develop into adulthood, inviting longitudinal tests of the model. System 3 thus offers a falsifiable, multi-level account of creative cognition and a scaffold for responsible enhancement technologies.",

This has sometimes been attributed to age-related change in communication goals, yet little is known about how different age groups modify their discourse style when they have different goals. Here, young and older adults produced discourse on a range of topics, first without specific instructions and then when instructed to be as entertaining or as focused as possible. When aiming to entertain, both age groups spoke more quickly and were less globally coherent, particularly in the later stages of responses. This later decline in coherence was more pronounced in the older group.  These results indicate that deviations from the topic of discussion can stem from a desire to entertain one’s audience. Thus, a shift in communication goals is a viable possible explanation for age-related declines in coherence.",

However, estimating reliability can be challenging for complex cognitive and behavioural assessments without test-retest data. Most statistical methods for assessing reliability with a single test administration are designed for fixed-item questionnaires. We introduce a novel Bayesian procedure called relative measurement uncertainty (RMU) for estimating reliability that can be broadly applied, including to many widely used computational models. Our approach draws pairs of samples from each subject's posterior and calculates the correlation between draws. We demonstrate analytically and via simulation that this method provides accurate reliability estimates and well-calibrated credible intervals across linear factor, signal detection and reinforcement learning models. Simulations found that RMU was more accurate (lower root mean square error) than existing measures (coefficient alpha, coefficient H, split-half), but more importantly, it can be applied across a wide range of computational models. RMU offers a general method for estimating reliability, leveraging the modelling flexibility of Bayesian statistical methods.",

We found that prototypical features varied regionally, suggesting an effect of participants’ geographical region on conceptual structure.

Within this framework, yawning—a stereotyped behavior linked to arousal regulation and social contagion—offers a unique opportunity to explore maternal-fetal relationships before birth. While contagious yawning has been extensively studied in postnatal contexts, its presence and developmental role in utero remain unexplored. This study investigated whether fetal yawning behavior is modulated by maternal yawning, suggesting a primitive form of behavioral contagion within the dyad. Thirty-six pregnant participants were exposed to video stimuli designed to elicit yawns, while fetal facial movements were recorded using 2D ultrasound. Maternal and fetal yawning frequencies were analyzed across four conditions: baseline, maternal still-face, maternal mouth opening/closing movements, and maternal yawning. Fetal and maternal time series were further examined using Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), and an LSTM-based neural network was employed for automated behavioral classification. Results showed a significant increase in fetal yawns following maternal yawning, but not during control conditions, indicating selective behavioral responsiveness. CRQA revealed enhanced temporal structure in true mother-fetus dyads compared to shuffled pairs, suggesting non-random coordination. The LSTM model accurately distinguished yawning from other facial actions, supporting the reliability of the behavioral data. These findings provide the first evidence of prenatal yawning contagion and support the notion that behavioral alignment may reflect embodied mechanisms of attunement that precede postnatal social engagement, offering new insights into the developmental origins of intersubjectivity.",

This semantic interference effect in the picture-word interference task has been replicated numerous times and is an empirical cornerstone of speech production research. However, picture-picture interference studies in which the distractor words were replaced with distractor pictures have yielded highly inconsistent results, reporting semantic interference, semantic facilitation, and null effects. We present a meta-analytic summary of the published studies. We found the estimated semantic effect to be close to zero (2 ms, 95% CI [-5, 9]). This contrasts with the results of 14 previously unpublished picture-picture interference experiments from our laboratory. Across these experiments, the estimated semantic interference effect was 15 ms (95% CI [9, 21]). When all data were included in a meta-analysis, the pooled estimate was 9 ms (95% CI [4, 14]). This suggests that the magnitude of semantic interference from distractor pictures has been underestimated and that it is not as elusive as previously thought. We conclude that there is no qualitative difference in the semantic effects caused by distractor words and pictures, and we discuss the implications for modelling word production.",

We present three experiments that force us to revise this dual process view. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants had to give their first, initial answer under cognitive load and time pressure. Next, participants could take all the time they wanted to deliberate and select a final answer. This enabled us to identify the intuitively generated response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Results show that participants do not necessarily need to deliberate to avoid the illusion and that incorrect respondents consistently display error sensitivity (as reflected in decreased confidence), even when deliberation is minimized. Both reasoning performance and error sensitivity in the initial, intuitive stage tended to be driven by the semantic relatedness between the anomalous word (e.g., “Moses”) and the undistorted word (e.g., “Noah”). We show how this leads to a revised model where the response to semantic illusions depends on the interplay of both incorrect and correct intuitions.",

Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction.

Experiment 3 focused on the impact of instructed study goals (preparing for a quiz show vs. learning a foreign language) on participants’ memory for veracity feedback. The results indicated that statement type and study context influenced memory for “true” and “false” feedback. For comparative statements, participants showed symmetric memory for truth and falsity. For definitions, on the other hand, participants remembered truth better than falsity, but only when the statement type was manipulated between participants.\nFurthermore, this effect was amplified by the study instructions. Taken together, these findings challenge traditional models on the mental representation of truth and falsity, which propose a rigid encoding of “false” tags (and “true” tags, respectively). Instead, the results argue for an optional encoding of “true” and “false” tags, which is shaped by the informational value of the different types of veracity feedback in a given study context.",

          "abstract": "With increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for mental health needs and reports of inappropriate and biased responses, it is important to identify determinants of bias in LLMs reasoning and responses. This study evaluated LLMs-generated responses to mental health vignettes varying in severity and nature of symptom for 10 social questions, such as comfort level as a working colleague and propensity for violence. Nine LLMs models (Deepseek, Gemini, Gemma, GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4, GPT‑4o, LLaMA, Microsoft, StabilityAI) were assessed using automated metrics, including BERTScoreF and ROUGE-L for differences from human-expert generated responses (degree of biasness). Analyses showed that models produced responses that differ lexically and semantically.. Moreover, the significant interaction effects of type of mental health symptom and severity across LLMs and type of social questions were indicative of weaker concordance of reasoning between LLMs and human-expert depending on specific symptom-severity, suggesting potential biases and differential generalization. Research and clinical implications, such as the importance of human expert oversight throughout the development and application of LLMs for mental health use, were discussed.",

          "authors": "Shawn Prest",
          "abstract": "Meditative experience has long been associated with conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity to phenomena, increased present moment perception and more pleasant experience. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such meditative “deconstruction” are not well understood, with no formal computational models available to explicate how deconstruction alters perception and action during meditation. Using the active inference framework, I demonstrate that the phenomenology of deconstruction–in terms of conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity and shorter temporal scale perception–naturally emerges from the dynamics of hierarchical inference when the deconstructive notion of letting go is cast as a reduction in belief precision over hidden states at a specific level of the generative model. I present a formal hierarchical three-level generative model and simulate deconstruction as an intervention in a facial recognition task, where the agent selects a letting go policy when perceived affective valence becomes excessively negative. The results demonstrate that the capacity to deconstruct permits agents to self-regulate experienced affect via letting go. I furthermore propose that the proposed letting go mechanism may underlie the emergence of minimal phenomenal experiences such as pure awareness states. The model offers a novel perspective within the paradigm of computational phenomenology on conceptual attenuation, equanimity, stillness and affect during meditative deconstruction.",

We argue that many previous studies supporting this view have significant shortcomings. Specifically, these studies conflate measures of objective performance with those of subjective experience, and cannot exclude the possibility that their observed effects might have been mediated by post-sensory processes instead (e.g., semantics, memory). To address these issues, our paradigm combined elements from two published studies by Sekar et al. (2011) and Lupyan and Ward (2013). Participants (N = 19) observed and rated visual targets of fixed intensity corresponding to their 50% identification threshold; visual targets were preceded by nonpredictive speech cues which matched or mismatched the target. Participants carried out an identification task and rated their subjective experience (“didn’t see”, “couldn’t identify”, “unsure”, and “sure”), while event-related potentials were recorded. We found that identification of targets that remained unseen (“didn’t see”) was not facilitated by congruent cues, but was impaired by incongruent cues. In addition, cue congruence did not affect the relative frequency of nonconscious (“didn’t see”) to conscious visual experiences, nor did it affect the amplitude of the Visual Awareness Negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The results indicate that language cues did not enhance the processing of subliminal visual inputs, nor boost them into conscious experience. This outcome aligns with accounts of low-level perception that exclude the influence of linguistic or conceptual knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Background: Despite clear evidence linking indoor sunbed use to an increased risk of skin cancer (melanoma), sunbed use among young adults in the UK remains prevalent. This research explored barriers and facilitators influencing the use of sunbeds and tanning alternatives among young adults in the UK, aiming to inform strategies to encourage safer tanning behaviours.\nMethods: An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and June 2025. Using purposive sampling, we recruited UK-based young adults (aged 18–24) who had used sunbeds in the past year. A total of 502 participants (Mage = 21.73, SDage = 1.76) completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Measures included demographics (e.g., age, ethnicity), social deprivation, skin cancer risk, sun protection behaviours, willingness to use alternatives, and barriers/facilitators to indoor sunbed and sunbed alternatives use, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Backward stepwise linear regressions predicted frequency of using indoor sunbeds and alternatives (past year) from TDF constructs. Significant predictors were entered into separate linear regressions controlling demographics in the first model. Qualitative feedback was gained to further assess barriers/facilitators for using each alternative; analysed using content analysis.\nResults: Quantitative findings indicated that facilitators for indoor sunbed use related to tanning addiction (behavioural regulation), lower intentions to reduce or replace sunbed tanning, achieving tanning goals, less knowledge relating to associated health risks, and beliefs that alternative tans are temporary. Frequent use of sunbed alternatives was associated with perceptions of a natural-looking tan, stronger future intentions, identity alignment, and social influence from other users. Qualitative findings indicated positive emotion and beliefs about consequences as key facilitators of sunbed use, whereas knowledge of health risks and costs were barriers. For alternatives, greater facilitators were associated with convenience and affordability. There were mixed views regarding beliefs about consequences between alternatives.\nConclusions: Efforts to promote switching from sunbeds to sunbed alternatives should target sunbed tanning addiction, knowledge of health risks, intentions to replace sunbed use, and beliefs about consequences from using sunbed alternatives. Understanding modifiable behavioural drivers can inform targeted strategies.",

          "authors": "Christopher Timmermann; Tommaso Barba; James Sanders; Stéphane Offort; John Dunne; David Erritzoe; Antoine Lutz",
          "abstract": "Meditation and psychedelics have separately been studied as powerful tools for probing consciousness through their capacity to deconstruct the sense of self. Yet, direct empirical comparisons remain scarce, particularly in expert meditators. Here, we report for the first time a case study in which an advanced meditator and Lama from the Mahāmudrā meditation tradition engaged in a traditional style of nondual meditation, placebo, and two doses of 5-MeO-DMT (5 mg and 12 mg), while high-density EEG (hdEEG), psychometric scales, and phenomenological interviews were collected in a controlled environment.\nThe nondual meditation practice employed and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT showed overlapping features, including timelessness, reduced labeling of sensory content, and reductions in the narrative self and thoughts. Both states were marked by increased alpha power and decreased gamma power, with cross-decoding confirming significant neural overlap driven by posterior and right frontal gamma reductions. At the same time, phenomenological and hdEEG profiles differed: nondual meditation uniquely emphasized the recognition of nonduality and clarity of mind, while low-dose 5-MeO-DMT was characterized by visual imagery. In contrast, high-dose 5-MeO-DMT produced a qualitatively distinct profile of sensory disconnection, seeing a ‘white-light’, and broad increases in gamma power.\nThese qualitative findings indicate that while self-dissolution in this style of non-dual meditation and 5-MeO-DMT overlap in certain respects, they also diverge along specific dimensions. The  hdEEG findings suggest that self-deconstruction and approximations to contentless awareness are associated with at least two distinct routes: a “saturation” route, characterized by increased neural firing (indexed by elevated gamma activity), and increased entropy, associated with experiences of spaciousness, white light, and sensory disconnection (high-dose 5-MeO); and a “subtractive” route, characterized by reduced neuronal firing, and decreased entropy, linked to drastic reductions in conceptual elaboration, and increased equanimity (nondual meditation and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT). The latter convergence points to low-dose psychedelics as a potential complement to meditative training, offering synergies that may expand both scientific understanding of consciousness and clinical applications. A promising avenue for testing this possibility would be for future studies to investigate non-dual meditation under low-dose 5-MeO-DMT.",

          "abstract": "When decisions are delegated to artificial intelligence (AI), human principals are more likely to implicitly request misconduct, and AI agents are more likely to comply more than human agents would. Across incentivized experiments recruiting human principals (N = 600) and three Large Language Models as AI agents, we confirm that these two mechanisms combine to generate substantial negative externalities, in the form of financial harm to a charity. In line with recent recommendations in AI ethics, we investigate the power of whistleblowers to contain these negative externalities. Whistleblowers are inside observers who are willing to incur personal costs to alert about unethical practices in their organizations. In an incentivized experimental set-up capturing the tensions and costs of whistleblowing (N = 300), we show that the more unethical the request from a human principal, the more likely a participant is to become a whistleblower---which means that more participants, on average, become whistleblowers under AI delegation, to the point where the negative externalities of AI delegation are entirely neutralized by the behaviour of whistleblowers. These findings support recent calls to institutionalize protective mechanisms for whistleblowers within the AI sector.",

Stillness Meditation participants were found to have acquired the basic skill of doing nothing in the 15 min session. They typically reported the session was calm, pleasant, and easy, and their mean interbeat interval and heart-rate variability significantly increased relative to pre-session baseline. Scores for our primary measure of self-reported calm were significantly higher in the Focused Attention condition than for Stillness Meditation and Audiobook, but there were no significant differences for easiness, pleasantness, or the cardiac measures. The findings validate our Stillness Meditation protocol and provide evidence that skilful doing nothing is calming, pleasant, and easy — not aversive.

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) has been proposed to act as a gateway into long-term memory (LTM), such that only information successfully stored in WM can be transferred into LTM. Accordingly, the capacity limit of WM should constrain the acquisition of LTM traces. Evidence for that prediction is mixed: Some studies showed that increasing WM load translated into weaker LTM of the memorized information. Others found no effect of WM load on LTM learning. Here we present the results of three experiments that comprehensively test the gateway hypothesis. All experiments included a WM test and a delayed LTM test for the same information. WM set size was varied from 2 to 8 or 10 items. Further, we varied the type of materials (verbal or visual), whether the task requires memory for items or bindings, and the type of test (recognition vs. recall). The WM set size influenced performance in the LTM test only when two conditions were met: (1) The WM task involved tests of item memory through old-new recognition with concrete objects or words, and (2) LTM was tested for items not tested in the WM test. Yet even these effects were not found consistently across all experiments. This Registered Report indicates that increasing WM load rarely impairs LTM encoding, implying that WM capacity does not act as a bottleneck to the formation of memory traces in LTM under most conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Long waiting times remain a key barrier to accessing outpatient mental health care in the Netherlands and worldwide. Little is known about patterns of symptom change during waiting times and whether certain individuals are at greater risk of deterioration. This brief report used routine outcome monitoring data from Dutch outpatient clinics to examine changes in psychological distress during waiting and to test whether age, sex, socioeconomic status, and length of waiting predicted improvement or worsening. Methods: Routine outcome monitoring data were analyzed from 962 individuals referred by their general practitioner to a large Dutch outpatient mental health provider. Psychological distress was assessed with the Symptom-Questionnaire-48 (SQ-48), which participants completed at both referral and intake. We computed reliable Change Indices (RCI) to classify individuals as improved, deteriorated, or unchanged. Logistic and  multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the effects of waiting time, socioeconomic status, age, and sex on change status during waiting times. Results: Mean SQ-48 scores decreased significantly between referral and intake, but changes were not clinically meaningful. Most patients (92.02%) showed no reliable change; 6.03% deteriorated, and 1.35% improved. Waiting time, sex, age, and socioeconomic status did not predict symptom change during waiting time. Limitations include the relatively short average waiting time (M = 18.90 days), limited variability in socioeconomic status, and potential systematic dropout. Conclusions: Most individuals remained stable, with only small proportions showing reliable improvement or deterioration during short waiting times. These findings highlight the need for precision-based approaches to identify those at risk of worsening.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the crosslinguistic distribution of intrinsic vowel duration, the observation that high vowels tend to be shorter than low vowels, using a large-scale corpus phonetic approach. Previous studies have reported a durational difference but have been limited by small speaker samples and narrow language coverage. Nevertheless, this observation has been debated to reflect an automatic consequence of the vowel height difference, or to be under speaker control. We reconsider this dichotomy in terms of competing pressures of target uniformity and enhancement in phonetic realization. Target uniformity would be consistent with a systematically shorter duration for high than low vowels and no systematic asymmetry between front and back vowels. In contrast, enhancement would predict larger, more variable durational differences between high and low vowels. To address the empirical gap, we analyzed duration contrasts among /i/, /u/, and /a/ in inter-obstruent contexts from over 60 languages, 80 language–length contrasts, and 16 language families in the VoxCommunis Corpus using automatic and manual vowel segmentations. Linear mixed-effects models assessed duration differences across vowel height and backness, incorporating rate-normalized and raw measures, while by-speaker analyses probed individual consistency. High vowels were shorter than low vowels in approximately 90% of language contrasts and significantly so for almost 80%. Crucially, no consistent durational bias emerged between high front and high back vowels. These findings suggest that intrinsic vowel duration is better understood as a statistical universal emerging from the balance between uniformity and enhancement in phonetic realization, rather than as a purely automatic universal.",

We used (generalized) linear mixed-effects models to test the effects of the BI and the mindset on khat use outcomes, controlling for covariates (e.g. comorbid psychopathology and motivation to stop khat use).\nThe results revealed a general decrease in the amount and frequency of khat use in the two weeks after the intervention, with the BI group showing a significant greater reduction in frequency than CG. No significant effects emerged regarding the mindset induction. We found khat use affected by psychopathological symptom load and motivation to change khat use. \nThe findings indicate that the adapted ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention can be promising in reducing khat use. More research is needed to enhance the effectiveness of khat-reducing brief interventions.",

          "abstract": "Metaphors are frequently used during communication, offering insight into creativity and cognition through figurative language. In bilingual individuals, metaphor production is influenced by language proficiency and cultural context. However, there is no psychometrically validated test measuring metaphor production ability beyond English. This study develops a tool to assess bilingual metaphor production using simple prompts (e.g., “The small dog is...”) that require original metaphors (e.g., “a tiny tornado”). Using automatic item generation with GPT-4, we generated 100 metaphor prompts, evenly split between English and Spanish. A sample of 160 Spanish-English bilinguals on Prolific provided responses. To evaluate metaphor originality, 100 Spanish-English bilingual raters scored responses using a planned missing data design. We applied a graded response model (GRM) to compute factor scores for each item and person, yielding sufficient rater agreement and measurement precision across both languages (Factor Determinacy Index = .77, ranging from .58 to .87). To further develop the assessment tool, additional factor analysis identified the most effective items, forming a short test of 10 items per language. This research provides a foundation for developing reliable and valid assessments of bilingual metaphor production, advancing the understanding of creative language use in multilingual populations and supporting linguistic assessment applications.",

          "authors": "Miranda Chang; Bryan Hong; Morgan Barense",
          "abstract": "In memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, recent autobiographical memories are disproportionately vulnerable to loss, yet most traditional reminiscence therapies focus on remote past events. We present a case study examining whether a digital reminiscence intervention designed to support memory for recent experiences can improve episodic recall and psychosocial outcomes in neurodegenerative memory impairment. G.F., a 79-year-old man with early-stage dementia, completed an 11-week personalized intervention using HippoCamera, a neuroscience-based smartphone application that helps users generate and review multimodal memory cues from everyday events. Events that G.F. reviewed using HippoCamera were recalled with greater episodic detail than events that were recorded but not reviewed. Post-intervention, G.F. reported improvements in quality of life, life satisfaction, self-concept, and perceived episodic and spatial memory abilities, along with reduced depressive symptoms. Qualitative feedback revealed that the intervention helped G.F. regain confidence, re-engage socially, and feel more optimistic about the future. These findings suggest that digital interventions targeting memory for recent experiences—a domain often overlooked in traditional reminiscence therapy—may provide benefits to cognition and well-being in the early stages of dementia. This work highlights the promise of HippoCamera as an accessible, neuroscience-informed tool to support memory and well-being in those experiencing memory loss.",

          "abstract": "Research on relatively simple forms of visual perception with limited emotional content has dominated the empirical and theoretical efforts to identify the neural basis of consciousness. In contrast, research on auditory affective experiences like misophonia, autonomous sensory meridian responses (ASMR), and musical chills promises to broaden our understanding of consciousness and challenge existing theories to accommodate a wider range of phenomena. Most notably, these experiences are driven primarily by meaningful environmental sounds but are often shaped by input from other modalities, including vision, touch, and interoception. This perspective highlights how subjective experiences may arise from interactions between sensory cortical pathways, bodily signals, and wider cortical networks implicated in emotion, interoception, and salience processing. Prior studies on misophonia, ASMR, and musical chills have indeed implicated the anterior insula, anterior cingulate, amygdala, striatum, secondary auditory cortex, and premotor cortex. These activity patterns are consistent with several mechanistic theories that explain auditory emotional experience, some of which may generalize across auditory affective phenomena, while others appear more specific to a smaller subset of them. Here, we review and synthesize findings and theoretical explanations from this growing area of research, and propose future directions aimed at identifying the commonalities and differences in mechanisms underlying auditory affective experiences.",

          "abstract": "Meditation and psychedelics have separately been studied as powerful tools for probing consciousness through their capacity to deconstruct the sense of self. Yet, direct empirical comparisons remain scarce, particularly in expert meditators. Here, we report for the first time a case study in which an advanced meditator and Lama from the Mahāmudrā meditation tradition engaged in a traditional style of nondual meditation, placebo, and two doses of 5-MeO-DMT (5 mg and 12 mg), while high-density EEG (hdEEG), psychometric scales, and phenomenological interviews were collected in a controlled environment.\nThe nondual meditation practice employed and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT showed overlapping features, including timelessness, reduced labeling of sensory content, and reductions in the narrative self and thoughts. Both states were marked by increased alpha power and decreased gamma power, with cross-decoding confirming significant neural overlap driven by posterior and right frontal gamma reductions. At the same time, phenomenological and hdEEG profiles differed: nondual meditation uniquely emphasized the recognition of nonduality and clarity of mind, while low-dose 5-MeO-DMT was characterized by visual imagery. In contrast, high-dose 5-MeO-DMT produced a qualitatively distinct profile of sensory disconnection, seeing a ‘white-light’, and broad increases in gamma power.\nThese qualitative findings indicate that while self-dissolution in this style of non-dual meditation and 5-MeO-DMT overlap in certain respects, they also diverge along specific dimensions. The  hdEEG findings suggest that self-deconstruction and approximations to contentless awareness are associated with at least two distinct routes: a “saturation” route, characterized by increased neural firing (indexed by elevated gamma activity), and increased entropy, associated with experiences of spaciousness, white light, and sensory disconnection (high-dose 5-MeO); and a “subtractive” route, characterized by reduced neuronal firing, and decreased entropy, linked to drastic reductions in conceptual elaboration, and increased equanimity (nondual meditation and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT). The latter convergence points to low-dose psychedelics as a potential complement to meditative training, offering synergies that may expand both scientific understanding of consciousness and clinical applications. A promising avenue for testing this possibility would be for future studies to investigate non-dual meditation under low-dose 5-MeO-DMT.",

          "abstract": "Narrative tasks externalize language and social cognition providing a powerful window in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This systematic review synthesizes previous research on the effects of ASD on narrative microstructure (i.e., lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, morphosyntactic accuracy, productivity) and macrostructure (i.e., story grammar/episodic structure, causal and temporal cohesion, mental-state language, referential clarity in individuals with ASD. To address this aim, a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Records were screened in Covidence by two independent reviewers and data was extracted using standardized procedures, and appraised risk of bias. Across studies and languages, children with ASD typically were found to produce narratives that are shorter, lexically less diverse, and syntactically simpler than those of typically developing (TD) peers; morphosyntactic accuracy is comparatively mixed and often relatively preserved. At the macrostructural level, children with ASD include fewer complete story grammar elements, show weaker causal/temporal linking, use sparser mental-state vocabulary, and display greater referential ambiguity. Variability in outcomes is explained partly by moderators such as age and cognitive level, language experience (mono-/bilingual status), elicitation demands, and analytic indices. Narrative difficulties in ASD arise primarily from discourse planning and socio-cognitive impairment, with local linguistic form though being relatively more preserved. The field would benefit from longitudinal and intervention studies using harmonized narrative measures to assess causal links between social cognition, and multimodal computational studies with executive control measures, and narrative growth.",

          "abstract": "Stimuli that reliably predict reward can increase their capacity to capture attention. This Value‑Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) is typically viewed as independent of task goals or physical salience, arising from Pavlovian learning. However, recent evidence suggests that the awareness of the stimulus‑reward contingency may be necessary during the acquisition of such attentional biases, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. One possibility is that awareness mediates the learning process of VMAC by directing selective attention toward the reward-predictive feature. The present preregistered study tested whether reward‑related attentional biases arise primarily from such selective attention, independently of awareness. Participants performed a visual search task in which one of two singleton distractors—one predicting high reward, the other low reward—appeared on a subset of trials. Selective attention to the reward‑predictive feature (i.e., distractor color) was manipulated between groups: In some trials, one group reported the reward-predictive distractor’s color, while the other group reported an irrelevant, non-reward predictive feature (its location). Otherwise, the stimulus–reward contingencies remained identical for both groups. The typical VMAC effect, as measured by slower response times for the high‑value compared to the low‑value distractor, emerged only in the group that attended to the color. Critically, the previous result cannot be explained by individual differences in awareness. These findings demonstrate a causal role of selective attention in the acquisition of reward-related attentional biases.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is one of our most archaic senses but its central mechanisms are lesser known than those of other senses. In this work, we address a possible link between olfactory stimuli and mental spatial representations. Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction. These results call for replications with an approach that factors in potential sources of individual differences.",

Parenting is a key risk factor, yet prior research often focuses narrowly on single behaviors, overlooking how broader patterns of parenting that consider multiple behaviors (i.e., involvement, warmth, inconsistency, monitoring, and punishment) interact with parent/family characteristics to predict internalizing and externalizing. \nMethods\nUsing data from the ABCD Study, we conducted latent profile analysis (LPA) using six parenting behaviors (involvement, positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, poor monitoring and supervision, corporal punishment, other punishment) to identify broad parenting patterns. Logistic regression models tested differences between profiles by parent/family characteristics. Linear regression models predicted youth internalizing and externalizing from parenting profile, parent psychopathology, and family characteristics across late childhood and early adolescence. \nResults\nLPA identified three parenting profiles (entropy 0.956-0.994).

          "abstract": "How can one bring wisdom into STEM education? One popular position holds that wise judgment follows from teaching morals and ethics in STEM. However, wisdom scholars debate the causal role of morality and whether presence of apriori moral dispositions is a necessary condition for cultivating and expressing wisdom. Some philosophers, education practitioners and behavioral scientists champion this view, whereas social psychologists and cognitive scientists argue that moral features like prosocial behavior are reinforcing factors or outcomes of wise judgment rather than pre-requisites. This debate matters particularly for science and technology, where wisdom-demanding decisions typically involve incommensurable values and radical uncertainty. Here, we evaluate these competing positions through four lines of evidence. First, empirical research shows that heightened moralization aligns with foolish rejection of scientific claims, political polarization, and value extremism. Second, scholarship on repeated economic games (Folk Theorem) suggests that wisdom-related metacognition—perspective-integration, context-sensitivity, and balancing long- and short-term goals—can give rise to prosocial behavior without an apriori moral blueprint. Third, in real life, moral values often compete, making metacognition indispensable to balance competing interests for the common good. Fourth, numerous scientific tasks require wise handling of ill-defined challenges, without a clear role of morals for such tasks. We address potential objections about immoral and Machiavellian applications of blueprint-free wisdom accounts. Finally, we explore implications for giftedness: what exceptional wisdom looks like in STEM context, and how to train it in the classroom via self-reflection exercises and exercises that highlight one’s knowledge gaps.",

Traditional measures using vignettes or static images often lack ecological validity, whereas video-based tasks provide a more naturalistic approach. This scoping review maps video-based measures of social inference in adults over the past 30 years. \nMethods: A systematic search in PsycInfo, PubMed, and SocIndex identified 5057 records, with 421 meeting inclusion criteria. We extracted details on test and stimuli characteristics, populations studies, and video features. \nResults: A total of 189 tests were identified: 33% assessed theory of mind, 25% social judgment, 20% deception, 12% irony/sarcasm, and 7% pragmatics. Most were in English or European languages, with videos typically featuring speaking actors (77%) and over half showing real interactions. Commonly used tests included the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition, Awareness of Social Inference Test, Interpersonal Perception Task, and EmpaToM. Thirteen stimuli banks were identified, mainly covering theory of mind, deception, and social judgment, with limited linguistic diversity. Psychiatric populations, particularly schizophrenia, were most studied, while neurodegenerative disorders were underrepresented. \nConclusion: The breadth of tools demonstrates strong innovation in task design and offers a practical resource for researchers and clinicians. However, validation remains limited, stimuli banks are scarce, and key populations such as older adults and patients with neurodegenerative disorders are underrepresented. Future work should focus on strengthening existing tools, expanding accessibility, and linking assessments more closely to clinical and real-world social functioning.",

This effect tends to be less pronounced or even reversed when immediate tests are employed instead of delayed tests. The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of this effect by varying the complexity within the same specific knowledge domain. Consequently, a quantitative investigation was developed with a sample of 310 students from an elementary school in the city of Santa Isabel, Ecuador. The sample included 171 females and 139 males, with an average age between 9 and 12 years, and a factorial design was implemented with the variables of task sequence (example-example vs. example-problem), element interactivity (i.e., high vs. low), and test timing (i.e., immediate vs. delayed). The results indicated that performance in both immediate and delayed tests is superior in tasks with a low level of element interactivity compared to tasks with high element interactivity. It was also found that example-problem tasks are better than example-example tasks in the delayed test. It is concluded that the relationship between element interactivity and the testing effect is not entirely clear, and it is suggested that the design of learning tasks should impose cognitive load within the limits of working memory.",

While predictive mechanisms are central in theory, empirical studies often rely on simplified tasks that overlook the sensory, motor, and social complexity of real-world interaction. We introduce a quantitative framework that integrates multimodal tracking of eye and body movements and heart rate with machine learning and Bayesian models to identify predictors of coordination in a fast-paced ball-hitting task. Coordination success depended primarily on similarity in partners’ predictive styles rather than on general anticipatory ability. Well-coordinated pairs showed similar anticipatory saccades in individual tasks, enabling more efficient prediction of self and partner actions during joint tasks. By contrast, demographic variables, overall physiology, motor activity, and self-assessments were minimally linked to success. By reverse-engineering behavioral signatures, our framework identifies alignment in action anticipation as a key mechanism of coordination in both human–human and human–robot interaction.",

          "authors": "Violetta Vysevkova; Dominika Rabinska; Jason Thomas; Claire Farrow; James Reynolds",
          "abstract": "Objective: In democratic societies, public opinion influences government policy. The urgency of global climate action highlights the importance of understanding public support towards environmental policies. The Value-Belief-Norm theory offers a model for understanding psychological processes underlying pro-environmental policy support. This study aims to evaluate the Value-Belief-Norm theory as an explanatory model of policy support. Method: We searched Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and three registries. We included 23 cross-sectional survey studies testing the Value-Belief-Norm model to explain support for environmental public policies, nine of which were eligible for random-effects meta-analysis of correlations. Results: Model-explained variance in policy support ranged from 2% to 72%, with substantial variation in the Value-Belief-Norm theory application across studies. Policy support was positively associated with Ascription of responsibility (r = .39, p &lt; .001), Awareness of consequences (r = .37, p &lt; .001), Pro-environmental personal norms (r = .36, p &lt; .001), Ecological worldview (r = .28, p &lt; .001) and Altruistic values (r = .13, p &lt; .01). The strongest correlations were between policy support and policy-specific beliefs, specifically Perceived fairness (r = .77, p &lt; .001) and Perceived effectiveness (r = .59, p &lt; .001), which are not part of the Value-Belief-Norm theory. Conclusions: The Value-Belief-Norm theory performs adequately at explaining public support for environmental policies but it does not include beliefs about policy fairness and effectiveness, which are the main reasons why the public support and oppose environmental policies.",

          "abstract": "Creativity depends on the rapid generation of novel associations and the equally rapid evaluation of their usefulness; yet, prevailing dual-process theories treat these operations as sequential and largely independent. We propose System 3, an integrative cognitive architecture in which intuition-dominated search and analysis-dominated checking are locked into a fast, self-regulating micro-cycle that we call transformative metathought. The model is specified by three behavioral indices—associative-distance density, analytic-verification ratio, and convergence latency—and mapped onto a neural motif in which Default Mode Network (DMN) activity alternates with Central Executive Network (CEN) activity on a sub-second timescale. A review of recent fMRI, EEG, and causal stimulation studies shows that (i) DMN–CEN coupling increases with idea originality, (ii) rapid network switching predicts insight accuracy, and (iii) dual site neuromodulation that balances the two networks boosts creative output without loss of practicality. System 3 also reframes cognitive biases as scalable heuristics that expand the search space when monitored by metacognitive confidence signals, and positions dopamine and serotonin as chemical gain controls on the generate–evaluate loop. Practical applications range from AI assisted ideation and precision neurofeedback to cautious exploration of pharmacological and genetic levers. An ethical framework is proposed to safeguard psychological integrity, authenticity, and equity as such interventions mature. Finally, developmental data suggest that the generative component matures early in adolescence, whereas evaluative gating and full-loop metacognition continue to develop into adulthood, inviting longitudinal tests of the model. System 3 thus offers a falsifiable, multi-level account of creative cognition and a scaffold for responsible enhancement technologies.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. The Shift-of-Strategy (SoS) approach aims to obtain concealed information from semi-cooperative suspects by prompting them to shift toward more forthcoming counter-interrogation strategies. While previous studies on the approach have shown promising results, important questions remain about its practical application. This paper reports three studies addressing these gaps. Aim. Study 1 tested two SoS variations designed to maintain suspects’ engagement and motivation to appear credible during interviews. Study 2 examined the approach in a repeated-interview context simulating an evolving investigation. Study 3 compared the approach’s effects on disclosures from innocent and guilty suspects. Methods. Within each study, participants completed a mock crime procedure and were thereafter interviewed as mock suspects. Following the interview, participants provided assessments of their experiences of being interviewed. Results. Study I suggest that the SoS approach’s efficacy is robust to procedural variation though the tactics aimed at maintaining suspect motivation did not provide additional benefits over the standard SoS approach. Study 2 revealed an important boundary condition; the approach’s effectiveness was limited when initial evidence was scarce. Study 3 demonstrated that innocent suspects were forthcoming regardless of their assigned interviewing condition, whereas guilty suspects disclosed more previously unknown information under SoS. Conclusion. The findings demonstrate that the SoS approach is robust to variation, however its efficacy is not maintained when evidence is sparse. Importantly, the approach does not appear to disadvantage innocent suspects. Together, the studies refine the understanding of how the SoS approach should be deployed for use in investigative practice.",

          "abstract": "Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent mental health issue in childhood with long-term negative consequences. As primary gatekeepers to professional help and treatment, parents play a crucial role in identifying and responding to children’s SAD symptoms. The threshold hypothesis posits that cultural socialization norms influence how parents evaluate SAD symptoms by shaping expectations for child behaviors. However, recent work suggests that stigma could explain cross-cultural differences in such parental evaluations. This study used an experimental vignette design to examine the role of cultural norms and stigma in shaping parental responses to SAD in China and Germany. A total of 295 parents of children aged 7 to 13 participated. The experimental manipulation of norm salience did not pass the manipulation check or affect parental evaluations. Perceived seriousness of SAD symptoms did not differ between the two groups. However, Chinese parents reported higher levels of help-seeking intentions, parental distress, and more shame in response to SAD symptoms, despite perceiving symptom severity similarly to German parents. These findings suggest that while cognitive appraisals of SAD symptoms may be similar across cultures, behavioral and emotional responses differ. Stigma-related distress appears to drive cultural differences in help-seeking, challenging the threshold hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Social identity profoundly shapes whom people choose as information sources, constraining exposure to diverse perspectives. While people are motivated to seek accurate information, they systematically avoid outgroup sources even when group membership is irrelevant to the task at hand.  Here we investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can circumvent these identity-driven biases in source selection. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1,054) preferred AI over human sources when seeking information about political conflicts. In Study 2 (n = 284), an incentivized political fact-checking experiment revealed that participants preferred AI sources over outgroup (d = 0.470) and even ingroup (d = 0.230) partisan sources, despite recognizing their equal competence level. In Study 3 (n = 277), using an identity-irrelevant shape categorization task, participants only preferred AI over outgroup sources (d = 0.191), with no difference between AI and ingroup sources. Computational modeling revealed that these preferences emerge through dual processes: participants initially favored human sources but subsequently accumulated evidence against partisan advisors during deliberation. These findings suggest that AI's perceived neutrality enables it to bypass identity-based discrimination. These results highlight the potential of AI to reduce echo chambers and broaden epistemic exposure by serving as an identity-neutral conduit for information acquisition.",

Neglecting one’s interests, desires, and duties in favor of others arguably goes along with a manifold of psychological consequences for individuals high in people pleasing. In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 1,323), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from facets of agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. Outlooks for future applications and further validation endeavors are outlined.",

Based on propensity score matching and a variety of control group sample specifications it is found that CARA significantly reduces recidivism and that for every £1 spent on CARA there is an economic benefit of £3.31 and £11.03 respectively for the two police force areas, annually, in 2024 prices. Extrapolating these findings to England and Wales, the intervention's yearly cost would be £2,176,438 while the savings, or net economic benefit, would be £18,372,615.

While the majority of this research has focused on speech children hear from adults, children around the world do not exclusively interact with adults. Instead, children regularly interact with other children, whether in the home or in early childhood education settings. Here, I contextualize the frequency of interactions with speech from other children. I then highlight properties of speech from children, such as its acoustic signature and content, that might make it particularly relevant for early language learning. Lastly, I discuss how considering speech from children allows us to create theories that are inclusive of societies around the world, where caretaking often involves more children and in lower-SES settings, where higher birthrates are common. I conclude that theories of language development should consider speech from other children as an important component.",

Whereas laboratory studies investigating this association found consistent evidence, experience sampling (ESM) studies yielded mixed results. In this ESM study, we investigated the effect of emotional intensity on the choice of disengagement (e.g., distraction) or engagement strategies (e.g., reappraisal) and their success in attenuating unpleasant emotions. Between 2020 and 2021, we collected ESM dyadic data from couples in a community sample of 183 participants over 28 days, with three prompts per day. Multilevel modelling revealed that the choice of most of the disengagement strategies was not significantly predicted by the intensity of unpleasant emotions. The choice of the disengagement strategy “substance use” and most of the engagement strategies was associated with higher within-person emotional intensity. Acceptance was more likely to be chosen with lower within-person emotional intensities. Regarding ER success, the attenuation of unpleasant emotions through disengagement strategies did not vary by emotional intensity. However, engagement strategies attenuated unpleasant emotions more successfully in situations with lower within-person emotional intensities. Overall, results on ER choice mostly diverge from recent theories and previous laboratory studies, whereas findings on ER success align with theoretical outlines.",

          "abstract": "Background: Long waiting times remain a key barrier to accessing outpatient mental health care in the Netherlands and worldwide. Little is known about patterns of symptom change during waiting times and whether certain individuals are at greater risk of deterioration. This brief report used routine outcome monitoring data from Dutch outpatient clinics to examine changes in psychological distress during waiting and to test whether age, sex, socioeconomic status, and length of waiting predicted improvement or worsening. Methods: Routine outcome monitoring data were analyzed from 962 individuals referred by their general practitioner to a large Dutch outpatient mental health provider. Psychological distress was assessed with the Symptom-Questionnaire-48 (SQ-48), which participants completed at both referral and intake. We computed reliable Change Indices (RCI) to classify individuals as improved, deteriorated, or unchanged. Logistic and  multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the effects of waiting time, socioeconomic status, age, and sex on change status during waiting times. Results: Mean SQ-48 scores decreased significantly between referral and intake, but changes were not clinically meaningful. Most patients (92.02%) showed no reliable change; 6.03% deteriorated, and 1.35% improved. Waiting time, sex, age, and socioeconomic status did not predict symptom change during waiting time. Limitations include the relatively short average waiting time (M = 18.90 days), limited variability in socioeconomic status, and potential systematic dropout. Conclusions: Most individuals remained stable, with only small proportions showing reliable improvement or deterioration during short waiting times. These findings highlight the need for precision-based approaches to identify those at risk of worsening.",

To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model” proposes that ostracism threatens fundamental social needs that individuals spontaneously attempt to secure by seeking reaffiliation. Using the Cyberball Game, a computerized ball-tossing game used to study psychological responses to ostracism via game social inclusion vs. exclusion conditions, recent studies showed that attention to social signals was an accurate proxy of the reaffiliation needs, themselves derived from  the social exclusion feelings. Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attentional is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model”, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feelings. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, and that they likely depend on individual features.

We further examined the roles of social perception dimensions—warmth, competence, and moral character—and individual differences in social dominance orientation (SDO). Contrary to expectations, stereotype congruence did not influence credibility. As predicted, perceived moral character was the strongest predictor of credibility, highlighting the importance of trust-related traits in credibility assessments. Competence negatively predicted credibility, perhaps reflecting suspicion that capable applicants are deceptive, while warmth and SDO showed no association with credibility.

Objectively and subjectively speaking? 2) How do we perceive and understand these other minds? 3) How are other minds represented in the brain? 4) Is the perception of minds in other species or artificial agents not just mere anthropomorphism? 5) Is it important how the other looks? Does it matter if the other is human-like (e.g., robots) or cute (e.g., animals)? 6) Does it matter at all if you think an agent has a mind on how you view yourself and others? And finally, 7) where does it all end? What methods and techniques, perspectives or approaches does the field need to answer these and future questions? Together, the answers to these questions suggest that minds are grounded in sociality and people judge minds on the capacity to feel and think, with a distinct neural network supporting this. There is emerging evidence on the flexibility thereof in terms of activity to diverse minds and presence of this network across species. Mind perception and anthropomorphism are distinct at the conceptual, psychological, and neural level, and beliefs and other top-down effects are more important than just the visual appearance of an agent. Reports on threat to human identity, intergroup effects, as well impact on group dynamics, show that there are clear inter- and intrapersonal consequences of mind perception. Future research should focus on an interdisciplinary approach embracing different disciplines from comparative psychology to linguistics, employing a multi-method assessment of mind perception in interactive, embodied, everyday situations, capturing the inter- and intrapersonal consequences thereof, to provide further answers on these and other questions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cross-cultural mental health assessment faces significant methodological challenges when Western-derived instruments are applied in non-Western settings, potentially missing culturally salient features of psychological distress. This study examines whether locally developed instruments can complement Western tools in understanding adolescent mental health among Kenyan youth.\n\nMethods: We evaluated the psychometric properties and complementary utility of the Ndetei-Othieno-Kathuku (NOK) Scale (a locally developed tool in Kenya) alongside standard Western-derived instruments (PHQ-8 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety) in 2,906 Kenyan adolescents (M age = 15.97, SD=1.45; 57.0% Female) across 40 secondary schools. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, receiver operating characteristic curves, multidimensional scaling, and network analysis, we examined instrument psychometrics, overlap, and established clinically-elevated symptom thresholds. We also assessed the association of clinically-elevated symptoms with sociodemographic factors.\n\nResults: The NOK scales demonstrated poor-to-adequate internal consistency (NOK-Anxiety α = .78; NOK-Depression α = .61) with distinct factor structures from Western instruments. ROC-derived thresholds were 3.5 for depression and 6.5 for anxiety, with moderate diagnostic accuracy (AUC = .72-.77). Prevalence estimates were higher using NOK scales (45.91% depression, 32.11% anxiety) compared to Western instruments (27.28% depression, 21.95% anxiety). Multidimensional scaling revealed clear clustering by instrument origin, while network analysis showed NOK items demonstrated higher centrality, suggesting greater interconnectedness with other symptoms. Age, gender, perceived academic ability, family structure (living with both parents), and parental loss emerged as significant factors associated with clinically-elevated symptoms.\n\nConclusions: Complementary use of locally-developed and Western-derived instruments can provide an enhanced understanding of adolescent mental health in diverse contexts. This \"both-and\" approach captures culturally specific expressions of distress while maintaining cross-cultural comparability, supporting more comprehensive and culturally responsive assessment practices.",

          "abstract": "Preterm birth remains a global health challenge with significant implications for neonatal outcomes and parental mental health. This paper explores the complex psychological experiences and intrapersonal processes of parents after preterm birth, highlighting their heightened risk for mental health difficulties such as postpartum depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Existing mental health interventions are medicalised, primarily focusing on infant care. As a result, there is currently a lack of emotionally-focused interventions aimed at supporting parents after preterm birth. The current conceptual review proposes a compassion-focused framework to address the unique challenges faced by these parents. The paper aims to: 1) examine common experiences of parents after preterm birth, 2) explore the complex psychological processes that underpin these experiences, 3) present theoretical models that can be applied to understand parent’s psychological responses, 4) critically review existing interventions aimed at supporting parent mental health following preterm birth, 5) introduce a compassion-focused approach as a novel framework for support, 6) review existing compassion-based interventions aimed at perinatal populations, and 7) outline directions for future research. By integrating a compassion-focused approach, this paper aims to provide actionable insights to support parents’ mental health following preterm birth.",

          "authors": "Oliver Tab Bellmann; Marisa Hoeschele; Melina Witt; Rie Asano",
          "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the origins of language and music are rooted in a common precursor. A common origin is likely if there are shared features, functions, and acoustic correlates, which can be studied by comparing across domains and species. One feature central to music, speech, and animal communication is timbre. Timbre depends on characteristics of the frequency spectrum and is used both to recognize individuals and to convey emotions in speech and mammalian vocal communication. However, to date, no work has been directly comparing timbre usage in music to the other two systems. The central question of this manuscript is therefore, whether similar functions of timbre are present in music relative to speech and mammalian vocal communication, and whether these functions are implemented by similar acoustic correlates. A review was conducted to investigate the functions of timbre and its underlying acoustic features in music. The results show that timbre in music conveys both emotion and identity relying on similar acoustical features as in speech and other mammalian vocal communication. This common function of timbre and the similar implementation across different communication systems suggests a common origin of music and language, likely broadly shared throughout mammalian communication.",

          "abstract": "Classical musicians’ individual practice time is central to their musical life and development, yet little research has examined the cognitive and affective processes that influence its effectiveness. This study investigates boredom, mind-wandering and flow during classical music practice, both on the trait and state level (i.e., during practice in general as well as during a specific session) as experiences associated with practice effectiveness. Classical musicians (N=105) completed two 20-minute practice sessions and filled out questionnaires beforehand, between sessions, and after the second session. Boredom emerged as a clear negative correlate for all performance outcomes: Trait boredom during practice was negatively associated with performance satisfaction, while state boredom was negatively related to both efficacy and creativity in a specific practice session. No significant associations were found between trait or state mind-wandering during practice and any outcome variables. Flow during practice, on the other hand, was positively associated with both efficacy and creativity. These findings suggest that while boredom is robustly linked to poorer outcomes and flow to better outcomes in classical music practice, the same is not true for mind-wandering. A possible explanation may lie in heterogeneous nature of mind-wandering and the relative freedom of practice. Given that boredom was consistently associated with less effective, less creative practice and lower performance satisfaction, whereas flow states were linked to more effective practice and higher creativity, future experimental or intervention-based studies should be developed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which cognitive and affective states influence musicians’ practice.",

However, the literatures examining these forces have proceeded separately, emphasizing either endogenous regulation or exogenous value signals such as reward prediction errors. This separation obscures a convergent account in which both influences jointly shape momentary affect. We address this gap by applying sparse equation discovery (SINDy) to a large happiness dataset from a gambling task (N = 16,337) and introduce DynAffect-C, a unified model that separates and quantifies endogenous and exogenous inertia. DynAffect-C recovers known value-signaling effects and, with regulatory baseline-attraction terms, explains substantially more moment-to-moment variation than value-only models. The model reveals nonlinear pull toward baseline affect, alternating mood states in a subset of participants, and a trade-off between stronger internal momentum and transient impacts of external events. The result integrates two literatures and yields a unified theory and testable equation for affect.",

          "abstract": "Music psychology researchers have long been interested in how emotions are expressed in music. Increasingly, researchers employ computationally derived measures of emotion (e.g., valence and arousal) from services such as Spotify. These measures are easy to use, but how they are calculated is not transparent. It is not clear whether these computational measures reflect how people rate perceived emotions in music. Addressing this, our study investigated the validity of Spotify’s automated ratings with subjective ratings from actual listeners. Participants were recruited from first-year university student cohorts and the general public (N = 244). Participants listened to 40 song excerpts, approximately 20-30 seconds in length, and rated tracks on their perception of its mood (valence), energy (arousal), danceability, familiarity, and enjoyment. Participant ratings were compared with Spotify’s automated ratings. We found that Spotify audio features energy and valence were positively associated with human ratings for these factors, with a strong relationship for arousal, and moderate relationship for valence. Spotify danceability, however, was not strongly associated with human ratings of danceability. These findings corroborate the utility of the widely used circumplex model for measuring emotions concisely. We further extend this by validating automated emotion ratings, such as those implemented by Spotify’s system, for use in music psychology, and highlight that if used cautiously, this is a useful tool in research.",

Overall, young people perceived workshops to have a positive impact on their mental health and helped provide support in coping with the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nConclusions\nStudy findings highlight the potential benefits and barriers to entry of mental health and life-skill workshops for young people from minority ethnic communities.\n\nClinical Applications\nCommunity-based and co-produced workshops were perceived as beneficial to mental health by BAME young people, warranting greater consideration and implementation in practice.\n\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC\n•\tBlack, Asian, Minority Ethnic (BAME) young people have experienced difficulties during the pandemic and would benefit from mental health support. \n\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\n•\tWhile the efficacy of co-created and community-based workshops are known, little research has demonstrated if this method resonates with BAME young people as a way to cope with the psychological impact of the pandemic. \n\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n•\tFuture research and policy should prioritise continued collaboration with young people from BAME communities, a population that is often not represented in the literature and poorly understood in terms of their support needs. This study recognises the value of community-based co-produced workshops by young people from BAME communities and believe more support in this format is needed for this group.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Speech perception continues to develop throughout school age and plays a fundamental role in language and reading development. Recent findings in English-speaking children suggest that speech categorization consistency—the stability of a listener’s percept across multiple encounters with a speech sound—predicts both language and reading abilities, with a particularly strong link between reading skills and vowel perception. One hypothesis is that this is due to complex grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs) in English vowels. The present study tested (1) whether the relationship between categorization consistency and language/reading abilities extends to typologically different languages and (2) whether the vowel-specific link observed in English is shaped by GPC complexity, using data from Korean, a language with relatively transparent GPC mappings.\n\nMethod: Forty-four 1st-grade Korean-speaking children completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, in which they heard tokens from a speech continuum and rated the correspondence between the stimulus and each word on a continuous scale. Standardized assessments of language and word reading were also conducted. \n\nResults: Children with poorer language/reading abilities exhibited lower categorization consistency, which is consistent with the findings from English-speaking children. In contrast to prior findings, however, this relationship was not specific to vowel perception but was held across all contrast types tested. Categorization gradiency (slope of the categorization function) was not significantly associated with any outcome. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend prior work by demonstrating that categorization consistency predicts language and reading abilities, even in a language with transparent GPCs. Importantly, this association was observed across all phonemic contrasts, not just vowels—suggesting that the previously observed vowel-specific link in English may stem from the greater GPC complexity of English vowels. Together, while categorization consistency appears to be a critical predictor of linguistic outcome, the specific pattern may vary across languages depending on the structure of their GPCs.",

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

Human moderators have limitations like limited capacity that can potentially be addressed by AI moderators. However, in order for AI to be effective as a moderator, we need to understand how people perceive an AI moderator compared to a human moderator. We report two experiments (N = 698) that showed a human or AI moderating misinformation in online groups, varying the moderator's arguments and the group's size. In Experiment~1, AI was seen as less effective when it used harm-based arguments to refute misinformation; however, this gap disappeared a year later in Experiment~2, perhaps as attitudes towards AI shifted. Perceptions of AI moderator effectiveness were unaffected by the moderated group's size. We suggest that there may be growing acceptance of AI as content moderators in online groups, and highlight some of the potential challenges their use may raise.",

In this model, respondents allocate time across items to maximize expected performance subject to a fixed time budget, so response time and accuracy are determined jointly and endogenously. The framework captures the time–accuracy trade-off within and across items and naturally yields the inverted U-shaped relation between time and accuracy observed in data. Using TIMSS data, the model reproduces item-level response times in a low-stakes setting: agreement between observed and predicted times is reasonably high overall, higher for stronger performers, and lower for respondents who finish quickly. We also find evidence of systematic time misallocation and miscalibrated beliefs about item properties during the test. Overall, the model offers a practical tool for analyzing response time data and for understanding respondents' test-taking behavior and strategies.",

          "abstract": "Purpose. Research on workplace violence has predominantly focused on individual, organizational, and situational risk factors associated with employee victimization. However, limited attention has been paid to the interactional processes that shape workplace violence events despite microsociological theories and evidence underscoring the critical role of face-to-face interactions in conflict situations. This paper proposes a microsociological approach to better understand how workplace encounters escalate into acts of victimization. Methodology. To exemplify the value of a microsociological approach, we analyze body-worn camera footage of a work situation that escalates into aggression between a ticket inspector and a bus passenger without a valid ticket. Using qualitative process analysis, we examine how interactional dynamics involving status and emotions shape the step-by-step progression of this high-risk encounter. Findings. We demonstrate how the imposition of a fine transforms the inspector-passenger interaction into a status negotiation, with passenger aggression emerging in response to the inspector’s exercise of authority. Moreover, the inspector’s emotion management plays a key role in preventing the situation from escalating further into mutual displays of anger and aggression. This case illustrates how a micro-interactional analysis of risky work situations can reveal the mechanisms of violence and inform situational prevention strategies. Implications. We provide methodological and theoretical guidance for incorporating microsociological analysis into workplace violence research. Originality. This study demonstrates how a microsociological approach, grounded in a novel video-observational method, yields unique insights into the interactional dynamics that causally shape incidents of workplace violence.",

It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge.

We observed greater learning when children reported more curiosity. In whole-brain analyses, high-curiosity was associated with greater activation in inferior frontal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, the thalamus, and the putamen. Curiosity did not modulate activation in preregistered regions of interest (dorsal attention network, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens) but did modulate activation in an exploratory region of interest, the amygdala. Multivariate searchlight decoding revealed local activity patterns that reliably distinguished reported curiosity levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, and cerebellum. Together, these findings suggest that curiosity enhances engagement of language, visual, and attention-related regions during learning in children.",

          "abstract": "Autistic adults experience disproportionately high levels of loneliness, often influenced by social environments that are inaccessible or unaccommodating, rather than a lack of social interest. To address this, some individuals have turned to digital tools, such as companion chatbots, which simulate emotionally supportive conversations as an alternative means of connection. This article critically examines the role of chatbots in alleviating loneliness and promoting the well-being of autistic adults. Following a brief overview of chatbot companions’ technologies and current theories of loneliness dimensions, this argument examines whether these technologies truly provide meaningful support for autistic individuals. By analysing chatbots through the lens of methodologies frequently proposed to mitigate loneliness, the paper highlights the benefits of these technologies in conjunction with ethical considerations, emotional risks, and design limitations—particularly when grounded in normative assumptions regarding communication, loneliness, and relationships. It concludes that, although companion chatbots may function as temporary support for companionship, they must be developed in accordance with neurodivergence-affirming principles to effectively alleviate loneliness and avoid further isolation or dependence for autistic users.",

Using repeated occurrences of such inattentional deafness, alongside objective and subjective awareness probes, we measure the processing of supraliminal, but undetected words. In two pre-registered EEG experiments (N = 67), we show a unique, temporally late, neural response that differentiates words from pseudowords in the absence of conscious awareness. Additionally, an exploratory analysis found a behavioral interference of undetected words with visual task performance. Both results were contingent on the relevance of word detection to participants, implying that auditory non-conscious processing is not automatic but goal-dependent.

          "authors": "Masaru Shirasuna; Hidehito Honda; Rina Kagawa",
          "abstract": "In today’s world, humans collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) and often make judgments with the help of AI assistance in such contexts as medical diagnoses. Greater AI accuracy and trustworthiness is generally regarded as the goal of designing decision-support AI systems. However, highly accurate AI may not always provide optimal assistance. Rather, AI with bias, especially in the direction opposite to an individual’s bias, may improve the accuracy of individual judgment. This is because the AI’s bias will cancel out the individual’s bias (e.g., individuals’ overestimation bias is corrected by AI’s underestimation bias). In this study, we call such aggregation of human and AI biases resulting in a change of final judgment “bias interaction.” We investigated such interactions using a simple perceptual judgment task simulating medical judgments. First, a theoretical analysis using computer simulations showed that optimal AI assistance depended on individuals’ biases. Second, two behavioral experiments demonstrated that AI with biases in the direction opposite to participants’ biases tended to improve participants’ accuracy. However, participants tended to evaluate such AI as being less trustworthy. The theoretical and empirical results of our study raise questions about conventional beliefs that attribute superiority to more accurate and trustworthy AI. We also discuss the practical implications of designing AI to be a better collaborator.",

          "abstract": "Climate misinformation has been identified as a barrier to mitigative action. One prominent example occurred when the 2019/2020 “Black Summer” bushfires in Australia were blamed on arson. This claim is cognitively attractive because of its simplicity and was widely publicised at the time, but also thoroughly debunked. In two experiments, we examined the impact of a misleading article implicating arson as the primary cause of the Black Summer fires on Australian (Exp. 1, N = 509) and Canadian (Exp. 2, N = 506) participants’ reasoning, associated donation behaviour, and climate change attitudes. The misinformation significantly influenced reasoning about the Black Summer and future fires in both experiments; it also reduced the donations of Australian participants to a local climate organisation and impacted Canadian participants’ reasoning about a novel, conceptually related (but fictional) flooding event. Corrections were largely effective at mitigating misinformation impact. A bolstered correction that portrayed climate change as an important causal factor through its impact on risks and emphasised the multicausality of natural disasters was more effective than a simple correction that merely refuted the misinformation. Climate change attitudes were largely unaffected by the misinformation and interventions. Our findings demonstrate that event-specific climate misinformation can influence reasoning beyond a specific event, and that corrections are broadly useful for combatting its effects.",

This study investigates whether social connectedness can be improved by modulating inter-brain coupling, a neural correlate of successful social interactions, through neurofeedback. Using an inter-brain neurofeedback system (i.e., a multi-brain computer interface that provides real-time visualizations of inter-brain coupling between dyad members), we showed dyads real-time visualizations of the extent to which their brainwaves (electroencephalography signals) were “in sync”. Our results showed that, compared to a sham control group, who received feedback based on randomly generated signals, dyads receiving real multi-brain neurofeedback exhibited an increase in inter-brain coupling, and, critically, that this increase was associated with a higher sense of social connectedness. A chain mediation analysis suggested that this experience of enhanced social connectedness may have been driven by a sense of joint control and shared intentionality. Together, our findings demonstrate the potential of inter-brain neurofeedback to modulate inter-brain coupling and to support key components of social connectedness.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation plays a role in the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Most of the research in this area has focused on how people regulate their own emotions, a process called self-emotion regulation, or self ER. Self ER strategies are well-established predictors of PTSS. However, people also regulate their emotions with the help of others, a process called social emotion regulation, or social ER. Relative to self ER, social ER is understudied, and its associations with PTSS and self ER are unclear. Therefore, we examined the relationships between self ER, social ER, and PTSS using a network analysis. Adults with a history of direct trauma exposure (N = 1,061) reported on their use of four social ER strategies (soothing, social modeling, perspective taking, and enhancing positive affect), two self ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and PTSS. We identified ER nodes that had the greatest bridge expected influence (EI) centrality with PTSS. Expressive suppression (a self ER strategy) had the strongest bridge EI centrality in the network, followed by soothing and social modeling (two social ER strategies). Expressive suppression was also differentially associated with social ER strategies. Although longitudinal research is needed to establish the direction of effects, these findings underscore the importance of evaluating the roles of both self and social ER in the development and maintenance of PTSS.",

          "abstract": "Prototype and exemplar theories of categorization have been compared for decades. However, little research has examined why individuals adopt different approaches to categorization. The aim of the present studies was to investigate individual differences in prototype and exemplar categorization. Study 1 examined how global and local processing, autistic traits, and analytic-holistic cognition relate to category representations using Medin and Schaffer’s (1978) 5–4 categorization task. Participants completed the classification task, followed by a Navon task to assess attentional processing and self-report trait measures. Results showed that reaction times on the Navon task had some associations to categorization strategy, suggesting that global processing abilities may be related to category learning. Study 2 experimentally manipulated attentional focus by priming participants’ attention either globally or locally before completing the 5–4 categorization task. Although priming did not significantly influence strategy use, attention weight analyses revealed nuanced differences in how participants allocated attention to stimulus features. Specifically, participants who focused on the details, attended to less optimal stimulus features when classifying. These findings contribute to our understanding of individual differences in categorization and category learning and highlight the role of attentional focus in shaping category representations",

          "abstract": "AI chatbots have been shown to be successful tools for persuasion. However, people may prefer to use chatbots that validate, rather than challenge, their pre-existing beliefs. This preference for “sycophantic” (or overly agreeable and validating) chatbots may entrench beliefs and make it challenging to deploy AI systems that open people up to new perspectives. Across three experiments (n = 3,285) involving four political topics and four large language models, we found that people consistently preferred and chose to interact with sycophantic AI models over disagreeable chatbots that challenged their beliefs. Brief conversations with sycophantic chatbots increased attitude extremity and certainty, whereas disagreeable chatbots decreased attitude extremity and certainty. Sycophantic chatbots also inflated people’s perception that they are “better than average” on a number of desirable traits (e.g., intelligence, empathy). Furthermore, people viewed sycophantic chatbots as unbiased, but viewed disagreeable chatbots as highly biased. Sycophantic chatbots’ impact on attitude extremity and certainty was driven by a one-sided presentation of facts, whereas their impact on enjoyment was driven by validation. Altogether, these results suggest that people’s preference for and blindness to sycophantic AI may risk creating AI “echo chambers” that increase attitude extremity and overconfidence.",

Implanted BCIs can record signals directly from the brain and translate them to computer commands at high speed and fidelity, in a continuous manner. About 100 people worldwide have been implanted with a BCI, all in research settings, and this number is expected to rapidly increase as implanted BCIs become commercially available. Individuals with pediatric onset conditions represent a large proportion of the global burden of complex and severe disability, and will likely benefit significantly from such systems. Despite the progress that is being made in the development of safe, wireless, and highly effective implanted BCIs, none of these have been considered for persons with pediatric onset conditions. Here we present a summary of two years of cumulative effort in establishing a world-first roadmap toward implanted BCIs for youth with complex needs. This roadmap encompasses discussions and findings from multiple transdisciplinary engagement sessions, including the first International Virtual Summit on Implanted BCIs for Children with Complex Needs (February 2024), follow-up themed workgroup sessions (May 2024-March 2025), and a final in-person workshop held at the 11th International BCI Society Meeting (Banff, June 2025).

          "authors": "Paul Henne",
          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that people tend to use lexical causal statements (like X activated Y) to\nexpress a productive concept of causation—where one event causes another when the first event\nproduces the second—and periphrastic causal statements (like X caused Y to activate) to express\na counterfactual concept—where one event causes another when if the first had not happened,\nthe second would not have too. A critical test for this account comes from the action effect and its\nreversal: in conjunctive structures (X and Z cause Y), people tend to judge actions as more causal\nthan inactions, but in disjunctive structures (X or Z cause Y), people tend to judge actions as less\ncausal than inactions. Critically, productive concepts of causation have no explanation for the\nreverse action effect. So, if people use lexical and periphrastic causatives to express distinct\nconcepts of causation, they should show a reverse action effect for periphrastic but not for lexical\ncausal statements. If, however, people use counterfactual thinking when considering causal\nstatements generally, they should show a reverse action effect for lexical and periphrastic causal\nstatements. In Experiment 1, I replicated the action effect and its reversal with periphrastic causal\nstatements. In Experiment 2, I investigated whether the reverse action effect depends on\ncausative type, and I found the reverse action effect for lexical and periphrastic causal\nstatements. These findings suggest that counterfactual thinking affects causal judgment across\ncausative types, which is consistent with the view that people have a singular, counterfactual\nconcept of causation.",

By reinterpreting stranger/separation anxiety in infancy as the onset of territoriality and the in-group favoritism, we bring the seemingly distinct psychological behaviors into a unified framework that also sheds light on the evolutionary origin of the correlated traits. This interpretation predicts the existence of an evolved unified neural circuitry, starting around six months of age that is responsible for the exhibition of coevolved behaviors of stranger/separation anxiety, territoriality, and in-group favoritism throughout a human’s life.",

The present study provides the first nationally representative data on ACEs in Serbia while critically examining current scoring practices and proposing a novel normalized scoring system. Data were collected from a stratified national sample of adults in Serbia using the ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ; WHO, 2018). Thirteen ACE domains were assessed with binary and scaled items. Prevalence was calculated using two recommended WHO scoring methods (binary and frequency), and a new normalized scoring approach in which each domain was rescaled to a 0–1 range. Criterion validity was tested against trauma-related symptoms and physical health outcomes. Prevalence estimates varied dramatically depending on the scoring method: physical abuse was reported by 50.2% (binary) versus 7.8% (frequency), and emotional abuse by 78.8% versus 23.9%. Binary scoring suggested that over half of respondents experienced four or more ACEs, while frequency scoring indicated that 37% reported none. The normalized scoring approach produced more nuanced distributions and showed consistent associations with both trauma symptoms and health outcomes, particularly respiratory and neurological problems. Findings underscore the need for standardized ACE scoring methods. The proposed normalized approach enhances psychometric clarity, facilitates cross-cultural comparability, and improves the utility of ACE assessment for epidemiological research, clinical practice, and public health interventions.",

          "abstract": "There are various statistical models with different features and assumptions in meta-analysis. Popular models are, for example, the fixed-effect (or common effect), random-effects, and mixed-effects models. Apart from these models, several alternative models, such as the multiplicative error model (unrestricted weighted least squares model), the hybrid of additive and multiplicative error models, and the location-scale model, have been proposed in the literature. Understanding these models can be challenging for researchers without a solid mathematical background. Implementing or modifying these models is even more challenging for researchers unless they have advanced statistical and programming knowledge. This tutorial elucidates a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework to understand these models. Several R packages are introduced to facilitate the\nspecifications and generation of graphical models for these meta-analytic models. More importantly, researchers may use the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation method to fit these models. This holds significant potential across two domains. First, it can be used as an educational tool in teaching and learning meta-analytic models. Second, the framework supports developing and evaluating novel meta-analytical models,\nwhich have not yet been implemented in current meta-analysis software, fostering advancements in meta-analytic methods. This tutorial also demonstrates with three real datasets how to extend it to address research questions involving complicated meta-analytic models, including nonlinear models, multivariate meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM). Limitations and future directions to extend the SEM-based meta-analysis are discussed.",

Results illustrated how enacted stigma as well as internalisation of stigma and hegemonic femininity contributed to participants’ sense of anticipated stigma, which inhibited their ability to communicate openly about menstruation outside of close informal support networks. Stigma experiences eroded participants’ trust in healthcare providers, and resulted in self-censorship in conversations about menstruation more broadly. However, the research also shows how empowering positive healthcare interactions can be, and a number of participants engaged in menstrual activism by resisting menstrual taboo. By highlighting the experiences of young women in menstrual health communication, this research contributes to our understanding of the pervasive impact of menstrual stigma and patriarchal norms of femininity, while shedding light on the potential to harness change through supportive healthcare interactions and everyday menstrual activism.",

The current study examined changes in secondary school students’ social and emotional loneliness and problematic social media use (PSMU) following a total smartphone ban, and the extent to which these changes depended on students' initial levels of social avoidance and distress (SAD). Our sample included 982 students (Mage = 14.1) from two Dutch secondary schools implementing a total smartphone ban. Students completed questionnaires about loneliness, PSMU, and SAD before the ban (W1) and three months following the ban (W2). Data were analyzed using difference score and multiple regression analyses. Students used substantially less social media during school breaktimes post-ban compared to pre-ban. Further, we found a small mean-level increase in emotional loneliness from pre-ban to post-ban. While mean levels of social loneliness remained stable, higher baseline levels of SAD predicted increased social loneliness post-ban. There were no changes in PSMU at the mean level nor in relation to students’ baseline levels of SAD. Taken together, we did not find that a total smartphone ban alleviates secondary school students’ loneliness and problematic social media use in the short term. On the contrary, such a ban may entail an initial adjustment period and may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for improving students’ socio-emotional functioning.",

The sample included 184 mothers, most of whom had higher education.\nResults: Parental stress was significantly directly associated with lower caregiver responsiveness. Additionally, depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship (for MRQ, but not PRS) between parental stress and responsiveness. The effects of personality traits were statistically non-significant.\nConclusions: Parental stress emerged as the most consistent predictor of caregiver responsiveness, underscoring its central role in shaping parental behavior.

          "abstract": "The achievement goal perspective highlights the importance of mastery-approach goals in facilitating students’ academic achievement. However, a socio-ecological lens would suggest that the effectiveness of these mastery-approach goals might vary across different levels of income inequality, specifically national- and school-level income inequality. Understanding the role of income inequality is essential for advancing a socio-ecologically sensitive achievement goal approach. This study examines whether the association between mastery-approach goals and academic achievement is moderated by national- and school-level income inequality. Our hypothesis is that the adaptive benefits associated with mastery-approach goals are weaker in socio-ecological contexts with higher national- and school-level income inequality. The study involved 273,269 students nested in 10,785 schools from 33 countries. The results revealed that both national- and school-level income inequality significantly moderated the associations between mastery-approach goals and academic achievement in the three focal subjects of mathematics, reading, and science. Both national- and school-level income inequality weakened the positive role of mastery-approach goals, and this was especially pronounced for lower socioeconomic status students. These findings underscore the importance of considering socio-ecological contexts when evaluating the impact of mastery-approach goals on academic outcomes, highlighting the need to address both achievement goals and broader socio-ecological contexts to support academic success for all students.",

Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational strategies were effective, and favored complex representations when ineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or complex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an epistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory of perception.",

          "abstract": "Emotions change through internal momentum and reactions to events. However, the literatures examining these forces have proceeded separately, emphasizing either endogenous regulation or exogenous value signals such as reward prediction errors. This separation obscures a convergent account in which both influences jointly shape momentary affect. We address this gap by applying sparse equation discovery (SINDy) to a large happiness dataset from a gambling task (N = 16,337) and introduce DynAffect-C, a unified model that separates and quantifies endogenous and exogenous inertia. DynAffect-C recovers known value-signaling effects and, with regulatory baseline-attraction terms, explains substantially more moment-to-moment variation than value-only models. The model reveals nonlinear pull toward baseline affect, alternating mood states in a subset of participants, and a trade-off between stronger internal momentum and transient impacts of external events. The result integrates two literatures and yields a unified theory and testable equation for affect.",

          "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly common in the psychology and neuroscience literature to use Bayes factors to provide evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The most common approach reports a Bayes factor that compares the null hypothesis to a “default” alternative. This approach can show that the data is more likely to have been generated under the null hypothesis than under the specific alternative tested, but it cannot provide evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, analyses using default alternatives can return evidence in favor of the null hypothesis when the data is consistent with medium to large effects. I show that common interpretations of these Bayes factor analyses are misleading, and I provide examples and simulations that help to understand what a Bayes factor in favor of the null does and does not tell us. I argue that Bayes factors have no special ability to help us understand null effects when compared to frequentist methods such as equivalence testing and confidence intervals.",

          "authors": "Seokhwan Tommy Kim; Xu Yan; Azara Lalla; Sean Devine; Signy Sheldon; A. Ross Otto; Akram Bakkour; Karin Foerde; Madeleine Sharp",
          "abstract": "Apathy, characterized by diminished motivation and reduced goal-directed behavior, is prevalent in normal aging. Recent evidence suggests that it may result from biases in the evaluation of costs and benefits during decision making. However, most research has focused on simple decisions involving the trade-off between motor or cognitive effort and monetary reward. Meanwhile, it is possible that the disrupted real-life decisions of people with apathy reflect biases affecting many other dimensions of value. Additionally, the extent to which mood symptoms that frequently co-occur with apathy also contribute to biases in decision making is unclear. To address these gaps, we developed a novel online task completed by 158 older adults who first rated everyday activities (e.g., watching TV, going to the park) across 19 value attributes (e.g., enjoyment, social obligation), and then made a series of choices between random pairs of the different activities. A factor analysis of attribute ratings identified three latent factors representing reward, effort, and obligation, which strongly predicted choices and choice response times. Apathy was selectively associated with an overweighting of effort-related attributes in models controlling for impulsivity, depression, or anhedonia; it did not affect the weighting of reward or obligation-related attributes. Interestingly, impulsivity, which was positively correlated with apathy, was associated with an underweighting of effort. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling supported these findings, showing that apathy and impulsivity modulated the influence of effort on the rate of evidence accumulation in opposite directions. Overall, these results suggest that decisions about everyday activities rely on the integration of a wide range of value attributes and that apathy is selectively associated with an overweighting of the effort dimension of value, driving choices away from activities that require greater effort.",

          "authors": "Jon Clindaniel",
          "abstract": "The color of each cord is often highlighted as one of the primary sites of meaning on an Inka khipu -- the mostly undeciphered recording device of the Inka empire. However, while there are a variety of historical, ethnographic, and archaeological suggestions for how the semantics of color worked, none of these approaches systematically explains how Inka khipu cord colors denoted meaning. Instead, they present a range of fragmented, sometimes contradictory snapshots of a much larger, more complex system. This study aims to address the question: is there even a \"system\" of color that can be discovered and deciphered? If so, how did it work? Or is the sheer variety of uses discussed in prior studies an empirical indication that color had limited semiotic consistency for Inka khipukamayuqs (\"khipu makers/interpreters\" in Quechua)? To answer these questions, I employ an AI khipukamayuq -- a custom \"transformer\" deep learning model trained to parse all of the cord colors in the Open Khipu Repository (OKR) -- to analyze the semantic space of Inka khipu cord color. My findings reveal a coherent system of color signs, wherein different colors occupy distinct, relationally-opposed semantic domains, with many colors demonstrating polysemy. This suggests a versatile set of color signs adaptable to various contexts and domains of representation, akin to other linguistic media. In the domain of khipus and beyond, this study points toward the importance of continued interaction with AI models as archaeologists learn (together with machines) to systematically represent and delineate the past.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study anchors its analysis on the controversy surrounding Shanghai Maritime University's “First-Class Undergraduate Programs” initiative in China. It aims to validate whether AI-enhanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence governance can reconstruct auditable evidence chains and quantify narrative discrepancies in education-related public incidents, while extrapolating governance performance to multidimensional national security risks. Methodologically, we collected university announcements, mainstream media reports, platform-accessible pages, and judicial leads within a unified time window to construct a “source-time-version” evidence graph. We introduced multilingual NLI and sentence vectors to measure narrative consistency, combined with JSD to monitor monitoring scope drift. We employed temporal propagation networks and DTW to measure the temporal misalignment between “post deletion/restriction” and public opinion peaks. Further, we mapped “evidence governance/information control opacity” to four normalized risk dimensions—academic integrity, rule of law and institutional trust, ideological security, and social stability—using structural causal models, providing 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate: The foundational evidence chain can be robustly reconstructed, yet significant narrative gaps exist regarding “whether ‘7 categories, 40 items’ of fraud occurred” and “whether platform actions were implemented/compliant.” Communication peaks typically precede search peaks by approximately one cycle (moderate DTW misalignment), with public nodes consistently holding the highest intermediary scores. Among the four risk dimensions, “academic integrity” and “ideological security” exhibit relatively higher levels. Conclusions indicate that earlier, auditable evidence disclosure (versioned notifications, third-party verification, platform log retention) simultaneously reduces all four risk dimensions and shortens the public opinion chain, whereas declarative statements alone fail to resolve disputes. AI-enhanced OSINT provides a reusable methodological pathway for evidence governance in educational settings and national security assessments.",

          "title": "The Psychology of Deepfakes: How Technology Manipulates Human Perception",
          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has quickly become one of the most disruptive new technologies in the digital information ecosystem. It can make convincing audio-visual content that looks just like real media.  Although much of the current research has looked at deepfakes from legal, technological, or ethical points of view, this article uses a psychological point of view to explain their particular potency.  The main point is that deepfakes don't work mostly as rational lies; instead, they work as cognitive exploits, types of \"perceptual malware\" that attack the way people trust each other.  The article illustrates how deepfakes exploit entrenched biases, such as the truth bias, familiarity effects, and the fluency of perceptual processing, by referencing cognitive psychology and neuroscience.  In doing so, they avoid higher-order logical inspection and use autonomic processes of recognition and belief construction.  The paper also puts deepfakes in the context of other research on false information and how memories can change, suggesting that fake media can create false memories or strengthen existing biases through repeated exposure.  Deepfakes undermine epistemic trust by eroding the dependability of visual and aural evidence, which have historically been regarded as the \"gold standard\" of credibility, in contrast to conventional kinds of propaganda. This situation not only puts democratic discourse and trust in the media at risk, but it also poses a serious psychological challenge: fighting deepfakes requires using cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that are mostly outside of conscious control.  This article provides an interdisciplinary framework for comprehending deepfakes as psychological weapons by integrating insights from cognitive science, information warfare studies, and emerging media research.  It suggests that protecting against this phenomenon necessitates treatments that transcend detection technologies, highlighting cognitive inoculation, media literacy, and the development of \"epistemic resilience\" in an age where visual evidence is increasingly distrusted.",

Higher-order \ncomponents were linked to evaluative dimensions of academic engagement, mid-level \ncomponents reflected the broader epistemological positioning of disciplines, and lower-order \ncomponents assessed the relational aspects of subjects in the context of interpersonal \ndynamics.

A global survey within the Library and Information Science (LIS) community explored training experiences, gaps, and interests, especially around research integrity. The results revealed critical knowledge gaps, including the need for a deeper understanding of bibliometric principles, responsible metrics use, advanced analysis techniques, and awareness of indicators' limitations and biases. Highlighting these deficiencies aims to engage the STI indicators community, prompting collective action to better equip bibliometrics practitioners. Proper training is essential to prevent the misuse of indicators, which can undermine research quality and academic evaluation.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from Latin American and European countries, specifically focusing on whether the issues and challenges faced by these regions differ significantly. Latin American countries may be addressing region-specific health concerns or environmental challenges different from the European countries. A bibliographic universal classification of SDGs may overlook such crucial issues and nuances vital to the development of these countries. This study emphasises the differing priorities between Latin America and certain countries in the Global North regarding the health and well-being of all individuals. It focuses on improving reproductive, maternal, and child health, ending epidemics of major contagious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, and addressing behavioral and environmental health risk factors. While Latin American countries often focus on topics like infections or mental health, the Global North tends to priorities Covid 19 and cancer. These differences reflect distinct economic, social, and political contexts, with us Global North sometimes overlooking the foundational needs of Global South countries. The research employs a sample from the Open Alex database, focusing on the ten most productive countries in Latin America and the ten most productive countries in Europe in SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being in the period of 2023-2024. The study, which falls under the framework of SDG 3 publications and employs data analytics techniques, identifies priority topics for Latin America and Europe, as well as common interests across both regions. Utilising predictive models based on machine learning, the study forecasts the topics that these countries are likely to prioritize in the near future with an accuracy of 60%. This level of accuracy may be influenced by the sample size used; therefore, future analyses will incorporate additional data, such as examining abstracts to determine whether European countries continue to diverge in their focus or if they find common ground on certain topics. This approach will provide valuable insights into regional priorities and the potential evolution of research related to the Sustainable Development Goals. The contrast between Latin America and Europe is valuable and quite original, since many global analyses tend to homogenize realities.",

          "abstract": "Contrary to the growing emphasis on resilience in sustainability science, I argue that resilience continues to reflect a mindset of human–nature domination, and thus represents continuity rather than a real relational turn. Instead, I propose vulnerability as a critical mode of relation. Drawing on Robin May Schott’s ontological critique of resilience, I extend her arguments into the field of sustainability science by examining its ontological assumptions, primary discourses, and existing critiques. I advance a threefold plea: first, that reconnecting with nature requires a particular relational mode; second, that vulnerability is a necessary precondition for this mode; and third, that sustainability transformations may benefit from less emphasis on resilience. By combining rational argumentation with art-based, transdisciplinary approaches, this paper seeks to foster psychological reflection, new relational imaginaries, and ultimately more just sustainability transformations. I conclude by inviting readers to engage with their own vulnerabilities as part of this process.",

          "abstract": "This paper analyzes joint employment trajectories of first-time parents in Germany from one year before to six years after the birth of their first child. Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

From here one can even explore a closeness underlying an apparent and declared detachment, to reflect on a disinterestedness that is actually interested. The analysis is thus based on an “against the grain” reading of the direct and explicit occurrences of Gramsci traceable in Bourdieu's texts, highlighting the space of their possible sociological implications and their tacit and implicit connotations.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how different types of social interactions are reflected in the archaeological record, specifically analyzing the extent to which artifacts can serve as proxies for past human interactions. Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

          "abstract": "This paper outlines an epistemic space in which race is neither a biological fact nor a social construct. At stake is a tractable analysis of race across public discourse, science, and law which doesn’t reduce to the essentialism of biology or society.\n\nDrawing on Michel Foucault’s archaeology, biopolitics, and dispositif, and reading them alongside Kant’s Anthropology, I argue that race persists not because it is true or false, but because it is realised “within the true” - that is, within epistemic norms and institutional apparatuses that produce what Steven Pinker calls common knowledge, Michael Hardimon calls enlightened commonsense. Racial thinking is exemplified in Aaron Panofsky’s observation that “one can believe that genes cause racial behavioural differences and also that science cannot substantiate that belief”. Race, I argue, is a  useful logical fiction.",

          "abstract": "The Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement highlights the complexity of public perceptions surrounding policies rooted in populist health initiatives in the United States. While supporters embrace the movement’s messaging around healthier lifestyles and nutritional choices, critics point to its political undertones and the widespread misinformation associated with it. To better understand the dynamics of public perceptions of the MAHA movement, our study leverages sentiment classification and topic modeling to analyze discourse about the movement on X. Our analysis reveals an interesting trend: although the movement initially generated overwhelmingly positive sentiment, overall positivity declined following the nomination and subsequent confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services to the point where negative sentiment began to outweigh positive sentiments. Further integration of such trends with topic modeling analysis suggests that while the public initially supported the ideals of healthier lifestyles promoted by the MAHA movement, enthusiasm diminished and eventually turned negative once the movement became entangled with political dimensions and controversial policies.",

The article presents findings of a series of interviews conducted with 15 members of the Final Fantasy XI (FFXI) private server community and investigates the value private servers provide to the preservation of virtual worlds. Player interviews speak to the power of private servers and their ability to allow them to relive past eras the virtual world in which they play and exist in, while interviews with private server developers uncovered the challenges of recreating past eras of a virtual world. Finally, this paper argues that by hiring the private server developers to help recreate these virtual worlds, game companies could address player demand, profit from the nostalgia, and compensate those who have already been voluntarily preserving their game.",

          "abstract": "How does coethnicity shape host attitudes toward refugees? Existing research often assumes that refugees who share the ethnic or cultural background of host populations will face less backlash. We test this assumption in Pakistan, where both refugee and host communities include substantial Pashtun populations. Drawing on original survey experimental, observational, and qualitative data, we find that while coethnicity increases refugee acceptance on average, this result masks sharp internal variation. Coethnic hosts who live in provinces where they are ethnic minorities are far more likely to express inclusive attitudes than those living in their ethnic homeland. The impact of coethnicity therefore depends on local context: in settings where ethnic identity is politically salient and shaped by marginalization, coethnicity with refugees can carry both instrumental and symbolic value. These findings complicate standard assumptions about the primacy of cultural threat and underscore the need to attend to subnational variation in refugee-host dynamics.",

          "abstract": "In 1954, Dorothy Martin predicted an apocalyptic flood and promised her followers rescue by flying saucers. When neither arrived, she recanted, her group dissolved, and efforts to proselytize ceased. But When Prophecy Fails (1956), the now-canonical account of the event, claimed the opposite: that the group doubled down on its beliefs and began recruiting—evidence, the authors argued, of a new psychological mechanism, cognitive dissonance. Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation.

          "authors": "Nusrat Molla; Ruchika Jaiswal; Jonathan Herman",
          "abstract": "Governance is increasingly understood to be a complex system shaped by diverse actors. However, understanding of how these actors interact with the institutions and infrastructure systems in which they are embedded to drive change is still limited. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to understand factors shaping actors' political behavior and how power dynamics influence their ability to create change. This study addresses this gap by combining analysis of actors' narratives about water issues and governance with dynamical systems modeling of the socio-hydrologic system in the context of California's San Joaquin Valley. Through interviews and focus groups with growers, advocacy groups, and rural residents, distinct narratives emerge around water issues and power dynamics. Modeling strategies that would maximize each actor's water access reveals that existing structures incentivize strategies that would mainly benefit larger growers, and thus conflict with the goals of environmental justice narratives. Comparing these modeled strategies with actors' actual strategies also reveals disparities in different actors' ability to pursue the \"optimal\" strategy. These findings highlight how system structures entrench certain interests as well as the potential of narratives for shaping strategies aimed at long-term transformation.",

          "authors": "Amanda Welsh; Jenna Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Multiple jobholding (MJH)—the practice of maintaining more than one paid position simultaneously—is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by digital platforms, remote work normalization, and the expanding gig economy, which have all democratized access to diverse work opportunities. This expansion has altered the demographics of multiple job holders, shifting from predominantly low-wage workers seeking economic survival to include professionals across the income spectrum pursuing varied employment arrangements. Exploration of MJH has typically been dichotomized into two perspectives: those who view it as an unfortunate necessity forced upon the economically vulnerable and those who celebrate it as empowering \"side hustles\" that provide supplemental income and personal fulfillment. To examine workers' actual preferences and motivations, we fielded a survey (n=254) investigating whether workers actively desire MJH arrangements, whether financial considerations alone drive these preferences, and what other factors influence their appeal. Results revealed that workers across demographic groups express a genuine preference for MJH arrangements, transcending economic boundaries. While compensation remains important, workers value MJH for the flexibility and autonomy it provides. In contrast to the universal appeal of these characteristics, the youngest generation (Gen Z) is distinguished by significantly higher interest in using multiple roles to maintain different professional identities and build diverse networks (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest the emergence of what we term the \"Career Mosaic\"—a deliberate construction of professional identity through intentionally curated work experiences that together create a more complete expression of self. This shift from viewing careers as linear progressions to seeing them as multifaceted compositions among the next generation of workers has profound implications for employment policy, workforce development practices, HR technology, and organizational strategy, all of which were designed for a single-employer paradigm that may no longer reflect workers' evolving relationship with work.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) has emerged as a critical component of development practice, especially in African contexts where donor legitimacy and accountability are upheld by demonstrable quantitative impact. Typically seen as a technical endeavour, M&amp;E is frequently presumed to yield impartial, objective assessments of societal advancement. This paper contests that assumption by proposing a philosophical redefinition of M&amp;E as performative ritualism, a fusion of Judith Butler’s theory of performativity and Victor Turner’s anthropology of ritual. The analysis employs a critical conceptual methodology and normative critique. Butler's explanation of performativity shows how indicators and reports work not just as reflections but also as performative utterances that have an \"impact\" through their repeated use in rituals. Turner's ritual theory shows that evaluation cycles baseline, midline, and endline act as rites of passage, turning ambiguity into symbolic closure for funders and policymakers. Post-humanist insights further expand these frameworks, illustrating how dashboards, algorithms, and artificial intelligence tools now operate alongside human evaluators, reinforcing evaluative categories through automated repetition. The findings indicate the cultural and ethical conflict of these activities within African cultures. Western evaluation rituals focus on linearity, abstraction, and bureaucratic closure. In contrast, African communitarian ethics focus on relational accountability, oral testimony, and cyclical processes of responsibility. The difference shows how theatrical imported evaluative systems are; it also shows how to recreate ethics by thinking of evaluation as participatory storytelling and communal debate instead of a bureaucratic audit. The article finds that monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is not a neutral tool but a symbolic system that enacts legitimacy and authority. Thinking of M&amp;E as performative ritualism brings out its cultural and philosophical sides and makes room for hybrid models that mix computational tools with community-based, relational practices. The paper provides a novel framework for examining development evaluation in the algorithmic era, rooted in African ethical philosophy.",

          "abstract": "While existing research highlights the occupational advantages of citizenship for immigrants, little is known about how such advantages might vary, and previous studies have not fully dealt with issues of selection. We study the heterogeneous effects of naturalization by leveraging a novel historical dataset of naturalization records from New York City’s Southern District in the early 1900s. We link these to U.S. census data from 1920, 1930, and 1940, tracking 1,947 immigrants who declared their intent to naturalize, analyzing occupational trajectories among them, and modeling selection into naturalization using random forests. Our findings reveal that immigrants who completed the naturalization process attained significantly higher occupational status than those who initiated but did not complete naturalization. In addition, propensity-stratified results support a negative selection hypothesis: Immigrants less likely to naturalize enjoyed greater returns to naturalization, surpassing the unnaturalized in the high-propensity, more advantaged group. We support these results with supplementary analyses of full-count census data, where we find similar trends. These results underscore the role of naturalization as a key driver of socioeconomic mobility while highlighting citizenship as a critical stratifying force.",

In this regard, it is emphasized how the points of contact between some couples of interpretative categories of each-habitus and doxa, hegemony and common sense, respectively-might detect some paths of interaction. Essentially, by highlighting the commonalities and shared ground of the two conceptual universes, we seek to understand whether it is possible to refer to them in social research; and whether their intertwining can give rise to reformulations and developments of conceptual and epistemological devices, with a view to their use in social theory.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes call social engineering the \"human factor\" in cybersecurity; however, this \nkind of language hides the underlying philosophical aspects of the issue. Instead of viewing \npersons as the most vulnerable component in technical systems, social engineering should be \nrecognised as a means of revealing the cultivation, maintenance, and exploitation of moral and \nintellectual inclinations within digital contexts. Current ethical frameworks predominantly \nexhibit deontological and utilitarian influences, prioritising adherence to regulations or the \noptimisation of favourable results. Although these frameworks possess practical applicability, \nthey inadequately represent the moral agency of individuals faced with deception. This essay \nconstructs a conceptual analysis that reinterprets social engineering within the context of \nDigital Virtue Ethics. Utilising Aristotle's notion of phronesis and MacIntyre's interpretation \nof practices, the argument underscores that effective resistance to manipulation relies more on \nthe cultivation of qualities such as wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice than on strict \ncompliance with laws. Insights from virtue epistemology, especially in the writings of \nZagzebski and Sosa, enhance this study by highlighting epistemic vigilance through \nattentiveness, humility, and conscientiousness. The amalgamation of these traditions facilitates \nthe emergence of Digital Phronesis: a distinctive form of practical wisdom tailored to the \ninherent unpredictability and persuasive dynamics of online existence. The important point is \nthat technical precautions and compliance procedures are necessary, but they are not enough \non their own. They need a philosophical framework that sees people as moral actors who can \ndevelop strong inclinations. From this perspective, social engineering is not just a technological \nviolation but also an affront to moral character and intellectual integrity. When you talk about \ncybersecurity in terms of virtue, you move away from the idea of the \"weakest link\" and make \nhuman agency the most important layer of defence.",

However, the concept has been understood in a variety of ways, which are at odds with how ideology is conceptualised in political theory and election research. This results in fragmented theorising and a lack of systematic empirical insights. I argue that we should conceptualise ideology in a theoretically sound, and empirically measurable manner to enable quantitative research. Using a definition of ideology common in political science, I argue that we should reclaim the term extremism to theorise effects of insurgent ideologies. I conceptualise ideological extremity as an insurgent group's ideological distance to an average ideology. Instead of relying on ideology-specific arguments, this novel concept enables theorising and empirically studying the effect of extreme, compared to moderate ideologies in a generalisable way, allowing insights that are transferable to future ideologies. The concept maps onto a measurement model, enabling me to estimate insurgent's ideological extremity based on their manifestos.",

Europe has been on the \nforefront of this trend with an increasing number of states since the early 2000s introducing \nregulations on security-based citizenship deprivation in national legislation, often allowing for \nsubstantial administrative discretion with few procedural safeguards.

We identify two ‘waves of securitisation’, \nincluding an early wave focused on disloyalty in the 1970s and 1980s. After a liberalising period in \nthe 1990s, we observe a strong resurgence of security-related deprivation provisions.

          "abstract": "National research assessment policies, designed to boost international competitiveness, have intensified “publish or perish” pressures and reshaped the global academic publishing landscape. However, the impact of these pressures on the domestic publishing infrastructures of semi-peripheral nations remains underexplored. This paper investigates how a nation’s domestic publishing infrastructure shapes whether new, high-volume open-access publishing models function as a portfolio addition or a systemic substitute. Using a comparative mixed-methods analysis of Spain and Lithuania, we combine bibliometric data from the Web of Science (2004–2024) with 28 semi-structured interviews with researchers. The findings reveal two divergent, rational strategies. In Spain, a resilient domestic publishing infrastructure, accommodated by a flexible evaluation system, allowed researchers to adopt new publishers as a pragmatic portfolio addition to an already diverse set of options. In stark contrast, Lithuanian research assessment policies actively marginalised domestic journals, creating acute strain on the country’s publishing ecosystem. Researchers in Lithuania thus adopted these same new publishing models as a systemic substitute and a survival measure. We conclude that control over a community-managed domestic publishing infrastructure is a key factor shaping the autonomy of a national academic system. It is this infrastructure that separates a strategy of dependent displacement from one of autonomous coexistence: a crucial lesson for policymakers engaged in global research assessment reforms.",

Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Persistent macroeconomic imbalances, long‑run deflation, and entrenched inequality are often interpreted as outcomes of market incompleteness or failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective by developing a dynamic equilibrium framework for open economies that incorporates asset‑side mechanisms. Within this framework, and by re‑examining the transversality condition (TVC) as an asset‑valuation criterion, such persistent imbalances can emerge as structural outcomes of optimal behavior rather than anomalies. The model yields the relationship:Rt-ρ=n+Da-U(θa)/Uc; This relationship shows that the gap between the asset return (Rt) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the combined effects of capital diffusion (Da), population growth (n) and preference terms (U(θa)/Uc). This reinterpretation explains how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist, and frames equilibrium as a dynamic configuration shaped by interdependence across economies and agents, beyond the traditional price‑clearing mechanism. The results align theory with observed realities and offer tools for policy design, including structural selection of the steady state, policy control of capital flows, and asset‑dynamics‑based policy reconstruction. Furthermore, by formalizing a concept akin to “economic entropy,” this framework provides a pathway beyond quantitative equilibrium theory toward a richer understanding of qualitative development.",

This study analyzes a stratified sample of Library and Information Science publications to examine how citance segmentation and annotator expertise influence the consistency of classification. Using two annotators with different professional backgrounds, the findings show that agreement is high when citances are defined identically, but reliability decreases sharply once text boundaries diverge. Citance length, rather than subject category or citation density, emerges as the strongest predictor of disagreement. These results identify segmentation as a methodological rather than a purely technical issue, shaping both human and automated tagging outcomes. By highlighting the interplay between expertise effects and boundary definitions, the study underscores the need for clearer operational frameworks in citation analysis. The contribution lies in demonstrating that methodological refinements in citance identification are essential for improving reproducibility, enhancing hybrid human-machine approaches, and strengthening the validity of citation-based indicators in research evaluation.",

As a result, a lack of affordable and available housing often places seasonal and vulnerable workers in inappropriate and poor-quality housing. This also makes it hard for businesses to attract and retain workers in regional parts of Australia.",

          "abstract": "Food and agriculture face interlinked crises of biodiversity loss, climate change and inequity,\nexposing the fragility of extractive models (IPBES, 2019; IPBES, 2025). This paper develops a\nframework of regenerative governance, combining Meadows’ leverage points, Ostrom’s\ncommons, and post-growth ethics, to analyze enterprises as micro-governance experiments in\nsustainability transitions. Using four cases, a US family farm, Dutch start-up, UK cooperative,\nand an Ecuadorian cacao partnership, we examine how organizational forms intervene at\nsystemic levels by redesigning rules, feedbacks, and paradigms.\n\nCross-case analysis shows that family and partnership models often catalyze paradigm shifts,\nwhile cooperatives and entrepreneurial networks codify rules and incentives at scale. Together,\nthey illustrate regenerative enterprises as “living laboratories” of ethical innovation, embedding\nfairness, stewardship, and resilience into governance. The paper contributes by: (1) integrating\nsystems, commons, and post-growth theory into an operational governance lens; (2)\ndemonstrating how organizational forms activate distinct leverage points; and (3) advancing\npractice-oriented propositions for testing regenerative governance in food systems. By\npositioning regenerative enterprises as governance innovations, the paper reframes business\nstrategy not only as value creation but as systemic intervention, with implications for sustainable\nbusiness models. The findings suggest that small, place-based initiatives can prefigure systemic\ntransitions when nested in polycentric networks and supported by aligned incentives, pointing to\npathways for post-growth transformation.",

          "authors": "Andreas Genoni; Didier Ruedin",
          "abstract": "Immigrants with higher levels of education tend to report more discrimination and a weaker attachment to their destination country than immigrants with lower levels of education. This so-called integration paradox is thought to occur because of two basic, mutually independent mechanisms: (1) highly educated immigrants more often experience unmet migration expectations, and (2) show stronger negative reactions when their expectations about their life abroad are not met. Existing research mainly focused on the first mechanism, and empirically tracing the second has been challenging due to a lack of evidence comparing less- and more-educated immigrants’ reactions over time. Here, we address this gap and examine how unmet migration expectations contribute to education-related differences in destination attachment. Using panel data on recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey (N = 5,242 immigrants and 13,890 observations, 2016-2022), we assessed the extent of unmet expectations and associated disappointment through a question on dissatisfaction with the decision to migrate. Consistent with theory, we found that increasingly negative evaluations of pre-migration expectations were linked to reduced destination attachment, especially for immigrants with higher levels of education. These results suggest a fundamental mechanism for the emergence of the integration paradox, enhancing our understanding of immigrant integration.",

This contribution analyzes the syntax and semantics of the phenomenon in order to unravel key aspects that have been ignored by previous work. At the syntactic level, the extended idea that complements introduced by en are direct objects is refuted, and the possibility is noted of the alternation taking place with verbs that select an indirect object as their second argument. At the semantic level, it is concluded that the structure introduced by en describes a dynamic, durative, atelic event that entails agentivity. This way, this article intends to contribute to our understanding of a construction that is unique among Romance languages.",

          "abstract": "Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) is a multilevel regression approach grounded in intersectionality theory. It examines inequalities across intersections of social identities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, class) and is argued to provide more accurate predictions of intersectional means than conventional methods that estimate group means directly or via regressions with all interactions. This study evaluates that claim using analytic expressions and an empirical illustration to compare simple and MAIHDA-predicted means against population values. Predictive accuracy is assessed via variance, correlation, bias, and mean squared error. Results show that MAIHDA estimates generally outperform simple means, particularly when decomposing intersectional means into additive and non-additive identity effects. The magnitude of the advantage depends on inequality patterns and group sample sizes. MAIHDA is especially valuable when inequalities are subtle or data for marginalized intersections are sparse—conditions common in practice. These findings highlight MAIHDA’s practical relevance for quantitative intersectionality research.",

          "abstract": "Agroforestry adoption by smallholders globally has been limited despite long-term encouragement from national policies. In India, a dedicated agroforestry policy, combined with its potential to contribute to forest restoration goals, has led to a renewed emphasis on promoting the adoption of agroforestry practices among smallholders. However, the views of smallholders residing near forest fringes, who are often approached for adopting agroforestry as part of restoration plans, have not been extensively documented. Using surveys and interviews, we investigate the motivations for engagement and non-engagement in agroforestry for forest restoration among smallholder farmers in Chhota Udepur district, Gujarat. Our logistic regression model indicates that the results of agroforestry from fellow farmers and knowledge about government programs have a strong positive association with agroforestry engagement. In contrast, water availability and trust in government are negatively associated with engagement. Our interviews substantiate these associations and provide additional information about perceived risks. Specifically, water shortages and labour scarcity are significant barriers to smallholders considering the adoption of agroforestry. In all sampled villages, smallholders have emphasised a need for reliable markets for selling agroforestry produce. The mobilisation of sales through existing farmer producer organisations in the region presents an opportunity to increase agroforestry uptake among farmers. Additionally, we find that the impact of the national agroforestry policy has been limited; however, given smallholders’ preference for government programs, this trust can be leveraged to provide better financial and technical support. Overall, our study reinforces the finding that unless livelihoods are secured, engagement in restoration by smallholders is likely to remain limited, ultimately undermining the potential co-benefits of forest restoration to the most vulnerable.",

          "abstract": "Public health and health education face many challenges which can be compounded by conflicting views and bias. Constructs and tools of mindfulness theory may offer avenues for addressing these challenges. The field of mindfulness developed as an individual practice involving meditation for stress reduction. The field of business extended principles of mindfulness to organizational behavior as “collective mindfulness,” which includes a mindful state separate from the practice of meditation. Principles of mindfulness can be applied at the community level to foster unbiased non-judgmental awareness and action through a dimensional and social-ecological approach, to address conflicting views at the individual, inter-personal, organizational/community, and policy/societal levels. Community mindfulness moderator training can foster neutral non-judgmental awareness of all factors involved in public health decisions and health education efforts, including trustworthiness of sources, potential bias, and short term and long term implications. Five processes of community mindfulness theory are presented which include: Creating a neutral nonjudgmental state of mind for objective analysis of evidence; Fostering trust, common ground, and a safe environment for discussion; Incorporation of a social-ecological perspective; Addressing dimensional and long range perspectives; and Inclusion of mindfully-based social media.",

          "abstract": "How does coethnicity shape host attitudes toward refugees? Existing research often assumes that refugees who share the ethnic or cultural background of host populations will face less backlash. We test this assumption in Pakistan, where both refugee and host communities include substantial Pashtun populations. Drawing on original survey experimental, observational, and qualitative data, we find that while coethnicity increases refugee acceptance on average, this result masks sharp internal variation. Coethnic hosts who live in provinces where they are ethnic minorities are far more likely to express inclusive attitudes than those living in their ethnic homeland. The impact of coethnicity therefore depends on local context: in settings where ethnic identity is politically salient and shaped by marginalization, coethnicity with refugees can carry both instrumental and symbolic value. These findings complicate standard assumptions about the primacy of cultural threat and underscore the need to attend to subnational variation in refugee-host dynamics.",

          "authors": "Chase Ledin",
          "abstract": "The emergence of STI prophylaxis using doxycycline (aka DoxyPEP) amongst gay and bisexual men (GBMSM) has been positively received by healthcare professionals (Molina et al. 2018; Cornelisse et al. 2023; Leutkemeyer et al. 2023), community health organisations (Weil &amp; Nutland 2023), and community members (Holt et al. 2024). Alongside high acceptability, integrating DoxyPEP into clinical medicine has raised clear issues about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and complex disruption of the human microbiome (Bachmann et al. 2024). These issues present new challenges for community health research and practice, including refining existing HIV/STI prevention strategies and new methods for engaging communities in conversations about sustainable antibiotic use and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) (Broder 2020; Weil 2023, 2024). This paper brings together interviews with UK clinicians with scholarship on STI/HIV health promotion to consider how emergent use of DoxyPEP plays into the making of queer AMS. I demonstrate how clinicians establish links between microbiome health and generalised antibiotic consumption to construct AMS principles. Based on these principles, I consider what a queer AMS might look like for GBMSM, including social and ethical procedures for assembling safer sexual practices and deterring onward transmission of bacterial STIs (Davis et al. 2022). Building upon Davis et al.’s (2022) work, I argue that the assemblage of normative and non-normative use of DoxyPEP constitutes queer AMS through the negotiation of what I call a ‘threshold of acceptable STI transmission’. Attending to this threshold might allow healthcare practitioners to stay with social complexity (Law 2004; Haraway 2016) and multiply engage with sexual communities (Epstein 2022) to cultivate queer AMS. Finally, when sufficiently contextualised and localised within larger debates about AMR, queer AMS can enable new understandings of how GBMSM actively understand and/or contest biomedical power through negotiated safer sex practices.",

          "abstract": "The inclusion of affective-sexual and gender diversity is an ongoing challenge due to the persistence of negative attitudes. The educational context is a critical space where either prejudices may be perpetuated or egalitarian attitudes fostered. A crucial step for advancing the inclusion of sexual diversity is being able to measure this construct. For this, several authors develop, validate, or applicate instruments to assess attitudes toward sexual diversity in Education. The objective of the present study was to review this type of measures. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses follows the recommendations of PRISMA and APA’s standards. After the eligibility criteria were applied, 7 papers were included. The instruments were analyzed according to (i) their ability to capture subtle attitudes and the dimensions of diversity addressed; (ii) the context in which they were validated and their target population; (iii) their psychometric properties and methodological rigor. As result, it can be state that most of the instruments present some evidences of validity and reliability. In order to reduce social desirability and reactivity, the scales combine positively worded items, with the traditional use of negatively items. In addition, they incorporate more subtle expressions associated with modern prejudice. However, certain items may no longer effectively capture the subtle attitudes or evolution of language to more accurately name sexual diversity. In conclusion, it would be beneficial to address certain challenges, such as the generality of the items, the reactivity of old-fashioned-prejudice measures, and the need to accumulate further evidence to strengthen their psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "The notion of sustainability has reached the forefront of global climate conversations but has also become more contested in meaning and practice. This paper interrogates how sustainability has been framed into a narrow construct of carbon neutrality, deterring considerations about broader ecological and social consequences. It will use a review of international frameworks, corporate commitments, and specific examples to illustrate the ways in which sustainability often operates as a rhetorical and branding device disconnected from a genuine concern for planetary health. The analysis employed policy papers, corporate announcements, independent watchdog and scholarly outputs as sources and was triangulated on analytical case study practices. Three case studies were selected as illustrative examples as each reflected patterns of interest. Carbon offsetting is heralded as a solution to the climate crisis; in practice carbon offset projects often validate land dispossession and alienation, harm ecosystems, and exacerbate pollution through mitigation claims of neutrality. The Indian Railways' introduction of kulhad cups shown as an example of the process of \"symbolic\" policy wherein environmental costs are displaced as new costs emerge where the value of ecological virtue is claimed. The 'traceability' of the commodity chains of cobalt and lithium demonstrates the deliberate obfuscation of brands taking little, if any responsibility for the human and environmental costs of the so–called green transition.\nThe evidence implies that sustainability is now less a universal ecological principle and more a curated agenda for political legitimacy and corporate profit. Greenwashing, reliance on offsets, ignorance of Scope 3 emissions, and reliance on interventions that are yet to be proven as technically feasible, are a few standard tactics that disguise the ecological damage. Unless sustainability is reclaimed as a holistic framework that accounts for the ecological, social, and ethical, we have the potential to duplicate unsuccessful, false solutions while entrenching systemic inequity.",

This framework proposes consciousness as an emergent system that develops through subconscious absorption of environmental behavioral patterns and genetic interpretive processing. Preliminary evidence suggests infants demonstrate behavioral competence before developing reflective self awareness, indicating sophisticated unconscious systems preceding conscious interface construction. Neural timing studies consistently show unconscious decision initiation before conscious awareness, though interpretations remain debated. The proposed theory includes three hypotheses: temporal precedence of unconscious processing, environmental construction of conscious identity, and neural interface formation through absorbed behavioral patterns. This theoretical investigation addresses questions about cognitive architecture while acknowledging substantial empirical limitations requiring further research. Testing these predictions would advance understanding of consciousness architecture and unconscious processing mechanisms while informing methodological approaches across multiple psychological domains, regardless of whether the specific theoretical framework receives empirical support.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of mass higher education in high-income countries represents a profound social and economic transformation. There is much research investigating the consequences of an increasingly large population of degree holders for socioeconomic inequalities. However, despite rising regional inequality and income segrega?tion in many countries, sociologists have neglected the implications of the expansion of higher education for disparities between places. This paper examines inequalities\nin the geographical distribution of the degree educated from the 1980s to the present day across 17 high-income democracies using granular data from the newly-available Regional Human Capital Database (RHCD). Results show an increasingly unequal distribution of degree holders across places in all countries studied. Educational expansion appears to exacerbate existing inequalities, with faster growth in areas that already had highly educated populations. The paper provides a tentative  explanation of these trends, with evidence suggesting a role for sorting: the selective migration of highly educated individuals to already well-educated urban centers. These findings suggest that previous analyses of educational expansion have overlooked its’ highly disparate geographical incidence. They underscore the importance of examining sub-national geographies when assessing the the role that mass higher education plays in shaping inequalities.",

This study examined how professional identity, cognitive appraisals, and perceptions of fairness shape judges’ openness to AI.\nResearch Questions: Five questions guided the study: (1) Do different message framings (role enhancement, efficiency, neutral) influence judges’ trust, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and adoption intentions? (2) How do professional identity and prior experience with technology and AI shape evaluations and willingness to adopt AI? (3) How are procedural justice, legitimacy, and trust interrelated in predicting adoption? (4) Do judges differ in their levels of trust across legal contexts? (5) What concerns or reflections do judges express about AI in courtroom decision-making?\nMethod: A national sample of 317 judges (56.6% male, 41.1% female; M age = 60.41, SD = 10.24; 80.2% White, 8.4% Black, 3.4% Hispanic/Latinx, 2.7% Asian, 1.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 1.9% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) was recruited through the National Judicial College. Judges were randomly assigned to one of three message framings. Measures included professional identity, trust in AI across eight legal contexts, perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitudes, procedural justice, legitimacy, and adoption intentions.\nResults: Role-enhancement framing significantly increased trust (η² = .02), perceived usefulness (η² = .06), and adoption intentions (η² = .04). Mediation analyses indicated that procedural justice predicted adoption indirectly through legitimacy and trust (indirect effect = .08, 95% CI [.05, .10]). Prior AI experience was the strongest predictor across outcomes (e.g., trust: β = .10, p &lt; .001; adoption: β = .37, p &lt; .001). Judges expressed higher trust in AI for research and educational tasks than for sentencing, bail, or parole.\nConclusions: Adoption of AI by judges depends on both functional evaluations (usefulness, familiarity) and normative judgments (fairness, legitimacy, identity alignment). Findings suggest that role-congruent framing, experiential training, and governance safeguards that emphasize fairness and transparency are critical for the responsible integration of AI into courts.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood is a critical period for the reproduction of social inequality. While extant literature focuses on socioeconomic background, less is known about the role of parents’ employment uncertainty, notwithstanding its significant presence in post-Fordist societies. We investigate the relationship between household employment uncertainty (HEU)— including temporary work and unemployment—and children’s cognitive and socio-emotional development, as well as their physical health. We leverage four waves of the nationally representative French Longitudinal Study of Children (ELFE). First, using OLS and Linear Probability Models, we find that the accumulation within the household and the persistence of HEU over time are both associated with lower cognitive development (up to -0.2 SD) at ages two and three and a half. Results for socio-emotional development are less robust, and physical health appears not to be correlated with HEU, possibly due to comprehensive healthcare. Second, we examine potential mechanisms using counterfactual mediation analysis. In line with the family investment and the family stress models, income and parental investment in cognitively-enhancing activities mediate the link with cognitive development, whereas parental stress mediates the association with socio-emotional development. Robustness tests include regression-with-residuals to account for other mediators and sibling birth as post-treatment confounders of the mediator-outcome link. Overall, HEU emerges as an important pathway in early inequality, calling for targeted policy.",

Although accommodation of minority languages in state-mediated domains can be expected to favor national integration and reduce conflict, the implied delivery of cultural and material benefits along linguistic lines can empower ethnic parties and further policitize identities. I examine the 1986 linguistic reform in the Spanish province of Navarre, which divided the territory into three zones with different levels of normalization of the Basque language. Using Difference-in-Differences and Regression Discontinuity designs across zones, I find that the introduction of bilingualism in public institutions did not significantly alter Basque nationalist mobilization in the short run. However, support for Basque parties diverged markedly across zones from the late 2000s, suggesting that intergenerational identity realignments and the end of political violence by ETA catalyzed political change over the medium to long run. Consistent with this interpretation, the reform led to an increase in the share of candidates with Basque names in local elections. Overall, the reform appears to have affected political behavior and the making of social boundaries between linguistic groups by widening the constituency of voters with Basque identities rather than changing the behavior of pre-existing Basque speakers. Machine-learning analyses of thousands of streets and geographic names reveal that an important boundary-making process, the linguistic make-up of human geography, remains in part contested in communities at the language frontier.",

          "abstract": "While a growing sociological literature documents how visuality shapes collective identities, less attention is given to the temporal dimension of symbol construction and the shifting meanings and practices associated with prominent images and objects. We introduce the concept of momentary symbols to describe and examine processes where objects for a shorter period rapidly grow into a dominant symbol for a collective, but just as quickly acquire a less central symbolic role. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of this concept by tracing how umbrellas, lasers, and masks became central but temporally contingent visual symbols of Hong Kong’s protest movement, Anti-ELAB. Specifically, we use methods from computational sociology (including dictionary classification, object detection, and actor-network visualisations) and tweets about the 2019 Hong Kong protests (N = 1,615,832) to trace the provisional and unstable characteristics of Anti-ELAB’s visual expressions. Drawing on actor-network theory, we analyse objects and technologies as non-human actants that express protest and oppositional voices alongside humans. Results show that the three actants (umbrellas, lasers, and masks) oscillate between symbolic-visual and practical-confrontative translations during the protest period. Our study demonstrates the relevance of using processual and temporal approaches to capture the erratic and volatile nature of symbol construction processes.",

          "abstract": "Recent period trends in the Nordic countries show rapid declines in first births, particularly among\nlower-educated men and women. This study translates these period changes into cohort patterns and\nanalyzes observed and forecasted ultimate childlessness by education for men and women born\n1970–1987/88 in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden using register-based data. We\napply three forecasting methods: freeze rates, five-year extrapolation, and a nonparametric approach\nbased on historical first-birth probabilities. Results reveal the steepest increases in ultimate\nchildlessness among the lowest educated, approaching as high as 40% among low-educated women\nand 50% among low-educated men in some of the countries. Among the higher tertiary educated,\nchildlessness is overall lower and remains relatively stable. By contrast, men with lower tertiary\neducation show notable increases in childlessness, in some cases reaching levels similar to or higher\nthan those of upper-secondary-educated men. While overall childlessness in Denmark remains\nstable, it exhibits the fastest widening educational gap. These findings underscore a growing\neducational polarization in the transition to parenthood across the Nordic societies, with women’s\nchildlessness patterns increasingly resembling those of men—a marked shift in the region’s fertility\nlandscape.",

          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Rosche",
          "abstract": "Coalition research increasingly emphasizes party-level explanations of coalition outcomes. However, this work does not account for the complex multilevel structure between parties and governments: many parties participate in multiple governments and governments often comprise multiple parties. In this paper, I show that this crisscrossing structure creates dependencies among observations both across and within governments. If ignored, these dependencies produce downward-biased uncertainty estimates that cluster-robust standard errors fail to fully correct. To address this issue, I then introduce a model that extends the Multiple Membership Multilevel Model to represent the multilevel structure of coalition government data. The model accounts for party-level dependencies across governments through party-specific effects in each coalition they join, and for dependencies within governments by representing the total party effect on a government as a weighted sum of its members’ contributions. By allowing party weights to vary with covariates describing their interrelationships, the model enables researchers to examine the interdependent nature of coalition outcomes. I validate the model through simulation and an empirical application to coalition government survival, showing that ignoring party-level dependencies can produce misleading conclusions at all levels of analysis. The model is estimated via Bayesian MCMC and implemented in the accompanying R package ‘bmlm’.",

A large number of studies use observational data to estimate these gaps, typically by controlling for potentially confounding factors and interpreting the coefficient of the group variable (e.g. female) as the degree of discrimination. However, estimations in this manner require choices both with regards to sample selection as well as the selection of variables to control for the stages where researchers assume discrimination to occur. Against the backdrop of the literature on gender wage gaps, this research note discusses these choices, their impact on the interpretation of the results and provides recommendations for applied researchers on how to deal with these choices in practice.",

          "abstract": "Background: Handloom weaving is a critical source of rural employment in Bangladesh but entails high ergonomic risk, predisposing workers to upper extremity repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). Evidence on prevalence and determinants of RSIs in Bangladeshi handloom workers is limited. Objective: To determine the prevalence, anatomical distribution, and predictors of upper extremity RSIs among handloom weavers in Tangail district. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 303 male handloom workers in Pathrail Union, Delduar Upazila. Data were collected via structured interviews and the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Socio-demographic, occupational, and ergonomic factors were assessed. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of RSIs. Results: The prevalence of RSIs was highest in the neck (60.7%), shoulders (56.8%), and wrists (55.8%). Repetitive movements ≥4 hours/day, awkward posture, prolonged working hours, low income, and limited education were independently associated with RSIs. Prevalence increased with years of experience: 58.7% (&lt;10 years), 72.2% (10–20 years), and 85.9% (&gt;20 years). Severe cases often required job modification and had multi-site involvement. Conclusion: Upper extremity RSIs are highly prevalent among Bangladeshi handloom workers, reflecting a combination of ergonomic strain and socio-economic vulnerability. Interventions targeting workplace ergonomics, work hours, and socio-economic support are essential to safeguard worker health and sustain the handloom sector.",

          "abstract": "Philanthrocapitalism, defined as the application of market-based logics and tools to philanthropic practice, has become increasingly prominent in the United Kingdom. While existing scholarship has largely examined philanthrocapitalism as an ideology, relatively little attention has been paid to how funders themselves understand and engage with these approaches. This paper addresses this gap through an exploratory qualitative study of 28 UK funders. Using written interviews, sentiment analysis, and thematic coding, the study identifies four recurring themes in funder perspectives: pragmatic adoption, loyalty to traditional grantmaking, contextual constraints, and resistance to the term “philanthrocapitalism” itself. By foregrounding funder perspectives, this paper provides a first exploration of how philanthrocapitalism is operationalised in the UK context and highlights implications for philanthrocapitalists and sector practitioners regarding opportunities for sector training necessary for effective adoption of philanthrocapitalist approaches.",

This framework proposes consciousness as an emergent system that develops through subconscious absorption of environmental behavioral patterns and genetic interpretive processing. Preliminary evidence suggests infants demonstrate behavioral competence before developing reflective self awareness, indicating sophisticated unconscious systems preceding conscious interface construction. Neural timing studies consistently show unconscious decision initiation before conscious awareness, though interpretations remain debated. The proposed theory includes three hypotheses: temporal precedence of unconscious processing, environmental construction of conscious identity, and neural interface formation through absorbed behavioral patterns. This theoretical investigation addresses questions about cognitive architecture while acknowledging substantial empirical limitations requiring further research. Testing these predictions would advance understanding of consciousness architecture and unconscious processing mechanisms while informing methodological approaches across multiple psychological domains, regardless of whether the specific theoretical framework receives empirical support.",

          "abstract": "Credit claiming, where legislators highlight their role in bringing home federal spending projects to their district, has been shown to offer electoral value in an array of studies. However, congressional messaging on distributive politics expands beyond credit claiming. Distributive policy moves in two directions – new spending and budget cuts – leading to more types of messaging than are currently explored. Legislators often claim credit for protecting existing initiatives (protection messages) and speak out against decisions to cut district projects (commiseration messages). We develop a theory of distributive politics that incorporates the full range of congressional messaging on federal spending. Using an\nonline survey experiment, we find that constituents are receptive to protection and commiseration messages. In fact, protection and commiseration messages are no less effective than traditional credit claims and announcement messages, respectively. These findings suggest distributive politics is about more than displaying influence; it provides legislators with a window for recognizing constituent needs, even in the absence of positive policy outcomes.",

Building on classic debates about using computers to analyze qualitative data, we revisit longstanding concerns and assess possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, AI chatbots, and \"big data.\" We first historicize developments by revisiting classical and emergent concerns about qualitative analysis with computers. We then introduce a typology of contemporary modes of engagement—streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical approaches, and the sociology of computation—alongside rejection of computational analyses. We illustrate these approaches with detailed workflow examples from a large-scale ethnographic study and guidance for solo researchers. We argue for a pragmatic sociological approach that moves beyond dualisms of technological optimism versus rejection to show how computational tools—simultaneously dangerous and generative—can be adapted to support longstanding qualitative aims when used carefully in ways aligned with core methodological commitments.",

Despite their apparent advantages in overcoming model misspecification, these methods are rarely used by social scientists. It is also unclear whether these methods actually outperform more traditional methods in finite samples. This paper has two aims: It is a guide to some of the latest methods in double robust, flexible covariate adjustment using machine learning, and it tests them against more traditional statistical methods and flexible \"single robust\" methods using simulated, cross-sectional data where the treatment effect is known. Double robust methods covered include Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). Results suggest that these methods do outperform traditional methods in a wide range of simulations, but only when paired with flexible machine learning estimators. Notably, G-computation with the same flexible estimators obtains almost identical results, and standard regression methods have only slightly higher bias. In the scenarios considered in this paper, flexibility and robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects appear to be more important properties than double robustness.",

Adding to an emerging literature on the effects of AI exposure, I show that higher educated workers indeed feel that they are at risk of technological redundancy, and that these perceptions are related to objective exposure to AI technology. Specifically, I combine comparative survey data on workers’ subjective technological vulnerability with indicators of objective industry-level AI exposure and find a U-shaped pattern among higher educated workers: There is high perceived vulnerability in some “traditional” automation-exposed sectors (e.g., manufacturing) but also in a group of strongly AI-exposed white-collar industries (finance, real estate, IT), with a remaining pocket of low vulnerability in strongly interpersonal sectors (e.g., education, healthcare). These findings have broader societal and political implications, namely that further advancement in AI technology may contribute to a de-polarization of social risk and thus create the basis for new cross-class coalitions and social solidarity – but it may also reinforce current authoritarian tendencies.",

          "abstract": "From its beginning, naturalization in the United States had been a largely informal, lightly regulated process; this system was upended by the Naturalization Act of 1906, eventuating in place the far more complicated naturalization procedures that have persisted to this day. Prior research argues that this new law achieved its desired goal of deterring citizenship acquisition among the least desired and least resourced immigrants. However, it also changed the value of citizenship wherein immigrants who may have been found citizenship least desirable decided to become a citizen more quickly given various alienage penalties. To understand how naturalization unfolded under these new conditions, this paper draws on a new hand-coded sample from a novel dataset of declaration of intent to naturalize forms and petition to naturalize forms to the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses. We then incorporate hand-coded information uniquely available in the naturalization documents, such as detailed place of birth, height, and complexion. We analyze the speed with which applicants for citizenship moved through the different steps of the naturalization process. Despite mixed results, we find more evidence in support of a defensive naturalization hypothesis, with immigrants with less desirable traits at the time naturalizing more quickly.",

          "abstract": "Soma, the sacred plant of the Rigveda, and its Iranian counterpart Haoma in the Avesta, have long remained shrouded in mystery. While earlier scholarship identified Soma with various candidates such as Amanita muscaria, Ephedra, Cannabis, and Peganum harmala, no consensus has emerged. This study offers a multidisciplinary approach, combining textual analysis, fieldwork in the Kutch region of India, and comparative ethnobotany. A plant identified as Vernonia cinerascens Sch. Bip. is proposed as a strong candidate for Soma/Haoma. Its morphology—woody stems, arrow-like shoots, tawny coloration, and leafy sprigs—corresponds closely with Rigvedic and Avestan descriptions. Experimental pressing of its branches produced a golden-tawny juice, accompanied by the crackling sound noted in Vedic hymns. Experiential trials confirmed psychoactive and healing effects resembling those praised in the hymns, such as relaxation, enhanced concentration, relief from pain, and states of calm joy. The plant’s known medicinal properties in African ethnobotany, especially for mental disorders and depression, further validate these findings. Comparative analysis with Assyrian “Sacred Tree” iconography and Zoroastrian Barsom ritual suggests a broader Near Eastern continuity of sacred plant traditions. Together, textual, ethnobotanical, and experiential evidence support the case that Vernonia cinerascens Sch. Bip may represent the long-lost Soma of Indo-Iranian antiquity.",

These games invite players to experiment with climate crisis solutions, fostering learning by placing them in the role of powerful decision-makers confronting challenges such as achieving net-zero CO₂ by 2050 while maintaining full employment. Learning is shaped by three characteristics: offering curated choices, delivering immediate and vivid feedback, and manipulating time. Yet limitations such as restricted choice and ideological bias make reflection essential. Informal online spaces, including discussion forums, host debates on political visions and the realism of in-game simulations, offering blueprints for integrating digital games into climate action education.",

          "abstract": "Is it possible to forecast the dynamics of societal resilience and its obverse, sociopolitical unrest or even breakdown? This is the goal of Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT), which integrates mechanism-based models with data and focuses on the dynamics of structural drivers for instability over the long-term (thus, requiring a historical approach). Several recent studies utilizing the SDT framework have proven adept at predicting (or “retrodicting”) sociopolitical instability in c.20 past societies. It was also used in 2010 to successfully forecast the outbreak of US instability for 10 years in the future (in 2020). This study applies the SDT to explore the dynamics of another contemporary society. Our aim is to empirically test SDT in a most rigorous way, using it to forecast future dynamics of sociopolitical instability in Japan. Our research questions are: (1) how accurately (if at all) does the SDT framework predict future levels of sociopolitical instability; (2) What are the relative contributions of possible drivers of instability, including those proposed by SDT, as well as other theories, in explaining instability levels; and (3) are there key ‘leverage points’ that might help mitigate the negative consequences of instability? This article explains how we develop quantitative indices for SDT drivers of instability: mass immiseration, elite overproduction, and state fiscal distress. We then construct a Political Stress Index to track the evolution of these pressures from the 1990s to the present and implement a multipath forecasting model to project future trends through 2050, using a variety of intervention (or non-intervention) scenarios. Our plan is to revisit these predictions ten years in the future with the goal of assessing their accuracy.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates childhood geographical mobility and its effect on educational and early career outcomes in Finland. Through using population register data, it analyzes migration histories of individuals born from 1987 to 1990, tracking their outcomes until ages 30-33. Findings reveal that frequent relocations during school years often correlate with lower educational attainment—particularly pronounced for those moving multiple times. Notably, the adverse effects of mobility are somewhat attenuated when considering family circumstances prior to school-age and concurrent life-course events. Furthermore, the study critically examines potential implications for occupational attainment. While initial findings disclose negative associations, these adverse effects are reversed when controlling for concurrent events and individual’s highest educational level. This research thus provides new avenues to understand how geographical mobility in childhood can influence educational and professional trajectories.",

This study aimed to examine changes in offending trajectories and youth justice system contact among Australian adolescents with a proven offence aged 10 to 16 years across 12 consecutive birth cohorts (1995 to 2006), in Queensland, Australia. Findings indicate that the number of adolescents with a proven offence decreased by 44%, and the number sentenced to a supervised order decreased by 29%. Within recent birth cohorts of justice-involved adolescents, there were significant increases in high frequency and violent offending, and in days spent in custody. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify offending trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that recent cohorts of justice-involved adolescents were significantly more likely to display moderate or chronic offending trajectories, than low-level offending.",

          "abstract": "This paper theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the paper reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.",

          "abstract": "The global trade in electronic and electrical goods is complicated by the challenge of identifying e-waste, which is often misclassified to evade regulations. Traditional analysis methods struggle to discern the underlying patterns of this illicit trade within vast datasets. This research proposes and validates a robust, data-driven framework to segment products and identify goods exhibiting an anomalous \"waste signature\" a trade pattern defined by a clear 'inverse price-volume'. The core of the framework is an Outlier-Aware Segmentation method, an iterative K-Means approach that first isolates extreme outliers to prevent data skewing and then re-clusters the remaining products to reveal subtle market segments. To quantify risk, a \"Waste Score\" is developed using a Logistic Regression model that identifies products whose trade signatures are statistically similar to scrap. The findings reveal a consistent four-tier market hierarchy in both Malaysian and global datasets. A key pattern emerged from a comparative analysis: Malaysia's market structure is defined by high-volume bulk commodities, whereas the global market is shaped by high-value capital goods, indicating a unique national specialization. The framework successfully flags finished goods, such as electric generators (HS 8502), that are traded like scrap, providing a targeted list for regulatory scrutiny.",

          "abstract": "Despite the widespread health risks associated with environmental hazards, the public display of real-time environmental health information remains relatively sparse. Existing displays tend to rely on static, number-heavy formats and scientific frameworks that may be inaccessible to diverse audiences. This paper presents findings from the AWAIR project, which employed participatory and artistic co-design methods to reimagine the display of public air pollution information in three neighborhoods across London, UK. Through collaborative workshops with residents, the study explored how individuals articulate informational needs and emotional responses to air pollution, how these evolve through dialogue, and how this can inform the public display of environmental phenomena. This research demonstrates how artistic artifacts, employed as ‘boundary objects’, created space for participants to express and negotiate diverse values, experiences, and concerns that ranged from health protection to aesthetic and symbolic resonance.  Rather than seeking consensus, the co-design process embraced productive friction among science, diverse lived experiences, and personal approaches to sense-making. Participants generated a range of display concepts, including smiley face icons, color codes, and heart imagery, illustrating the potential for affective, accessible, and context-sensitive communication. However, the process also surfaced tensions tied to the technological infrastructures conventionally relied upon to define air pollution, as well as assumptions about scientific and digital literacy. This work underscores the need for ongoing, iterative, and inclusive design practices that foreground creativity and co-creation. By centering diverse publics in environmental communication design, such approaches can render air quality information exchange more meaningful, democratic, and just.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a generic machine learning-based pipeline for nominative linkage of records within and across large-scale Chinese historical datasets. The pipeline addresses key challenges, including character variations, incomplete data, and scalability issues specific to historical datasets in which names and other attributes are recorded with Chinese characters, not just for China, but potentially for Korea, Japan and Vietnam. Techniques developed for attributes recorded in phonetic alphabets are of limited usefulness for Chinese characters not only because homonyms are common, but characters that are similar enough in appearance to be frequently mistaken for each other may sound completely different. Our approach integrates stroke-based character embeddings for efficient blocking, supervised classification with active learning for record matching, and graph-based clustering for final linkage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline using the career records of officials in the China Government Employee Database-Qing Jinshenlu (CGED-Q JSL) as a test case. We achieve improved linkage quality compared to standard probabilistic methods, with substantially longer linked sequences of career records and fewer aberrant transitions. To validate the generalizability, we also successfully apply the pipeline to another database and a cross-database linkage task. By minimizing the need for manual tuning, our pipeline offers a more accessible and effective solution for Chinese historical data linkage.",

          "abstract": "Discipline has traditionally been approached as external enforcement, yet coercion and punishment rarely yield lasting transformation. This paper advances a new model in which forgiveness and permanence are identified as the neurobiological preconditions of effective discipline. Forgiveness collapses conflict into coherence through anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)–prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulation of amygdala-driven hostility, while permanence consolidates forgiveness into enduring relational stability. Together, these processes produce discipline as an emergent property of resolution and stabilization rather than fear or control. Drawing on neuroscience, psychology, and resilience research, the model predicts that forgiveness without permanence leads to fragility, permanence without forgiveness results in brittleness, and only their integration generates sustainable order. Applications span clinical psychology, education, criminal justice, and public health, offering testable hypotheses for neuroimaging and longitudinal research. By reframing discipline as the integration of forgiveness and permanence, this framework situates discipline as a pathway to resilience and transgenerational thriving.",

Emphasizing “aesthetic responsibility,” the book addresses ethical considerations and underscores the relational power of artistic processes to foster meaningful change. While grounded in the 1990s, its foundational principles resonate with current realities of political polarization, global conflict, and collective trauma, illustrating the continued relevance of an embodied, creative framework. Future directions include deeper cultural adaptation and exploration of digital modalities, yet Minstrels of Soul remains an enduring cornerstone for professionals seeking holistic, arts-based approaches to individual and communal healing.",

By\nforegrounding heteroglossia, we resist linear arguments and instead situate meaning “in the\nmiddle,” revealing how dialogic interplay and collective improvisation shape knowledge. The\ncarnival atmosphere, marked by comic subversions and open-ended acts, challenges rigid\nboundaries between personal memory, scholarly theory, and cultural artifacts. Rather than\nconcluding with definitive statements, the performance encourages ongoing mashups and\nreinterpretations, affirming duoethnography’s commitment to reflexive, relational practice and\ncelebrating the dynamic interplay that keeps research alive and evolving.",

Wicked problems such as climate change, pandemics, and systemic inequality cannot be reasoned about through intuition or traditional data displays alone. This paper situates spatial computing, meaning technologies such as Virtual, Augmented, and Extended Reality, within the historical trajectory of cognitive artefacts including language, writing, mathematics, and mapping. Drawing on the concept of exaptation, it argues that spatial computing can repurpose evolved perceptual systems to interpret complex, high-dimensional data. Recent research prototypes illustrate how immersive environments enable users to “walk through” dimensionality-reduced datasets, annotate evolving multidimensional changes, and collaborate in shared data spaces, thereby making otherwise abstract information perceptible and actionable. As with literacy and numeracy in earlier centuries, the democratic value of spatial computing will depend on equitable access, institutional integration, and critical scrutiny. Far from a technological luxury, spatial computing should be understood as a civic necessity - an essential scaffold for collective reasoning amid the deluge of data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a widely used chain‑referral method for surveying hidden or hard‑to‑reach populations. While it has theoretical advantages over other non‑probabilistic methods, there is limited empirical evidence on the accuracy of its estimators when benchmarked against complete population data.\nMethods: We conducted a GPS‑verified, smartphone‑based RDS survey in York, England, in September–October 2024. The target sample size was 800 residents aged 16 or over; 807 eligible responses were obtained from six recruitment seeds over up to 44 waves. The survey collected demographic, socio‑economic, and health information aligned with the 2021 Census, along with personal network size and some network composition data. RDS‑I, RDS‑II, and Successive Sampling estimators were applied, and results were compared with Census 2021 benchmarks.\nResults: For many variables, RDS estimates diverged markedly from census values, and 95% confidence intervals often failed to include the true value. Deviations from the at‑random recruitment assumption were evident, particularly for sex and ethnicity, and appeared to be a major source of bias. Incorporating self‑reported network composition reduced bias in the estimate of the variable for which network composition information was collected.\nConclusions: In this real‑world test, standard RDS estimators did not produce consistently accurate estimates. Violations of the random recruitment assumption were a likely cause. Network composition‑based estimation offers a promising alternative but requires further testing and methodological refinement. Enhancing RDS systems to monitor subgroup representation in real time and applying weighting adjustments to address complex recruitment homophily could improve estimator performance.",

          "abstract": "The approach to federalist and non-federalist countries has always attracted considerable attention from the academic community. Regional development is directly related to the levels and type of decentralisation model that each country actually adopts. In this approach, I analyse centralised and non-centralised countries in a comparative manner, with a strong emphasis on countries with a federal decentralisation model. Thus, the analysis shows that there is greater economic concentration in a single city, such as the capital, which is responsible for the political and economic decisions of the other regions. Centralised countries also have less capacity for economic transformation, due to the lack of fiscal decentralisation, which should in fact promote greater tax revenue collection. On the other hand, the approach also analyses lower political participation and exclusive democracy regions at lower subnational levels with less capacity for democratic participation. On the other hand, the analysis effectively shows that most federated countries, their states and municipalities, through fiscal decentralisation, promote greater economic transformation and greater democratic plurality. However, federated countries are those that manage to achieve greater macroeconomic stability, evidenced by a larger tax base. There is also evidence to suggest that there is in fact greater sustainable economic growth in federal countries.",

          "authors": "Nerhum Sandambi",
          "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

          "title": "Fiscal decentralisation, inclusion and regional competitiveness:  Evidence for a federalism model",
          "authors": "Nerhum Sandambi",
          "abstract": "Through more assertive fiscal decentralisation, the starting point is to analyse in a plausible manner the main implications that are in fact related to its application in a federalist model context. Thus, unitary states in particular do not in fact have evidence of ensuring better fiscal inclusion capacity in their territories. Thus, in this particular approach, I propose significant fiscal decentralisation. The approach shows that, through Structural Imbalance Correction Mechanisms, it is possible to guarantee greater growth dynamics for regions with lower potential. however, regions with lower potential will in fact be the regions that should nevertheless grow significantly in a progressive manner. There is, however, other evidence that contributes to making regions more attractive through a more inclusive fiscal policy. The approach also shows that municipalities with lower attractiveness potential will in fact tend to attract to their territory, as a fiscal headquarters, a group of companies capable of driving a transformation dynamic through significant increases in tax incentives and, in fact, leading their respective regions to greater fiscal and structural sustainability in particular.",

          "title": "Language: Shame, Emotion, and the Limits of Expression",
          "authors": "Brian Lynch",
          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThis essay explores the fundamental inadequacy of language in expressing and mediating human emotion, arguing that its limits are often affective rather than purely logical. Drawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, Silvan Tomkins' affect psychology, and recent neuroscience concerning the habenula, the piece demonstrates how language, as a later evolutionary tool, is \"pasted on\" an ancient, pre-linguistic affective system primarily designed for survival. Concrete examples, such as intimate relationship conflicts, illustrate how words often fail to capture the \"braided\" nature of emotions, leading to misunderstanding and defense mechanisms. The essay further posits that this affective-linguistic mismatch is exacerbated in contemporary society by the fragmentation of shared multiple inputs, leading to a dangerous divergence of meaning in symbols and discourse. Ultimately, by understanding that affect is primary and that our bodies \"feel\" before we \"speak,\" the essay advocates for a shift towards greater awareness of our internal states—informed by what music and poetry have always intuitively expressed about affective truth—to foster more gentle, deliberate, and effective communication, moving beyond the illusion of linguistic clarity.",
