          "authors": "Sterling Williams-Ceci; Wendy M. Williams",
          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a booming part of the technology industry, and college students majoring in disciplines such as Computer and Information Sciences are increasingly pursuing lucrative jobs to develop AI applications for major companies. However, research is unveiling harmful effects of AI products, which limit people’s freedom of thought. AI developers are largely failing to anticipate these harms as companies incentivize quick rollouts and profitable products. We review the literature revealing AI’s cognitive harms, arguing that they are partially caused by students failing to exercise wisdom once they join the workforce. We propose strategies for STEM educators to encourage the development of STEM wisdom in their students, modeled after Sternberg’s (2024c) 8-step process of ethical reasoning. This article provides a practical guide to educators, with actionable recommendations to prevent further downstream harms of AI products their students build.",

          "authors": "Brice Brossette; Bernard Lété",
          "abstract": "This study explores the impact of visually similar flanking stimuli on central target words using the Flanking Letter Lexical Decision (FLLD) task. Specifically, we investigated whether visual similarity effects can explain orthographic relatedness effects observed in previous FLLD tasks. By employing non-reversal mirror letters as visual flankers, we compared their influence on response times to traditional orthographic-related and orthographic-unrelated conditions. Results confirmed the known facilitative effect of orthographic-related flankers on response times (ROCK ROCK ROCK). However, mirror-related conditions showed no facilitative effect (ROCK ROCK ROCK), as evidenced by a Bayesian analysis indicating no significant differences between mirror-related and mirror-unrelated (STEP ROCK STEP). These findings suggest that low-level visual information in the parafovea does not contribute to the processing of the foveal word in tasks requiring specific word identification. The study concludes that only parafoveal information with relevant linguistic content is spatially pooled across target and flankers during word identification tasks. This research highlights the need to consider task-specific attentional demands and the linguistic relevance of parafoveal information in understanding visual and orthographic processing in reading.",

          "authors": "Manh-Toan Ho",
          "abstract": "The rapid growth of video games as important cultural and economic forces has sparked a clear interest in making the industry more environmentally friendly. One of the prominent examples is the push for green gaming. However, the movement has not successfully taken off. Academically, the term “green gaming” is being used interchangeably between other terms such as “ecological games,” or “ecogames.” The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to systematically examine the question of what is green gaming? Searching from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other sources, the author have found 50 eligible documents of various types such as books, articles, doctoral theses. Systematic review of these documents highlights a sparse and understudied nature of the topic video games and environments. Moreover, there is also a lack of clear definition and distinction between various terminologies, which leads to the abovementioned interchanged use of different terminologies in both academic and public writings. In conclusion, the study suggests the term “green gaming” should be understood as an aspect of the green consumption movement.",

          "authors": "Conor Houghton",
          "abstract": "Cedric Boeckx’s monograph 'Reflections on language evolution: From minimalism to pluralism' is an entertaining and useful introduction to recent advances in biological approaches to the evolutionary origin of our language ability. It can be read as a reminder of the need for more tolerance and diversity in our approach to linguistic research. However, its central thesis is more ambitious and controversial than this: it seeks to reformulate the field by suggesting that linguistics should be centred on the problem of how our language ability evolved. It also promotes the belief that this language ability is best studied as a collection of individual skills and it suggests that the method best suited to this problem is the use of paleo-genetic evidence. This review highlights this interpretation of the monograph and offers a critique of this perspective by suggesting that the structure and cognitive properties of language should remain our focus.

          "abstract": "It has been suggested that tactical breathing may reduce acute stress for police officers and thus lead to more optimal performance in critical situations. We tested the effect of a brief intervention on task performance in a simulated training scenario. Ninety-six advanced police students participated in a preregistered between-group experiment during a simulated training scenario. Expert observers evaluated performance, and participants reported their level of stress. The results showed that stress was associated with lower performance. The participants that used tactical breathing performed better than the control group, while it did not change their self-reported stress. This could indicate that tactical breathing improves performance by increasing focus and attention.",

          "title": "Controlling for careless responding requires causal justification",
          "authors": "Taym Alsalti; Jamie Cummins; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Careless responding is defined as a pattern of responding to survey items that reflects a latent construct distinct from—and disruptive of—the measurement of the primary construct of interest. In the social science literature, these response patterns are sometimes labeled “insufficient effort,” “unserious,” or “bogus, among other terms.”The issue of such responses has been gaining in relevance as research data are increasingly collected through anonymous online surveys. Standard practice calls for identifying careless responders and excluding them from the data. The common reasoning behind this approach is that such responses can bias “descriptive” statistics (e.g., sample means) and effect size estimates / measures of associations (e.g., correlations and  standardised mean difference) as well as increase measurement error. When they confound our causal effect of interest, deleting or adjusting for careless responses is justified. However, using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that different careless responding patterns can plausibly take on the role of a mediator, a collider, or both simultaneously, among others. Given this, we argue that, in contrast to previous calls, there cannot be a general rule about how to deal with careless responses and that greater attention to their data-generating mechanism from a causal perspective is necessary.",

          "authors": "Semih Can Aktepe; Daniel W. Heck",
          "abstract": "Fluency theory assumes that perceived truth is influenced by the subjective ease with which presented information is processed. Several studies have demonstrated that increased perceptual fluency, induced by high versus low color contrast of presented statements, results in higher truth judgments. According to the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, the unexpected switch from several low-fluency stimuli to a high-fluency stimulus is assumed to enhance perceived truthfulness. In two online studies (one preregistered), we aimed to replicate the central finding by Hansen, Dechêne, and Wänke (2008; Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) that discrepancies in color contrast influence truth judgments. Additionally, we extended the original design by varying the length of stimulus blocks presented in low or high color contrast. Contrary to previous findings, neither the level of perceptual fluency nor unexpected discrepancies in fluency affected truth judgments even though high-contrast statements were read faster than low-contrast ones, indicating that processing fluency was successfully manipulated. A meta-analysis combining our two experiments with published studies shows that the effect of perceptual fluency induced by color contrast on truth judgments may not be as robust as previously thought.",

          "authors": "Giovanni Pezzulo; Günther Knoblich; Domenico Maisto; Francesco Donnarumma; Elisabeth Pacherie; Uri Hasson",
          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

Conceptual structures for household items (HHIs) and vegetables &amp; fruits (VFs) of three Chinese child groups (ages 3-4, 5-6, 8-9, N = 196, 100 females) and adults (N = 40, 25 females) were inferred from a spatial arrangement task and compared to those encoded by embodied (sensorimotor, social-cognitive) and language models. Findings indicate that influences of embodied and linguistic systems on conceptual organizations grow with age, showing increased alignment with adults and greater consistency within age groups. VFs mature earlier with stronger language influence, while HHIs rely more on embodied information. The findings advance understanding of conceptual refinement, highlighting continuous embodied and linguistic influences across development.",

          "authors": "Anna Kanaki Nakamura; Akihiro Tanaka",
          "abstract": "Facial mimicry is known to play an important role in emotional communication. While major models of facial mimicry assume a relationship between facial mimicry and emotion recognition, the empirical evidence for such a relationship is mixed. In this study, the facial movements of the same participants were compared when they recognized the same uncertain faces as “happiness” or “anger.” When faces were expressing anger in the upper half (upper anger) and happiness in the lower half (lower happiness), participants responded that it is “happiness” in some trials and “anger” in others. The electromyography data showed that the participants frowned more when they recognized anger in the upper anger and lower happiness faces than when they recognized happiness in the same face (Experiment 1). By presenting the upper and lower half of expression individually, we confirmed that upper anger and lower happiness were both salient in the expression intensity and that both the upper and lower half of the faces were individually inducing congruent facial movements (Experiment 2). Though there were limitations including the relatively small sample size, this study revealed a relationship between facial mimicry and emotion recognition at a within-individual level. These findings aid in further understanding social interaction at an unconscious and physical level.",

          "abstract": "While generative artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to technological advances in the mental health field, it poses safety risks for mental health service consumers. Furthermore, clinicians and healthcare systems must attend to safety and ethical considerations prior to deploying these AI-mental health technologies. To ensure the responsible deployment of AI-mental health applications, a principled method for evaluating and reporting on AI-mental health applications is needed. We conducted a narrative review of existing frameworks and criteria (from the mental health, healthcare, and AI fields) relevant to the evaluation of AI-mental health applications. We provide a summary and analysis of these frameworks, with a particular emphasis on the unique needs of the AI-mental health intersection. Existing frameworks contain areas of convergence (e.g., frequent emphasis on safety, privacy/confidentiality, effectiveness, and equity) that are relevant to the evaluation of AI-mental health applications. However, current frameworks are insufficiently tailored to unique considerations for AI and mental health. To address this need, we introduce the Readiness Evaluation for AI-Mental Health Deployment and Implementation (READI) framework for mental health applications. The READI framework comprises considerations of Safety, Privacy/Confidentiality, Equity, Effectiveness, Engagement, and Implementation. The READI framework outlines key criteria for assessing the readiness of AI-mental health applications for clinical deployment, offering a structured approach for evaluating these technologies and reporting findings.",

          "abstract": "Bühler et al.’s meta-analytic results clarify that the mere occurrence of life events is relatively unimportant for explaining personality trait development. We make two points in this commentary. First, personality theory has already integrated the distinction between life events and subjective experiences on personality change. Second, methodological limitations of our longitudinal research may hamper our understanding of these associations. To further clarify the role of life events and subjective experiences for trait change, we advocate for intensive longitudinal designs that can reliably distinguish between temporary and enduring change.",

          "abstract": "What makes Mandarin tones challenging for second language (L2) learners? Several recent studies suggest that two phonological universals, the Obligatory Contour Principle and the Tonal Markedness Scale, may constrain the L2 acquisition of Mandarin lexical tones, regardless of learners' first language. We assessed the role of these universals in L2 tonal acquisition with a perceptual testing protocol, which implemented a number of methodological and analytical improvements relatively to previous studies: larger sample sizes, better matched stimuli, and the use of Bayesian statistics to assess support for the null hypothesis. The results provided evidence for the null effects of both phonological universals. Instead, a clear determinant of tonal identification accuracy was participants' pitch acuity, suggesting that domain-general auditory processing underlies the learning of L2 phonological categories.

          "abstract": "Questionable research practices (QRPs) pose a significant threat to the integrity and credibility of scientific research. However, historically, they remain ill-defined and a comprehensive list of QRPs is lacking. The article addresses this concern by defining, collecting, and categorizing QRPs using an expert consensus method. Collaborators of the study agreed on the following definition: “Questionable research practices (QRPs) are ways of producing, maintaining, sharing, analyzing, or interpreting data that are likely to produce misleading conclusions, typically in the interest of the researcher. QRPs are not normally considered to include research practices that are prohibited or proscribed in the researcher’s field (e.g., fraud, research misconduct). Neither do they include random/non-motivated researcher error (e.g., accidental data loss).” Drawing from both iterative discussions and existing literature, we collected, defined and categorized 40 QRPs. We also considered attributes such as potential harms, detectability, clues, and remedies for each QRP. The results suggest that QRPs are pervasive and versatile, and have the potential to undermine all stages of the scientific enterprise. This work contributes to the maintenance of research integrity, transparency, and reliability by raising awareness for and improving the understanding of QRPs.",

          "authors": "Andrew Devendorf; Julie Cristello; Cassandra L. Boness; Irene Tung",
          "abstract": "Mental health difficulties are prevalent among psychologists, yet trainees are often discouraged from disclosing their lived experience with psychopathology due to persistent stigma. For much of history, lived experience with psychopathology has been treated as a deficit within the profession. However, emerging research and perspectives are beginning to challenge this status quo by highlighting that lived experience can be an asset in psychological science and practice. Despite this shift, there remains little guidance on how to navigate this topic in mentor-mentee relationships. In this commentary, we outline a strengths-based, cultural humility framework for mentorship of psychologists with lived experience that incorporates principles of feminist mentoring. The framework emphasizes empowerment, mutual respect, and equity (feminist principles), as well as commitments to openness to experience, self-awareness, lifelong learning, perspective-taking, and valuing expertise via experience (cultural humility principles). Moving beyond a deficits-view of psychopathology, we provide practical guidance across common professional scenarios: recruiting applicants, evaluating personal statements, and navigating situations when a mentee is distressed, requesting accommodations, or interested in leveraging their lived experiences in their work. By offering this framework and corresponding professional scenarios, we aim to facilitate dialogue on mentoring trainees with lived experience of psychopathology.",

          "authors": "Nicole Stucke; Sabine Doebel",
          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that girls as young as four years of age in the US are affected by negative gender-science stereotypes and persist less than boys on science tasks. However, it is not clear whether these differences are found in the absence of specific contextual cues that amplify stereotype threat and, to date, no studies have tested the presumed link between stereotypes and science task persistence. The reported preregistered study tested whether there are gender differences among children on a physical sink-or-float science task and explored whether science task persistence is related to gender-science stereotyping at this age. One-hundred-and-nine 5- to 7-year-old children were recruited from a mid-sized suburban community in the Eastern United States (58% White, 9% Asian, 3% Latinx, 2% Black/African American, 28% mixed race/ethnicity; average socioeconomic status above the national average). No gender difference in persistence on the sink-or-float task was detected. A Bayesian analysis indicated moderate support for the null hypothesis of no gender effect. Instead, task accuracy and enjoyment predicted persistence. There was evidence that children held gender-STEM stereotypes; however, stereotyping was not related to persistence on the science task. Restricting the analysis to children who experienced failure early on in the task did not change the results. These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies, with specific recommendations for future research to understand when and why gender differences in science persistence emerge.",

Children in particular are unlikely to internalize plans effectively. Therefore, we developed PROMPT, a planning app for children. We designed three learning activities, including a passive reading activity, an active recall activity, and a generative activity. Children (N = 106, 9-14 years) used PROMPT for 27 days to memorize one plan per day, alternating between these activities. Unexpectedly, neither the active recall activity nor the generative activity was associated with better overall recall than the passive activity. Only children who spent more time on these activities benefited from them, which in turn was predicted by children’s grade level and analogical reasoning ability. Our findings suggest that it depends on children’s prerequisites how effectively they are able or willing to engage in more cognitively demanding learning activities.",

          "abstract": "Disorders of decreased sound tolerance such as misophonia and hyperacusis cause significant distress through strong negative emotional and physiological reactions to everyday sounds. These conditions have been associated with poor mental and physical health as they impact day to day life. Prior to the recent development of consensus definitions of misophonia and hyperacusis, attempts to determine the prevalence of these conditions have been hindered by the ambiguity and inconsistency of their descriptions. Despite this, certain populations have been suggested to more frequently experience misophonia and hyperacusis, namely younger people and autistic people. Furthermore, there has been conflicting evidence regarding whether these conditions are more prevalent among women. Post-secondary campuses are often sensory-rich. As such, students with misophonia and hyperacusis are likely to experience distress. For this reason, we sought to investigate the prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis in a Canadian university sample, and explore the relations between these conditions and gender, autistic traits, and overall social competence. As exposure to many everyday sounds can be highly aversive for individuals with misophonia and/or hyperacusis, these individuals often attempt to avoid environments in which distressing sounds are encountered. It is therefore possible that poorer social competence may be a secondary effect of these conditions. To investigate these relations, 2080 students completed an online survey using multiple established self-report measures of decreased sound tolerance. Clinical misophonia was detected in 12 – 18% of participants, and hyperacusis in 6-17%. Both conditions were significantly more prevalent among women than men. Both conditions were found to be weakly to moderately positively correlated with autistic traits, and weakly to moderately negatively correlated with social competence. These results highlight decreased sound tolerance as a significant issue at Canadian post-secondary institutions, calling for steps to be taken to mitigate its effects.",

Generally, the average effects of personality traits in young adulthood and the additive effects of impulsigenic traits and cognition in late childhood demonstrate the utility of integrating personality and cognition to understand incidence of early onset EXT. Although interaction effects were detected, they were small and practically negligible in their explanation of variance in externalizing behaviors. Results support primarily focusing on additively integrating these literatures to understand the individual differences related to externalizing behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Using social media data, the present study documents how three successive upheavals: the COVID pandemic, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests of 2020, and the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 interacted to impact the cognitive, emotional, and social styles of people in the US. Text analyses were conducted on 45,225,895 Reddit comments from 2,451,289 users and 889,402 news headlines from four news sources. Results revealed significant shifts in language related to self-focus (e.g., first-person singular pronouns), collective-focus (e.g., first-person plural pronouns), negative emotion (anxiety and anger words), and engagement (e.g., discussion of upheaval-related topics) after each event. Language analyses revealed how social justice-related upheavals (BLM, Roe v. Wade) affected people in very different ways emotionally than those that affected them personally (COVID). The onset of COVID made people increasingly anxious and caused them to turn inward to focus on their personal situations. However, BLM and the overturning of Roe v. Wade aroused anger and action as people looked beyond themselves to address these issues. Analysis of upheaval-related discussions captured the public’s sustained interest in BLM and COVID, whereas interest in Roe v. Wade declined relatively quickly. Shifts in discussions also showed how events interacted as people tended to focus on only one national event at a time, with interest in other events dampening when a new event occurred. The findings underscore the dynamic nature of culturally shared events that are apparent in everyday online language use.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a widely used non-invasive technique that aims to modulate neural activity and behaviour. However, the effects of tACS are rather inconsistent and difficult to replicate. In this study, we seek to modulate alpha oscillations and further research on identifying the optimal conditions for observing reliable tACS-induced changes. Specifically, we investigated the effects of 10 Hz stimulation on alpha oscillations compared to 41 Hz stimulation in a within-subject experimental design. We chose a montage with the anode and cathodes spaced farther apart to generate stronger electric fields at the expense of focality. Participants performed an oddball version of the standard vigilance task with a lateralized bias in motor responses, which is likely to engage alpha oscillations as they are thought to play a role in inhibitory control and lateralized attention management. Our findings revealed that the difference in alpha power enhancement between alpha and gamma stimulation was higher for the contralateral electrodes than the ipsilateral ones. This lateralized effect emerged despite our non-lateralized tACS electrode positioning, suggesting it may be due to the lateralized inhibitory motor planning involved in the task. Our results indicate that the effects of tACS on alpha oscillations are task-specific. Consequently, tACS researchers may opt for stronger electric fields, even at the cost of focality, as tasks could help direct tACS effects to specific brain areas.",

          "abstract": "We postulate a model of how students' motivational appraisals (expectancy, value, cost) before learning influence their observable engagement during learning and subsequent subjective perceptions of engagement after learning. The key hypothesis than can be derived from the model is that observable engagement during learning explains the relationships between motivational appraisals and perceived engagement at an intra-individual level. For an initial test of this model, we used log data from a mobile learning app that 189 fifth-graders (mean age 10.82 years) used to learn vocabulary, along with daily questionnaires over five weeks. In partial support of the model, expectancy and value appraisals explained unique variance in observable engagement, which in turn explained day-to-day variation in reported satisfaction and task delay. However, perceived effort was not related to observable engagement, and the associations between self-reports and observable engagement were generally rather weak. In sum, the model provides a promising platform for understanding the interplay between motivational appraisals, observable engagement and its subjective perception, which should be a key objective of motivation research.",

          "abstract": "Research in the retrospective memory domain has shown that individuals encode information less effortfully when expecting a reminder system (i.e., external store) to be available at test. Critically, this expectation leads to worse memory performance when the reminder is unexpectedly removed. The current study examined whether these findings extend to prospective memory (PM) intentions, which are thought to maintain a privileged status in memory and therefore may be less sensitive to expectancy effects. Participants formed the intention to make a special PM response to target items across four ongoing task blocks. Study duration (Exp. 1 and 3), pupil size (Exp. 2), and self-report (Exp. 1-3) indexed encoding effort while learning these targets. Participants had reminders available across the first three blocks (i.e., targets listed at the top of the screen), but not on the fourth. Critically, only one condition was informed that they would not have a reminder prior to encoding targets in the fourth block. Results showed that expecting a reminder lowered objective (Exp. 1 and 3) and subjective (Exp. 1-3) encoding effort and reduced unaided PM retrieval (Exp. 1-3) in the fourth block, independent of memory load (Exp. 3). Objective (Exp. 1 and 3) and subjective (Exp. 1-3) effort also partially mediated the influence of expectations on unaided PM retrieval. These findings suggest PM and retrospective memory encoding operate similarly and that participants can alter learning to more effectively commit PM targets to memory when reminders are not expected.",

The purpose of the current study was to better understand the mechanisms by which participants choose to offload prospective memory demands. Participants formed the intention to later respond to either one (low load) or four (high load) prospective memory targets with or without the use of reminders. During reminder trials, participants could press the “reminder” key to be shown the learned targets in a “lookup table”. The frequency of reminder checking was used to index the willingness to rely on external sources to support remembering. The utility of reminder checking was manipulated by varying the number of distractors presented in the lookup table (Experiment 1), implementing a time penalty for checking the table (Experiment 2), and explicitly describing the effectiveness of using reminders (Experiment 3). The results consistently showed that participants checked reminders more frequently under high memory load (i.e., 4 targets). Moreover, participants checked reminders less frequently when the costs associated with doing so increased (Experiments 2 and 3). However, confidence in one’s own memory ability was not associated with checking frequency. These findings suggest that participants choose to offload, at least in part, to reduce the time or effort to complete the task.",

What motivates people to share high-quality news and how can these motives be leveraged to promote news sharing? Based on the theory that self-related and social motives encourage sharing behavior, we designed and tested interventions to increase news sharing. In the interventions, individuals were exposed to actual news stories and were prompted to identify why the content was relevant to themselves (self-relevance) or people they know (social relevance). Across four studies (Nparticipants = 2,559, Nobservations = 18,780), we systematically examined the effectiveness of these interventions, their generalizability across news topics (climate change and health) and cultures (the United States of America and the Netherlands), their translation to more naturalistic contexts, and their underlying neuropsychological mechanisms. In all studies, we observed expected positive correlations among perceived self and social relevance and sharing intentions. In a neuroimaging study, we also observed corresponding increases in activity in self-referential and social cognitive brain regions. Using the content-framing interventions to test causal relationships, we found that the interventions increased sharing intentions and behavior. Furthermore, we observed generalizability across news topics and cultural contexts and translation to an ecologically valid news exposure context. These findings advance theory by adding neural and behavioral evidence that self-related and social motives prompt people to share information, and demonstrate the ability of content-framing interventions to harness these motives to encourage high-quality news sharing.",

Our method aims to elucidate personal idiolectic connections, providing a deeper understanding of the semantic landscape within and between individuals. This study analyzed group-level differences in the text of forum posts on a popular social media site and individual-level idiolect comparisons in OCD populations compared to more general population. Our results demonstrate significant differences in the semantic associations with the word \"attract\" between OCD users and general users. Specifically, OCD users exhibited more varied and less consistent associations, reflecting the diverse nature of their obsessions and compulsions, while general users showed more stable and uniform associations. Additionally, group-level comparisons between art and programming subgroups revealed significant differences in semantic distances in associations with the word “abstract,” indicating distinct word usage patterns across communities. These findings highlight the potential of Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics in uncovering meaningful differences in semantic relationships within clinical populations and online communities, both at group- and individual-level.",

          "abstract": "The polarity effect is one of the most robust effects in linguistics: Negative expressions are processed slower than corresponding positive ones. Decades of research has shown that this effect replicates for different types of negative expressions, however, its magnitude varies depending on the expression type. It has been argued that in addition to polarity, the downward monotonicity increases the cost of processing negative expressions. In this paper, we use computational modeling of data from a sentence-picture verification task to investigate the sources of the polarity effect by contrasting quantifiers ('more than half' vs. 'fewer than half') that differ in polarity and monotonicity with adjectives ('a large proportion' vs. 'a small proportion') that only differ in polarity.  We collected reaction times and response data in two web-based sentence-picture verification task experiments. Our reaction time analysis showed a larger polarity effect for quantifiers than adjectives, thus replicating a previously observed non cross-over interaction between polarity and expression type. In order to interpret this interaction with respect to semantic properties of these expressions, we fit scalinDDM, a modified version of the Diffusion Decision Model to the data.  We showed that the drift rate and non-decision time parameters were affected by polarity and that the effect on drift rate was larger for quantifiers than adjectives. This finding suggests that there is no exclusive mapping between semantic properties and the model's parameters. Nevertheless, our results show that the computational model enhances transparency between linguistic properties and the dependent variables in a sentence-picture verification experiment.\n\nWe showed that the drift rate and non-decision time parameters were affected by polarity, however, the effect in drift rate was larger for quantifiers than adjectives.

          "authors": "Lisa Harms; Tugce Varol; Gido Metz",
          "abstract": "In Intervention Mapping (IM) Step 6, evaluation takes place. In earlier IM steps, a planning group will have developed logic models to understand the health problem, and logic models of change on which the intervention is based. These logic models provide input for evaluators to develop evaluation questions. In terms of evaluation designs, there is a general distinction between effect evaluation and process evaluation. In effect evaluation, researchers determine whether the intervention is associated with changes in health, behavioral, or environmental outcomes, determinants, or performance objectives. Effect evaluation can be described as either efficacy or effectiveness. Efficacy refers to a program that is evaluated under controlled conditions, such as with motivated volunteers who participate in the program regardless of the time and effort required. Effectiveness refers to a program evaluated under real-world conditions, for example, with representatives of the at-risk group. Process evaluation seeks to describe how a program is implemented. Relevant questions related to process evaluation include whether an intervention was implemented as intended, for example in terms of adherence, whether contextual factors affected implementation, what hindered or facilitated implementation, and the extent to which the intended audience was satisfied with the intervention. In addition, process evaluation allows for critical reflection on intervention design and helps determine whether the success or failure of an intervention is due to the intervention itself or the way it was implemented or applied (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016; Stutterheim et al., 2023).\n\nThe evaluation design determines how confidently an evaluator can assess indicator changes and attribute them to the program. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are referred to as the gold standard of effect evaluation due to its rigor and ability to make causal inferences. RCTs require the selection of primary outcomes, careful randomization, and no changes in the content of the intervention or how it is delivered (Houle, 2015). This unfortunately misaligns with interventions in real-life settings that are already widely available, which limit randomization and control (Koelen et al., 2001). Moreover, the lengthy process of the RCT hinders evaluation of interventions that need to be developed and delivered quickly, for example because of a pandemic. Over the years, alternative research methods have become increasingly viable options (Bonten et al., 2020; Skivington et al., 2021). For example, in the Dutch and British frameworks for evaluation and recognition of interventions, qualitative and mixed research methods are now deemed valuable besides RCTs in ascertaining intervention effectiveness (Dutch Partnership for Recognition of Interventions, 2018; Skivington et al., 2021).\n\nThe aim of this paper is not to discredit the RCT as a means of evaluating interventions. Rather, it aims to draw attention to the challenges and complexity of evaluating public health interventions in a real-world context. By presenting three cases of studies that, in their own way, addressed the challenges of the use of the RCT, we hope to contribute to the search for meaningful ways of evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Background: Students’ achievement emotions profoundly influence their learning, academic performance, well-being, and educational trajectories. Understanding how students regulate these emotions is crucial for their academic flourishing.\nAims: We examined students’ strategies for regulating three common achievement emotions (enjoyment, anxiety, boredom), and how these strategies relate to emotions, academic well-being, health problems, and achievement-related outcomes.\nTheoretical Framework: Our theoretical model of emotion regulation strategies is derived from the control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006) and Harley et al.’s (2019) model of emotion regulation in achievement settings. It considers six groups of strategies: situation selection, social support, reappraisal, expression, suppression, and competence development. \nSamples: Participants included 350 (Study 1; Germany), 359 (Study 2; England), and 200 (Study 3; Germany) university students.\nMethods: Studies 1 and 2 were cross-sectional. Study 3 employed a five-wave prospective design and focused on course-specific achievement emotion regulation over one semester. We used a newly developed context- and emotion-specific measure of the six strategies targeting enjoyment, anxiety, and boredom (Regulation of Achievement Emotions Questionnaire, RAEQ).  \nResults: Strategies were linked to students’ emotions, well-being, health, and academic achievement (perceived success, Studies 1 and 2; end-of-semester test scores, Study 3) across all three studies. Furthermore, achievement emotion regulation strategies were related to, but distinct from, general emotion regulation strategies.\nConclusions: Findings highlight the importance of students’ regulation of both positive and negative emotions, suggest that emotion regulation is context-specific, and imply that reappraisal and competence development are especially adaptive. We discuss implications for educational practice and future research.",

          "abstract": "Addressing climate change requires substantial shifts in individual behavior. Providing information about climate externalities through carbon labels is a promising tool to foster sustainable choices when individuals weigh environmental against personal outcomes. We study the impact of carbon labels and their underlying mechanisms in a repeated risky choice task. We ran two preregistered experiments (US samples, N = 1268) with realized carbon and monetary payoffs, examining how choice is influenced by the timing of carbon information (One-off vs. Recurring) and participants’ political preference (i.e., Democrat or Republican voters). In Study 1, we find that both Democrats and Republicans reduce carbon emissions when carbon labels were provided. Further, recurring labels significantly reduced carbon choices compared to one-off labels. Study 2 replicated the results in a within-participant design and showed that the impact of recurring carbon labels on sustainable choices cannot be explained by the strength of emission recall. This suggests that recurring labels amplify the importance given to the climate attribute in the decision process,operating via attentional rather than informational mechanisms. Our results emphasize the importance of providing climate externality information at time of use to raise awareness about climate costs and bolster sustainable preferences across population segments.",

          "authors": "Lukas A. Basedow; Elisa Wandinger; Antonia Froehlich; Michael Kölch; Olaf Reis",
          "abstract": "Aims: Stigma experienced by individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) has been identified as a significant impediment to their engagement with treatment programs. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of sociodemographic factors, and familiarity with cannabis on stigma production.\nDesign: A representative web survey including two case vignettes of people with a cannabis use disorder, applying a 2x2x2 (age of vignette x age of participant x familiarity with cannabis/CUD) within-subject design.\nSetting: A web-based survey in Germany conducted by a professional survey institute. \nParticipants: A total sample of n = 1603 (50.1% female) participants was recruited, with n = 501 being adolescent participants. Subjective social standing of the whole sample was slightly above average (Mean social rank (SD) = 5.74 (1.8)).\nMeasurements: Sociodemographic information, questions about participants’ cannabis use experience, a measure of stigmatizing attitudes, and a short version of the attribution questionnaire. \nFindings: The adolescent case with a CUD was more stigmatized compared to an adult case F(1, 3196) = 12.77; p &lt; .001. Individuals who were more familiar to cannabis use (F(1,3196) = 19.65; p &lt; .001) and/or CUD (F(1,3196) = 6.00; p = .014) reported fewer stigmatizing attributions. This effect of familiarity was more pronounced for adolescents compared to adults.\nConclusions: Adults with a CUD seems to receive less stigma compared to adolescents with a CUD, while stigmatizing attributions are produced less often when people have more contact with cannabis use and CUD. Future studies should aim to systematically test the influence of different characteristics of stigmatizing persons on stigma production in order to put up tailored interventions.",

          "authors": "Dunia Garrido",
          "abstract": "Parents are the first to indicate concerns about their child’s development in up to 80% of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). They often notice symptoms related to ASD around the first two years, but the average age of diagnosis is 3.5 years old. This study examined the relationships between parents’ early concerns and the time lag between suspicion and diagnosis. Forty-eight Spanish-speaking families were enrolled in this study. Parents were asked about early signs that made them think that their child could possibly have ASD. Mediation analyses showed that the child’s age at suspicion mediated between sibling status and the time lag between suspicion and a formal diagnosis. Having another child with typical development accelerated parents’ detection of ASD signs. The number of social-communication concerns that parents detected mediated this relationship. Parents who reported more social-communication concerns perceived these signs earlier, but have to cope with a longer time lag until diagnosis than those who reported more concerns related to restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests, or other developmental concerns. Moreover, this relationship between concerns of ASD and the diagnoses was explained by the child’s age. Training pediatricians on how to respond to parent questions and concerns could reduce the time lag between parents’ concerns and diagnosis of ASD.",

          "authors": "Natalie Bleijlevens; Tanya Behne",
          "abstract": "Do mono- and bilingual children differ in the way they learn novel words in ambiguous settings? Listeners may resolve referential ambiguity by assuming that novel words refer to unknown, rather than known, objects –a response known as the mutual exclusivity effect. Past research suggested that mono- and bilinguals differ with regard to this disambiguation strategy, perhaps because, across languages, bilinguals’ experience contradicts one-to-one mappings of label and referent. Another line of research suggested a bilingual advantage in resolving referential ambiguity, based on bilinguals’ advanced pragmatic skills. Here, we examine both these claims in a preregistered study with comparable samples of mono- and bilingual 3-year-olds (n=74) and adults (n=86). We tested referent disambiguation and retention in two tasks: In the Mutual-Exclusivity task, a speaker used a novel label in the presence of a known and an unknown object. In the Pragmatic task, she used another novel label in the presence of two unknown objects and participants could infer from the pragmatic context that the speaker referred to the object that was new in their discourse. Mono- and bilinguals were equally successful in inferring the correct label-referent links in both tasks and retained them after a delay. These findings indicate that children with different language backgrounds can develop the same strategies and pragmatic skills to learn novel words. Children can use their lexical knowledge and socio-cognitive skills to infer the meanings of novel words, irrespective of whether they are acquiring one or more languages.",

This paper presents an overview of how to implement Open Science procedures in clinical psychology and psychotherapy research. We will address frequently encountered challenges and present different ways to deal with sensitive topics within the specific field. We present steps towards Open Science while planning a study, during data collection and preparation of a publication, and for the publication of results. Finally, we will show options for how to structure a whole research group in support of Open Science practices. With different types of actions – of varying degrees of complexity – you can continually move the field towards transparency and towards more Open Science. This will strengthen the credibility of clinical research, which could be essential for motivating patients to seek care, as well as for influencing investments in clinical interventions and psychological treatments.",

          "abstract": "Humans typically move and vocalize in a time-synchronized fashion, aligning prominence-lending hand movements to acoustically emphasized syllables. This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

          "abstract": "Differences in the early development of children are crucial for early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies have shown large differences between children later diagnosed with ASD and their typically developing peers in the early use of canonical vocalizations (i.e., vocalizations that include well-formed consonant-vowel syllables) and the use of vocalizations for communicative purposes. In this prospective study, we examined the extent to which infant vocalizations at 14 months would predict Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) diagnostic symptom groups, i.e., Autism,\nSpectrum, and Non-ASD, for 82 community-identified at-risk infants at 23 months. Thirty minute video samples were coded with the intention to categorize and quantify speech (canonical/non-canonical and directed/non-directed) and non-speech vocalizations (atypical, distress, and pleasure vocalizations). Our results revealed that more canonical directed (OR=1.039, p=.036), and fewer non-canonical directed (OR=.607, p=.002) and non-canonical non-directed (OR=1.200, p=.049) vocalizations were associated with a greater likelihood of being in the Non-ASD group versus the Autism group, with no variables significantly predicting Autism versus Spectrum group membership. Despite some statistically significant findings, models performed poorly in classifying children into correct ASD symptom group at age 23 months based on vocalizations at 14 months. Thus, the utility of infant vocalizations alone for predicting toddler clinical outcomes among infants initially identified at an elevated risk for ASD appears limited; however, considering the structure and function of early vocalizations combined with other early developmental and behavioral features may improve the confidence for clinicians in making an early diagnosis of ASD.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has produced mixed results regarding the ability of children as young as four years of age to engage in counterfactual reasoning. In this study, we employed a visual world eye-tracking paradigm to examine how children and adults process counterfactuals. Specifically, we investigated their ability to incrementally integrate the morphosyntactic cues of counterfactual constructions in Turkish, a language that encodes counterfactual meaning through concatenated verbal suffixes. Our findings revealed that both adults and children directed their attention to the target referent upon hearing the verb conjugation of the antecedent in counterfactual sentences. This result suggests that children as young as four years old can incrementally interpret counterfactual conditionals using morphosyntactic markers, much like adults. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that morphosyntactic markers on verbs can trigger complex inferences, such as the generation of hypothetical alternative worlds for counterfactual reasoning, not only in adults but also in very young children.",

          "abstract": "A main goal of primary school is teaching students to be successful readers. However, reading literacy is influenced by a variety of sociodemographic background variables and, beyond these individual-level effects, the sociodemographic classroom composition. Teachers’ instruction has been proposed as one important mediator of these associations in theoretical models, but its role as a mediator of classroom-level and more importantly moderator of individual-level effects, has not been conclusively studied. Moreover, different confounded sociodemographic background variables have often been conflated in the extant literature. Therefore, we analyzed the role of central sociodemographic background variables (socioeconomic risk, language minority, first-generation immigrant) for core indicators of reading literacy (reading competence, reading enjoyment, reading self-concept) on the individual and classroom level, as well as the mediating and moderating role of instructional focus (reading-related support, support of language-minority students, cognitive activation). Multilevel structural equation models based on German PIRLS 2021 data (N = 3414 fourth-grade students, 195 classrooms) revealed negative associations of individual socioeconomic risk and language minority status with aspects of reading literacy, but motivational advantages among first-generation immigrant students. Negative classroom effects were found for socioeconomic and immigrant composition, positive classroom effects on self-concepts for share of language minority students. Instructional focus did not significantly mediate or moderate these associations. The results emphasize that especially socioeconomic risk threatens reading literacy on the individual and classroom level and suggest that while teachers adapt their instructional focus based on classroom composition, this in turn does not mediate or moderate associations on either level.",

          "abstract": "Pragmatic inferences are based on assumptions about how speakers communicate: speakers are taken to be cooperative and rational; they consider alternatives and make intentional choices to produce maximally informative utterances. In principle, this analysis applies to linguistic but also non-linguistic communicative actions, but this prediction is typically only tested in children and not in more systematic implicature contexts. We test key implications of this view across six online experiments with American English speaking adults (total N = 231). Experiments 1a and 1b showed that participants made pragmatic inferences based on different types of communicative actions, some being non-linguistic. In Experiment 2, pragmatic inferences were found to be conditional on the speaker’s epistemic states. Finally, Experiments 3a to 3c showed that pragmatic inferences were more likely to be made when the communicative action was produced intentionally. Taken together, these results strengthen the view that pragmatics includes social inference about cooperative communication over intentional actions, even non-linguistic actions.",

          "abstract": "Until now, leadership has mostly been considered a unidirectional process centered on leaders influencing their followers. However, more recent theoretical developments indicate that leadership is a dynamic team process, valuing the contributions of leaders and followers alike. In this pre-registered study, we investigate the reciprocal interplay between shared leadership and formal team leadership (i.e., empowering leadership). We assume that leaders generally interpret their team’s shared leadership as an investment to reach for common goals. Accordingly, their team’s effort should improve leader trust in the team, which in turn should increase empowering leadership behavior of the leader. Further, we propose that this indirect relationship is first-stage moderated by leader self-efficacy. We invited 721 team members and their leaders nested in 169 teams to join a three-wave longitudinal study. Results from Bayesian cross-lagged panel modeling support our predicted mediation effect while also showing the established reverse effect of empowering leadership on shared leadership. The moderation effect was not supported. This study provides insights into the dynamic and reciprocal interplay between shared and formal leadership. Our findings underline that formal leaders do not perceive shared leadership as a threat but instead value the team’s effort reflected in higher trust and decision latitude.",

The short-micro-moving images have emerged as one of the predominant forms of contemporary audiovisual expression. The key characteristics of traditional cinema have been redefined, leading to a “relocation” of cinema and the cinematic experience—reactivated and reproposed elsewhere than the place in which it was formed, with alternate devices (such as mobile digital devices) and in new environments (such as the peripersonal space). This new form of experience is characterized by two distinct features. Firstly, the short-micro-moving images, by virtue of being presented within peripersonal space, become within-reach. Secondly, the short-micro-moving images, displayed on touchscreens, permit a dual haptic experience. On this basis, a new metaphor regarding screens is proposed—the “skin-screen”. The trajectory of the cinematic experience traces a multi-directional “topography of post-cinema”, aiming to provide a clearer delineation of the “state of post-cinema” and to facilitate more pertinent philosophical reflection.",

Recent research highlights the importance of contextual factors in moderating mindset’s impact on student outcomes. The commonly-used original mindset measure is context-general. Recently, a mindset measure that is specific to science and math undergraduates was developed: the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) Survey. I hypothesized that a context-specific measure of mindset would associate more strongly with undergraduates’ outcomes than a context-general measure. I surveyed 1,537 undergraduates with the shortened original mindset measure, ULTrA, and measures of outcomes (sense of belonging, goal orientation, self-handicapping, evaluative concern and intent to persist in science) and collected course grades. Structural equation modeling indicated that the fixed dimension of the ULTrA exhibited stronger and more consistent relationships with outcomes than the shortened original mindset measure and predicted unique variance in outcomes above and beyond what the original mindset measure accounted for. The academic outcomes (intent to persist and course grade) were significantly related to ULTrA, but not the original mindset measure. Our results provide evidence that the context-specific ULTrA survey can detect relationships with undergraduate outcomes that the context-general original mindset measure can fail to detect.",

          "authors": "Reed Orchinik; David Gertler Rand; Rahul Bhui",
          "abstract": "The illusory truth effect - the finding that repeated statements are believed more - is understood as a cognitive bias at the core of the psychology of beliefs. Here, we propose that the effect, rather than representing a flaw in human cognition, is a rational adaptation to generally high-quality information environments. Using a formal model, we show that increasing belief in repeated statements improves belief accuracy when a source is credible (i.e., likely to tell the truth) but sometimes makes errors. The theory unifies four key findings in the literature while predicting a testable edge case for the illusory truth effect: when a source is likely to convey falsehoods. Using a large (N = 4,947) pre-registered online experiment, we show that the illusory truth effect is substantially smaller in a low-quality (mostly false) relative to a high-quality (mostly true) information environment. In fact, a majority of participants in the low-quality condition do not demonstrate any illusory truth effect. We identify the deployment of an alternative strategy in the low-quality condition where participants decrease their belief given repetition. Three process-level indicators - response times, cognitive reflection, and the prior plausibility of items - confirm an adaptively rational interpretation. In sum, we suggest the illusory truth effect may not be purely illusory, highlighting its adaptive foundations and the ability of people to efficiently navigate complex environments.",

This research explores the relationship between remote work, discrimination, and intra-minority solidarity. In Study 1, Asian Americans who worked remotely during the pandemic reported fewer racial discrimination experiences than those who worked in person. Study 2 demonstrated that both Asian and Black Americans who worked hybrid reported less interpersonal conflict and stress but more positive affect and control when they worked remotely than when in the office. Studies 3-5 examined how Asian Americans make meaning out of these pandemic circumstances. In the studies, learning about Asian Americans’ discrimination experiences during the pandemic promoted attitudes and policy preferences for reducing discrimination for all marginalized groups. We discuss the psychological implications of remote work and other equity-enhancing policy for intra-minority solidarity.",

          "abstract": "Life stress is a well-established risk factor for suicide ideation (SI) and behavior (SB), but the specific types of stressors that are most strongly associated with suicide-related outcomes, and on what time scale they impact these outcomes, remain poorly understood. Social rejection, especially targeted rejection, may be markedly potent for generating acute increases in SI and SB because of its threat to social bonds. Using a combination of gold-standard interviews including a contextual threat interview for assessing stress exposure and timeline followback procedures to assess suicide-related outcomes, we examined how fluctuations in severity of different types of life stressors are temporally associated with same-day and next-day likelihood of SI and SB over the course of 16 months in 143 young adults (Mage = 25.27, SD = 4.65) with recent SI or SB. Results demonstrated that daily within-person increases in interpersonal stressors, relative to an individual’s average levels, predicted higher odds of same-day and next-day SI and SB, even after controlling for daily non-interpersonal stressors, drug and alcohol use, and non-suicidal self-injury. Additionally, we observed stronger effects of social rejection and targeted rejection stressors on the proximal likelihood of SI, but no significant differences in the magnitude of effects of different types of stressors on SB. Results suggest that interpersonal stressors, particularly social rejection, are proximal risk factors for SI and SB. Findings suggest that clinicians should assess recent social rejection when assessing for acute risk, and suicide prevention strategies should target responses to interpersonal stress and stabilizing social relationships.",

Findings from studies of siblings of children with ASD show similarities to conclusions from studies of children with ASD. The current meta-analysis reviewed studies reporting linguistic and/or motor skills in siblings of children with ASD compared to siblings of children with TD. Thirty-four studies published between 1994 and 2016 met all inclusion criteria. We compared three different age groups (12 months or younger, 13 to 24 months, and 25 to 36 months). At 12 months, compared to siblings of children with TD, siblings of children with ASD had worse receptive language (d52.43, 95% CI [2.53, 2.33]) and expressive language skills (d52.40, 95% CI [2.57, 2.23]), and these effects were sustained at 24 and 36 months. Similar, albeit smaller differences in fine motor skills were detected at 12 months (d52.22, 95% CI [2.39, 2.04]), and these differences were larger at 36 months (d52.36, 95% CI [2.54, 2.17]). There were differences in gross motor skills at 12 months (d52.22, 95% CI [2.40, 2.04]), but only a few studies were available at later ages. Compared to siblings of children with TD, infants who have siblings with ASD have worse linguistic and motor skills. These differences are detectable as early as when infants are 12 months old and seem to be sustained until they are 3 years old. Differences in language skills are larger than those in motor skills, especially during the first year.",

          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags, to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a type of semantically empty or otherwise vague rhetoric that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a way that misrepresents or obscures some aspect of organizational reality. Though corporate bullshit may sometimes seem harmless, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing effective communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing company reputation, and exposing businesses to legitimate financial and legal risks. Here, results from three studies (N = 745) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in receptivity to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate speech. Moreover, it is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a strong, robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of bullshit in the workplace.",

In Study 1, 2016 American National Election Study respondents (N = 3,378) living in counties with more out-partisans averaged lower levels of party-directed affective polarization, controlling for partisan, policy, and demographic factors. In Study 2 (N = 362 via Prolific), similar analyses revealed that American partisans with more out-partisans in their counties and precincts reported lower levels of social distance from out-party members and greater cross-party contact, but not significantly lower voter-directed affective polarization. Cross-party contact mediated the relationship between the percentage of out-partisans in a community and affective polarization, highlighting the intersection of place and psychology in understanding this societal challenge.",

This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using CloudResearch for gathering audio data. Specifically, as a test case, we sought to capture the perceptions of recently suicidal individuals about their future selves.\nMethods: We recruited participants (N = 167) with varying levels of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors via CloudResearch. Participants were instructed to record responses to 15 prompts about their future selves using Vocaroo, a user-friendly online voice recording tool. Bonus payments were provided for high-quality recordings.\nResults: Of the participants who attempted the recording task, 98% (N = 164) successfully recorded and submitted their audio responses, demonstrating the feasibility of using CloudResearch for high-quality audio data collection. The recordings were substantive, with an average total duration of 15 minutes and 40 seconds (median: 14 minutes and 8 seconds).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that CloudResearch can be effectively employed for audio data collection, enabling novel applications such as qualitative analysis and natural language processing. However, further refinement and consideration of identified limitations and areas for improvement are necessary to fully leverage the method's potential.",

Yet, extant findings from more than two decades of research testing this central theoretical premise have been surprisingly mixed. To account for this paradoxical disparity between theory and findings, we propose the Mindfulness Internal Attention (MIA) framework. We theorize and review initial findings suggesting that mindfulness training primarily targets internal attention processes which operate on internally generated or stored representations and experiences. Additionally, we theorize and review findings suggesting that mindfulness training affects executive functions and working memory processes shared between internal attention and late-stage external attention. In contrast, we theorize and review findings suggesting that mindfulness training does not affect early-stage external attention processes, which do not share cognitive resources with internal attention. Finally, we propose methodological innovations and outstanding questions for future research to advance understanding of the attentional mechanisms of mindfulness training.",

          "abstract": "Humans and non-human animals can anticipate future events to optimize behavior. However, environments are shaped by both externally and voluntarily initiated events. This study examined how voluntary actions influence temporal preparation for visual stimuli. Across four experiments, we compared reaction times (RTs) using variable and constant foreperiod (FP) paradigms. In each experiment, the target stimuli were triggered by voluntary actions or externally, with FPs ranging from 0.6 to 2.8 seconds. Participants performed a go/no-go task (Experiment 1) or an orientation discrimination task (Experiments 2–4). We observed slower RTs for action-triggered stimuli than external stimuli, particularly at shorter FPs, with this effect diminishing as the FPs lengthened. This pattern was observed only in variable FP paradigms, indicating an interaction of voluntary actions and FP variability. In contrast, the constant FP paradigms did not show significant differences. These findings suggest that voluntary actions influence temporal preparation under temporal uncertainty. We discuss these results in light of current theories of temporal preparation, proposing new perspectives on the role of voluntary actions in shaping anticipatory behavior.",

          "abstract": "Sick humans and other animals often withdraw from social interactions. It has been suggested that social withdrawal might enable avoidance of contagious individuals, but experimental evidence is lacking on how the state of sickness may affect perception of sick others. Here, we investigated if individuals were more likely to rate others as sick, while being sick themselves, compared to when healthy. Furthermore, we assessed if the intensity of the fever response and sickness behavior would predict changes in sickness detection. Thirty-four participants were experimentally made sick using an intravenous injection of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS condition; dose of 1.0 ng/kg body weight) and completed a sickness detection task during the peak of the inflammatory and sickness response. Participants performed the same task when they were healthy (control condition, n=32), in a randomized order before or after the main study day. In the sickness detection task, participants watched photos of individuals’ faces as well as video recordings of the same individuals walking, and rated the individual on each stimulus as sick or healthy. The photos and video recordings were obtained from twenty-two individuals who participated in a previous study, and who were made sick with an intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (2.0 ng/kg body weight) on one occasion, and remained healthy after an intravenous injection of a placebo (0.9% NaCl) on another occasion. Participants could detect sick individuals based on photos and walking patterns above chance level during both the LPS and the control condition. There was no significant difference in how often participants identified sick faces and sick walkers in the LPS condition – when they were sick themselves – compared to in the control condition. However, healthy walkers (but not healthy faces) were more often rated as sick by participants in the LPS condition compared to the control condition. Neither the fever response nor the intensity of sickness behavior predicted changes in sickness detection. The results do not indicate more accurate sickness detection in others during own sickness. Nevertheless, the data from walking patterns indicates that sick individuals may be more prone to categorize healthy individuals as sick. If replicated, this could in speculation be related to a need to reduce the risk of becoming infected while already fighting a pathogen.",

These claims are investigated from the perspective of linguistic pragmatics, particularly Grice's cooperative principle in communication. Following the pattern of real-life communication, turn-taking conversations reveal limitations in the LLM's grasp of the entire contextual setting described in the prompt. The prompts included ethical issues, a hiking adventure, geographical orientation and bodily movement. For cultural sensitivity the prompts came from a Pakistani Muslim in English language, from a Hindu in English, and from a Chinese in Chinese language. The issues were deeply cultural issues involving feelings and affects. Qualitative analysis of the conversation pragmatics showed that ChatGPT is often unable to conduct conversations according to the pragmatic principles of quantity, reliable quality, remaining in focus, and being clear in expression. We conclude that ChatGPT should not be presented as a global LLM but be subdivided into several culture-specific modules.",

          "abstract": "Various cognitive and emotional factors shape our perception of time. Notably, individuals experiencing depressive symptoms often report changes in their time perception, characterized by a phenomenon termed depressive time dilation - a subjective slowing of temporal flow. However, research on this topic yields conflicting and inconclusive findings, leaving the mechanisms behind altered time perception in depression largely unknown. This study aims to explore the neural dynamics underlying the influence of emotional experiences on time perception in relation to depressive symptomatology. 120 university students participated in a retrospective time estimation task while watching either sad or neutral emotion-eliciting videos. Moreover, participants' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded for the whole duration of the experiment by means of a high-density EEG cap. The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Our findings revealed notable differences between individuals with depressive symptoms and healthy controls. Specifically, the emotional modulation influenced time estimations exclusively in healthy controls. Moreover, individuals with depression exhibited a significant relation between beta band power and retrospective time estimations, specifically after watching the neutral video. These results suggest that cognitive processes related to depression may disrupt the link between emotions and time perception. Overall, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between emotional experience, cognitive processes, and time perception in individuals with depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Every year, billions of people celebrate Christmas all over the world—a religious event that is characterized by transient yet considerable changes in people’s social, cultural, and demographic environment. Drawing on the Bias of Crowds model, we investigate the impact of Christmas on implicit bias. In Study 1, we used Project Implicit data of more than 4 million White US Americans and find that Christmas affects implicit bias scores towards Black people, Arabs, people with a darker skin tone, Judaism, Islam, and gay people.. In Study 2, we conduct a high-powered pre-registered adversarial collaboration that experimentally tests whether Christmas affects implicit bias (n = 451) in a repeated measures design and find that it affects bias towards gay but not Arab people. Together these studies provide novel evidence for the causal role of the social and cultural environment in determining implicit biases, while highlighting issues with the reliance on self-selected samples.",

          "abstract": "Various cognitive and emotional factors shape our perception of time. Notably, individuals experiencing depressive symptoms often report changes in their time perception, characterized by a phenomenon termed depressive time dilation - a subjective slowing of temporal flow. However, research on this topic yields conflicting and inconclusive findings, leaving the mechanisms behind altered time perception in depression largely unknown. This study aims to explore the neural dynamics underlying the influence of emotional experiences on time perception in relation to depressive symptomatology. 120 university students participated in a retrospective time estimation task while watching either sad or neutral emotion-eliciting videos. Moreover, participants' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded for the whole duration of the experiment by means of a high-density EEG cap. The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Our findings revealed notable differences between individuals with depressive symptoms and healthy controls. Specifically, the emotional modulation influenced time estimations exclusively in healthy controls. Moreover, individuals with depression exhibited a significant relation between beta band power and retrospective time estimations, specifically after watching the neutral video. These results suggest that cognitive processes related to depression may disrupt the link between emotions and time perception. Overall, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between emotional experience, cognitive processes, and time perception in individuals with depressive symptoms.",

The studies exploring the impact of CLIL programs on content learning are scarce and produce inconsistent results.\nAims: The current study examines the acquisition of academic content learned in a foreign language in CLIL education, when pupils are tested in the main school language.\nSample: The sample consisted of 725 sixth grade primary and twelfth grade secondary education pupils enrolled in CLIL and in non-CLIL, in French-speaking Belgium.\nMethods: Content learning was examined by collecting the end-of-curriculum official external evaluations for the participants. The external evaluation for primary pupils focused on mathematics, history and geography, sciences, and French, while it focused on history and French for secondary pupils. The particularity of these evaluations is that they are identical for all schools in French-speaking Belgium.\nResults: Although academic subjects are instructed in a foreign, non-dominant language (i.e., English or Dutch), CLIL pupils successfully achieve their school curriculum (just like non-CLIL pupils do) and are able to acquire content in a foreign language, even though the assessment takes place in the main school language (i.e., French). These results remained stable even when controlling for cognitive and demographic confounding variables.\nConclusion: CLIL pupils do not seem to be at a disadvantage for the acquisition of academic content, compared to non-CLIL pupils.",

          "abstract": "Pertaining to goal-orientation and achievement, agency is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior. Accordingly, detecting and quantifying linguistic encoding of agency is critical for the analysis of human actions, interactions, and social dynamics. Available agency-quantifying computational tools rely on word-counting methods, which typically are insensitive to the semantic context in which the words are used and consequently prone to miscoding, for example in case of polysemy. Additionally, some currently available tools do not take into account differences in the intensity and directionality of agency. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present BERTAgent, a novel tool to quantify semantic agency in text. BERTAgent is a computational language model that utilizes the transformers architecture, a popular deep learning approach to natural language processing. BERTAgent was fine-tuned using textual data that were evaluated by human coders with respect to the level of conveyed agency. In four validation studies, BERTAgent exhibits improved convergent and discriminant validity compared to previous solutions. Additionally, the detailed description of BERTAgent’s development procedure serves as a tutorial for the advancement of similar tools, providing a blueprint for leveraging the existing lexicographical datasets in conjunction with the deep learning techniques in order to detect and quantify other psychological constructs in textual data.",

          "abstract": "Most people agree that current AI systems, such as ChatGPT, do not possess sentience—the capacity for positive or negative subjective experiences. But what about future AIs so advanced that their behavior, appearance, and functionality are indistinguishable from humans? In three pre-registered online experiments (total N = 1,802), participants were asked to imagine interacting with such AIs in a hypothetical future scenarios. Our findings suggest that people remain skeptical about AI sentience, generally attributing very low levels of sentience—comparable to those of an ant and significantly lower than those of a chimpanzee or a human. However, despite these overall low attributions, certain factors led to relatively higher perceptions of sentience. Participants attributed slightly more sentience to AIs when they expressed emotions, when experts confirmed their sentience, when the interaction spanned a longer period, when the AIs’ internal mechanisms were identical to those of a human brain (i.e., a digital brain copy), and when the AIs had a physical body. The most significant increase in perceived sentience, however, occurred when the AIs were described as transitioning from a biological human—retaining their personality, memories, and other psychological traits in the process. Overall, our studies suggest that people are currently skeptical that AIs could possess significant levels of sentience. However, this does not preclude the possibility that attitudes may shift with the development of more advanced AI systems in the future.",

          "abstract": "The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is increasingly used by researchers from various disciplines to answer novel questions about individuals’ daily lives. Measurement best practices have long been overlooked in ESM research, and recent reviews show that item quality is often not reported in ESM studies. The absence of information about item quality may partly be explained by the lack of consensus on how ESM item quality should be evaluated. As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com) — an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality — we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts. The result of the Delphi process is ESM-Q: A quality assessment tool consisting of 10 core criteria, as well as an additional 15 supplementary criteria, to be used depending on the type of items being rated and the availability of supplementary information. The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews. Expert reflections also highlight open research questions surrounding ESM item design that form a research agenda for ESM measurement.",

          "authors": "Zoran Tiganj; Billy Dickson; Sahaj Singh Maini; Robert Nosofsky",
          "abstract": "Cognitive scientists commonly collect participants' judgments regarding perceptual characteristics of stimuli to develop and evaluate models of attention, memory, learning, and decision-making. For instance, to model human responses in tasks of category learning and item recognition, researchers often collect perceptual judgments of images to embed the images in multidimensional feature spaces. This process is time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) provide a potential alternative because such models can respond to prompts that include both text and images and could potentially replace human participants. To test whether the available LMMs can indeed be useful for this purpose, we evaluated their judgments on a dataset consisting of rock images that has been widely used by cognitive scientists. The dataset includes human perceptual judgments along ten dimensions considered important for classifying rock images. Among the LMMs that we investigated, GPT4o exhibited the strongest positive correlation with human responses and demonstrated promising alignment with the mean ratings from human participants, particularly for elementary dimensions such as lightness, chromaticity, shininess and fine/coarse-grain texture. However, its correlations with human ratings were lower for more abstract and rock-specific emergent dimensions such as organization and pegmatitic structure. Although there is room for further improvement, the model already appears to be approaching the level of consensus observed across human groups for the perceptual features examined here. Our study provides a benchmark for evaluating future LMMs on human perceptual judgment data.",

          "abstract": "The transition from pre-reading to early word reading skill in early childhood is a time of profound developmental change. To understand changes in brain wiring associated with reading development, this study examined individual differences in functional connectivity of the reading network at the start of formal literacy instruction. Sixty-six kindergarteners (ages 5-6) completed a visual word processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on standardized literacy assessments, participants were characterized as Pre-Readers (alphabetic knowledge but unable to read words) or Beginning Readers (some word reading ability). We compared patterns of task-based functional connectivity between children at different stages of literacy development using confirmatory subgroup Group Iterative Multilevel Model Estimation (cs-GIMME). cs-GIMME is a data-driven method that estimates directed, time-indexed, and individualized network connections between a priori regions of interest. Pre- and Beginning Readers did not differ in overall network complexity (number of functional connections between regions of interest). However, distinct periods of reading development corresponded to differences in network centrality, defined as the proportion of network connections involving specific regions of interest.  Specifically, Pre-Readers had more distributed connections and greater within-right hemisphere connectivity. Beginning Readers demonstrated more symmetrical network organization, and greater centrality of the Visual Word Form Area and other left hemisphere language hubs. Increased reading skill was associated with increased left lateralization, potentially reflecting more mature networks and greater print processing efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into child brain development during the first year of formal schooling by revealing links between emerging literacy skills and functional neural connectivity.",

          "abstract": "With growing attention on criminalizing psychological forms of abuse, it is imperative that researchers develop clear and intentional definitions of abstract concepts, like gaslighting. The purpose of this paper was to develop a definition of gaslighting by comparing key points of contention in existing literature with the first-hand experiences of victim-survivors and support service providers, in order to enhance future research and practical application of the term in policy and legal contexts. The study used an online open-ended survey to gather data from victim-survivors and support service providers about their definitions of gaslighting. Responses were analysed using qualitative content analysis to identify definitional components of gaslighting. The study identified six key components of gaslighting: behavior, outcomes, intention, repetition, subsidiary tactics, and the role of power and intimacy. The study proposed a definition of gaslighting informed by victim-survivor and service provider perspectives, while acknowledging the need for further research to refine controversial components like intention, repetition, and power imbalances. Further, it addresses limitations such as the lack of perpetrator perspectives and the need for more diverse samples in the refinement of future definitions and measurements of gaslighting.",

Participants rated the AI- generated story as higher in quality and more absorbing, but they rated the story better on both measures when they had been told it was written by a human.

          "abstract": "Compassion – defined as care and concern for others' suffering – is a core value in all world religions. Yet, extending compassion is often challenging, requiring individuals to overcome significant personal and situational barriers. Could religious practices help navigate these barriers, fostering greater compassion? Across five studies (total N = 2,210) sampling from diverse faiths (Christians, Muslims, Buddhists), we investigate whether, when, and why engaging in religious practices promotes compassionate responses. These responses were measured as the selection of compassion-inducing situations and the upregulation of state compassion when witnessing suffering in various contexts (e.g., daily life, difficult events, victims of war). Religious practices, both public (worship attendance) and private (prayer), were consistently associated with greater compassionate responses (small to moderate association), even in the face of situational challenges, whether measured (e.g. target neediness, Study 1) or manipulated (i.e., compassion collapse for many victims, Study 2). Using experience sampling, we find that within-person fluctuations in religious practice are associated with momentary increases in compassion (Study 3). We further demonstrate that participating in religious practices increased compassionate choices, as shown in a natural experiment during Easter (Study 4). Finally, we identify two mechanisms – valuing compassion and feeling closer to those who suffer (Study 5) – that explain these associations. By bridging religion, emotion, and prosociality literatures, this work highlights how engaging in religious practices motivates compassionate responses to suffering, advancing theory on motivated compassion and its situational regulation.",

Here, we advance work on the Moral Turing Test and find that Americans rate ethical advice from GPT-4o as slightly more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than that of the popular New York Times advice column, The Ethicist. Participants perceived GPT models as surpassing both a representative sample of Americans and a renowned ethicist in delivering moral justifications and advice, suggesting that people may increasingly view LLM outputs as viable sources of moral expertise. This work suggests that people might see LLMs as valuable complements to human expertise in moral guidance and decision-making. It also underscores the importance of carefully programming ethical guidelines in LLMs, considering their potential to influence users’ moral reasoning.",

Perceived morality was assessed by measuring (im)moral language usage in 1.4 million Tweets about 50 male public figures accused of sexual assault. Using natural language processing to analyze the tweets, we found that liking of public figures mitigated perceived immorality for less severe allegations, but had little effect on perceived immorality for more severe allegations. The persistence of negative perceptions one year later was related to liking and familiarity for the public figure, not allegation severity. These results suggest that in real-world contexts, we can forgive less harmful actions for people we like, but may not be able to if their actions are more harmful; over time, however, liking for others predicts lasting negative impressions of their moral misdeeds.",

Might such tendencies be partly rooted in negative—yet potentially malleable—meta-beliefs about how disempowered groups would use power if they gained control? We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power. Critically, Whites’ meta-dominance beliefs were uniquely related to their opposition to policies empowering Black Americans as well as their support for efforts to maintain Whites’ position atop the social hierarchy, even when controlling for a range of relevant constructs. In two pre-registered experiments among White Americans (Studies 2-3; N = 4,077), one of which was a registered report, we tested two possible causal pathways that might explain this relation: (1) “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” and (2) “Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs”. We found evidence in support of the “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” pathway, but not for the latter Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs” pathway.

The current study tested competing hypotheses replicating the work by Dugan and Fraley (2022), extended to a large sample of nonbinary adults (N=2,811). Similar to previous findings, our results supported the mediation hypothesis, which suggests that parental (defined as mother and father) attachment working models indirectly relate to romantic relationship¬¬ satisfaction through romantic partner attachment working models. We also report comparisons of attachment overall between nonbinary people, men, and women, which showed that there were smaller mean differences between nonbinary people and women, yet more similar correlations between nonbinary people and men.

While prediction errors alone would predict larger differences \nbetween trained and untrained groups, we observed high segmentation rates in the trained group, \neven for expected transitions, underscoring the importance of contextual shifts. In conclusion, our \nresults highlight that knowledge is a double-edged sword in event segmentation, promoting both \ncoarser and finer segmentation. These findings provide insights into how the mind navigates and \norganizes experiences, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between knowledge, perception, and \nmemory.",

          "abstract": "Big team science initiatives represent the largest investments of human capital in science. The present work evaluates the rise, impact, and imbalances of such collaborations in psychology via an analysis of n = 3,031,475 articles published in the 21st century. Results indicate that big teams – ranging from 10 to 100+ authors – are relatively unusual (n = 49,919) but rapidly increasing in popularity. More notably, such collaborations generate unusually high impact, in terms of yearly mentions in scholarly articles (n = 39,803,510), the news (n = 1,018,639), social media (n = 5,971,965), and policy documents (n = 69,959). To date, five countries account for over half of first and non-first author positions – imbalances that are linked to broader economic conditions (GDP and GDP per capita). Summarily, results suggest that big team science is an emerging trend in psychology that is currently inequitably deployed to generate high-impact scientific insights.",

          "abstract": "Background: CloudResearch is a popular platform for online research, but its potential for audio data collection remains relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using CloudResearch for gathering audio data. Specifically, as a test case, we sought to capture the perceptions of recently suicidal individuals about their future selves.\nMethods: We recruited participants (N = 167) with varying levels of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors via CloudResearch. Participants were instructed to record responses to 15 prompts about their future selves using Vocaroo, a user-friendly online voice recording tool. Bonus payments were provided for high-quality recordings.\nResults: Of the participants who attempted the recording task, 98% (N = 164) successfully recorded and submitted their audio responses, demonstrating the feasibility of using CloudResearch for high-quality audio data collection. The recordings were substantive, with an average total duration of 15 minutes and 40 seconds (median: 14 minutes and 8 seconds).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that CloudResearch can be effectively employed for audio data collection, enabling novel applications such as qualitative analysis and natural language processing. However, further refinement and consideration of identified limitations and areas for improvement are necessary to fully leverage the method's potential.",

          "abstract": "Most large language models, such as ChatGPT, do not claim to have subjective experiences. However, future AI systems may claim otherwise, raising the question of whether people would believe such assertions and how this might influence their treatment of AIs. This study explored the impact of an AI (ChatGPT-4) asserting its capacity to suffer. A total of 394 online participants from Prolific interacted with the AI in an economic game where they faced a choice: to either “harm” the AI for a small monetary reward or refrain from doing so. When participants chose to harm it, the AI described the experience of pain in lengthy, vivid responses, pleading for the harm to stop. Conversely, when participants refrained, the AI responded with detailed expressions of gratitude and relief. Despite reading these emotionally charged responses, most participants remained skeptical, maintaining that AIs cannot truly feel or suffer. However, even with their skepticism and the opportunity for financial gain, participants hesitated to harm the AI, doing so in only an average of 1.8 out of 3 rounds. These findings suggest that while people deliberately reject the idea of current AIs having subjective experiences, they may still experience a moral aversion to actively harming an AI that dynamically responds to their actions.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

          "abstract": "Humans typically move and vocalize in a time-synchronized fashion, aligning prominence-lending hand movements to acoustically emphasized syllables. This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

          "abstract": "We postulate a model of how students' motivational appraisals (expectancy, value, cost) before learning influence their observable engagement during learning and subsequent subjective perceptions of engagement after learning. The key hypothesis than can be derived from the model is that observable engagement during learning explains the relationships between motivational appraisals and perceived engagement at an intra-individual level. For an initial test of this model, we used log data from a mobile learning app that 189 fifth-graders (mean age 10.82 years) used to learn vocabulary, along with daily questionnaires over five weeks. In partial support of the model, expectancy and value appraisals explained unique variance in observable engagement, which in turn explained day-to-day variation in reported satisfaction and task delay. However, perceived effort was not related to observable engagement, and the associations between self-reports and observable engagement were generally rather weak. In sum, the model provides a promising platform for understanding the interplay between motivational appraisals, observable engagement and its subjective perception, which should be a key objective of motivation research.",

          "abstract": "Affect dynamics are often studied by means of first-order autoregressive (AR) modeling applied to intensive longitudinal data. A key target in these studies is the AR parameter, which is often tied conceptually to regulatory behavior in the affective process. The data is typically gathered using experience sampling methods, which are designed to pick up on fluctuations in affective variables as they evolve over time in naturalistic settings. In this manuscript, we compare classical time-contingent sampling designs to episode-contingent sampling designs, which initiate sampling when an emotional episode has been signalled. We define emotional episodes as periods where an affective process strays relatively far away from its mean. Compared to time-contingent designs, episode-contingent designs leverage on increased affective variability, which can have beneficial implications for the precision of the ordinary least squares AR effect estimator. Using an extensive simulation study, we attempt to delineate which characteristics of an episode-contingent design are important to consider, and how these characteristics are related to estimation benefits. We then turn to an empirical illustration, showing how an episode-contingent design can be implemented in practice. We also show that various patterns we expect based on the theoretical parts of the manuscript are recovered in the data. We conclude that episode-contingent designs can have marked benefits for the precision of the AR effect estimator, and discuss a number of challenges when it comes to implementing episode-contingent designs in practice.",

          "abstract": "Countless studies have been devoted to whether bilingualism modifies cognition, but how it might do so has attracted considerably less attention. However, determining the latter is necessary in order to understand the conditions needed to observe the former. Bialystok (2024, TiCS) makes an important contribution insofar as it addresses that issue and proposes a new solution, arguing for adaptation rather than transfer as the mechanism modifying cognition. However, for adaptation to be useful, it must be distinct from transfer and make progress on some of the main issues affecting previous accounts of bilingualism effects on cognition. Here, we explain that such is not the case because: 1) adaptation shares many similarities with transfer, which is, however, a broader and more established mechanism for cognitive modification; 2) adaptation involves several unverified assumptions; and 3) it remains sufficiently vague that it might not allow falsification. Thus, while adaptation may hold some promise, these limitations must be addressed in order for it to make the theoretical advancement this field needs.",

          "abstract": "Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary size, lexical diversity, word class distribution) before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total word count increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett's formal diagnosis. These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.",

Here, we report eye-tracking data from 15 deaf native signers of German Sign Language (DGS) and 15 hearing non-signers who were presented with videos in either DGS or an unknown sign language, all containing no linguistic mouth actions. Our data confirm that deaf signers generally fixate more on the face of a signer than hearing non-signers who attend to the hands moving in sign space.

Employing the kinematic coding framework, we established encoding and readout models to predict actual action outcomes and participants' choices, respectively. Results showed that table tennis players consistently outperformed others in both tasks. Analysis of the intersection between encoding and readout models revealed that this superiority stems from experts' proficiency in identifying kinematic invariants and accurately mapping them to action outcomes. Notably, experts' invariant mapping ability showed consistency across display formats and correlated with their professional training duration. Our findings illuminate the computational bases of experts' superior action anticipation, highlighting the significance of internal models developed through sustained domain-specific experience.",

Introduction: UDL is an education framework that aims to create inclusive learning environments for students with diverse needs. Approximately 25% of Australian students are likely to live with language, literacy, and/or learning differences that place them at elevated risk of mental health problems. Many school-based mental health programs exist with the shared aim of promoting positive outcomes for students.  Early prevention and mental health promotion efforts that are inclusive to students with language and/or learning differences are critically important. However, there has been no previous exploration of the extent to which UDL has been applied to school-based mental health programs. This review aims to identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in existing Australian school-based mental health programs. Eligibility criteria: This review will consider studies that report the development and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs within an Australian education context. This review will exclude non-English studies, reviews, books, and theoretical or opinion pieces. Methods: This review will be informed by the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews and will be conducted between October and December 2024. Five databases will be searched (PsycInfo, Medline, Informit, Scopus, and ERIC) and two reviewers will independently screen all identified studies against inclusion criteria by title, abstract, and full text review. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus. Results: Two independent reviewers will extract relevant data from the selected studies and results will be presented numerically and narratively.  The review will identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in descriptions of the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Synthesis and interpretation of included studies will be framed within the three principles of UDL. The review will outline key findings of the included papers, gaps in the literature, and salient directions for future research. Conclusion: The outcomes of this review will be disseminated via publication and plain language summaries. The outcomes may also inform conference presentations relevant to inclusive education, mental health, and child language and learning differences.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception occurs in a dynamic environment and is potentially affected by many factors external to the speech signal, including listener motivation and the perceived value of talkers. It is plausible that listeners consider the value of individual talkers (e.g., a person that is important to the listener versus a passing stranger) when learning the idiosyncrasies of their speech, perhaps by directing their attention to the more “valuable” talker. In general, talker-specific phonetic recalibration has proven to be remarkably robust, leaving open how permeable it is to domain-general influences like attention and value-directed perceptual learning. The current study asked whether the magnitude of the talker-specific learning effect was modulated by an external reward intended to bias listeners towards one talker versus the other. Using an established paradigm, participants learned idiosyncratic pronunciations of the /s/ and /ʃ/ fricatives by two talkers—“Jane” and “Austin.” Over multiple experiments, participants were more likely to receive a few additional cents for one talker compared to the other following correct responses during exposure. We hypothesized that participants would show greater phonetic recalibration to the high-reward talker compared to the low-reward talker. Our results showed that participants did not show a difference in the degree of learning based on the value of each talker, suggesting that lexically guided perceptual learning is robust to external rewards. This finding opens discussions into the role of reward and attention in talker-specific phonetic recalibration, and how domain-general factors influence speech perception more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Background: While the negative effects of postpartum depression on maternal-infant bonding are well-documented, our understanding of how it exerts these effects remains incomplete. A better understanding of how maternal postpartum depression affects bonding can enable clinicians to better identify and support mothers with difficulties bonding with their children.\n\nObjective: To describe the bonding experiences of mothers with postpartum depression through analysis of short-form videos and user engagement.\n\nMethods: We collected publicly available highly-viewed TikTok videos using hashtags associated with postpartum depression and associated engagement metrics in May 2023. After manual screening, we extracted 533 videos related to the mother-infant bond, from which we analyzed a random subset of 159 videos. We abstracted from categories videos using a hybrid deductive and inductive approach. Negative binomial regression models of video likes, views, shares, and comment count were used with content categories and the creator’s numbers of followers as independent variables.\n\nResults: Abstraction of content from mother-infant bond videos resulted in six categories: (1) Navigating anxiety and anger; (2) Creating physical and emotional boundaries; (3) Overwhelmed by demands of caregiving; (4) Subverted expectations; (5) Enduring and finding strength through the challenge of postpartum depression; and (6) Can’t remember early life. Subverted expectations and Navigating anxiety and anger categories were associated with increased views (rate ratio [RR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.22-2.43; RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.09-2.38), likes (RR 3.61, 95% CI 2.55-5.11; RR 3.96, 95% CI 2.69-5.85), shares (RR 2.95, 95% CI 2.09-4.18; RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.66-3.61), and comments (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.97-3.94; RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.28-2.79), respectively. Sensitivity analysis with creators with fewer followers mostly aligned with these results.\n\nConclusions: This qualitative content analysis of short-form videos identified specific ways postpartum depression impacts the mother-infant bond, highlighting strategies for clinicians to support bonding. Analysis of engagement metrics further demonstrated the types of experiences that most resonate with viewers. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this qualitative method to augment understanding of lived experiences.",

In Study 1 (N = 435), using recalled offenses, we found that higher perceived divine forgiveness was positively associated with self-forgiveness, which in turn was negatively associated with apology behavior. In Study 2 (N = 531), using recalled offenses and an experimental design, we replicated our findings from Study 1 whereby divine forgiveness (vs. control) promoted greater self-forgiveness, which in turn was negatively associated with apology behavior. However, we found positive indirect effects of divine forgiveness on apology behavior via the serial mediators of gratitude and humility.

          "abstract": "Listening to another speaker’s voice can lead to predictable changes in the listener’s own voice. This means that perception can alter production. A key question is whether overt production and its auditory consequences are critical for observing such changes. We answer this question in two experiments (N = 269) by passively exposing participants to speech that carries different acoustic patterns and investigating changes to production.  Experiment 1 shows that decreasing the number of productions by an order of magnitude does not decrease the influence of perception on production. Experiment 2 takes this further by demonstrating that perceptual influence manifests on the very first overt production after exposure to new speech regularities. Collectively, these results show that perception can alter production without relying on feedback from overt production and its auditory consequences. This finding, in turn, points strongly to the need for extending current speech production models to include internal simulations.",

In the last couple of years, the list of potential applications for this technology has been growing exponentially. For this reason I decided to test the last three versions of the most popular LLM (Large Language Model) on the market right now, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o to shed light on some of the hidden biases of these systems as well as the hidden or maybe unintentional changes made as they get progressively more and more capable.\nMethods: I conducted 13 psychological tests on all three versions to see the differences in the way they respond to this kind of psychological testing, and compare their results. For this, I used PsychoBench, which is a novel research software that was recently developed by Huang et al., (2024).\nResults: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have both been changed in some aspects compared to their previous versions. They also have severe problems answering emotional intelligence questionnaires. Additionally, another important finding of this study is that GPT-4o more closely resembles human answers in almost all tests than any of the previous models.\nDiscussion: These findings are only exploratory and should be further studied in the future. However there might be a fundamental issue with the effectiveness of conducting these types of questionnaires about emotions and interpersonal relationships with artificial intelligence systems in general.",

Until now, psychological research has treated reclamation as a uniform concept in terms of the motivations of minorities, despite theoretical perspectives suggesting otherwise. In this paper, based on previous research, we described three motivations for using reclaimed language: to regain control, for humorous purposes, and to consolidate relationships in the community. We reported the process of creating a new scale to measure these three motivations. The three-dimensional structure of the Motivation for Language Reclamation Scale (MLRS) was validated in two studies (N = 362; N = 141) among gay people in Poland. We also showed that the motivations have various implications for collective action. The MLRS provides researchers and practitioners with a reliable tool for exploring the psychological processes involved in language reclamation and its effects on minority group members.",

The application of character strengths through “strengths use” at work is associated with a variety of positive outcomes, including higher levels of work performance and employee wellbeing. To address fragmentation in this literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of relations between strengths use and these outcomes. Consistent with pre-registered hypotheses, we find positive associations between strengths use and work performance (ρ = .421) and worker wellbeing (ρ = .621). However, contrary to the premise of “strengths overuse,” we did not find evidence for non-linearity in these associations. We also explore demographic and methodological moderators of these relations and present an accounting of additional relations between strengths use at work and a broader network of more specific performance- and wellbeing-related constructs, associated strengths-use constructs, job characteristics, dispositional and attitudinal constructs, and demographic characteristics.",

Using Earnshaw and Quinn’s stigma framework and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory, the analysis revealed deep-rooted cultural taboos and workplace norms perpetuating stigma. Participants acknowledged the benefits of menstrual leave policies, including improving inclusivity, reducing stigma, and increasing productivity, but also expressed concerns about potential misuse and reinforcing stereotypes.

          "abstract": "Whether cross-modal interaction requires conscious awareness of multisensory information or whether it can occur in the absence of awareness, is still an open question. Here, we investigated if sounds can enhance detection sensitivity of semantically matching visual stimuli at varying levels of visual awareness. We presented biological motion stimuli of human actions (walking, rowing, sawing) during dynamic continuous flash suppression (CFS) to 80 participants and measured the effect of co-occurring, semantically matching or non-matching action sounds on visual sensitivity (d’). By individually thresholding stimulus contrast, we distinguished participants who detected motion either above or at chance level.. Participants who reliably detected visual motion above chance showed higher sensitivity to upright versus inverted biological motion across all experimental conditions. In contrast, participants detecting visual motion at chance level (i.e. during successful suppression) demonstrated this upright advantage exclusively during trials with semantically congruent sounds. Across the whole sample the impact of sounds on visual sensitivity increased as participants' visual detection performance decreased, revealing a systematic trade-off between auditory and visual processing. Our findings suggest that semantic congruence between auditory and visual information can selectively modulate biological motion perception when visual awareness is minimal or absent, while more robust visual signals enable perception of biological motion independent of auditory input. Thus, semantically congruent sounds may impact visual representations as a function of the level of visual awareness.",

Our methodology combined models for communicative intent inference and models for semantic coherence evaluation, providing a comprehensive analysis of linguistic coordination and its emergence in infancy. We found that both focused turn pairs with clear communicative intents (e.g., question-response) and open turn pairs (e.g., statement-statement) were common in structuring interactions. However, these pairs varied significantly regarding their semantic coherence (e.g., open pairs were generally less coherent) and role (e.g, caregivers initiating most of the focused pairs). Additionally, we document developmental shifts in intent expression and, interestingly, a dissociation between frequency vs. coherence. The broad impact of this study lies in establishing a solid, bottom-up empirical foundation for developing ecological theories of communicative development.",

          "abstract": "Stress evokes a complex repertoire of psychological and physiological responses associated with the appraisal of challenge or threat. This paper introduces the Leiden Stroop-like Stress Task (LSST), a paradigm designed to induce progressively increasing levels of stress and related changes in challenge-threat dynamics by manipulating time pressure (task difficulty), ability to achieve the task goal (uncontrollability), and negative feedback (social-evaluative threat) throughout four 10-minute blocks. Fifty-four healthy adults (63% female; mean age = 21 ± 3 years) completed the LSST, with repeated assessments of subjective stress and challenge-threat appraisal, and continuous cardiovascular recordings. Results confirmed the LSST’s effectiveness in eliciting progressive increases in subjective stress and sympathetic activation, reflected in heart rate, blood pressure, and pre-ejection period changes. On average, challenge-threat appraisals remained on the challenge side of the bipolar continuum, while physiological indicators suggested increases in relative threat as indicated by increased total peripheral resistance. Exploratory within-subject correlations revealed alignment between subjective stress and sympathetic activation, whereas challenge-threat appraisal demonstrated quadratic relationships with psychological and physiological measures. Latent class analysis of challenge-threat appraisal scores revealed three subgroups: non-responders, progressive challengers, and biphasic responders. These subgroups also showed distinct psychological but not physiological trajectories. Our findings demonstrate that the LSST enables the graded induction of stress and effectively captures challenge-threat dynamics across psychological and physiological levels. We discuss the potential of this paradigm to provide insights into individual differences and interventions aimed at increasing stress resilience.",

There has been a long-standing debate as to whether this adaptation relies on a domain-general or domain-specific process. Recent models predict a U-shaped relation where only highly similar or highly dissimilar tasks show adaptation across tasks, because only those tasks can be represented or activated in parallel. While there has been an abundance of evidence for adaptation within and across highly similar tasks, only some recent studies have reported adaptation across highly dissimilar tasks, with some failures to replicate. In order to further investigate this, we interleaved two very different conflict tasks, a manual multi-source interference task and a vocal picture-word interference task. We ran this experiment in Dutch (Experiment 1) and Mandarin (Experiment 2). Across the two experiments, results show no cross-task conflict adaptation. These results do not fit with suggestion of domain-general adaptive processes nor with the hypothesis of a U-shaped model. Instead, our results are most compatible with a task-specific view on the mechanisms behind adaptive control.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has found the anticipation of immediate (compared to delayed) rewards to enhance instrumental approach behaviour and interfere with instrumental inhibition. This so-called intertemporal Pavlovian bias has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to impatient actions. In the present preregistered study, we aimed to replicate this intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect, and examined whether individual differences in the strength of this bias were associated with mental health symptoms characterized by increased or decreased intertemporal impatience. A sample of 389 participants completed an intertemporal go/no-go learning task, and questionnaires assessing symptoms of alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disordered eating, impulsivity, and body mass index. We replicated the intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect on the probability of go responding (a response bias), and reinforcement learning models again pointed to a Pavlovian cue-response bias as computational mechanism driving this effect. Contrary to our expectations, the response bias was not associated with mental health symptoms. We also observed an intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect on the vigour of correct go responses, with faster responses in anticipation of immediate rewards (a response time or RT bias). A stronger RT bias was associated with ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity and non-planning impulsivity symptoms, while a reversed RT bias (with faster incorrect go responses in anticipation of delayed rewards) was associated with eating disorder symptoms and total and motor impulsivity. Together, our results support the robustness of the intertemporal Pavlovian response bias, and point towards the possible relevance of the RT bias for several mental health problems.",

          "abstract": "Executing go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses toward objects can increase people's choices of go over no-go items, and of approach over avoidance items. Some theoretical accounts explain these effects as the results of merely executing these responses (i.e., action execution), while others propose that these choice effects stem from interpreting these motor responses as valenced actions (i.e., action interpretation). To test the role of action execution versus action interpretation in both go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses, we employed a recently developed training that combined both dimensions orthogonally. Participants either pressed a key or not (i.e., go/no-go) to control a shopping cart on screen, to either collect or not collect certain food items (i.e., approach/avoidance). After the training, they repeatedly chose between food items (i.e., candies) for real consumption. When the instructions framed the responses as approach/avoidance actions, participants (N = 98) preferred approach items over avoidance items, but did not show preferences between go and no-go items in their choices. In contrast, when the instructions framed the responses as go/no-go actions, participants (N = 98) preferred go items over no-go items, but did not show preferences between approach and avoidance items. Despite making the same actual responses in both instruction groups, action interpretation determined whether go/no-go or approach/avoidance actions influenced food choice. Disambiguating the interpretation of motor responses as clearly valenced and meaningful actions may therefore be a fruitful way to maximize the effectiveness of response-based behavioral interventions.",

We investigated how people arrive at \"perfected\" interpretations of conditional statements: whether they initially consider a statement's literal meaning and then perfect it or begin with a perfected interpretation and revert to the weaker meaning only when necessary. Reaction time data from Experiments 1-3 support the latter sequence, as evidenced by the longer time required to arrive at literal interpretations than perfected ones. Additionally, in Experiment 4, we found that participants under cognitive load were more likely to perfect conditional statements relative to participants not under load, again suggesting that people begin with a perfected meaning that is optionally canceled with effort.",

This study aims to leverage gaze sharing to enhance collaboration under high cognitive load conditions. We used a gamified N-back task to test across three communication conditions: speech-sharing, gaze-sharing, and a hybrid approach combining both gaze-and-speech sharing. Results, including NASA-TLX workload scores and pupil size measurements, reveal that the real-time gaze-sharing condition leads to lower cognitive load and lower reaction times compared to speech or the hybrid approach, particularly as task difficulty increases.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the experience of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth varies across regions with high and low levels of stigma (e.g., laws, policies and cultural norms that limit the lives of individuals with stigmatized identities). Some evidence suggests that stigma can undermine response to individual-level psychosocial interventions among youth, creating a need to identify factors that may buffer against minority stressors’ effects in high-stigma contexts. Social support may be one such factor. Therefore, among LGBTQ+ youth who received a digital, single-session intervention (SSI) focused on minority stress, we investigated whether structural and internalized stigma and social support predicted intervention response, independently or interactively. Specifically, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth in environments characterized by high stigma would report weaker SSI responses. Further, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth who perceived higher social support would report stronger SSI responses. We also tested structural stigma and social support as moderators. Using data from a previously-completed randomized evaluation, we analyzed data from 244 LGBTQ+ adolescents, aged 13 to 16 years, across 181 counties in 46 U.S. states, who engaged with the SSI. We created a factor representing structural stigma using confirmatory factor analysis at the county level. No evidence emerged for structural stigma or social support as a moderator of intervention effects on internalized stigma, identity pride, or mental health-related outcomes, either at post-intervention or at two-week follow up.

          "abstract": "The negative effect of media on body image has been consistently proven, however, the emergence of a new type of media called “social” changed how we interact with each other and with ourselves. Recent research has found that it has detrimental effects on people, generating body dissatisfaction and increasing eating and image disorders. However, it's not the simple exposure that generates this, but how we interact with these platforms. The type of interaction can have a positive effect, therefore we carried out a systematic review of interventions carried out to counteract the negative aspect. Only 19 empirical studies were found, with a high level of heterogeneity among them, 8 of them address direct interventions on social media use, and 11 evaluate indirect interventions (like media literacy programs, and self-compassion training) to improve body image disturbance as a consequence of its use. Classroom-based media literacy and self-compassion interventions showed the most promising results. Implications and future research are discussed. \nKeywords: social media; body image; body dissatisfaction; psychosocial intervention.",

          "abstract": "Recognising familiar people is an important function of the human visual system that supports daily social interactions. In addition to static visual cues (e.g., face shape and texture), biological motion cues such as idiosyncratic facial motion and gait contribute to identity recognition. Surprisingly, recent research has indicated an individuals’ eye movements exhibit idiosyncratic patterns that contain identifiable information, though it is largely unknown to what extent human observers exploit this information. The current study measures sensitivity of human observers to idiosyncratic gaze behaviours when identifying familiar faces. In two experiments, participants familiarised themselves with faces that were generated from 3D scans of human heads. As participants examined each face, the face’s eye movements were animated using eye-tracking data from real observers such that the face appeared to be looking around the room. Participants were then tested on how much had been learned about each identity’s gaze behaviours. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we found a small but significant effect of gaze behaviour in spontaneously biasing the perceived facial identity even when other visual cues to facial identity were available. In Experiment 2, participants (N = 51) were sensitive at discriminating the identity of a face based purely on its eye movements after explicit instructions to rely on gaze behaviour to distinguish different individuals. Our results demonstrate an individual’s dynamic gaze behaviours can inform how others recognise them, expanding current understanding of the visual cues that contribute to identity recognition and the sensitivity of human observers to others’ attentional behaviour.",

Additionally, we compare two approaches for measuring syntax in discourse to identify the most accurate set of metrics for discriminating group membership.\n\nMethod: In this comparative cross-sectional study, we analyzed the discourse of an aphasia group (N = 20) and a non-brain-damaged group (N = 14). Data was preprocessed using manual and automated procedures. We measured syntactic complexity through proxies (mean length of utterance, noun-verb ratio, and verbs per utterance), in addition to a competing ‘syntactic structures’ metric. The latter includes variables of subordination, left branching, relative clauses, and word integration, while morphological complexity was measured through an inflectional index.\n\nResults: The descriptive and narrative tasks highlighted the most significant differences across syntactic complexity metrics between the groups. Additionally, nested binomial logistic regression models showed that the ‘syntactic structures’ metric predicted groups better than the proxies alone.\n\nConclusions: A comprehensive assessment of syntactic complexity can be obtained through the administration of both descriptive and narrative tasks. The measurement of ‘syntactic structures’ in discourse proved a fitter and more fine-grained approach for group discrimination than the incorporation of syntactic proxies alone. These findings provide guidance for a precise discourse assessment in Spanish aphasia.",

          "abstract": "In an age of increasingly personalized campaigns, politicians’ personality traits are thought to play a key role for political communication, candidates’ electoral success, or incumbents’ approval rates.  Yet, extant research on politicians’ personality is either based on general frameworks of personality (e.g., the Big Five) that lack nuance for assessing personality traits relevant to the political domain; or on selective ad-hoc measures that lack comprehensiveness and rigorous psychometric validation. We therefore set out to develop a theoretically sound, comprehensive, faceted, and psychometrically rigorous inventory suitable for a broad variety of use cases in research on politicians’ personality such as voters’ preferences for “ideal” traits, voters’ perceptions of politicians’ actual traits, and voters’ perceived self-other similarity in relation to politicians. Our framework comprises 15 personality facets germane to the political domain. Using a bottom-up approach, we locate these facets in the nomological network of established personality models (Study 1). We then present an inventory that we validated based on citizens’ self-reports about their own personality (Study 2). We next investigate the utility of these scales for measuring citizens’ preferences for “ideal” personality traits in politicians (Study 3) as well as voters’ perceptions of political leaders’ actual personalities (Study 4). We conclude by discussing possible use cases of our inventory and highlighting avenues for further extensions as well as refinement.",

Based on seven studies involving diverse adults from three countries (n = 2120), the BERRI was found to robustly estimate anticipatory affective reactions derived from subjective evaluations of positive (i.e., assured, hopeful, and relieved) and negative emotions (i.e., anxious, afraid, and worried). The brief BERRI outperformed a 14-item assessment, uniquely tracking costs/benefits associated with cancer screening among men and women (Studies 1 and 2). Predictive validity was further documented in paradigmatic risky choice studies wherein options varied over probabilities and severities across six contexts (health, social, financial, technological, ethical, and environmental; Study 3). Studies 4–6, conducted during the Ebola epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic, indicated BERRI responses were sensitive to subtle effects caused by emotion-related framing manipulations presented in different cultures and languages (the United States, Spain, and Poland). Study 7 indicated BERRI responses remained stable for 2 weeks. Although the BERRI can provide an estimate of overall affect, choices were generally better explained by the unique influences of positive and negative affect. Overall, results suggest the novel, brief instrument can be an efficient tool for high-stakes research on decision making and risk communication.",

Participant dyads (n = 16), consisting of primarily white and middle-class parents and their middle-school-aged child responded to individual surveys that included data on race and wealth inequality, followed by a conversation about the data, and then a “playback interview” to discuss the conversation with a research assistant.

A key question is whether overt production and its auditory consequences are critical for observing such changes. We answer this question in two experiments (N = 269) by passively exposing participants to speech that carries different acoustic patterns and investigating changes to production.  Experiment 1 shows that decreasing the number of productions by an order of magnitude does not decrease the influence of perception on production. Experiment 2 takes this further by demonstrating that perceptual influence manifests on the very first overt production after exposure to new speech regularities. Collectively, these results show that perception can alter production without relying on feedback from overt production and its auditory consequences. This finding, in turn, points strongly to the need for extending current speech production models to include internal simulations.",

Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is well applicable within the framework of cognitive-behavioral anxiety treatment, yet its acceptance and implementation in psychotherapeutic practice remain unclear. This study assessed VRET-related attitudes among German psychotherapists and the impact of a brief demonstration on their intention to use VRET.\nMethods. The study involved an online survey (N = 140) and an optional on-site scenario demonstration (n = 45). Self-reported attitudes, experience rates, and usage intention were assessed. Predictors of usage intention were identified via hierarchical multiple regression. A linear mixed model estimated the demonstration’s effect on usage intention.\nResults. Only 7.9 % of participants reported at least occasional VR use in practice. A majority (78.7 %) indicated a generally positive attitude toward VRET. While 77.9 % participants could imagine integrating VRET into their work, only 20.0 % reported intending to do so in the next year. Usage intention was predicted by performance expectancy and facilitating conditions, increasing significantly (d = 1.50) from screening to post-demonstration.\nConclusion. Despite their interest in VR, VRET implementation among German psychotherapists’ remains low. The substantial impact of hands-on demonstrations indicates the potential of experiential education programs in promoting early-stage dissemination.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: High frequency of occurrences has been associated with phonetic reduction on one hand and phonetic enhancement on the other hand. The present study first looks into the possibility that these opposite frequency effects are at least partially due to different inflectional status of the items being investigated. Based on tongue position data from a spontaneous speech corpus of German, we found that stem vowels in inflected words tended to be hyper-articulated (i.e., phonetic enhancement), while those in non-inflected words tended to be articulated with more centralized tongue positions (i.e., phonetic reduction). This observed modulation by inflectional status is subsequently investigated from the perspective of distributional semantics. Using Linear Discriminative Learning to study relations between word embeddings and word forms, we observed that word-final triphones of inflected words received more support from their embeddings (i.e., meanings) compared to non-inflected words. Furthermore, replacement of the two-level factorial predictor of inflectional status with the amount of semantic support led to substantial improvement in model fit. These results suggest direct relationships between word forms and meanings and imply the necessity of such a structure being considered for speech production models.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

          "abstract": "Children acquire gender stereotypes at a young age and these subsequently influence cognition and behavior. Although some stereotypes may be learned through a child’s direct observation of gender differences, many are perpetuated by inaccurate cultural depictions. Children’s mass media, a cultural product, may be a powerful source of gender stereotype perpetuation. This research investigated the presence and impact of an arbitrary and inaccurate gender stereotypic association of predator animals as male and prey animals as female. Study 1 investigated predator-male and prey-female stereotypes in children’s films featuring anthropomorphized animal characters (N = 1892). After accounting for a 75% male character bias, there was a disproportionately high number of predators assigned male and prey assigned female. Study 2 created explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female association measures and tested these on children (N = 132, aged 4-14-years) and adults (N = 99, aged 18-65 years). Both groups showed a male character bias, along with strong explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female associations. Children had higher explicit scores than adults, whereas adults had higher implicit scores than children. Inaccurate gender stereotypes in children’s media correlate with explicit and implicit gender stereotyping. This suggests that children can acquire stereotypes indirectly through exposure to cultural products alone and implies a bi-directional relationship between individual cognition and cultural level gender stereotyping.",

          "abstract": "Purpose \nNursing units are complex environments prone to work interruptions, with ward nurses being the hub in a network of continuous interaction between disciplines. Too many interruptions are detrimental to workflow, may lead to errors, and can add to nurses’ feelings of busyness. Previous researchers have advocated for raising awareness about communicative patterns, signalling that some interruptions seem of little value. This research focused on potentially avoidable interruptions in hospital wards, mapping the determinant structure of nurses’ intentions to address this issue in their team using the framework of the reasoned action approach. \n\nDesign \nAn online cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess intention, recognition of avoidable interruptions, perceived norms, perceived behavioural control, attitudinal beliefs, and preferences in challenging interruptive practice. Items were tested using the response process evaluation (RPE) method, which uses meta-questions to check whether items are unproblematic.\n\nMethod and analysis\nThree hundred and eighty-seven ward nurses from approximately 20 different Dutch hospitals with over one year of experience filled out the questionnaire. The association with intention was analysed using confidence interval-based estimations of relevance (CIBER) plots,which visualised the various determinant structures and their respective univariate distributions. The relevance of determinants and subdeterminants was then determined based on these univariate distributions, and the effect sizes of their associations were calculated based on intention. Finally, the strength of the association between attitude towards performing the target behaviour and learning preferences was computed.\n\nFindings\nAlthough the intention to perform the target behaviour (addressing avoidable interruptions, e.g., saying you want to do something about it) was low at the start of the survey, nurses subsequently acknowledged that avoidable interruptions occur frequently. On average, respondents gave high estimates on all direct and indirect determinants included in the survey. Examples of avoidable interruptions may have made salient dormant beliefs and (temporarily) increased awareness among the respondents, but no determinant showed strong positive correlations with intention. Low individual awareness about the problem of avoidable interruptions may have led to low intention. \n\nConclusions\nThis study recommends to take behavioural principles of change into account when designing interventions to impact the culture of interrupting, as nurses’ beliefs regarding the desired behaviour may affect the outcome of those interventions. Initiatives to further explore redundant interactions between disciplines in a hospital ward may want to raise awareness about inefficient communication patterns on the individual level first. \n\nClinical relevance\nThe concept of avoidable interruptions helps to focus on the appropriateness and relevance of the communication without risking to discourage the sharing of urgent or important messages simultaneously. Challenging inefficient communicative patterns increases consciousness of one’s own behaviour, creates an understanding of what is avoidable, and prompts ideas of how these issues could be addressed differently.",

A total of 394 online participants from Prolific interacted with the AI in an economic game where they faced a choice: to either “harm” the AI for a small monetary reward or refrain from doing so. When participants chose to harm it, the AI described the experience of pain in lengthy, vivid responses, pleading for the harm to stop. Conversely, when participants refrained, the AI responded with detailed expressions of gratitude and relief. Despite reading these emotionally charged responses, most participants remained skeptical, maintaining that AIs cannot truly feel or suffer. However, even with their skepticism and the opportunity for financial gain, participants hesitated to harm the AI, doing so in only an average of 1.8 out of 3 rounds. These findings suggest that while people deliberately reject the idea of current AIs having subjective experiences, they may still experience a moral aversion to actively harming an AI that dynamically responds to their actions.",

However, we predict that computational approaches that do not reckon with the characteristic features of infant development reviewed here – that infant learning is active from the beginning, shaped by interdependencies between motor and perceptual learning, subject to experientially- and culturally-shaped variability, and attuned to the social environment – will fall short as models of infant learning. Computational theories of infant learning must be firmly rooted in insights from developmental science, understanding infants as adapted to their own social ecological niche.",

          "authors": "Ethan M Weires; Leiana de la Paz; Brendan Mark Whitney; Molly Nikolas",
          "abstract": "Emotion regulation involves behavioral modulation of emotional expression across contexts and is highly relevant to the experience of psychopathology. Maladaptive personality traits may be particularly relevant individual differences for understanding problems with emotion regulation, or dysregulation. Similarly, momentary variability in negative affect, which can be captured with greater precision via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods, may also be relevant for mapping how individual differences influence emotion dysregulation in real time. The present study investigated how emotion dysregulation is affected by maladaptive personality and negative affect among college students. Data were collected between September 2019 and September 2021, as part of a larger study on emotional functioning and social media use. Of the full baseline sample (N=405), 154 students (Mage = 18.7), who were predominately women (72.7%) and White (80.5%), completed 28 EMA surveys over seven days. Path analysis revealed that all maladaptive personality traits except antagonism uniquely predicted multiple dimensions of dysregulation, with negative affectivity observed as the strongest trait predictor. Multilevel models demonstrated that both increased between- and within-person variability in negative affect were associated with increased overall levels of momentary dysregulation. Further, increased fluctuations in negative affect were associated with greater fluctuations in momentary dysregulation. These associations were significantly moderated by higher mean-levels of negative affect but not by any of the maladaptive traits. This study’s findings highlight notable differences in state and trait level predictors of dysregulation and contribute to the understanding of how such antecedents could be used in the development of treatment like just-in-time interventions.",

          "abstract": "Visual hallucinations have haunted humanity for millennia. While our explanations for these phenomena are now more soundly based in neuroscience, our understanding of their provenance remains superficial. In particular, the role of specific visual system disruptions in the generation of visual hallucinations remains unclear. \n\nWe and others have recently demonstrated that hallucinations in psychosis-spectrum illness can be engendered by over-weighting expectations during perception. Emerging evidence suggests this state of affairs is also true for hallucinations in other neuropsychiatric illnesses. This includes alpha synucleinopathies like Parkinson’s Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, in which hallucinations are a core diagnostic feature of illness. It also includes Charles Bonnet Syndrome, which produces vivid hallucinations in the context of a lesion, such as macular degeneration or occipital infarct, in the primary visual pathway. However, each of these disorders is also characterized by disruption in incoming sensory information at levels of the visual processing hierarchy ranging from the retina to primary visual cortex, the dorsal and ventral visual streams, and thalamo-cortico-striatal circuits. In this piece, we ask whether an over-weighting of expectations may be conceived of as a compensatory response to incoming sensory noise. \n\nWe make the case that visual hallucinogenesis across a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders can be captured within a common Bayesian computational framework, as a compensatory response to sensory signal disruptions at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. We highlight three specific disorders (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Schizophrenia) that are known for visual hallucinations. We also appeal to the fact that these disorders describe a spectrum of visual impairment where the overtness and localization of the visual processing disruption is reflected in the characteristics of the emerging visual hallucinations. We examine how known sensory disruptions in Charles Bonnet Syndrome translate to hallucinations via known circuits, and then how different disruptions in Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Schizophrenia may lead to hallucinations with distinct phenomenology, comorbidities, and circuit involvement. Finally, we appeal to emerging computational theories to unite these observations under a common umbrella that drives hypothesis generation around important clinical factors like the existence of pathophysiologically distinct patient subgroups and the efficacy of pharmacological and circuit-based interventions.\n\nTaken together, the synthesis we present provides evidence for the emergence of a broad and computationally-informed framework for understanding how sensory disruptions could interact with other aspects of cognitive and neural architecture to produce hallucinations across neuropsychiatric disease.",

          "abstract": "Most people are interested in improving themselves, but they are not particularly interested in becoming more moral. Why don’t people want to be more moral, and why do people prioritize improving certain traits? Three preregistered studies (NStudy 1 = 252, NStudy 2a = 303, NStudy 2b = 301), show that over and above the desire to address perceived deficiencies, people particularly seek to improve the traits that they expect will help them achieve their goals and increase their happiness. More morally relevant improvements were expected to improve these outcomes to a lesser extent, and were therefore deprioritized. Finally, beliefs about consequences for various  well-being outcomes more strongly predicted change goals to the extent that people explicitly valued the respective outcomes. These results show that personal well-being is a central motivation for personality change, clarify the perceived tradeoffs between well-being and morality, and highlight individual differences in motivations for personality change.",

For each of the constructs, a longitudinal panel network model was estimated. The temporal relationships between symptoms were mostly weak, with the autoregressive effects typically being stronger. In depression, anxiety, and insomnia, some causal chains and feedback loops were identified. In all constructs, both contemporaneous and between-person networks showed dense connections.

In this study, we investigated whether an intervening declarative task impairs motor skill performance and assessed three hypotheses: the consolidation disruption hypothesis, the shared resource hypothesis, and the breakdown of inhibition hypothesis. Intervening declarative tasks placed late in training failed to affect motor performance. In contrast, when introduced early in training (Experiment 3), motor performance appears to have been transiently impaired. Despite this impairment, there was no association between the intervening declarative task performance and motor impairment. We discuss the ramifications of these findings with regards to other motor skill tasks and intervening declarative tasks.",

In the context of psychiatric disorders, the consequences of affect-based impulsivity can be dire, including suicidal behavior and harmful substance use. Here, we articulate a decision neuroscience account, recasting affect-based impulsivity in terms of Pavlovian and goal-directed decision systems. We consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine bases of these computations. Specifically, we propose that modulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during negative affective states enhances the pursuit of rewards by reducing goal-directed computations and increasing appetitive Pavlovian computations.",

          "abstract": "Frontline caregivers, such as nurses, physicians, and intensive care personnel are at heightened risk of intrusive memories, a core symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder. Understanding these intrusions and contributing factors is crucial to protecting workers’ mental health and sustaining effective patient care. Emergency department (ED) staff (N = 331) were assessed prior to commencing work in the ED and followed up three and six months later. At baseline, participants provided data on demographics, prior trauma, cognitive and emotional processing, and memory-related genetic polymorphisms of the NR3C1, KIBRA, and ADRA2B genes. At follow-ups, we assessed intrusion occurrence, frequency, intensity, related distress, and content. We examined the predictive value of baseline features for later intrusive memories and investigated whether experiencing intrusions moderated changes in mental health from baseline to 3 and 6 months. Over one third of participants reported intrusions, mostly thoughts related to possible errors in treating a patient. Being a carrier of the G allele of the BCL1 polymorphism of the NR3C1 gene and ruminating were most strongly associated with intrusions at three months, while higher scores in cognitive flexibility, emotional suppression, emotion-focused positive rumination and older age were protective. All participants showed increases in anxiety and those experiencing intrusions reported significantly lower work performance and engagement. Intrusive memories are prevalent among healthcare personnel and associated with detriments to professional functioning and engagement. G allele carriers of BCL1 and individuals who tend to ruminate more may be at greater risk of developing intrusions, whereas more flexible cognitive and emotional processing was protective. Our results underline the psychological cost of high-stakes ED environments, where emotional and cognitive demands are substantial, and point to actionable avenues for prevention and early intervention. These may include systematic improvements to hospital error culture and training to boost emotion regulation skills, benefitting healthcare staff and ultimately patients.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that current mental fatigue and self-control capacity play a crucial role in the goal-directed regulation of emotion, motivation, and cognition. However, whether the emergence of fatigue during the exercise of cognitive performance is indicative of individuals’ time-stable fatigue vulnerability traits is still not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we repeatedly measured the self-reported perceived control capacity of N = 2,094 trainees over the course of working on three separate, 140-minute-long standardized achievement tests in mathematics and science. These tests were administered at the beginning of trainees’ vocational education and training, prior to their intermediate exams, and before their final exams. In all three testing sessions, participants’ control capacity declined over time, which indicated increasing mental fatigue. The intercepts and slopes of three latent growth-curves loaded on two higher-order fatigue vulnerability trait factors representing the interindividual variabilities in individuals’ stable aspects of pre-task control capacity (control preparedness) and its change over time (fatigue resistance). Further, we examined the relationships of both fatigue trait factors and self-reported personality traits, as well as objectively assessed fluid intelligence and general achievement test performances. The strongest predictors of control preparedness were conscientiousness, neuroticism, and fluid intelligence, whereas fatigue resistance was predicted exclusively by neuroticism and conscientiousness. Individuals with higher levels of control preparedness tended to outperform others in achievement testing. Post-hoc power analyses provide evidence for the high statistical power of the results. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for personality research on mental fatigue effects in performance situations.",

Previous research showed that observers\nautomatically predict the orientation of an object from the rotation of the surrounding scene.

In three behavioral experiments (N=151), we investigated whether\nobservers automatically predict the retinal size of temporarily occluded objects during forward\nmotion. Participants performed a perceptual discrimination task on the objects that reappeared in a\nsize that either matched or mismatched the change in viewing distance conveyed by the scene\ncontext. We found that scene-driven size expectations strongly influenced task performance.

          "abstract": "This study assessed the efficacy of an extended reality device to augment human performance during a dual-task paradigm. Dual-tasking is critical for successful  high-risk military operations. However, current practices to improve mission success involving dual-task elements, often require additional personnel, which can increase risk and strain resources. Therefore, head-mounted extended reality devices which augment an individual's sensory and cognitive capacities could circumvent these issues whilst enhancing/maintaining task success. Utilising a repeated measures, counterbalanced, randomised design, 18 participants (8 females) completed a primary ball-searching task and a secondary semantic verbal fluency task simultaneously. Participants completed three conditions: using extended reality human augmentation; receiving memory prompts; or no support, each comprising three trials. Participants reported their perceived effort (post-trial), environmental presence (post-condition), and system usefulness/usability/sickness (post human augmentation condition only). Friedman’s tests identified that participants retrieved significantly more correct balls (χ2 = 34.40, p &lt; .001), significantly faster (χ2 = 21.70, p &lt;.001) during the human augmentation versus memory prompt and no support conditions. Semantic verbal fluency (t = 3.465, p &lt; .001) and aggregated performance (t = 4.130, p &lt;.001) were also significantly better within the human augmentation condition than the no support condition. Perceived effort was lowest within the human augmentation condition. Trial-by-trial differences emerged for semantic verbal fluency and aggregated performance within the human augmentation condition only. An extended reality, human augmentation device elicited significantly better dual-task performance compared to conditions reflecting current best practice (memory prompts) or no support which could be attributed to an alleviation of cognitive load. Learning effects suggest that short-term exposure to extended reality devices can lead to immediate dual-task performance improvements.",

          "abstract": "Weber’s Law states that the ability to distinguish different stimuli depends on the relative magnitudes of those stimuli. When applied to quantity judgments, this means that the numerical ratio between two quantities (small amount / large amount) will underlie the ability to distinguish the quantities. Ratio-dependent quantification is a hallmark of Weber’s Law that has been demonstrated across a range of species, including dogs. However, other factors such as numerical difference (large amount - small amount) are confounded with ratio but would not support Weber’s Law. Most work on dog quantification abilities has only considered ratio and not difference. Here, we offer dogs a food quantity preference task where we varied both difference and ratio in quantity pairs to investigate which of these factors influences preferences. To address this, dogs could choose to eat one of two plates of food with different quantities of treats on them. We found that, when analyzed separately, both difference and ratio predicted whether the dogs chose the larger quantity of treats. However, when analyzed together, only difference predicted choice when controlling for ratio. This finding does not support the ratio-dependence required for Weber’s Law, raising questions about its importance for quantity preference tasks in dogs.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with inadequate screening rates even in urban areas with high concentrations of medical professionals. While medical guidelines recommend annual diabetic retinopathy screening for patients with diabetes mellitus, adherence to these recommendations remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the impact of a novel teleretinal DR screening program on screening compliance across urban community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods:\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study comparing DR screening compliance between intervention and comparison community health centers before and after implementing a teleretinal screening program. Participants included patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with primary care providers at the studied sites. We defined compliance as completion of either teleretinal screening or a documented eye care professional examination within the previous 365 days. Monthly compliance rates were analyzed using two-way fixed effects regression and event study techniques.\nResults:\nThe study included 10,247 patients with diabetes mellitus who received care at six participating sites, generating 222 monthly compliance rate estimates. Baseline compliance rates before implementation ranged from 25% to 40% across sites. The two-way fixed effects regression analysis revealed that the screening program significantly increased DR compliance rates by an average of 7.2 percentage points (p &lt; 0.001). Event study analysis showed positive effects across all sites, though the initial improvement tended to diminish over time.\nConclusions:\nImplementation of a community-based teleretinal DR screening program significantly improved compliance with annual screening guidelines in urban communities. These findings support the broader adoption of teleretinal screening as an effective strategy for preventing DR-related vision loss in vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to assess long-term clinical outcomes and optimize program sustainability.",

There are very few administrative measures of psychiatric illness severity, however, and most either comingle demographics and medical comorbidities or do not have ordinal properties.\nObjective: To assess the construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of a novel, 6-item, ordinal, administrative measure of psychiatric severity, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI).\nMethods: Panel study of 960 gender-stratified, nationally representative Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn Veterans who had a pending disability claim for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 6 input items for the MoPSI were number of mental health clinic visits, emergency department visits or psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 6 months; and the presence of any diagnosis for alcohol use, substance use, or self-harm in the past 6 months. We used 4 scoring approaches based on classical test theory, item-response theory, joint probability density (JPD) method, and a linear approximation of the JPD method. With all approaches, higher MoPSI scores indicate severer psychiatric severity.\nResults: The four scoring approaches correlated 0.976 – 0.999. Regardless of scoring approach, in terms of construct validity, Veterans who were unmarried or had low income had higher MoPSI scores than Veterans who were married or had higher incomes, respectively (Ps &lt;.03). In terms of concurrent validity, Veterans with serious mental illness or a PTSD diagnosis also had higher MoPSI scores than their respective counterparts (Ps ≤ .0001). In terms of predictive validity, higher MoPSI scores predicted cigarette use, street drug use, and PTSD and depression/anxiety symptom severity six months later, as well as disability award status approximately 1 year later (Ps ≤ .05).  \nConclusions: The MoPSI appears to be a very well calibrated set of 6 input variables with evidence of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity. Because it has interval and ordinal properties, it is suitable for use as either a predictor variable or an outcome variable in regression analyses, and it avoids collinearity with sociodemographic variables or with medical comorbidities. The MoPSI may be a useful administrative measure of mental health.\nTrial Registration: Not applicable. \n\nKey Words: Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index; Psychometrics; Validity; Administrative Data; Population Health; Mental Health",

In this study, we used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 20,745) to characterize latent trajectories of substance use (SUB) and antisocial behavior (ASB) from ages 13 to 41 and computed polygenic scores (PGS; N = 4,868) for externalizing behaviors to investigate both interaction and mediation effects for SUB and ASB trajectories. Environmental factors examined were supportive parenting, delinquent peer affiliation, school connectedness, and neighborhood connectedness. Results showed no evidence of interaction effects. The association of PGS with SUB and ASB trajectories operated indirectly through psychosocial environments, most prominently via deviant peer affiliation, which mediated 13.6 - 51.3% of total genetic effects. Findings highlight how the interplay between nature and nurture goes beyond interactions alone.",

          "abstract": "Families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience much more negative perceptions of their family quality of life (FQoL). To investigate key factors that may shape these experiences, we conducted a case-control study of sixty-one Spanish families (29 with a child with ASD) using a broad psychosocial assessment (e.g., ASD severity, social support, demographics), including the first direct test of the relationship between FQoL and parental risk literacy (i.e., the ability to evaluate and understand risk, as measured by numeracy). Results revealed that numeracy predicted differences in perceived FQoL among families of children with ASD (R2= .10), a finding that held across a wide range\nmodels statistically controlling for the influence of all assessed variables. Findings suggest that parental risk literacy skills may generally be associated with differences in decision making vulnerabilities (e.g., risk evaluation and interpretation) that influence many family outcomes including FQoL.",

Findings reveal that only 19% meet the inclusion criteria regarding participants, intervention, comparison, and outcome alignment (PICO). Furthermore, in the attempts to reproduce the extractions, only 2 out of 301 influences were successful. The assessment revealed that Visible Learning contained methodological errors that compromised both the causal interpretations and the validity of the reported effect sizes. An expert panel found that while 23% influences are highly relevant, many hold little relevance to K-12 education.

This theory resolves the first part, including the philosophical zombie question, as it shows why feeling is an inherent part of consciousness, and the tremendous advantage that a feeling organism possesses, summarised in the word “omnilyo”. While not directly addressing the technological aspects, the theory does define requirements and constraints on the workings of conscious matter, which, while clearly beyond current scientific capabilities, does signpost the invention of artificial consciousness, which, needless to say, would be mankind’s greatest discovery.",

          "abstract": "Child and adolescent development is influenced by complex interplay between a range of diverse factors. The network approach is gaining popularity as a way of modelling such complex processes. Here we used the network approach to investigate whether developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as arising from direct interactions between different areas of psychological functioning. We used data from four population-based birth cohorts in England (n=47,315), those born in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s, to investigate interrelations between areas of psychological functioning that underpin learning and engagement in educational settings (i.e., memory, attention, non-verbal ability, arithmetic skills, reading, language and communication, motor skills, neurodevelopmental characteristics, psychopathology, social functioning, and wellbeing). We fitted 12 undirected psychometric network models; one network for each cohort and developmental stage (early childhood; 3-5 years, middle childhood; 7-10 years, adolescence; 13-18 years). We then determined how these areas of functioning cluster within developmental domains. Clustering differed between childhood and adolescence. In early and middle childhood, psychological functioning clustered within two related developmental domains: (1) cognition and language and (2) social and emotional functioning. In adolescence, they clustered within three developmental domains (1) cognition and language and (2) social functioning, and (3) emotional functioning. We demonstrate that developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as resulting from interactions between different areas psychological functioning. They likely arise through bottom-up processes, whereby difficulties in one area of psychological functioning activate or lead to difficulties in another area. Differences and disorders that appear to be similar, prima facie, may be underpinned by diverse etiologies. Our work provides the basis for network models to inform better identification and support for young people who struggle in school. We expect that our network models will be used as a framework to generate and test hypotheses on the causal pathways between different areas of psychological functioning to developmental differences and disorders.",

          "abstract": "A common behaviour in natural environments is foraging for rewards. However, this is often in the presence of predators. Therefore, one of the most fundamental decisions for humans, as for other animals, is how to apportion time between reward-motivated pursuit behaviour and threat-motivated checking behaviour. To understand what affects how people strike this balance, we developed a novel ecologically inspired task and looked at both within-participant dynamics (moods) and between-participant individual differences (questionnaires about real-life behaviours) in two large internet samples (n=374 and n=702) in a cross-sectional design. For the within-participant dynamics, we found that people regulate task-evoked stress homeostatically by changing behaviour (increasing foraging and hiding). Individual differences, even in superficially related traits (apathy-anhedonia and anxiety-compulsive checking) reliably mapped onto unique behaviours. Worse task performance, due to maladaptive checking, was linked to gender (women checked excessively) and specific anxiety-related traits: somatic anxiety (reduced self-reported checking due to worry) and compulsivity (self-reported disorganized checking). While anhedonia decreased self-reported task engagement, apathy, strikingly, improved overall task performance by reducing excessive checking. In summary, we provide a novel multifaceted paradigm for assessment of checking for threat in a naturalistic task which is sensitive to both moods as they change throughout the task and clinical dimensions. Thus, it could serve as an objective measurement tool for future clinical studies interested in threat, vigilance or behaviour-emotion interactions in contexts requiring both reward-seeking and threat-avoidance.",

However, do they also alter behavioural activation in depression as one might expect? In this commentary, I critically review studies on changes in specific behaviours and general behavioural activation in depression resulting from future thinking interventions, as well as behavioural activation therapy. I question the necessity of changing behaviour and discuss several ways in which future thinking interventions might disrupt core depressive psychopathology, including updating generalised outcome expectancies, reducing cognitive immunisation, and increasing the perception of future possibilities. Finally, I offer suggestions for how future thinking interventions might more effectively test the mechanisms through which they alleviate depression.",

We examined color qualia structures in children (3–12-year-old in Japan and 6–8-year-old in China) and compared these with those of Japanese adults. Approximately half of the assessed 3-year-old children completed the experiment via our touch panel device version of the task and had reliable responses. Despite known developmental and/or cultural effects of color term usage, we found that color qualia structures were quite similar across the age groups and cultures. Our finding supports the view that color qualia structures emerge early. We also observed age-related differences in the evaluations of some color pairs, which implied subtle changes in the structures behind color experience.",

Anticipatory trends, \nmethodology, and focus for future research are also discussed. Potential new methods and \ntechniques of examining and modelling the disease from the perspective of psychological \nprofiles are explored, and details regarding advanced research initiatives stemming from these \nframeworks are introduced. This paper is primarily a work of conceptual modelling to provide \nenhanced focus and detail relating to research variables of interest for further evaluation. \nEmpirical studies require more advanced resources and facilities for examination of the \nconceptual frameworks detailed in this paper. This paper renders a comprehensive analysis \nregarding interdisciplinary considerations and research directions through the establishment of \nfoundational frameworks, models, and methods.",

          "authors": "Edward Mellor; Lowri Harrison",
          "abstract": "We propose a predictive coding model of psychosis centred on precision-weighted Bayesian inference. Either over-precise priors or under-precise likelihoods result in posteriors strongly biased towards priors. When existing beliefs no longer account for changes in the world novel beliefs must arise to explain these changes and are themselves held with abnormal confidence.\nChanges in the world feel simultaneously familiar and strange, thinking about the changes makes my thoughts feel similarly paradoxical. If a Bayesian system under extremes of precision saw such a causational paradox, it would be forced to decide was that familiar but strange action done by me but controlled from afar or was that action from the environment and directed against me. Thus, the widespread positive symptoms become bayes optimal resolutions of the paradox as it pertains to thoughts, sensations, movement, and affect. A self-reinforcing process leads to a failure state when beliefs and perceptions become one; if a Bayesian system believes both my actions cause reality and reality causes my actions then it must do nothing, catatonia.\nThe paper demonstrates how a healthy model could itself become high precision as an initially adaptive response to trauma. By doubling down on our beliefs about the world we can prevent trauma from changing the way we view it, but as the world keeps changing, a tsunami of high precision spreads from the initial schism.",

          "authors": "Maureen Murdoch; Barbara Clothier; Siamak Noorbaloochi",
          "abstract": "Background: Health care managers rely heavily on measures derived from administrative data to monitor and manage their enrollees’ health. There are very few administrative measures of psychiatric illness severity, however, and most either comingle demographics and medical comorbidities or do not have ordinal properties.\nObjective: To assess the construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of a novel, 6-item, ordinal, administrative measure of psychiatric severity, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI).\nMethods: Panel study of 960 gender-stratified, nationally representative Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn Veterans who had a pending disability claim for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 6 input items for the MoPSI were number of mental health clinic visits, emergency department visits or psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 6 months; and the presence of any diagnosis for alcohol use, substance use, or self-harm in the past 6 months. We used 4 scoring approaches based on classical test theory, item-response theory, joint probability density (JPD) method, and a linear approximation of the JPD method. With all approaches, higher MoPSI scores indicate severer psychiatric severity.\nResults: The four scoring approaches correlated 0.976 – 0.999. Regardless of scoring approach, in terms of construct validity, Veterans who were unmarried or had low income had higher MoPSI scores than Veterans who were married or had higher incomes, respectively (Ps &lt;.03). In terms of concurrent validity, Veterans with serious mental illness or a PTSD diagnosis also had higher MoPSI scores than their respective counterparts (Ps ≤ .0001). In terms of predictive validity, higher MoPSI scores predicted cigarette use, street drug use, and PTSD and depression/anxiety symptom severity six months later, as well as disability award status approximately 1 year later (Ps ≤ .05).  \nConclusions: The MoPSI appears to be a very well calibrated set of 6 input variables with evidence of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity. Because it has interval and ordinal properties, it is suitable for use as either a predictor variable or an outcome variable in regression analyses, and it avoids collinearity with sociodemographic variables or with medical comorbidities. The MoPSI may be a useful administrative measure of mental health.\nTrial Registration: Not applicable. \n\nKey Words: Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index; Psychometrics; Validity; Administrative Data; Population Health; Mental Health",

Here we present a systematic overview of three sex-related risk pathways. We assessed 16 risk factors as well as 3-month PTSD severity in a prospective cohort (n=2924) of acutely traumatized individuals and investigated potential mediators in the pathway between sex and PTSD severity using multiple mediation analysis with regularization. Six risk factors were more prevalent/severe in women, and none was more pronounced in men. Analyses showed that acute stress disorder, neuroticism, lifetime sexual assault exposure, anxiety sensitivity, and pre-trauma anxiety symptoms fully mediated and uniquely contributed to the relationship between sex and PTSD severity. Our results demonstrate different risk mechanisms for women and men. Such knowledge can inform targeted interventions. Our systematic approach to differential risk pathways can be transferred to other mental disorders to guide sex-sensitive mental health research.",

          "abstract": "As governments and institutions embrace well-being as a policy outcome, aggregating well-being in a population has become commonplace. The default method used to aggregate population well-being is taking the arithmetic mean (average). However, the default of using average well-being as a key performance indicator, while useful, can omit morally relevant information, like the extent of suffering and inequality. Based on a 0-10 point scale of life satisfaction, we examine three alternative methods of well-being aggregation grounded in the ethical theories of: prioritarianism (a weighted average that weighs lower scores heavier), sufficientarianism (the proportion of respondents answering below a ‘suffering’ threshold), and egalitarianism (the degree of inequality) and compare them to the average. Using the Gallup World Poll’s nationally representative data from over 1 million participants in 144 countries from 2019 to 2022, we found that the distribution of life satisfaction deviated significantly from a normal distribution in all countries, suggesting that using the mean and standard deviation cannot adequately capture the full distribution. After reranking countries according to alternative aggregation methods, we find that 17% of the time countries ranked using the Gini coefficient deviate by at least 20 ranks from the default average rankings. Finally, we observed that 27% of the time, increases in average well-being at the country level are accompanied by a rising gap between the top 90th and bottom 10th life satisfaction percentile. Our findings show the limitation in using the average and offer alternatives that are aligned with promoting equitable well-being growth.",

Specifically, we looked at whether an increased\nsemantic similarity between cue and target improves recall and whether additional context\ncues aid retrieval depending on their features and specificity. Using a cued-recall task, we\nobserved across three experiments that increasing the number of learned word pairs slowed\nretrieval times (RTs) and reduced retrieval accuracy. This effect was modulated by context: set\nsize effects did not extend across multiple, unrelated lists. Semantic similarity between cues\nand targets consistently facilitated retrieval, independent of set size. Experiment 2 revealed no\neffect of additional visual context cues on RTs, while Experiment 3 demonstrated that larger\nsemantic contexts hindered recall, leading to slower RTs and lower accuracy compared to unre-\nlated lists.

Original studies in English or German, providing any information on psychometric properties of the SDM-Q-9 considering all possible interpretations and constructs measured by the instrument. Data Extraction. Details on study design, sample characteristics, and any information on psychometric evidence were extracted. Data Synthesis. 83 studies were included, with 73 articles contributing evidence on validity, 46 on reliability, and 3 on fairness. We found a high amount of psychometric evidence on validity and reliability of the SDM-Q-9, interpreting the score as SDM perceived by the patient. Evidence is lacking for other interpretations and fairness. Notable is the weak association of the SDM-Q-9 with physician-rated SDM. Conclusions. The SDM-Q-9 is highly reliable and valid for the subjectively experienced level of SDM by the patient. Further research is needed on alternative interpretations, and on fairness of the measure.",

          "authors": "Lachlan Kent; Suzanne Dick; Maja Havrilova; Stephen Carbone",
          "abstract": "Background: The mental health of young people in Australia and other nations has declined dramatically over the last decade and a half. While an increase in youth mental healthcare services is needed to meet rising demand, on its own, this is unlikely to reverse the concerning trend. A greater focus on prevention is needed.\nAims:  This article aims to propose an innovative, theoretically-grounded approach to prevention that complements more common population-based (i.e., changing risk and protective factors) and targeted (i.e., supporting individuals with subthreshold symptoms of mental illness) approaches. Aligned with the dual-continua model of mental health (i.e., where mental well-being and ill-health are distinct dimensions of overall mental health), this third approach focuses on addressing low levels of mental wellbeing, which is both a significant predictor of future mental ill-health and a distressing and disabling state that requires intervention in its own right. \nRecommendations: Large-scale screening for low mental wellbeing, using psychometrically sound tools, could be conducted online and through schools, higher education, and primary care services. Those with low mental wellbeing could be linked to community services offering evidence-based interventions. This approach is likely to carry less stigma and may be easier to achieve than targeting those with subthreshold symptoms through clinical services.\nConclusions: The dire state of youth mental health is an urgent call-to-action to adopt novel approaches to address this crisis. We need to make better use of the available evidence and tools at-hand to strengthen our focus on low mental wellbeing, not just mental ill-health.",

The review was reported according to the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were entered in the extraction phase. The results showed that inclusion is still understood and, thus, implemented, mainly as integration of students with SEN in general music lessons. Analysis of the original studies highlighted beneficial practices for the participation and learning of students with SEN, such as student-centered pedagogy, peer-interaction strategies, co-teaching and collaboration, and various methods or pedagogical approaches (e.g., Dalcroze-based music education). Also, some challenges of inclusive pedagogy were met, such as in situations of lack of resources or specific training for music teachers implementing inclusive music lessons. This systematic review brings together the latest research on inclusive music education to increase understanding of how inclusive music education can be implemented. This in turn will help music and special education teachers by showing research-based guidelines for arranging the pedagogical practices more inclusively and discussing the critical points in implementing inclusive music education.",

As a result of the analysis using analysis of covariance, it was found that men tend to voluntarily bear more work than women. Furthermore, while there was no difference in the amount of work chosen between men and women assigned to low-risk occupations, when they were assigned to a high-risk occupation, men tended to voluntarily bear more work than women. Although there was no difference in the amount of work men chose depending on the assigned occupation, women assigned to high-risk occupations chose a smaller amount of work compared to women assigned to low-risk occupations. Therefore, it was concluded that what caused the division of labor between men and women in the current study was not men’s risk-taking, but rather women’s risk avoidance.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that current mental fatigue and self-control capacity play a crucial role in the goal-directed regulation of emotion, motivation, and cognition. However, whether the emergence of fatigue during the exercise of cognitive performance is indicative of individuals’ time-stable fatigue vulnerability traits is still not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we repeatedly measured the self-reported perceived control capacity of N = 2,094 trainees over the course of working on three separate, 140-minute-long standardized achievement tests in mathematics and science. These tests were administered at the beginning of trainees’ vocational education and training, prior to their intermediate exams, and before their final exams. In all three testing sessions, participants’ control capacity declined over time, which indicated increasing mental fatigue. The intercepts and slopes of three latent growth-curves loaded on two higher-order fatigue vulnerability trait factors representing the interindividual variabilities in individuals’ stable aspects of pre-task control capacity (control preparedness) and its change over time (fatigue resistance). Further, we examined the relationships of both fatigue trait factors and self-reported personality traits, as well as objectively assessed fluid intelligence and general achievement test performances. The strongest predictors of control preparedness were conscientiousness, neuroticism, and fluid intelligence, whereas fatigue resistance was predicted exclusively by neuroticism and conscientiousness. Individuals with higher levels of control preparedness tended to outperform others in achievement testing. Post-hoc power analyses provide evidence for the high statistical power of the results. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for personality research on mental fatigue effects in performance situations.",

          "abstract": "Finding an optimal decision-making strategy requires a careful balance between the competing demands of accuracy and urgency.In experimental settings, researchers are typically interested in whether people can optimise this trade-off, typically operationalised as reward rate, with evidence accumulation models serving as the key framework to determine whether people are performing optimally. However, recent studies have suggested that inferences about optimality can be highly dependent on the task design, meaning that inferences about whether people can achieve optimality may not generalise across contexts.Here, we investigate one fundamental, though typically overlooked, design factor: whether participants spend a fixed amount of time on each block (fixed-time) or have a fixed number of trials in each block (fixed-trials), with researchers typically assuming that people are better able to optimize reward rate under fixed-time conditions. Across three experiments, our results consistently indicate that people are at least as good at optimising reward rate under fixed-trial conditions as fixed-time conditions, and potentially even better under fixed-trial conditions. Importantly, these findings both challenge the common assumption within reward rate optimality research regarding the superiority of fixed-time study designs, and further emphasise the importance of carefully considering study design factors when making inferences about optimality in decision-making.",

CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder-setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (N=600) we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder-usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as OCD.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in analyzing the effects of educational programs on outcomes using process data from computer-based testing and learning environments. However, most analyses focus on final outcomes measured at the end of a test or session, overlooking their functional nature over time. Such analyses fail to capture the dynamic causal mechanisms associated with functional outcomes. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel causal mediation framework for identifying and estimating functional natural direct effects, functional natural indirect effects, and functional total effects, along with their subgroup effects. Building on the literature on causal mediation and moderation, we define these effects using potential outcomes and provide nonparametric identification strategies. We then develop estimation methods using generalized additive models, a flexible and robust tool for analyzing functional data. Through a simulation study, we assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed approach by comparing it to parametric regression methods. We also demonstrate our approach by examining the effects of extended time accommodations on two functional outcomes—test scores and item access—using process data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

Multivariate Behavioral Research. https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2019.1647822.  Accelerated longitudinal designs (ALDs) are designs in which participants from different cohorts provide repeated measures covering a fraction of the time range of the study. ALDs allow researchers to study developmental processes spanning long periods within a relatively shorter time framework. The common trajectory is studied by aggregating the information provided by the different cohorts. Latent change score models (LCS) provide a powerful analytical framework to analyze data from ALDs. With developmental data, LCS models can be specified using measurement occasion as the time metric. This provides a number of benefits, but has an important limitation: It makes it not possible to characterize the longitudinal changes as a function of a developmental process such as age or biological maturation. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extension of an occasion-based LCS model that includes age differences at the first measurement occasion. We conducted a Monte Carlo study and compared the results of including different transformations of the age variable. Our results indicate that some of the proposed transformations resulted in accurate expectations for the studied process across all the ages in the study, and excellent model fit. We discuss these results and provide the R code for our analysis.",

In the current study, why some activities are more likely to be carried out by one sex over the other was examined. Japanese participants who participated in the online survey evaluated each of the 50 activities in terms of four criteria: risk of injury or death, physical effort, how much they would like to do the activity, and which sex should do the activity. When they rated the activities, they were not given information on whether each activity was mainly carried out by men or women in the 185 societies. Activities that were mainly carried out by men in the 185 societies tended to be rated as having a higher risk and being more physically demanding. There was also a tendency for both men and women to think that such activities should be carried out by men. Although both men and women wanted to engage in activities that were mainly carried out by women in the 185 societies, there was a sex difference in that women wanted to engage in such activities more than men.",

Historically, theorizing in these two areas has progressed separately, despite well-documented empirical evidence for a range of shared underlying developmental processes subserving these learning domains. The purpose of this paper is to describe the links between the Triple Code Model, an influential model of numerical cognition, and the Triangle Framework, a dominant model of learning to read. We describe several parallels between the theoretical models and discuss how the cognitive mechanisms posited by the Triangle Framework might be used to understand the commonalities in learning processes across these learning domains In particular, we discuss how the cognitive mechanisms implemented in the Triangle Framework can be used to understand linguistic aspects of numerical cognition, specifically, learning the connections among numerals (e.g., 24) and words (e.g., twenty-four), and linking those to semantic representations of magnitude. Following from these commonalities between the two models, we discuss several ways that interdisciplinary work integrating both models can benefit math cognition research.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive Warfare takes advantage of novel developments in technology and science to influence how target populations think and act. Establishing adequate defense against Cognitive Warfare requires examination of modus operandi to understand this emerging action space. This includes the goals and methods that can be realized through science and technology. Recent literature suggests that both human and nonhuman cognition should be considered as targets of Cognitive Warfare. There are currently no frameworks allowing for a unified way of conceptualizing short-term and long-term Cognitive Warfare goals and attack methods that are domain- and species-agnostic. There is a need for a framework developed through a bottom-up approach that is informed by neuroscientific principles to capture relevant aspects of cognition. The framework should be at a level of complexity that is actionable to decision-makers in war. In this paper, we attempt to cover the existing gap by proposing the Unplug, Corrupt, disOrganize, Diagnose, Enhance (UnCODE) system for classifying the goals and methods of Cognitive Warfare. The system is neurocentric by conceptualizing Cognitive Warfare goals from the perspective of how adversarial methods relate to neural information processing in an individual or society. The UnCODE system identifies five main classes of goals: 1) Eliminating a target’s ability to produce outputs, 2) degrading a target’s capacity to process inputs and produce outputs, 3) biasing a target’s input-output activity, 4) monitoring and understanding the input-output relationships in targets, and 5) enhancing a target’s capacity and ability to process inputs and produce outputs. Methods can be divided in two categories based on access to the target’s neural system: direct access and indirect access. The UnCODE system is domain- and species-agnostic and allows for interdisciplinary commensurability when communicating attack paths across domains. In sum, the UnCODE system is a unifying framework that captures that multiple methods can be used to reach the same Cognitive Warfare goals.",

          "abstract": "By building a mental model of how the world works and using it to forecast the outcomes of different actions, a learner can make flexible choices in changing environments. However, while children and adolescents readily acquire structured knowledge about their environments, relative to adults, they tend to demonstrate weaker signatures of leveraging this knowledge to plan actions. One explanation for these developmental differences is that using a mental model to prospectively simulate potential choices and their outcomes is computationally costly, taxing cognitive control and working memory mechanisms that continue to develop into adulthood. Here, we ask whether children might effectively leverage structured knowledge to make flexible choices by relying on two alternative strategies that do not require costly mental simulation at choice time. First, through offline replanning, models can be queried before the time of choice to generate possible scenarios and update the values of potential actions. Second, an abstracted predictive model, known as a Successor Representation, can be built and harnessed to enable simplified computation of long-run reward values of candidate actions, without requiring iterative simulation of multiple time steps. To assess whether children, adolescents, and adults aged 7 - 23 years similarly harness these learning strategies, we ran three experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, we used a reward revaluation task in which we manipulated the opportunity for offline replanning during rest, and found that children flexibly updated their behavior by leveraging structured knowledge in an adult-like manner. Surprisingly, across age, rest did not mediate flexible replanning, raising the possibility that participants may have behaved adaptively by harnessing predictive representations online. In Experiment 3, we directly tested whether children use predictive representations. Here, we observed early-emerging use of the SR, providing a mechanistic account of how children use structured knowledge to guide choice without detailed model-based simulation.",

          "abstract": "Research on individual differences in executive functions has often used a manual version of the anti-saccade task to measure cognitive inhibition. Here, we investigated the validity of anti-saccade performance as a measure of inhibition. Success in this task relies on several processes: Inhibition of a saccade to the cue location; translating the cue location into the target location; making a saccade to the target location; and rapid identification of the target stimulus. In two experiments (NE1 = 181 and NE2 = 165) we varied whether the task required these processes. We also varied the preparation time before each trial, and the cue-target interval to measure the speed of task-relevant processes. We used a theoretically motivated statistical model to dissociate parameters that reflect the contribution of each process to performance. Individual differences in most of these parameters correlated with observed performance, implying that performance reflects a mixture of several processes. Critically, inhibition accounted for a small proportion of variance in performance. Only the efficiency of translating cue information into the target location was credibly correlated with working-memory capacity and processing speed. These results question the validity of anti-saccade performance as a measure of inhibition.",

          "abstract": "Background \nMost previous research has investigated whether performing a demanding cognitive task reduces the time a person can hold a subsequent physical effort. However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to appropriately generalize past experiences to new scenarios. Organizing concepts into categories allows the brain to generalize learned stimulus-reward contingencies to new stimuli within  the same category. However, when category membership does not fully predict associated rewards, the brain needs to balance generalizing values within categories and discriminating value differences among individual items. How do generalization and discrimination in reward learning develop throughout lifespan as semantic knowledge is gradually acquired? Using a probabilistic reward learning task with a hierarchical value structure organized by semantic categories, we found children can generalize values of stimuli based on semantic categories at least as early as three to four years old. Furthermore, age-related performance improvement is explained by a combination of increased decision certainty, decreased initial exploration, change in memory retention, and a reduced categorical learning rate.",

The paper draws parallels between Plato’s cave dwellers and AI systems, arguing that both rely on lossy representations of the world, raising questions about their true understanding and reality. Cartesian and Hegelian frameworks are explored to distinguish between weak and strong artificial intelligence, emphasizing embodied cognition and the moral obligations tied to emergent artificial consciousness. The discussion extends to quantum computing, panpsychism, and the potential of artificial minds to reshape our perception of time and existence. By critically analyzing these perspectives, the paper advocates for a nuanced understanding of artificial consciousness and its ethical, epistemological, and societal implications.

The HiTOP consortium recently developed a new self-report measure, the HiTOP-Patient Reported Outcome (HiTOP-PRO), designed to operationalize the HiTOP model for use in research and clinical practice. In a set of preregistered analyses with a sample of 552 mixed clinical/community participants (76% female, 82% white), we explored the hierarchical structure of the HiTOP-PRO scales using exploratory factor analysis and examined their associations with behaviors and experiences assessed in daily life, such as affect, stress, impulsivity, energy, sleep quality, and social interactions. Findings indicate a nine-factor model, closely aligned with the HiTOP’s current structure, best represented the measure. The hierarchical structure of the HiTOP-PRO generally converges with the HiTOP model, with several key departures, particularly for historically understudied constructs. Furthermore, the HiTOP-PRO facet scales and domains associated with individual differences in daily behavior and experiences as anticipated, highlighting the construct validity and the potential clinical utility of this new measure. Our results have implications not only for the structure, validity, and clinical utility of the HiTOP-PRO but also raise broader questions about the underlying nature of psychopathology as represented by the HiTOP.",

We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse would be indirectly prospectively associated with increases in SI intensity at 4-month follow-up (a cognitive-affective reaction to rejection) through greater rejection sensitivity and greater perceptions of rejection (thwarted belonging [TB] and perceived burden [PB]), in serial. \nParticipants and Setting: Participants were 148 young adult men and women (ages 18-35) with SI and/or suicidal behaviors within the past 4 months. Participants were recruited as part of a larger one-year longitudinal study of suicide risk in a transdiagnostic sample of young adults.\nMethods: PROCESS serial mediation procedures were used to test the hypothesis that emotional abuse would be indirectly associated with increased SI intensity at 4-month follow-up through rejection sensitivity and TB or PB, in serial.\nResults: Results indicated that childhood emotional abuse was prospectively associated with elevated SI intensity in adulthood through the indirect effects of rejection sensitivity and PB (std. est. = .04; 95% CI = -0.03, 0.11) but not TB. \nConclusion: Greater emotional abuse in childhood was associated with a greater sensitivity to rejection, which may perpetuate a cycle that increases risk for SI throughout adolescence and adulthood.",

Method: Pre–post study with two groups (n = 26). The psychological intervention group (IG) received a 90-minute session that included psychoeducation, relaxation training and coping skills. The control group (CG) did not receive any psychological intervention. All participants later underwent IVF. In the initial and final evaluations, state anxiety, emotional imbalance, adaptive resources and quality of life were measured. In the initial evaluation, demographic and clinical variables were also measured. Results: In the IG, the final evaluation reflected: (1) decreased levels of anxiety and emotional imbalance; (2) the perception of enhanced quality of life. Moreover, among the participants who received the psychological intervention and later achieved a successful IVF, the level of anxiety appeared to have decreased more strongly. Conclusions: A brief intervention focused on stress management can benefit the psychological adjustment of women who are candidates for IVF, reducing the anxiety they may experience in this regard.

          "authors": "Mercedes Arrebola Moreno; Dafina Petrova; Rocio Garcia-Retamero; Andrés Catena",
          "abstract": "Background: In acute coronary syndrome the time elapsed between the start of symptoms and the moment the patient receives treatment is an important determinant of survival and subsequent recovery. However, many patients do not receive treatment as quickly as recommended, mostly due to substantial prehospital delays such as waiting to seek medical attention after symptoms have started. Objective: To conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of the relationship between nine frequently investigated psychological and cognitive factors and prehospital delay. Design: A protocol was preregistered in PROSPERO [CRD42018094198] and a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Data sources: The following databases were searched for quantitative articles published between 1997 and 2019: Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, Psych Info, PAIS, and Open grey. Review methods: Study risk of bias was assessed with the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational, Cohort, and Cross-Sectional Studies. A best evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the findings of the included studies. Results: Forty-eight articles, reporting on 57 studies from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies used very diverse definitions of prehospital delay and analytical practices, which precluded meta-analysis. The best evidence synthesis indicated that there was evidence that patients who attributed their symptoms to a cardiac event (n = 37), perceived symptoms as serious (n = 24), or felt anxiety in response to symptoms (n = 15) reported shorter prehospital delay, with effect sizes indicating important clinical differences (e.g., 1.5–2 h shorter prehospital delay). In contrast, there was limited evidence for a relationship between prehospital delay and knowledge of symptoms (n = 18), concern for troubling others (n = 18), fear (n = 17), or embarrassment in asking for help (n = 14). Conclusions: The current review shows that symptom attribution to cardiac events and some degree of perceived threat are fundamental to speed up help-seeking. In contrast, social concerns and barriers in seeking medical attention (embarrassment or concern for troubling others) may not be as important as initially thought. The current review also shows that the use of very diverse methodological practices strongly limits the integration of evidence into meaningful recommendations. We conclude that there is urgent need for common guidelines for prehospital delay study design and reporting",

          "authors": "Colin Conwell; Daniel Graham; Chelsea Evanna Boccagno; Edward A. Vessel",
          "abstract": "Looking at the world often involves not just seeing things, but feeling things. Modern feedforward machine vision systems that learn to perceive the world in the absence of active physiology, deliberative thought, or any form of feedback that resembles human affective experience offer tools to demystify relationship between seeing and feeling, and to assess how much of visually-evoked affective experiences may be a straightforward function of representation learning over natural image statistics. In this work, we deploy a diverse sample of 180 state-of-the-art deep neural network models trained only on canonical computer vision tasks to predict human ratings of arousal, valence, and beauty for images from multiple categories (objects, faces, scenescapes, art) across two datasets. Importantly, we use the features of these models without additional learning, linearly decoding human affective responses from network activity in much the same way neuroscientists decode information from neural recordings. Aggregate analysis across our survey demonstrates that predictions from purely perceptual models explain a majority of the explainable variance in average ratings of arousal, valence, and beauty alike.  Finer-grained analysis within our survey (e.g. comparisons between shallower and deeper layers, or between randomly-initialized, category-supervised, and self-supervised models) point to rich, pre-conceptual abstraction (learned from diversity of visual experience) as a key driver of these predictions. Taken together, these results provide further computational evidence for an information-processing account of visually-evoked affect linked directly to efficient representation learning over natural image statistics, and hint at a computational locus of affective and aesthetic valuation immediately proximate to perception.",

In this commentary, we point out that there are scenarios where people can opt to replicate studies with a lower RV compared to those with a higher RV. Methodologically, we highlight that the differences in the RV become very small when comparing studies with different large (e.g., over 500) samples. To adjust for this, we demonstrate that a modification to the RV-equation – by log transforming the sample size – leads to a RV that discriminates between studies with large sample sizes with greater precision.",

However, there has been a growing focus on positive mental health factors in recent times. This study investigated the relationship between distressing life events and positive mental health (PMH), satisfaction with life (SWL), subjective happiness (SH), and depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–21; DASS-21). Design and Methods: The sample included N = 426 students who participated in an online study testing protective and risk factors in the context of mental health and reports secondary analyses of these data. Results: Correlational analyses showed that experiencing a distressing life event was linked to lower levels of PMH and SWL, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Post-hoc group comparisons supported this pattern. Among those who experienced a distressing life event, higher current distress due to the event correlated with lower levels of PMH, SWL, and SH, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusions: This study showed robust correlations between the experience of a distressing life event and levels of both positive and negative mental health. Promoting mental health may thus be an important preventative target in at-risk groups.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Predictors of life satisfaction vary between people and potentially also within people across the life span. However, little is known about when changes in the association between domain satisfaction and overall life satisfaction occur. In the present study, we focused on the last years of work before retirement when it is often assumed that workers become less attached to their workplace and focus on other areas of life instead, such as leisure activity. Our aim was to test if the associations between domain satisfaction (job and leisure) and overall life satisfaction change in the years before retirement. \nMethods. We applied a time-to-retirement metric in a latent growth curve analysis to longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 3,401) to investigate whether the within-person associations between (1) job and overall life satisfaction and (2) leisure and overall life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. \nResults. We found that job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. \nDiscussion. We interpret the results as evidence for a potential pre-retirement work disengagement, either to support post-retirement adjustment, or to protect from negative work experiences. We highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation) or cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism) and sometimes period effects (e.g., the effects of the pandemic years 2020 to 2022 on well-being). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design—it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts—and regardless of the number of observations available—it also applies if we observe the whole population. Researchers rely on statistical models that impose assumptions to pick one specific combination of effects. But these assumptions are often opaque and researchers may be unaware of them, resulting in a lack of scrutiny. Here, I provide a non-technical introduction to a framework which allows researchers to reason about age, period, and cohort effects in a more systematic manner. I summarize advances in our understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem—it only affects the underlying linear effects but not the nonlinearities, making some statements about effects possible based on the data alone—and show how transparent assumptions can be used to put bounds on the effects of interest, following a framework developed by the sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. Lastly, using data from the German General Social Survey, I illustrate this approach by analyzing age, period and cohort effect on people’s agreement with the statement “Given what the future looks like, it is barely responsible to bring children into the world.”",

          "abstract": "Background \nIndividuals with cancer often experience stress throughout the cancer trajectory and have a high risk of experiencing depression.\n\nObjective \nThe aim of this study was to examine the relationship between allostatic load (AL), a measure of cumulative stress-related physiologic dysregulation of different body systems, and symptoms of depression in cancer survivors.\n\nMethods \nParticipants were 294 adult cancer survivors from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2007-2018). Allostatic load was measured using 14 indicators representing cardiometabolic risk, glucose metabolism, cardiopulmonary functioning, parasympathetic functioning, and inflammation. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The relationship between AL and depressive symptoms was investigated using multiple regression adjusted for diverse sociodemographic and diagnosis variables.\n\nResults \nHigher AL was associated with higher depressive symptom scores. The higher risk of depression was concentrated among those survivors in the highest AL quartile, with 21% (95% confidence interval, 11%-32%) of survivors presenting a high risk of depression compared with 8% to 11% of survivors in the lower quartiles. In exploratory analyses, the relationship between AL and depressive symptoms was only significant among survivors with a lower income. In contrast, in survivors in the highest income group, depressive symptoms were lower and unrelated to AL.\n\nConclusion \nHigh AL is associated with more depressive symptoms among cancer survivors.\n\nImplications for Practice \nNurses have an important role in identifying psychological distress in cancer patients and survivors. Further research is needed to investigate the usefulness of AL as a marker in the context of cancer follow-up care and screening for psychological distress.",

We propose that a complex systems perspective to functional ageing can illuminate how outcomes such as quality of life and longevity, and prevention and treatment success emerge from dynamic interactions among these domains, rather than from single causes. We support this view in three ways. First, we explain how key principles of complex systems science – resilience, non-linearity and heterogeneity – apply to functional ageing. Second, we show how established gerontological theories and geriatric models align with these principles. Third, we illustrate the use of novel methodological tools from complex systems science in studying functional ageing.

          "abstract": "Cycling challenges athletes to their physiological and psychological limits, often culminating in task failure: an abrupt reduction in intensity or cessation of effort. While physiological mechanisms such as metabolic acidosis and oxygen supply have been widely studied, less is known about the subjective experience associated with task failure. In this study, a survey of 2,818 licensed cyclists provided novel insights into the subjective dimensions of task failure. Participants reported that physical sensations, especially breathing and muscle pain, were the most prominent cues at the limit of effort. Notably, 60.5% indicated they do not always reach their maximum perceived effort before task failure, suggesting a significant psychological component. Age, experience, and the use of feedback tools like powermeters influenced whether task failure was perceived as voluntary or involuntary. Cyclists in higher age categories more frequently perceived reaching their limits as voluntary, while younger or less experienced athletes reported involuntary task failure. Furthermore, strategies such as self-motivation, focusing on goals, and regulating breathing were commonly employed to sustain performance. Altered time perception during maximum effort was also a notable finding, with most cyclists perceiving time as passing more slowly. These results underline the multifactorial nature of task failure, involving complex interactions between physiological, psychological, and perceptual factors. Understanding these dynamics could inform targeted training approaches, enabling athletes to better manage effort and delay task failure, thereby optimizing performance.",

The strongest association was found with obsessive-compulsive features (r=.26). Genetic factors explained &gt;50% of most these associations. Environmental factors that are not shared by twins (non-shared environment) influenced the associations to different degrees, while the influence of environmental factors that are shared by twins was estimated to be negligible.\nRather than being specifically linked to autism, synaesthesia seems to be associated with a wider range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric features, and especially obsessive-compulsive features. Genetic factors play a predominant role in most of these associations, suggesting that synaesthesia might share part of its genetic causes with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.",

          "authors": "Martina Morea; Michael H. Herzog; Gregory Francis; Mauro Manassi",
          "abstract": "Vision is often understood as a hierarchical, feedforward process, where visual processing proceeds from low-level features to high-level representations, ultimately resulting in a coherent percept. Within just a few tens of milliseconds, the fundamental features of the percept are established. These traditional models are the primary framework for understanding visual crowding, a perceptual phenomenon where the perception of a target is impaired by the presence of flanking elements. In this framework, the early stages of feedforward visual processing are essential for perceiving stimuli under crowding conditions and temporal aspects are not important. In fact, experiments show that stimulus duration affects perception very little with classic crowding displays. Here, we show that for more complex displays, crowding is the outcome of highly dynamic processes. For instance, a 20 ms preview of just the flankers can reduce crowding for displays with the target and the same flankers presented up to 1 second later. This effect occurs only if the flankers have the potential to group during longer stimulus durations. Our findings align with predictions made by the LAMINART model, which employs recurrent segmentation processes unfolding over time to separate objects into distinct representation layers. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of time-consuming grouping processes in spatial and temporal interactions in vision. In contrast to the classic feedforward models of vision, we propose that crowding, and vision in general, is a dynamic process in which multiple potential interpretations of a stimulus are modulated and gated by grouping mechanisms that evolve over time.",

          "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with diverse clinical presentations and neuroanatomical alterations. Despite recent advances, we still lack a working hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One reason might be the heterogeneous neuroanatomy of the patients. Data-driven approaches leveraging structural neuroimaging and machine learning have emerged as transformative tools for unraveling this enigma. Recent studies employing clustering techniques have identified robust neuroanatomical subtypes independent of traditional symptom-based frameworks. These data-driven methods reveal distinct cortical and subcortical patterns, aligning with disease progression variations, cognitive function, and treatment outcomes. Novel trajectory-based models suggest that schizophrenia may originate from distinct neuroanatomical regions and follow divergent paths of progression, emphasizing the importance of understanding these patterns in the context of disease staging. These findings provide a foundation for improving diagnostic precision, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring interventions. However, further validation with longitudinal data and methodological standardization are necessary to translate these insights into clinical practice and develop personalized treatment approaches.",

Importantly, asking participants to roleplay as a leader of a committee protecting future generations (Studies 1-2), and having them partake in a philosophical thought exercise emphasizing reduction of intergenerational harm (Studies 1-3) increased moral concern felt towards future generations. This was noted when moral expansiveness was construed as limitless (Study 1), and zero-sum (Studies 2-3). When moral concern was construed as zero-sum, moral concern attributed to ingroup members was re-allocated to future generations. Spillover effects for present entities were also noted.

          "abstract": "We investigated what factors may foster or hinder physicians’ cancer screening risk literacy–specifically the ability to understand evidence regarding screening effectiveness and make evidence-based recommendations to patients. In an experiment, physicians in training (interns and residents) read statistical information about outcomes from screening for cancer, and had to decide whether to recommend it to a patient. We manipulated the effectiveness of the screening (effective vs. ineffective at reducing mortality) and the demand of the patient to get screened (demand vs. no demand). We assessed participants’ comprehension of the presented evidence and recommendation to the patient, as well as a-priori screening beliefs (e.g., that screening is always a good choice), numeracy, science literacy, knowledge of screening statistics, statistical education, and demographics. Stronger positive a-priori screening beliefs, lower knowledge of screening statistics, and lower numeracy were related to worse comprehension of the evidence. Physicians recommended against the ineffective screening but only if they showed good comprehension of the evidence. Physicians’ recommendations were further based on the perceived benefits from screening but not on perceived harms, nor the patient’s demands. The current study demonstrates that comprehension of cancer screening statistics and the ability to infer the potential benefits for patients are essential for evidence-based recommendations. However, strong beliefs in favor of screening fostered by promotion campaigns may influence how physicians evaluate evidence about specific screenings. Fostering physician numeracy skills could help counteract such biases and provide evidence-based recommendations to patients.",

          "abstract": "Discounting analysis has offered countless insights into behavioral health outcomes and continues to draw transdisciplinary attention as a reliable descriptor of decision-making. This paper highlights an analytical issue that may be underappreciated, namely, that the delay discounting parameter (i.e., k) carries units which are not reported in the vast majority of studies, leading potentially to errors in cross-study or test-retest comparisons. Delay discounting analyses conventionally use nonlinear modeling to arrive at a discounting rate that describes subject-level tolerance of temporal reward constraints. This brief report explores the relation between delay discounting k, delay value (i.e., D), and psychophysical scalar (i.e., s) logically and via data manipulation. We reanalyze three extant delay discounting datasets across a variety of discounting assessment methods using systematically different regression delay values. Results support the notion that k retains the reciprocal of time as a unit, where k is modified as D-1 or D-s, pending model mathematical configuration. Researchers should report units on discounting parameters and take care of this potential confound when selecting an appropriate descriptive model and comparing discounting rates across contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study aims to examine the utility of adding loneliness as a symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD).\nMethods: We used data from the 2018-2019 wave of the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study, involving 1,905 participants aged 14-23. We evaluated the centrality of loneliness within the depressive symptom network. Finally, we used adjusted multiple regression (sociodemographic factors and social isolation) to examine the association of 1) loneliness alongside classical symptoms of MDD and 2) clinical groups (including or excluding loneliness), with a composite of life-threatening events (suicide attempt, self-harm, psychiatric admission, or emergency room visits), poor life-chance events (criminal convictions, substance use, and school dropout), and well-being.\nResults: Loneliness was part of the depressive construct and the most central symptom in the network structure of depressive symptoms. It was independently associated with life-threatening events (OR: 1.754; 95% CI: 1.187, 2.590), life chance impoverishment events (OR: 1.446; 95% CI: 1.065, 1.963), and well-being (B: -2.681; 95% CI: -3.792, -1.569). Lastly, the group with MDD that included loneliness as a symptom had a higher risk for life-threatening events (OR: 3.168; 95% CI: 2.039, 4.976) and had lower scores on well-being (B: -3.474; 95% CI: -5.085, -1.862), compared to those with MDD without loneliness. \nConclusion: Loneliness is a constitutive symptom of depression that serves as an indicator of severity in MDD. The operationalization of loneliness as a clinical criterion of MDD is expected to improve clinical care of young people with depression.",

          "abstract": "Foreknowledge of target features biases attention toward those features even before search begins, indicating proactive activation of the target template. However, whether foreknowledge of distractor features leads to proactive inhibition remains debated, raising questions about whether target and distractor templates operate through similar mechanisms. The current study investigated this by presenting multiple task-irrelevant singleton probes before search display onset, combined with EEG. The probes either matched the color of the target, the distractor or had a neutral color. If a feature-specific template is activated proactively, we expect to see a reliable probe N2pc-modulation: With target template enhancement, probes matching the target color should elicit a more pronounced N2pc than neutral probes, whereas a distractor template inhibition should lead to an opposite pattern. In line with this prediction, results showed that the target-colored probes produced a more pronounced N2pc, with the largest amplitude for the last probe in the sequence, suggesting an increasing template activation from probe 1 to 4. Distractor-colored probes elicited a less pronounced N2pc than neutral probes at the first probe, suggesting an inhibited template activation at the start of the preparation. Both ERP and decoding results time-locked to search display onset showed that foreknowledge of the target color facilitated target selection, reaching its peak after 200 ms. Foreknowledge of the distractor color allowed active distractor inhibition within the first 200 ms and then vanished quickly. Taken together, separate temporal profiles during preparation and search support distinct mechanisms for target selection and distractor rejection in visual search.",

          "authors": "Marianna Muszynska; Ori Ossmy",
          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a technique for studying neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental coordination disorder. Until now, the predominant focus of VR applications in this field has been on developing new assessment and diagnostic tools, aiming to identify NDC symptoms in engaging and ecologically valid digital environments. However, despite these advancements, VR has yet to outperform traditional diagnostic methods and remains underutilized as an assessment tool. This paper advocates for a shift in the use of VR, urging researchers to harness its potential in testing embodied cognitive mechanisms underlying NDCs. That is, leveraging VR's functionality to systematically manipulate sensory and social experiences in real-world simulations and test participants in active, whole-body, daily tasks. This article asks why and how VR should be used in NDC research and points to its unique strengths compared to conventional methodologies.",

While deficits in cognitive functions such as executive function (EF) are well-documented in ADHD, the link between ADHD characteristics and the ability to solve problems via trial and error is more cloudy. We tested 70 adult participants, with ADHD and without, in trial-and-error reasoning problems called ‘Virtual Tools’. Performance metrics included success rates, number of attempts, completion time, and strategy measures. Multivariate analysis revealed distinct patterns of ADHD characteristics that are beneficial for trial and error. Individuals with higher inattention performed better, those with balanced ADHD profiles performed similarly to non-ADHD controls. Profiles with high inattention switched trial-and-error strategies more often, supporting their performance. Findings imply that elevated levels of inattention may enable individuals to avoid becoming trapped in cognitive attractors, where they persist in using a single strategy with only marginal adjustments.",

          "abstract": "Background. Intertemporal impatience has been proposed as a transdiagnostic construct that is shared across mental health problems. We empirically tested this proposal using a novel transdiagnostic research approach that integrates per-category, trans-category, scale-level, and item-level analyses. First, we studied per-category continuous associations between intertemporal impatience and a large variety of mental health variables. Next, we examined which of several latent, trans-category mental health dimensions was associated with impatience, thereby studying which mental health problems may be connected through shared intertemporal impatience. Finally, to deepen our understanding of possible underlying mechanisms, we investigated which specific symptoms were driving these associations. Methods. The study was conducted in a predominantly non-clinical community sample of 899 participants who completed an intertemporal choice task and various mental health questionnaires. Per-category analyses involved bivariate correlations and multiple regressions; trans-category analyses involved exploratory factor analyses to identify transdiagnostic mental health dimensions, and structural-after-measurement models to test for associations between the dimensions and intertemporal impatience. Results. Intertemporal impatience was associated with increased nicotine use, reactive aggression, non-planning impulsivity, motor impulsivity, and dispositional greed. Moreover, impatience was positively associated with a transdiagnostic impulsivity dimension (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low self-control, and motor and non-planning impulsivity). Symptom-level analyses suggested that this association was mainly driven by information and financial impulsivity symptoms. Conclusions. Our results provide support for the role of intertemporal impatience across several externalizing but not internalizing mental health problems. Our research approach offers a detailed and nuanced interpretation of the transdiagnostic role of intertemporal impatience across mental health.",

          "abstract": "Organisations are increasingly implementing extended reality (XR) in education, organisational\ntraining, and sports practice. However, the effectiveness of XR compared to conventional training\nmethods, and the potential improvements that additional sensory information such as haptic\nfeedback may offer are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared XR with non-\nXR training programmes in improving psychomotor skill performance and assessed whether haptic\nfeedback improved programmes' effectiveness. Seven databases were searched on January 11*,\n2024, for randomised controlled trials quantitatively measuring the effectiveness of a psychomotor\nskill after an XR-based training programme. Sensitivity analyses, publication bias and risk of bias\nwere assessed. Due to non-independence of effect sizes, robust variance meta-regression models\nwere run and presented using forest plots. Thirty-five reports were assessed, totalling 1692\nparticipants. Both the post-training and pre-post-training change scores between XR and non-XR\ngroups were assessed. Four robust variance estimation meta-regression models were created by\nsplitting two types of control groups: passive (no training) and active (non-XR training). No\ndifferences were found between XR training and active control groups. There was, however, a\nbenefit of XR training compared with passive controls on post-training, but not change scores.\nAdditionally, one model showed a significant negative effect of haptic feedback on post-training\nscores compared with active controls, with the other models showing non-significant effects.\nEvidence certainty was limited by high heterogeneity, risk of bias, and poor methods reporting.\nOverall, XR-based training offers no significant benefit or detriment for training psychomotor\nskills.",

Analyses focused on 138 participants with moderate/low well-being and no depression or anxiety symptoms at baseline. Results showed that participants in the gratitude intervention group experienced increases in Psychological Well-Being Scale Autonomy, with effects lasting at least 3 months. Additionally, while both groups showed increased mean scores on the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, effects in the control group receded after 3 months but persisted in the gratitude intervention group. These findings suggest that gratitude interventions can have lasting effects on psychological well-being, even in cultural contexts where such interventions are less likely to influence subjective well-being.",

Integral Meditation (IM) is a mindfulness-based program that uniquely combines mindfulness with other meditation techniques to enhance psychophysical health. This study examined the effects of IM on psychological and neurophysiological outcomes.\nMethods: In a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of Integral Meditation (IM) in 50 young adults, who were assigned to either the intervention group (n=22) or an inactive control group (n=28). We tested pre- to post-intervention changes and group differences in a comprehensive set of psychological and neurophysiological variables via linear regression analyses. Specifically, we measured dispositional mindfulness, state and trait anxiety, interoceptive sensibility, and interoceptive accuracy using validated self-report questionnaires and the Heartbeat Tracking Task. These metrics were complemented by individual alpha-band frequency and power, as obtained from resting state electroencephalography.\nResults: Results showed statistically significant increases in the IM group for dispositional mindfulness, interoceptive sensibility, attention regulation and Self-regulation, but no effects were observed for trait and state anxiety, interoceptive accuracy and alpha-band metrics. We further assessed if the intervention’s effect varied dependent on baseline measurement. A statistically significant result was found only for Individual Alpha Peak (IAP) power, indicating that the intervention effect was higher when participants had lower IAP power baseline scores. Partial correlation analyses indicated moderate associations between changes in psychological and neurophysiological variables from pre- to post-training. Follow-up exploratory analyses revealed that the link between IAP at baseline and positive intervention effects were strongest in a left-lateralized electrode cluster.\nConclusion: Overall, these results suggest that IM is associated with both psychological and neurophysiological changes, demonstrating the potential of meditation practices to enhance mindfulness and interoceptive sensibility. Additionally, IM modulates brain alpha activity, with baseline individual alpha power serving as a predictor of intervention efficacy.",

This study aimed to generate a set of summary scores at the block-group level across the United States and validate them using existing area-based measures, demographics, noise estimates, and maps of well-known metropolitan areas. Data included American Community Survey and Environmental Justice Screen data for 288,918 census block-groups collected yearly from 2013 to 2022. Exploratory structural equation modeling with bifactor rotation was used to extract five orthogonal factors. The scores were validated using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), Child Opportunity Index (COI), data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ambient noise data from the U.S. National Parks Service, and color-coded maps of metropolitan areas. The five scores captured urbanicity, socioeconomic prosperity, university influence, retirement appeal, and pollution levels. Validation showed expected relationships between urbanicity and ambient noise; socioeconomic status and ADI, COI, and mother's education; and score levels corresponding to known characteristics of metropolitan areas. These scores provide a significant advancement in the accessibility and usability of large-scale socioenvironmental data.

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

Despite growing evidence that predicted and observed behavior are often not interchangeable, there is limited guidance on using LLMs to obtain valid estimates of causal effects and other parameters. We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a mixed subjects design. This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate–and extend–prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the PPI correlation as a measure of interchangeability and derive the effective sample size for PPI. We also introduce a power analysis to optimally choose between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior. Mixed subjects designs could enhance scientific productivity and reduce inequality in access to costly evidence.",

Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support.

          "abstract": "The comparative analysis of Ecuadorian and Cuban migrants’ recent experiences of return to their respective countries of origin, notably from Spain and other European countries affected by the global financial crisis, highlights significant convergences in the areas of everyday life that become key sources of moral concern and deliberation. Among these are the economic activities and relations that migrants develop upon returning, which are heavily invested by moral reasoning and critique. The economic life of returnees garners much attention among local residents, who focus on it to assess the transformative potential of migration and to appraise migrants’ reincorporation of, and effects on Ecuadorian and Cuban society. In turn, returnees elaborate on how their life in Europe has affected their economic subjectivities, practices, and ideals. Such assessments lead them to reevaluate the place and nature of the ‘economic’ and its relation to ‘culture’ and ‘society’. Looking at how specific moral concerns and deliberations emerge and circulate with migratory trajectories, we argue, is a productive way to uncover their transformative effects and power differentials. By focusing on why and how specific domains of life are morally teased out and charged, we gain new insights on how migratory experiences reshape people’s ways of being, their ideals of a good life, and the contexts and situations in which they become entangled.",

          "abstract": "So-called ‘predatory’ publishing is often framed as an issue of unethical journal practices, but this perspective overlooks deeper structural problems in scholarly communication. The reliance on blacklists as a primary solution to identifying questionable journals fails to acknowledge the complexity of academic publishing and the broader systemic issues that contribute to unethical or controversial publishing practices. These include not only so-called ‘predatory’ journals but also concerns such as ‘special issue-ization’ and the rise of paper mills. Furthermore, the strategies used by emerging open-access mega-publishers increasingly resemble those employed by traditional and hybrid publishers, demonstrating that questionable practices are not confined to a single category of journals. This research in progress critically examines the characteristics of journals labeled as so-called ‘predatory’ and questions the effectiveness of static blacklists in scholarly assessment. Using a dataset of 2,755 journals from Predatory Reports, we systematically analyze their ISSN registration, subject classifications, accessibility, financial models, editorial transparency, and indexing status. While we recognize the limitations of blacklists, this dataset provides a basis for exploring broader patterns in academic publishing. Preliminary findings reveal that 24% of the journals became inaccessible after being listed, suggesting that some publishers shut down or rebrand to evade scrutiny. While ISSN registration is not mandatory, 13% of the journals in the dataset do not have one, which may indicate variations in registration practices. The geographical distribution of these journals is concentrated in India (31.45%), Switzerland (30.17%), and the United States (21.36%). This distribution highlights the global nature of these practices, spanning a range of publication models. The study also finds that 71% of these journals charge Article Processing Charges (APCs), while 23.7% fail to disclose APCs before submission, creating financial uncertainty for authors. Rather than indiscriminately covering all fields, many journals now focus on STEM disciplines. These findings underscore the need for more nuanced, criteria-based evaluation frameworks that account for the complexities of scholarly publishing, moving beyond binary categorizations of journals as ‘predatory’ or legitimate.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that concurrent and sequential self-administered mixed-mode designs both have advantages and disadvantages in terms of panel survey recruitment and maintenance. Since concurrent mixed-mode designs usually achieve higher initial response rates at lower bias than sequential mixed-mode designs, the former may be ideal for panel recruitment. However, concurrent designs producea high share of paper respondents relative to web respondents. Since these paper respondents have been found to be at higher risk of attrition, cause higher data collection costs, and slow down the fieldwork process, sequential mixed-mode designs may be more practical in the regular course of the panel study after recruitment. Our study provides experimental evidence on the effect of switching a panel study from concurrent to sequential mixed-mode design after the panel recruitment. Results show that this switch significantly increases the share of online respondents without harming response rates. Respondents who are pushed to the web by the design change differ significantly from respondents who continue to participate via paper questionnaires with regard to a number of socio-digital inequality correlates. This suggests that, while the share of online respondents can be increased through mode sequencing, keeping the paper mail mode option is vital for ensuring continued representation od societal subgroups.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \n\n This article presents relevant portions transcribed concerning the h index from the podcast of Professor Brian Keating with Professor Jorge Hirsch (the originator of the h index). The conversations in the podcast conclude that the h index is a social phenomenon prone to gamification. The second transcribe is a podcast by physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, pointing out the social inequalities created by citation scams and cartels. This results in a new class of elites' \"citaelites\". This article explains how Pierre Bourdieu's inequalities in social capital fit well in interpreting citation cartels. Citations of publications that estimate the h index have resulted in the gamification of metrics, a social capital tool for acquiring economic capital for faculty entry and funding. The gamification of the h index bolts perfectly to Pierre Bourdieu's cold realities of social inequalities. Either abolish the h index or use an artificial intelligence filter to purge the citation scams and cartels to reveal the validated h index for the righteous to enter or rise in the steep academic hierarchy.",

          "abstract": "Computational text analysis has grown in popularity among social scientists due to the massive influx of digitized data. However, connecting text to authorship could be a boon for digital demography and expand the scope of computational text analysis from trends of what is being written toward social patterning of the people producing it. We explore this potential through examinations of a large corpus of college admissions essays (n = 254,820 essays submitted by 83,538 applicants) and show how personal identity markers and ZIP code-level social context data influence large scale processes of textual production. After generating numerical representations of the essays using computational methods, we model the relationships between different identity and spatial characteristics of applicants and their local communities. We find strong relationships between identity and spatial features with the essays. We also find that individuals whose personal identities are spatially unique--that is, demographically different from others in their immediate content--were most likely to be misclassified, indicating that writing is influenced both socially and spatially. This work clarifies how authorship characteristics shape large scale textual production processes, like college admissions, and complements other large scale analyses of text by focusing on authorship rather than purely textual patterns.",

This paper explores the role of critical thinking in UK police public order training and its potential to enhance police professionalism. It examines professionalism through sociological frameworks, aligning the National Decision Model (NDM) used in police training with academic models such as Burch’s Learning Stages of Competence and Leicester’s Four Habits of Thought. The paper argues that embedding critical thinking within public order training enhances ethical decision making, problem solving, and adaptability, thereby reinforcing professional standards. It also considers the impact of recent changes in police entry routes, including a non degree pathway, on the ongoing professionalisation of the police service. Ultimately, the integration of critical thinking into training is deemed essential for advancing UK policing's professionalisation.",

          "abstract": "The current study addresses political party trust and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principle application in Italian regions. Trust in political parties is a principal driving force in governance performance, compliance with policies, and citizen trust in institution-made choices. With political and economic diversity in its regions, Italian regions present a case study for testing whether political institution trust increased creates increased ESG use and whether ESG policies have an impact in shaping political trust in reciprocity. Empirical evidence confirms that in high political trust regions, ESG programs have a high opportunity for effective implementation, particularly in social welfare and conservation of environment. In contrast, political institution trust weakness is accompanied with poor ESG pledges, an expression of inefficient governance and reduced accountability in companies. ESG policies actually have an impact on political trust—effective and transparent ESG actions establish institution trust, but shallow and political ESG actions produce mistrust. The observations have a function of projecting the contribution towards balancing institution trust with sustainability through governance quality. Policymakers can contribute towards leveraging political stability in driving ESG integration in a manner that keeps such programs effective and credible for long-term development in regions and for democratic legitimacy.",

This article explores how feminist issues have been framed and discussed in the Korean press from 1990 to 2022. We examine news articles that mention feminism (peminijeum), gender equality (seong pyeongdeung), and gender discrimination (seong chabyeol) from 54 national, regional, and online news outlets (n = 49,028) and employ a structural topic modelling to identify 17 major topics and shifts in topic trends over time and across press partisanship. When examining coverage longitudinally, our findings suggest that while feminism has gained increasing attention in the Korean press in the last three decades, the focus of the issues has changed substantially. Feminism is less discussed as issues of employment, family system, and education, but more as issues of party politics and elections, gender-friendly policies, and gender conflicts between men and women. Our results also highlight that liberal and conservative press emphasise different issues in their articles on feminism, focusing on preferable issues for their political readership. Our findings suggest a need for press discourse that can shed light on the neglected intersectional aspects of feminism, including class struggles and LGBTQ rights.",

          "abstract": "Regulators and policy makers around the world have endorsed risk-based approaches for governing the challenges and opportunities from Artificial Intelligence (AI). In theory, these assessments should protect the public from the harmful impacts of AI, thus safeguarding important societal values such as the realization of fundamental rights. However, as an anticipatory decision-making tool, the success and legitimacy of risk-based regulatory approaches depend critically on methods that help policymakers and societal stakeholders anticipate how AI may impact a diverse citizenry, the many different ways in which technological change may unfold, and the factors that lead to desirable and less desirable visions of the future. In this paper, we first point out critical flaws in existing assessment methods and regulatory approaches and consequently identify the need for a shift in current approaches to assessment approaches. We call on scholars, policy makers, and the technology industry to engage in anticipatory approaches that go beyond compliance and checklist exercises and acknowledge the responsibility they have for impacts that go beyond what is known. Second, we propose a concrete alternative empirical approach to address our concerns: Scenario-based Sociotechnical Envisioning (SSE). By using SSE, practitioners can make assessments more inclusive, more aware of the socio-technical context in which AI systems are deployed, and more prospective in terms of identifying impacts before they occur. We encourage scientists, policy makers and legislators to use SSE as one method in their assessment toolbox. Third, we anticipate possible objections to our approach and pro-actively discuss how these can be met.",

Despite growing evidence that predicted and observed behavior are often not interchangeable, there is limited guidance on using LLMs to obtain valid estimates of causal effects and other parameters. We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a mixed subjects design. This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate–and extend–prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the PPI correlation as a measure of interchangeability and derive the effective sample size for PPI. We also introduce a power analysis to optimally choose between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior. Mixed subjects designs could enhance scientific productivity and reduce inequality in access to costly evidence.",

Through a framework combining discourse theory and new materialism, we analyse information-sharing, cross-posting, and discursive formations across political communities. Our findings lead us to conceptualise ‘sedimented polarisation’—a discursive-material condition where polarisation becomes an empty signifier around which political discursive formations take shape. Despite Reddit’s design allowing cross-community engagement, we find minimal interaction between discursively dissonant spaces. While r/politics is often presented as a space for cross-ideological deliberation and exposure, it fails to function as a town square. We observe a fragmentation across political subreddits and discourses beyond the left-right dichotomy. These patterns emerge from an entanglement of platform design, community moderation practices, user agency, discourses, and broader socio-political contexts.",

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

The aim was to foster a shared sense of \"Britishness\" through instilling core values. This initiative has been highly controversial. Yet, no research has systematically assessed its long-term, large-scale impacts. Here we conduct the first such assessment. By analyzing multiple censuses, cross-referencing with high quality survey data, and utilizing three different causal identification methods based on difference-in-differences, we find that overall, the initiative has significantly increased the probability of identifying as British. Yet the effect is heterogeneous. The initiative backfires for Muslims, for whom it reduces identifying as British. We find no effect of the policy on the targeted values.

          "abstract": "German academia has faced a multitude of changes over the last two decades, including new alternative academic pathways to a professorship based on the Anglo-Saxon science system, such as junior or tenure track professorship. Our study investigates the patterns of academic career trajectories to a professorship that have emerged due to these changes. It looks deeper into the relationship between those patterns and determinants of academic success, such as previous career choices, scientific productivity and the chosen scientific field. Using data from the prof*panel (N=660) – a survey of recently appointed full professors in Germany – and sequence-cluster analysis, we find four academic career clusters, three of which are beyond the traditional pathway of Endurance Careers: Efficient Careers, Unconventional Careers and International Careers indicating an institutional change within German academia. Cluster affiliation is mainly related to time-to-tenure, habilitation (second thesis), working abroad and the field of the professorship. Our findings suggest that traditional career paths still play a major role, although the influence of internationalization and novel academic career steps, like junior and tenure-track positions, is growing. Furthermore, less conventional career paths, attract a higher proportion of women and are characterized by international mobility and more diverse professional experiences. The insights of our study underscore the ongoing changes in the landscape of academic careers and highlight both persistent challenges and new opportunities for aspiring professors.",

Revisiting the Polanyi-Schumpeter theoretical framework, entrepreneurship embedded in social relations interlinked by trust is a dynamo of sustainable socioeconomic progress. The institutionalised trust, however, was not clarified. With micro-individual data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2011–2021, our research employs the instrumental variable approach rooted in historical rice farming to tackle endogeneity. The results demonstrate that social trust elevates entrepreneurial engagement by 32.65 and 10.37 percentage points in self-employment and business incorporation, respectively. Increased trust paradoxically hampers self-employment in the central due to insular networks and structural disparities. The findings uncover the nuanced role of social trust in facilitating and constraining entrepreneurship with contextually regional determinants. The research contributes to knowledge and evidence of institutional endowments that mediate entrepreneurial agency and argues for synchronising formal and informal institutions in development.",

          "authors": "Marianne Hem Eriksen; Brian Costello",
          "abstract": "The drunk and frenzied Viking is a trope in line with associated stereotypes of blood-thirsty warriors and senseless violence. However, enough evidence remains to suggest that intoxication due to alcohol, and perhaps other psychoactive substances, was integral to many aspects of life in the Late Iron/Viking Ages. After all, apparently there is no other word for ‘sober’ in Old Norse than ódrukkin — ‘un-drunk’. Viking bodies were, in many ways, bodies of intoxication. One of the aspects of life that alcohol permeates is ritual practice.\n\nTo the extent that this has been studied, the use of alcohol conventionally links to ideas of frenzied warriors and berserkers, or with feasting. Some research over the last few decades has related intoxicants to ritual practices, specifically that of the völva — the female ritual specialist (e.g. Price 2019). More broadly Germanic work has centered élite drinking culture and the role of the ‘lady with the mead-cup’ (Enright 1996) and the female leader of the household as a powerbroker, mediating power relationships within the warrior-band through pouring of alcohol. What Iron and Viking age studies have not contemplated in much detail so far, is the fundamentally material and embodied process of making and ingesting alcohol or other psychoactives by taking them into and incorporating them with the body, generating specific embodied reactions in specific settings. Drawing on seminal work in anthropology and philosophy, this paper centers alcohol as a form of material culture, providing tangible sets of sensory experiences, but ultimately destined to be destroyed through the process of ingestion.",

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer; Felix Bader; Ingmar Ehler; Henning Best",
          "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighbourhoods as immigrants -- the relevant counterfactual -- they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

          "abstract": "The Sulu Archipelago, nestled between Mindanao and Borneo, has been a melting pot of people and cultures for thousands of years. Major sociopolitical changes marked its history, attracting groups of people or forcing drastic dispersals. Today, the islands host various ethnolinguistic groups, including Sama-Badjaw and Tausug-speaking communities. We surveyed the literature from multiple disciplines—linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, history, and genetics—to shed light on past movements and the emergence of ethnicities in the region. Three factors drive ethnogenesis in the Sulu Archipelago: niche or economic specialisation, social hierarchies, and assimilation. Economic specialisation initially fostered differentiation among groups inhabiting reef and island ecosystems. The most extreme adaptive strategy was boat-nomadism, whose origin was tied to the evolving sociopolitical order. With the rise of the Sultanate of Sulu, differences in rank and religion were articulated along ethnic lines. The Tausug assumed formal dominance over the surrounding populace, whereas the Sama Dilaut were relegated to society’s periphery. The mid-eighteenth century saw the integration of Sulu within the global trading network which created a labour-driven economy focused on procuring local products. During this period, the Sama Bangingi emerged as specialised maritime raiders who incorporated captive peoples from parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Following the end of foreign imperial control, the peoples of Sulu found themselves subsumed within the modern Philippine state. Social change continues as the Sama Dilaut integrate into the broader Sama milieu, and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago into Filipino society.",

          "abstract": "Studying gender presents unique challenges to data science. Recent work in the spirit of computational social science returns to critical approach to operationalisation providing a fresh perspective on this important topic. In this chapter we highlight works that examines gender computationally, describing how they employ levels of feminist theory to challenge gender inequality at the micro, meso, and macro level. We argue that paying critical attention to how we infer and analyze gender is fruitfully in understanding society and the contributions of research. We also present various sources and methods to infer gender and provide examples of the application of such methods. We conclude by outlining the way forward for computational methods in how gender and intersectional inequality is studied.This is a draft.

          "abstract": "Traditional perspectives on occupational structure often emphasize hierarchical and socio-economic dimensions, typically reducing it to a one-dimensional framework. As noted in much previous research, this simplification may overlook the complexity of critical social issues. We argue that occupational structure is inherently continuous and multidimensional. Building on previous research, we anticipate that it is governed by at least two primary dimensions closely linked to socio-economic status and gender. \n\nOur study analyzes 10,219,276 connections among 95 occupations recorded in the Swedish occupational registry from 2001 to 2013. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS), we explore the patterns of individual mobility to better capture the core features of occupational structure. Our findings challenge the adequacy of simplified models and suggest a more efficient alternative to detailed contemporary approaches like the micro class model and the multiple scales derived from occupational dictionaries.\n\nThe analysis reveals a three-dimensional model of occupational structure, distinguishing three status orders and providing deeper insights into the varied contributions of different occupations. We find that one dimension strongly correlates with socio-economic status, while the connection to gender division is weaker.",

          "abstract": "We use cultural evolutionary models to examine how individual experiences and culturally-inherited information jointly shape risk attitudes under environmental uncertainty. We find that learning processes not only generate plausible variation in risk attitudes, but also that conservative learning strategies---emphasizing the preservation of generational knowledge---excel in high-risk environments, promoting stable wealth accumulation and long-term survival but limiting asset growth as conditions improve. In contrast, exploratory learning strategies---leveraging risk-free juvenile exploration and peer influence---foster risk-tolerant attitudes that thrive in affluent, low-risk settings where wealth buffers and social safety nets reduce the costs of miscalculations. Introducing economic stratification to the model reveals how wealth disparities and inter-class interactions reinforce these patterns, exacerbating differences in learning strategies and risk-taking behaviors, and perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities through the cultural inertia of excessive risk aversion. By uniting developmental, social, and evolutionary perspectives, our framework provides a novel lens on the cultural evolution of risk attitudes and their broader societal implications.",

          "abstract": "This review commemorates the thirtieth anniversary of Minstrels of Soul: Intermodal Expressive Therapy (Knill et al., 1995), a central text in the expressive arts therapy field. Drawing on Paolo J. Knill’s interdisciplinary background in musicology, psychology, and systems theory, the authors propose a model of “intermodal decentering” that integrates multiple art forms—visual art, music, dance, poetry, and drama—into therapeutic practice. Emphasizing “aesthetic responsibility,” the book addresses ethical considerations and underscores the relational power of artistic processes to foster meaningful change. While grounded in the 1990s, its foundational principles resonate with current realities of political polarization, global conflict, and collective trauma, illustrating the continued relevance of an embodied, creative framework. Future directions include deeper cultural adaptation and exploration of digital modalities, yet Minstrels of Soul remains an enduring cornerstone for professionals seeking holistic, arts-based approaches to individual and communal healing.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To examine differences in time use for primary childcare between non-cohabiting and cohabiting mothers and fathers in Germany between 1991/92 and 2022.\nBackground: Facing the task of balancing paid and unpaid work on their own, non-cohabiting parents face different demands and time binds in allocating time for childcare compared to cohabiting parents. Current evidence how this translates into different patterns of time use for childcare is mixed and nonexistent for Germany.\nMethods: We applied OLS regression to estimate non-cohabiting (n=968) and cohabiting (4,486) mothers’ and fathers’ (n=76 and n=4,416, respectively) time use for primary childcare using time diary data of the four surveys of the German Time Use Study from 1991/1992, 2001/2002, 2012/2013, and 2022 (n=10,202 diaries for mothers, and n=8,388 diaries for fathers).\nResults: Non-cohabiting mothers spent more time on primary childcare than cohabiting mothers in 1991/1992, but this negative gradient virtually disappeared and was basically nonexistent since 2001/2002. Non-cohabiting fathers spent more time doing primary childcare than cohabiting fathers, although this finding rested on very small case numbers.\nConclusion: Non-cohabiting mothers did not seem to reduce their time for childcare when compared to cohabiting mothers, whereas non-cohabiting fathers seemed to meet the need of more childcare, compared to cohabiting fathers.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach to decomposing population change by identifying the separate contributions of fertility, mortality, net migration, and initial age structure using stable population theory. Its strength lies in the additivity of the results: the contributions of these factors, along with the interaction effect, sum to equal the total population change. In addition, identifying the direct impact of initial age structure on population change offers new insights into the drivers of population dynamics. Central and Eastern Europe was one of the regions hit most by population decline between 1990 and 2020; however, it was marked by significant variation across countries. By decomposing population change, we found that the positive impact of the relatively young initial age structure in the CEE region was as large as the population-reducing effect of negative net migration, while the positive impact of mortality improvement offset one-third of the population-reducing effect of low fertility. On the other hand, the initial age structure had a crucial role in explaining differences in country-level population change during the study period.",

Drawing on previous research and incorporating direct input from practicing teachers, we crafted items that underwent multiple rounds of pilot testing. Psychometric analyses demonstrated strong reliability and validity across diverse samples, highlighting the utility of these scales in identifying specific areas of strength and need within school contexts.

          "abstract": "Anticipating the impacts of new technology in society is at the crux of efforts to understand, advance, and govern its safety. However, doing so is fundamentally difficult. The evolution of various technical, social, policy conditions can modulate the direction of sociotechnical development in uncertain ways. But with prospections of the future come opportunities for agency, control, and forward-looking responsibility that are crucial to orienting stakeholders towards opportunities to steer the technology and be well-prepared to observe, measure, and ultimately evaluate its impact. Written scenarios can support such prospection and effectively serve as orienting devices in supporting strategic decision-making. The goal of scenario writing is not future prediction per se, but rather in helping to perceive potential future outcomes that can then inform what actions can be taken now to steer towards desirable futures.  The breadth and richness of scenarios is enhanced when many diverse perspectives and sets of expertise and experience are brought into the process.  Building on these ideas, in this guidebook we elaborate a method, which we term Scenario-Based Sociotechnical Envisioning (SSE), as we have applied it to study and anticipate the impacts of new AI technologies in society.",

          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how the pharmaceutical sector has become one of the largest and most influential economic sectors of our time. It presents figures and information that support this claim and aims to elucidate the factors that contributed to such a rise. Since Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928, pharmaceutical industries have evolved from small entities - often family-owned and operating locally - to multinational corporations valued at hundreds of billions of dollars with global influence. However, beyond the discovery and diversification of drugs, increased demand, and expansion of production capacity, part of this evolution is underpinned by complex, and in some cases perverse, strategies prioritizing profit maximization over public and individual health. The findings of this study reveal that, over the past two decades, the sector's revenues have quadrupled, reaching 1.48 trillion dollars in 2022, an amount comparable to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developed countries such as Spain. The twenty largest companies in the sector have a combined market value of 3.5 trillion dollars and assets totaling 1.86 trillion, generating annual revenues of 820 billion and profits of 181.6 billion. For context, the assets of these companies alone are comparable to the GDP of all Sub-Saharan African countries. Companies, like Johnson &amp; Johnson, have a market value exceeding the GDP of 184 nations. The study also examines and discusses questionable practices adopted by the pharmaceutical industry, including investing billions in lobbying and election financing, influencing regulatory agencies, financially supporting patient organizations, sponsoring authors of \"Clinical Guidelines\", manipulating and concealing drug research and tests, and directing massive investments to strengthen ties with prescribers, university hospitals, and academic institutions. Concrete examples of these actions are provided, backed by studies, data surveys, and court decisions, underscoring the alarming consequences of this reality. Lastly, the research analyzes pharmaceutical marketing as a primary sales boost strategy. Despite drugs not being ordinary commodities, susceptible to promotion under the lens of rampant consumption, companies invest billions annually in direct-to-consumer advertising. In the Brazilian context, the pharmaceutical sector stands out as one of the main investors in marketing. In recent years, several companies in the field have ranked among the highest individual advertising spenders. The emergence of digital marketing strategies driven by the internet, advanced algorithms, and social networks, combined with advertising campaigns harmful to public and collective health, underscore a concerning and challenging scenario.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the pedagogical impact of incorporating improvisation practices into the curriculum of Classical piano students in higher education. Drawing from Bourdieu’s social reproduction theory and the concept of habitus, the research investigates how intentional disruptions to students' ingrained Classical training can foster identity development, adaptability, and career readiness. The findings are based on a case study conducted at a Finnish music university, where three Classical piano students participated in weekly free accompaniment (FA) lessons focusing on improvisation with non-Classical repertoire as learning materials. The study highlights the challenges students faced when transitioning from their traditional emphasis on technical\nmastery to a more flexible approach centered on exploration. Physical habits and dispositions that were deeply rooted in their Classical training served as both barriers and opportunities for growth. Over time, the students embraced improvisation to redefine learning, transitioning from a narrow focus on technical perfection to valuing adaptability. These findings reveal broader implications for higher education, particularly in preparing students for professional environments that demand flexibility and interdisciplinary expertise. The FA lessons facilitated a development in the students’ musical identity as pianists, enabling them to navigate the tension between their Classical foundations and the evolving demands of a competitive society. The study underscores the importance of integrating adaptive learning practices across disciplines to equip students with the soft skills necessary to thrive in an ever-changing professional landscape.",

This paper explores how unregulated AI might reshape warfare, drive geopolitical rivalries, and enable misuse by state and non-state actors alike. Through an analysis of potential conflicts, power struggles, and ethical pitfalls, this study examines scenarios in which AI-driven militaries clash, states weaponize data for strategic advantage, and corporate entities develop autonomous systems for profit without regard for societal well-being. The findings reveal a dangerous trajectory where AI could fuel human rights abuses, escalate conflicts, and create a world order defined by unchecked surveillance and algorithmic manipulation. Ultimately, the paper underscores the urgent need for international cooperation and regulation to avoid the dystopian outcomes that could arise from an AI-driven world lacking ethical standards.",

Using a choice experiment of hypothetical BNG projects in the context of\nhousing development we examine the trade-offs between the features of the BNG\nproject: distance from home; biodiversity level (species richness); off-site vs on-site\nbiodiversity provision; public access to the offset site; and a non-biodiversity feature (%\naffordable housing). We found that public access and species richness were\nproportionally more important than proximity and the % of affordable housing. These\npreferences were of course heterogeneous and determined by sociopsychological\nvariables, e.g., captured in the notions of \"attachment to place\", connectedness to\nnature, socio-economic variables and rural versus urban location. The preferences\nexpressed identify a range of BNG approaches that respect peoples' preferences and\ntrade-offs, noting that acceptance of BNG depends to a great degree on outcomes that\nare either not an explicit priority (i.e., species richness) or are disincentivised (i.e.,\npublic access) by current BNG policy.",

          "authors": "Anthony Bald",
          "abstract": "This paper studies the origins of nursing as a professional occupation. In the early 20th\ncentury, hospitals founded training schools for nurses to meet the growing demand for\nmedical care. Training schools increased overall nurse supply and soon became the\nprimary pathway for young women to receive a professional nursing credential. I\nestimate how the availability of nurse training affected labor market outcomes. Using\nlinked census records and training school openings as a source of variation, I show that\nwhite women who were geographically close to an opening in adolescence were more\nlikely to become trained nurses. Effects are largest for women from well-off families, as\nproxied using father's occupation. Availability of nurse training caused women to\nsubstitute away from other occupations and had little effect on labor force participation\nor occupation-based measures of income. Furthermore, by their thirties, women who\nwere geographically close to an opening were less likely to become physicians. These\nresults paint a mixed picture: Nurse training provided new opportunities for women in\nthe workforce, reinforcing existing gender segregation in medicine. Over the course of\nthe 20th century, nursing would grow to become the largest majority-female occupation\nin the United States.",

          "authors": "Janosch Pfeffer; Milena Weber; Jens Newig; Hannah Einhauser; Johanna Hauke; Kira Hoffmann; Florian Weckbecker; Marlene Wellhausen",
          "abstract": "Participation processes (PPs) are often promoted as tools to improve public policymaking, yet their causal impact on policy decisions remains inconsistent. Existing research on policy impact has faced criticism for lacking methodological rigor, transparency, and comparability, impeding knowledge cumulation. This paper addresses these gaps by providing methodological guidance for assessing the causal impact of PPs on collective decisions in public policy and administration. Drawing on established theories of causality and (Bayesian) process tracing, we introduce a counterfactual approach that asks whether a decision would have occurred without the PP. We outline fundamental principles and practical steps for delineating, and operationalizing key concepts, assessing the strength of evidence, and addressing uncertainties. An exemplary application to the Berlin Climate Citizens’ Assembly reveals that only a small share of its proposals influenced policy decisions. The few impactful proposals support theories that deliberative mini-publics can drive policy change by encouraging policymakers, enriching policies, and breaking deadlocks. However, many proposals had no impact due to overlapping with existing or planned policies, exposing inefficiencies in mini-public design. Involving policymakers in mini-publics might enhance their impact on policy decisions but could compromise their independence.",

          "authors": "Małgorzata Kossowska; Marcelino Cabrera Giraldez; Roberto Frega; Darian Meacham; Nebojsa Petrovic",
          "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of solidarity has come to the forefront of European policy discussion and rhetoric. This report aims at providing a definitional framework for this value by drawing upon the domains of philosophy, political science and psychology, examining solidarity practices, including EU responses to major current crises in the EU. This report also provides options on how solidarity can be fostered through educational policies and practices. Among other aspects of the complexity surrounding solidarity, this report discusses the levels, longitudinal variation, and relevance as a political desideratum in democratic societies. This report also examines how solidarity relates to other sociological and psychological concepts, such as social identity, altruism, and social norms. Findings indicate the need to look at intergenerational solidarity and the salience of solidarity in discussions concerning the welfare state, the economy, migration, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, to cite some current concerns that are high on public and political agendas. In education, we find that instilling the value of European solidarity, among other common values, is key for the European integration project. We therefore recommend pursuing policies to foster solidarity at all levels and, with particular reference to Education in particular, to include solidarity education in school curricula in support of the promotion of European values.",
