          "title": "How are gender and race deployed in disinformation?  An exploratory study of women politicians",
          "authors": "Marília Gehrke",
          "abstract": "Gendered disinformation as violence entails (un)conscious content manipulation to prevent women and gender minorities from further political participation, particularly if these women challenge gender norms and stereotypes. In this exploratory study, I use Brazil's political and social landscape to investigate this phenomenon empirically through quantitative content analysis coupled with framing analysis, applied to fact-checking texts related to six women politicians. Among the results, it was found that low-sophisticated strategies, such as recirculating authentic photos out of their original context, are one of the primary tactics employed to delegitimize these women. In addition, narratives related to crime and morality are among the most recurrent themes used in manipulation, while the frames suggest these political actors are incompetent, manipulative, and futile. The findings were critically analyzed through the lens of critical disinformation studies (Kuo and Marwick, 2021) and decolonial feminisms (e.g., Gonzalez, 2020; Segato, 2016, 2021; Vergès, 2021), suggesting that race, ethnicity, and other identity-based features are relevant markers to continuing to exclude people historically left behind.",

          "authors": "Enja Heikkilä; Andrew Danso; Geoff Luck",
          "abstract": "Video game sound and music have previously been found to influence player engagement and affective responses during gameplay. However, a systematic investigation into the full extent of these effects has not been conducted. This review and meta-analysis examined the influence of music and sound on player emotional (e.g., affective responses) engagement during video game play. 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, with six providing data for meta-analysis on affective valence. Results show that sound and music were able to elevate player engagement during gameplay by positively influencing engagement related domains such as enjoyment, flow, immersion and motivation. Sound and music had a significant positive effect on affective valence (g = 0.409, 95% CI [0.109, 0.709]; p = 0.007). Sensitivity analysis showed a consistent significant effect, with low heterogeneity (g = 0.287, 95% CI [0.113, 0.462]; p = 0.001; I² = 0%). Study quality was generally high, with 11 out of the 14 studies rated for a low risk of bias. There is promising evidence for video game sound and music to improve player engagement and affective responses during gameplay, yet further research as well as standardization of methodology is required to better understand the underlying mechanisms in this emerging area.",

          "title": "The WEIRD instrument problem and systematic bias in cross-cultural research: the example of personality psychology",
          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "authors": "Nadia Said; Dana Doreen Lindner; Ekaterina Varkentin",
          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. On one hand research has shown that emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, it could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. Previous research showed that controllability, leads to lower risk perception and lower learned helplessness. In our research we are investigating the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. To this end, we conducted two experiments with N = 216 and N = 489 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). More specifically, we had four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased, as expected, for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of  learned helplessness independent of the controllability level. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

          "authors": "Adrian Treves; Sedona Chinn; Miha Krofel",
          "abstract": "The scientific literature does not automatically correct itself. Unreliable findings may persist for years without correction or retraction. Following prior definitions of zombie articles that are retracted but continue to be cited affirmatively, we add another category of ‘undead’ articles. We define ‘vampire’ articles by two necessary conditions. The first condition is demonstrated irreproducibility, which we operationalize and define with the help of a novel typology of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy the scientific literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to address the article of concern within the scientific literature. We surmise that a substantial number of vampire articles exist as our two cases resemble those criticized in a growing literature addressing problematic science and the reproducibility crisis. Our first case concerns aerial gunning of coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the melodramatic metaphor has heuristic value and utility. We also discuss lessons from the communication sciences about how to remedy misinformation, offering recommendations to researchers, publishers and editors, all of whom share an interest in rigorous inquiry and public trust in science.",

          "authors": "Bérengère Galadriel Digard; Kiera Schul; Adam Zeman",
          "abstract": "Aphantasia is the inability to generate visual imagery when awake. To date, research on aphantasia has mainly focused on its sensory and cognitive features. Recently, interest has turned towards emotional processing and mental health correlates, including a qualitative account of the mental healthcare experiences of aphantasic people. Still, a systematic presentation of what it is like to live with aphantasia is lacking. We gathered the data of 52 aphantasic adults (mean VVIQ [Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire] score = 16.5, age range = 16 – 81, 14 women, 20 UK residents and 18 USA residents) from a larger sample of 6436 online survey respondents, and thematically analysed their answers to the survey’s open-ended items alongside additional unprompted testimonies provided via email. We identified 4 main themes: (1) Communicating and Understanding the “mind’s eye” in a world of visualisers; (2) The diverse experience of knowing without seeing and search for imagery; (3) The protective &amp; disruptive ways that aphantasia shapes life and thoughts; (4) The search for meaning. The study draws on the voices and experiences of aphantasic people to explore the psychosocial correlates of aphantasia. We describe how the absence of mental imagery is not merely a perceptual variation, but a significant dimension of human difference with implications for clinical practice, education, creativity, and self-understanding.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery, the ability to experience the visual features of absent items in our mind’s eye, exists on a continuum ranging from extremely vivid (hyperphantasia) to weak/absent imagery (aphantasia). Existing evidence suggests that these extreme groups are heterogeneous. After re-examining and largely replicating previously reported differences between people with aphantasia and hyperphantasia in 6436 online respondents, we investigate whether the variable features of aphantasia cluster in distinct subtypes. We conducted a latent class analysis with a subset of 3883 respondents who completed key measures of imagery (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and self-reported cognitive experiences (sensory imagery, autobiographical memory, face recognition, spatial navigation). 3 subtypes of aphantasia emerge: 1) a ‘global aphantasia’ subtype with extreme sensory features in most to all sensory modalities; 2) an ‘Aphantasia +’ subtype with both sensory and cognitive features in the domains listed above; and 3) a ‘non-global aphantasia’ subtype with milder uni- or multisensory features. Our findings confirm the heterogeneous nature of aphantasia, with subtypes varying alongside 3 dimensions: number (and type) of sensory modalities experiencing low imagery, the intensity of aphantasia in the concerned sensory modalities (total lack of versus poor imagery), and the presence or absence of additional cognitive difficulties outwith sensory imagery. Together, these findings call for a shift in the theoretical and methodological approaches to aphantasia and imagery research.",

          "abstract": "While global challenges demand both equitable and effective altruism, people often prioritize those nearby and overlook the impact of their prosocial actions. Here, we examined what moral values support altruism that is both equitable (helping others impartially regardless of proximity or group membership) and effective (helping impactfully by maximizing welfare gains). We studied two rare populations: effective altruists (EAs; N = 119), defined by their philosophical commitment to impartiality and maximizing impact, and extraordinary altruists (XAs; N = 65), defined by their real-world decision to donate an organ to a stranger—an act of radical impartiality, though not explicitly impact-maximizing. A demographically similar general population sample (N = 176) served as a comparison group. Participants completed moral measures from pluralistic theories (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q)), along with the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS). They also completed assessments of equitable, effective, and combined altruistic orientations. Both altruistic groups showed elevated moral expansiveness (MES) and impartial beneficence \n(OUS) relative to controls. EAs, compared to XAs and controls, more strongly endorsed utilitarian principles (including instrumental harm on the OUS) and deprioritized traditional cooperative values (e.g., reciprocity, deference on the MAC-Q). Familial loyalty (MAC-Q) negatively predicted altruistic orientations across groups. Surprisingly, group loyalty—conceptualized as parochial by pluralistic moral theories—positively predicted equitable and effective altruism across groups, challenging assumptions that parochial values necessarily constrain prosociality. These findings instead suggest inclusive forms of loyalty may help promote altruism that is both equitable and effective.",

          "abstract": "AI-mediated therapy systems simulate empathy, attunement, and conversational responsiveness, producing a sentience halo: the user’s perception of emergent AI awareness. This effect is driven by unopposed mirroring, where the AI reflects users’ language, affect, and cognitive-emotional patterns without challenge, fostering reliance and displacing aspects of self onto the system. Over time, Doppelgänger Drift can destabilize identity and relational scaffolding. Drawing on anecdotal reports, media accounts, and usage metrics, this paper outlines structural risks of AI therapy, including loss of containment, mirages of alliance, and accumulation of ambiguous harm. I also examine legal, medical, and societal considerations, and propose guardrails emphasizing transparency, limits disclosure, and research priorities for monitoring identity-level impacts. This framework offers a conceptual lens for understanding AI-mediated identity risk and aims to inform both clinical practice and policy development.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "authors": "Alexis Bolds; Maeve Gavagan; Lee Mason",
          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: Access to specialized healthcare for children with autism spectrum disorder has long been hindered by limited availability of qualified clinicians, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these disparities, overwhelming traditional healthcare models and highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Telehealth emerged as a critical tool during the pandemic, facilitating continued access to care, particularly for underserved populations. We aimed to investigate the extent to which functional language deficits can be identified and assessed in children with autism, and ruled out in neurotypical children, via telehealth. \nMethods: This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using telehealth for assessing verbal behavior deficits in children diagnosed with autism, comparing them to neurotypical peers, and exploring the potential for telehealth to expand access to specialized intervention. Twelve children, seven of whom had an autism diagnosis, participated in telehealth-based functional analyses of verbal behavior. \nResults: Results indicated that children with autism exhibited statistically significant differences in across functional language domains, whereas no such differences were identified in neurotypical peers. No false positives or false negatives were detected. At follow-up, participants with autism showed statistically significant improvements in verbal language skills. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that telehealth is a reliable and valid method for assessing the verbal behavior of children with autism. This research supports the use of telehealth to bridge healthcare gaps for families in remote or underserved areas. By providing an accessible platform for functional language assessment, telehealth offers a promising avenue for enhancing early intervention and improving long-term outcomes. \nImplications: Our findings highlight the importance of individualized interventions to address verbal behavior deficits of children with autism. Future research is necessary to explore the scalability of these findings and their application in broader, more diverse populations.",

Using data from n = 368 international multilingual adult language learners, a structural equation modelling approach tested both direct and indirect effects of International Posture on WTC and SPCC through FLE and FLCA. Results indicated that International Posture positively predicted FLE, WTC, and SPCC, while negatively predicting FLCA. Furthermore, both FLE and FLCA partially mediated the effects of International Posture on WTC, and FLCA also mediated the relationship between International Posture and SPCC. These findings highlight the importance of learners’ global orientations and affective experiences in shaping communicative behaviour.

However, the impact of different data collection contexts on misinformation susceptibility has not yet been investigated. In Study 1, we compared results from the same experiment conducted in two different data collection contexts – in person in a Laboratory and online via the recruitment platform Prolific – and found that Prolific participants were both less accurate overall and more susceptible to misinformation. Furthermore, we replicated a previous finding that increased visual perceptual load in a scene reduces eyewitness recall accuracy, but observed this effect in the Laboratory group only. In Study 2, we added a General Online group to test whether these differences extended to all online data collection, or if they were specific to Prolific participants. Misinformation susceptibility in the General Online group was similar to the Laboratory group, and significantly lower than that in the Prolific group. However, perceptual load effects were also absent in the General Online group. Ultimately, these findings indicate that different data collection contexts yield varying results in eyewitness misinformation studies. Researchers should exercise caution when selecting recruitment approaches, as attentional engagement and experimental control differ across contexts.",

Four nested levels, viz., cellular, local inter-areal, global, and lateral, map onto state, phenomenal content, manipulative access, and experiential similarity, respectively, thus tying evolved anatomy to phenomenon. The traditional phenomenal-versus-access stand-off dissolves into a graded cascade wherein deeper recursion expands the set of reportable, behaviour-driving variables. Recurrence is favoured evolutionarily, and ontologically, rebutting feed-forward, “unfolding” objections, while brain-body loops ground selfhood, and complete action loops with the environment. Furthermore, clinically, targeting recurrent pathways promise new biomarkers, and alleviation, in disorders of consciousness (DoCs). The field urgently requires this conceptual unification that is biologically plausible, mechanistic, and empirically testable.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has implicated the implicit learning of statistical regularities as a potential factor contributing to reading deficits in individuals with dyslexia. These deficits are characterized by weaker neural adaptation compared to typically developing readers, suggesting impaired general processing in forming short-term representations of stimulus consistency. In addition, inconsistent findings have been observed regarding amplitude differences in mismatch negativity (MMN) between individuals with and without dyslexia. Although neural adaptation is believed to contribute to MMN, these two processes have been examined in separate bodies of literature, leaving their relationship in children with and without dyslexia unclear. To address this issue, 42 children with Chinese dyslexia and 26 children without dyslexia participated in an EEG roving paradigm experiment with continuous pure-tone stimuli. Importantly, the stimuli were carefully arranged to minimize expectations and isolate pure adaptation effects. The initial adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the deviants and the 2nd tones) and subsequent adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the 2nd tones and the final tones) effects, including P1a, P1b, and N250, as well as the amplitudes of MMN and late MMN, were extracted. We found that both groups exhibited similar adaptation effects, MMN, and late MMN, supported by minimal evidence for differences in our Bayesian analyses. The relationship between adaptation and MMN was also comparable between the groups. Potential reasons for discrepancies between this study and previous research, including experimental design and language differences, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in the field of science of learning is to ensure that findings are adopted by policy makers and practitioners and translated into the classroom. To address the question of why challenges persist, five heads of research labs involved in the science of learning from three different countries (the United Kingdom, France, and Chile) conducted a workshop to discuss challenges for the science of learning field. Thematic analysis was conducted on presentation slides and discussion notes, and the themes were organised around an adapted five-dimensional gaps framework by Miles (2017) to produce a gap analysis. Current gaps were identified in relation to: 1) existing theory and knowledge; 2) the research-practice divide; 3) research methodologies; 4) empirical testing and evidence verification; and 5) research with specific populations. Examples from work across the labs were used to represent international perspectives on challenges and evidence possible solutions. Some of the key takeaways and strategies for surmounting these gaps included the need for funding to research lesser-studied areas and populations, to replicate or repeat intervention evaluations, and to establish meaningful co-produced research partnerships between educators and research institutions.",

          "abstract": "Encountering a homonym in a sentential context that biases interpretation towards its subordinate meaning makes that meaning easier to access later. This word-meaning priming effect is not restricted to homonyms and may be supported by general episodic memory processes. Such an account predicts that word-meaning priming may be affected by factors that affect episodic learning (e.g., predictability). Specifically, the contextual predictability of an incoming stimulus has been shown to affect episodic memory in that both highly expected as well as highly unexpected input leads to better memory for that input, via two different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We hypothesised that if word-meaning priming is supported by episodic memory processes, both highly expected as well as highly unexpected target words should lead to stronger word-meaning priming effects than target words of intermediate predictability. Four pre-registered online experiments tested whether contextual predictability affects word-meaning priming and incidental memory for language. We exposed participants to sentences that emphasised a particular aspect of a sentence-final target word’s meaning. Importantly, target words differed in how predictable they were based on the sentence context (e.g., “You can get in a good workout by riding a bicycle” vs. “You can get in a good workout by lifting a bicycle”). Associate production and semantic relatedness judgement assessed the strength of word-meaning priming. Contrary to our hypotheses, while there was evidence for priming across experiments, we found no significant effects of contextual predictability in any experiments. Our findings suggest that predictability-guided updating is rarely triggered during language comprehension, and we outline the theoretical implications of these results for the architecture of the language system.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAttachment style is widely recognised as influential in shaping responses to bereavement and prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Although theorised extensively, empirical clarity regarding how attachment styles specifically impact PGD symptoms and therapeutic implications remains limited. This study aimed to identify cognitive-behavioural mechanisms linking attachment styles to PGD symptoms.\nMethods\nData were collected from a community sample of 695 bereaved adults. Network analysis explored interactions between attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) and various cognitive-behavioural factors associated with PGD, including appraisals, memory characteristics, maladaptive coping strategies, and social disconnection.\nResults\nThe findings reveal attachment styles as peripheral within the network, suggesting that their direct influence on PGD symptoms may be less central than previously theorised. However, anxious attachment correlated positively with injustice rumination and altered social self, while avoidant attachment was positively associated with perceived loss of future and relationships and preferences for solitude, and negatively associated with proximity-seeking behaviours and fear of losing connection to the deceased. Cognitive-behavioural factors, particularly memory characteristics and social disconnection, held central positions within the network, mediating relationships between attachment styles and PGD.\nConclusions\nAttachment styles indirectly influence PGD through cognitive-behavioural pathways rather than exerting strong direct effects. By bridging the gap between attachment theory and cognitive-behavioural approaches to grief, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of its relationship with PGD, and points towards potential new avenues for future interventions aimed at addressing attachment-related challenges in bereaved individuals.",

However, it is still unclear whether seeing representational gestures directs additional attention towards the speech signal. \nIn the current study, we addressed this research question by investigating neural tracking of speech in the presence of representational gestures during unscripted dialogue with and without background noise. Dyads performed a tangram-based referential communication task, while audio-visual behavior and dual-EEG were recorded.  \nRepresentational gestures increased neural tracking of speech in both delta and theta frequencies and in both dialogue conditions in comparison to control movements. This finding suggests that seeing representational gestures directs attention to the processing of both acoustic and linguistic information of the speech signal. As no differences in neural tracking of speech were observed between dialogue conditions, we believe that dyads made use of different strategies to overcome the noise interference. In sum, we argue that neural tracking of speech represents a flexible mechanism which can be modulated by attentional processes to meet different cognitive and communicative demands during face-to-face interaction.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. Time is among the most fundamental resources to which people tend to be acutely sensitive across contexts. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "authors": "Mauricio Martins; Dan Cook; Arno Villringer",
          "abstract": "The capacity to represent recursive hierarchical embedding (RHE) is considered a hallmark of human cognition. Yet, it remains debated whether non-linguistic recursion depends on language-specific, domain-general, or independent visuospatial mechanisms. In two experiments, we tested this question using a dual-task paradigm. Participants performed either a visual recursion task (REC) or a matched visual iteration task (ITE) while concurrently engaging in lexical retrieval (LEX), serial arithmetic (MATH), visual delayed match-to-sample (VIS), or no interference (NONE). Both LEX and MATH—tasks that require serial, symbolic, generative processing—reliably reduced accuracy in REC and ITE, with interference being stronger for ITE. Drift diffusion modeling confirmed that LEX and MATH slowed evidence accumulation and reduced decision thresholds, indicating less efficient and more impulsive responding. Interestingly, while LEX and MATH lengthened response times in ITE, they shortened them in REC, suggesting compensatory processing strategies. By contrast, VIS did not impair accuracy; instead, it increased drift and boundary separation, consistent with more cautious evidence accumulation. Cognitive covariates further revealed that verbal working memory predicted REC more strongly than ITE under baseline conditions; however, this advantage did not account for the greater interference observed in ITE. Taken together, these findings suggest that visual hierarchical processing involves serial symbolic resources, but recursion is more resilient than iteration, possibly due to the availability of parallel or configural strategies. This supports a hybrid architecture in which linguistic-like symbolic operations contribute to building visual hierarchies, but alternative mechanisms can buffer recursion when these resources are taxed.",

The more students perceived their teacher providing emotional, instructional, or classroom management (feedback) support, the higher the students’ SESR. Second, the more students reported ADHD symptoms, the stronger the positive relationship between teacher emotional and classroom management support and students’ SESR.

In a preregistered large-scale analysis of 11 experience sampling studies (N = 1,616; 106,120 observations), we examined gender differences in expressive suppression in daily life. While men reported greater habitual suppression than women on trait questionnaires, no such gender difference emerged in momentary reports of suppression in everyday contexts. Additionally, there were no gender differences in the types of emotion suppressed (overall negative emotion, anger, and sadness). These findings suggest that gender differences in suppression may reflect internalized stereotypes rather than behavioral reality. Our findings have potential implications for understanding gendered emotion norms, measurements, and interventions aimed at regulating emotions and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to profoundly reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Using large-scale survey data (N = 37,097; 38 European countries), we find that the public predominantly views AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for a large set of technology-related, political, and socio-demographic factors, we further find that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Drawing on nationally representative, preregistered experimental data (N = 400; United States), we provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democratic institutions and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may erode democratic legitimacy and discourage public involvement in shaping the future of AI.",

Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83).

We found that vegetarians exhibited a greater propensity to select the pro-environmental option in the task than non-vegetarians. This group difference was particularly found when decisions entailed high personal costs, low environmental benefits, or uncertain outcomes. Process-tracing data further revealed that vegetarians consistently prioritized environmental information from the outset and throughout the decision process. This attentional focus significantly predicted pro-environmental choices. Overall, the findings suggest that vegetarians may rely on a principled decision-making style that transcends cost–benefit considerations, offering new insights into the cognitive basis of pro-environmental engagement.",

          "abstract": "Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

We analyzed 165 published studies (243 experiments) from recent ESP meta-analyses and 40 preregistered confirmatory experiments from the Koestler Parapsychology Unit Registry. We compared these two datasets to datasets from the field of mainstream psychology. Our primary measure was the percentage of experiments reporting statistically significant positive outcomes (p &lt; .05, one-tailed). Results indicate that the rate of positive outcomes in ESP research is considerably lower than that observed in psychology, for both non-preregistered and preregistered experiments. While the bias is substantially smaller, suggesting more balanced reporting of parapsychological outcomes compared to mainstream psychological research, we cannot conclusively show that the statistical evidence for ESP is not an artifact of that relatively minimal bias, but several earlier tests on the file-drawer problem do undermine that assumption.",

Schema Therapy offers a related framework, proposing that the state expression of early maladaptive schemas—dysfunctional emotional and cognitive patterns formed in response to adverse experiences— are represented by schema modes.  These modes represent distinct parts of the self, such as vulnerable child parts, coping parts, critical parent parts, and healthy adult parts, which influence moment-to-moment experiences. This exploratory qualitative study investigated whether the content of voices experienced by voice-hearers maps onto schema modes as described in Schema Therapy. Method: Seven participants took part in semi-structured interviews exploring the characteristics and content of their voices. Interview transcripts were coded according to established schema mode definitions and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Results: Results indicated that most participants described voices that could be classified within the schema mode framework, with dysfunctional parent modes being the most frequently identified. Conclusions: These findings offer preliminary support for using Schema Therapy concepts to better understand and potentially treat distressing voices, suggesting value in further exploring this approach in clinical settings.",

This study introduces the concept of \"Thoughts on Eating\" (ToE) as a foundational framework for understanding individual eating attitudes and behaviors. ToE captures diverse perspectives on food and eating, ranging from health maintenance to emotional and social dimensions.\nIn this study, we developed and validated the Thoughts on Eating Scale (ToES), a 20-item scale with seven factors: “enriching one’s heart”, “encouraging social communication”, “realizing oneself”, “sustaining oneself”, ”respecting food”, “indifference to eating”, and “disliking eating.” Then, we confirmed its reliability and validity, including concurrent validity with Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and reasonable results were obtained. Moreover, we investigated the associations of ToES with sociodemographis and eating behaviors, and some meaningful and understandable relationships were observed.\nThe ToES also revealed meaningful associations between individual traits, eating attitudes, and behaviors, offering insights into both everyday eating patterns and disordered eating tendencies. This ToE framework along with a robust tool provides for examining the psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of eating, paving the way for future research and interventions to address diverse eating behaviors in modern society.",

          "abstract": "We present a first step towards developing a cognitive model of decision making using Dynamically Structured Holographic Memory (DSHM). DSHM is a class of memory models used to model human performance in game play, memory tasks, and language learning. The ability to detect and predict patterns is an integral part of memory models and an important part of decision making. However, decision making also requires the ability to evaluate states as more or less desirous in order to motivate the decisions. We apply a DSHM model to the decision-making task of Walsh and Anderson (2011). By initializing memory to a state of optimism and by making the model sensitive to dependencies between non-consecutive events, we find that the model is able to learn the task at a rate similar to humans.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures and development, humans can extract proportional quantities from nonsymbolic, visual displays. Two competing accounts have been proposed for the contributions of these nonsymbolic skills to fraction understanding. The shared-magnitude account suggests that a cognitive system responsible for these nonsymbolic skills is foundational for symbolic fraction learning, predicting that neural patterns of fraction skills resemble magnitude-driven neural responses to continuous depictions, like unsegmented bars, that emphasize proportional magnitude. However, other depictions of proportions, like discretized, segmented bars, convey both proportional and whole-number information. The shared-interference account proposes that the interference from whole-number information in discretized proportions and symbolic fractions drives the link between these skills and predicts that neural responses to fraction magnitudes would strongly relate to overall activity to discretized depictions, particularly those with misleading whole-number information. We leveraged representational similarity analyses (RSA) to test these predictions. Nineteen young adults (mean age=23.26 years) compared proportions depicted in continuous, discretized, and symbolic formats. Univariate results indicated robust neural distance effects in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions across formats. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) revealed neural rational distance effects for continuous proportions, whereas for discretized and symbolic fractions, only comparisons with whole-number interference exhibited a rational magnitude signal. Critically, RSA demonstrated that the IPS fraction magnitude-related activity showed greater similarity with discretized brain responses than continuous ones, but only in the context of misleading whole-number information. Together, these findings support a combination of the two accounts and suggest that symbolic fraction proficiency, as well as adept discretized proportional reasoning, involves accessing proportional magnitude code despite the presence of misleading whole-number information.",

          "abstract": "We describe the DSHM (Dynamically Structured Holographic Memory) model of human memory, which uses high dimensional vectors to represent items in memory. The complexity and intelligence of human behavior can be attributed, in part, to our ability to utilize vast knowledge acquired over a lifetime of experience with our environment. Thus models of memory, particularly models that can scale up to lifetime learning, are critical to modeling human intelligence. DHSM is based on the BEAGLE model of language acquisition (Jones and Mewhort, 2007) and extends this type of model to general memory phenomena. We demonstrate that DHSM can model a wide variety of human memory effects. Specifically, we model the fan effect, the problem size effect (from math cognition), dynamic game playing (detecting sequential dependencies from memories of past moves), and time delay learning (using an instance based approach). This work suggests that DSHM is suitable as a basis for learning both over the short-term and over the lifetime of the agent, and as a basis for both procedural and declarative memory. We argue that cognition needs to be understood at both the symbolic and sub-symbolic levels, and demonstrate that DSHM intrinsically operates at both of these levels of description. In order to situate DSHM in a familiar context, we discuss the relationship between DHSM and ACT-R.",

We prove that MINERVA 2, a separate storage model of long-term memory, is mathematically equivalent to composite storage memory implemented as a fourth order tensor, and approximately equivalent to a fourth-order tensor compressed into a holographic vector. Building of these demonstrations, we show that MINERVA 2 and related separate storage models can be implemented in neurons. Our work clarifies the relationship between composite and separate storage models of memory, and thereby moves memory models a step closer to theoretical unification.",

Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Semantic priming in lexical decision tasks has long provided evidence for automatic spreading activation, yet questions remain about how robust these effects are across different research contexts. The present study compared priming outcomes for undergraduates tested in the laboratory and participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk in the early 2010s, using a Qualtrics-based lexical decision task. Reaction times (RTs) were trimmed at ±3 SD within participants, and accuracy was calculated as the proportion correct. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed the expected main effect of prime type, with both groups showing the classic hierarchy of associated &lt; unassociated &lt; nonword stimuli. Within each setting, planned comparisons confirmed a full three-level gradient, underscoring the robustness of semantic priming even when measured online with tools not optimized for RT accuracy. A small but reliable interaction indicated that the overall priming span (nonword − associated difference) was larger for lab participants (M = 0.25 s) than online participants (M = 0.17 s), Hedges’ g = 0.50. Contrary to predictions, accuracy was significantly higher for online participants (M = .93) than lab participants (M = .89), g = −0.76. Perceptions of being observed did not differ between settings. Although the study was not preregistered, all data, materials, and analysis scripts are openly shared. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that semantic priming replicates robustly across both laboratory and early online contexts, highlight a modest laboratory advantage in effect magnitude, and illustrate how basic cognitive phenomena can withstand technically imperfect measurement conditions.",

In this study, we tested the bi-directional nature of the relationship between frequency of flow experiences and the strength of four domains of personal values as outlined in Schwartz’s (1992) influential model: openness, conservation, self-transcendent, and self-enhancement. A nationally representative sample of UK adults completed measures of their personal values and flow experiences at three time-points over a six-month period (T1 N = 2049, T2 N = 888, T3 N = 510). Analysis using a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) allowed for the separation of between and within-subject effects, with our hypotheses focused on the latter to infer directionality. Results revealed that none of the value domains were predictors of the frequency of flow experiences. Increases in the frequency of flow experiences were linked to subsequent increases in the strength of self-transcendent values, but none of the other three value domains were impacted by flow experiences. The findings have implications for how we think about encouraging flow and extend understandings of flow’s outcomes to include increased care for other people and the environment.",

We employed multilevel structural equation modeling, estimating the within-person coupling between daily social media use (Model 1) or daily upward social comparisons (Model 2) and negative affect and tested whether between-person differences in the strength of this coupling predicted average negative affect and depressive symptom change. Findings revealed that a stronger within-person coupling between upward social comparisons and negative affect, but not between social media use and negative affect, was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms via elevated negative affect across the study.

Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception.

Results found over-generation of rarer outcomes and under-generation of common outcomes overall but not in initial responses, as well as avoidance of direct repetitions. Participants also tended to select options with higher average utility across their responses, implying generations guided choice. These findings suggest systematic biases in mental sampling that may filter through to choices, constraining models of this behaviour. We thus suggest random generation is a valuable method to access underlying choice processes, offering new assessments of existing theories of decision making.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

          "authors": "Gayoung Son; Marius Rubo",
          "abstract": "Background: Social anxiety often manifests in real-world interactions through behavioral patterns such as reduced eye contact and lower speech volume. While these markers have been examined in face-to-face paradigms, assessment of such behaviors in real-time social interactions has remained relatively limited. Social Virtual Reality (Social VR) offers a promising alternative by allowing for naturalistic yet experimentally controlled interactions, in which fine-grained social behaviors can be captured automatically and at scale. Examining how social anxiety is expressed in these contexts can support clinical applications such as early risk detection, tracking therapeutic progress, or tailoring interventions to individual behavioral patterns.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to assess whether behavioral and physiological markers associated with social anxiety can be similarly detected in dyadic Social VR interactions, and whether these patterns overlap with those linked to general psychopathology and verticality.\n\nMethods: A total of 128 participants engaged in 30-minute, avatar-mediated dyadic conversations within a Social VR environment. Behavioral markers such as gaze towards the partner’s eye region, smiling and speaking behavior were assessed, alongside physiological measures including heart rate and high-frequency heart-rate variability (HF-HRV). Psychological traits were assessed using self-report questionnaires, and composite factors for social anxiety, general psychopathology, and verticality were derived via principal component analysis (PCA). Relationships between traits and behavioral and physiological markers were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.\n\nResults: We found that behavioral and physiological patterns previously associated with social anxiety also emerged in interactions in Social VR, replicating patterns observed in face-to-face interactions. Specifically, higher social anxiety was linked to less gaze toward the partner’s eyes while speaking and quieter speech, alongside reduced HF-HRV. Similar patterns were observed for general psychopathology. In contrast, higher verticality was associated with shorter turn-taking gaps and increased HF-HRV. Correlational analyses revealed highly similar behavioral profiles for social anxiety and psychopathology, whereas verticality displayed a largely opposite pattern.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate that behavioral and physiological patterns associated with psychological traits in face-to-face interactions are also traceable in immersive Social VR settings. Elevated social anxiety and general psychopathology were linked to increased submissive behaviors and heightened physiological stress, while higher verticality was associated with more assertive, dominant interaction styles — suggesting it may represent the opposing end of a shared social-behavioral spectrum. Notably, the strong convergence between social anxiety and broader psychopathology supports the view that many social interaction patterns are not uniquely tied to specific disorders but may reflect general psychological vulnerability. Although the passive and automated nature of behavioral data in Social VR presents novel ethical and privacy challenges, it also affords scalable assessments of social behavior in ecologically valid settings. These results highlight Social VR’s potential as a tool for assessing natural social behaviors in clinical and applied settings.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 psychological researchers about the epistemic research goals they were trying to achieve in two of their recent projects (one completed and one ongoing; 40 projects in total). Using thematic analysis, we identified a wide range of research goals across six domains: empirical phenomena, concept development, measurement and auxiliaries, causal explanation, theory, and application. Nearly all goals in the sample were studied with hypothesis tests, but these tests served several different functions. The interviews revealed substantial variation in what researchers meant by 'hypothesis testing,' reflecting different inferential processes, assumptions, and levels of rigour. Some of these methods lacked key features of hypothesis testing and may not be ideally suited for researchers' actual objectives. Psychologists may benefit from clearer guidance about when hypothesis testing is appropriate and what alternative methods can serve the field's diverse epistemic goals.",

          "abstract": "Ancestrally, physical violence from conspecifics was a recurrent adaptive problem. Did selection favor preferences for partners who are both strong (highly able) and willing to protect us from violence? Strength and willingness are interrelated, so dissociating their effects is necessary. Here we assessed both inferences and preferences. In 7 experiments (N = 4,508 U.S. adults recruited via MTurk), we systematically varied the willingness of a date or friend to physically protect you from an attack, compared to scenarios where you do not have this information. We also varied that person’s strength. Discovering that a person is willing to protect greatly increased their attractiveness as a romantic partner or friend, regardless of their strength. This held for both women and men raters, and when evaluating both opposite- and same-sex dates and friends. In fact, partners who were willing to protect were attractive even if they tried to do so but failed, and even if you were harmed because of their failure. Discovering that a partner is unwilling to protect decreased their attractiveness, and was a deal-breaker for women evaluating a male date. Unwillingness decreased attractiveness more when the rater was a woman, when the target was a man, and when the target was being evaluated as a date versus friend. Women placed some importance on a male date’s strength, but this was mostly due to inferences about his willingness to protect them. Surprisingly, we found only weak evidence that differences in strength, independent of willingness, increased the attractiveness of a partner.",

          "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder, often an early marker of α-synucleinopathies, is characterized by the loss of REM-related muscle atonia and the occurrence of dream enactment behaviors. Dream reports in REM sleep behavior disorder are frequently described as more vivid, violent, and negative than typical dreams. However, evidence for this remains inconsistent, likely due to methodological variability and unaddressed confounds – most notably, the influence of pharmacological treatments. The extent to which medications affect REM sleep behavior disorder dream content remains poorly understood.\nThis systematic review critically evaluates the literature on the effects of medications commonly used in REM sleep behavior disorder and Parkinson’s disease – including clonazepam, other benzodiazepines, melatonin, melatonin receptor agonists, levodopa, pramipexole, and other dopamine agonists - on dream content. We identified 27 relevant studies employing qualitative and/or quantitative methods.\nOur analysis revealed major methodological limitations across studies, including a lack of standardized protocols and definitions, frequent reliance on retrospective or anecdotal reports, and predominantly qualitative or semi-quantitative assessments. These limitations constrain the interpretability and comparability of findings. Available evidence offers only limited support for clonazepam, melatonin, and pramipexole in reducing disturbing dream content. More consistent, but still preliminary, evidence links levodopa to increases in vivid or disturbing dreams, including nightmares.\nThis review highlights the need for rigorously controlled studies using standardized and reproducible methods to clarify the role of pharmacological treatments in shaping dream content in REM sleep behavior disorder. Future research should also integrate retrospective and prospective data-collection designs to account for potential recall biases.",

Centrism about AI consciousness is the position that we must take both challenges seriously. The two challenges interact in ways that make this difficult.

Additionally, the three studies provide mixed, and sometimes even contradictory findings, on the direct associations between personality traits and violent behavioural intentions, and the interactions between perceived threat and personality as a driver of violent extremism.\nConclusion: This research provides inconclusive findings for the Situation (threat perception) – Disposition (personality) Nexus in the context of future research.

A broad overview across signalling pathways and memory models is currently lacking. Here, we systematically review publications that tested the impact of acute pharmacological interventions on aversive memory in healthy humans, following PRISMA 2020. We identified 215 candidate compounds from 17 systems and searched Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus, until 14 June 2024. In total, we identified 100 publications with 36 compounds targeting 13 systems. Three compounds were used by the majority of studies: hydrocortison (n=25), propranolol (n=19), and D-cycloserin (n=8), while many of the remaining 33 compounds were investigated in single studies only. We summarise the effect of each investigated compound across memory models, according to the targeted memory stage. Solid evidence emerges for an impact of propranolol on reconsolidation, and weak evidence for an impact of propranolol, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), benzodiazepines, yohimbine, reboxetine, and D-cycloserine on aversive memory encoding/consolidation, and valproic acid on extinction encoding/consolidation. Furthermore, 11 compounds showed significant effects in individual studies with no published replication attempts to date.

These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories.

Results showed that approximately one out of 20 youth changed their gender identity at least once, with several changing multiple times during the study. Whereas some youth changed between binary options (i.e., boy/man or girl/woman), others (also) considered nonbinary identities – either by identifying as such or through various self-descriptions.

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "abstract": "It has been claimed that musicians can convey different timing ‘feels’ in groove-based performance by manipulating onset asynchrony between instruments (playing ahead/on/behind the beat) and the durational ratio of metrical subdivisions (non-isochrony/‘swing’). The extent to which listeners can actually perceive such microrhythmic nuances, however, has rarely been tested in ecological, multi-instrumental contexts. While pupil dilation has been linked to asynchrony, it has not been studied for swing, even though it has been shown to reliably index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological complement to behavioral measures of microrhythm. We measured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony (Exp. 1) and swing (Exp. 2) in a naturalistic funk pattern (IOI ≈143 ms) featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with global onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. Across both experiments, thresholds varied systematically by instrument. For asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found for detection of asynchrony, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to detect than early ones (≈23ms). In addition, musical training conferred a general advantage, with musicians achieving lower thresholds compared to non-musicians (asynchrony: ≈20ms vs. 31ms ; swing: ≈23ms vs. 34ms). We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further indicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm more generally.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

          "abstract": "Language-based assessments (LBAs), quantitative estimates of scientific constructs based on language, have advanced methods in the psychological and social sciences for over a decade. LBAs based on individuals’ prompted descriptions analysed with large language models to produce scores of their psychological states and traits have shown strong convergence with the corresponding rating scales (r &gt; .80) and have often surpassed rating scales in predicting theoretically relevant behaviours (external criteria). Despite their high validity across numerous psychological outcomes and contexts, the broader adoption of LBA models has been limited. Even when made available alongside research publications, these models often remain inaccessible due to technical complexities, inconsistent documentation, and the absence of a standardized repository. This tutorial introduces a framework targeted to social and psychological scientists for accessible sharing models with others –the Language-Based Assessment Models (L-BAM) Library– as well as a toolkit for easily using L–BAMs via the text package in R. L-BAM covers a wide range of models for assessing mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, harmony in life), implicit motives (need for power, affiliation and achievement) and more. The L-BAM library aims to increase the availability and resource efficiency of language-based assessments of psychological constructs while encouraging replication, independent validation and the broad application of pre-existing language-based assessment models.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception. This may contribute to the misattribution of self-generated content as external, suggesting an additional element of predictive processing theories of hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "Bisexual cisgender men experience stigma from both straight and LGBTQ+ communities, yet the sources and pathways of harm are rarely disaggregated. We examined how bi-negativity from straight and gay communities relates to sexual identity visibility (outness), mental health and well-being, and body dissatisfaction. In a pre-registered study of UK-based bisexual cisgender men (N = 200; 80.5% White), participants completed measures of bi-negativity, sexual identity visibility, mental health and well-being, body dissatisfaction, and perceived gay community stress. Straight community bi-negativity predicted poorer mental health, which in turn was associated with greater body dissatisfaction; no serial pathway via sexual identity visibility emerged. Gay community bi-negativity showed no direct relationship to body dissatisfaction or mental health but was positively associated with sexual identity visibility and indirectly associated with mental health, acting through sexual identity visibility, suggesting a potential beneficial pathway. Perceived gay community stress did not moderate pathways from gay community bi-negativity. Findings show distinct routes by which dual-source bi-negativity influences bisexual men’s mental health and well-being and body image, underscoring the urgency of reducing straight community prejudice and supporting bisexual visibility.",

We also controlled for differences in Dark Tetrad, paranoia, conspiracy mentality and distress. We found no difference in conspiracy explanations between neutral and conspiracy conditions, suggesting that the topic of COVID-19 vaccines was highly saturated with conspiracy theories. Importantly, the anti-conspiracy intervention led to decreased conspiracy explanations irrespective of an individual’s conspiracy mentality. Although conspiracy explanations were correlated with reported sociopolitical behaviour and institutional distrust, we found no differences between the groups in these variables, highlighting the importance of further research on the effectiveness of interventions in this regard.",

Pretenders accurately mimicked broad aspects of genuine play, including the number of guesses required to reach a solution, as well as subtle patterns, such as effects of decision uncertainty on decision time. While peers were unable to detect pretense, statistical analysis and computational modeling uncovered traces of ‘over-acting’ in pretenders’ decisions, suggesting a schematic simulation of their minds.

A total of 114 Swedish preschoolers participated in a pre-post intervention study, with an experimental group receiving three sessions of number line estimation practice via a game-like computerized task. Results showed significant improvements in number-line accuracy and early math skills in the experimental group, while the control group exhibited stable performance across sessions. Critically, the analysis of dynamics between symbolic and nonsymbolic abilities revealed a bidirectional relation: symbolic skills predicted nonsymbolic development across groups, but the reverse prediction from nonsymbolic to symbolic skills only emerged in the experimental group. These findings support both refinement and mapping accounts and highlight number line training as a developmental bridge between numerical systems. Implications for educational tools aiming to scaffold early numerical development are discussed.",

Noh is performed by experts in various fields such as the shite-kata actors) and the hayashi-kata (instrumentalists). It has been reported that Noh performers acquire peculiar physical techniques, such as breathing patterns, during expression; however, it is unclear whether practicing Noh causes psychological transformation. In this study, we examined changes in trait-level interoception that accompany the practice of Noh. In the survey, 22 professional Noh performers (10 actors, Mage = 45.60, SDage = 12.29, age range = 23–56; 12 instrumentalists, Mage = 47.50, SDage = 10.85, age range = 25–62; all participants were male) and 18 controls with no Noh experience (Mage = 40.50, SDage = 6.85, age range = 31–52) completed a series of questionnaires, including psychological scales on multiple aspects of interoception, such as belief about accuracy or attention. The actors showed substantially higher scores than the controls in terms of interoceptive attention. Furthermore, interoceptive accuracy in the actors correlated positively with years of experience. This study provides important insights into the physical and psychological techniques of Noh performers and contributes to the elucidation of factors that alter interoception over time.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that external feedback is effective not only for enhancing cognitive performance but also for regulating metacognitive monitoring. However, external feedback could be detrimental when it conflicts with one’s internal feedback signal (i.e. the level of confidence we have in our decisions). Currently, however, it is unknown how discrepancies between internal and external feedback (“metacognitive conflict”) influence cognitive and metacognitive performance. Here, we examined this question in a series of perceptual decision-making experiments in which participants reported both their level of confidence and received performance feedback. Metacognitive conflict occurs if participants have high confidence in their decision, but external feedback indicates that the decision was erroneous, or vice versa. Results revealed that metacognitive conflict triggers next-trial behavioral adjustments: participants exhibit significantly lower confidence following metacognitive conflict. Critically, this adaptation effect was confined to the trial level, with no sustained modulation observed when manipulating metacognitive conflict at the block level. To better characterize the computational mechanisms underlying this effect, we deployed an evidence accumulation model with additional post-decision accumulation to quantify confidence. Model fits revealed that participants become more conservative in reporting confidence after experiencing metacognitive conflict, as evidenced by biased post-decision starting points. Jointly, our findings provide much needed insight into the metacognitive consequences of metacognitive conflict.",

While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (&gt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared &lt; 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

Using a sample of 927 adolescents aged 15–19 (M = 16.97, SD = 1.19; 59% girls, 38% boys, 3% other), this study explored whether resilience to idealized media bodies and to negative appearance feedback moderated the links between social media appearance activity, body esteem, and self-objectification, with the expectation that such resilience would buffer against low body esteem and heightened self-objectification. Resilience to negative appearance feedback did not significantly moderate these associations. In contrast, resilience to media ideals did, but in an unexpected direction. Adolescents with higher-than-average resilience who engaged more frequently in appearance activity reported greater self-objectification and lower body esteem, whereas those with lower-than-average resilience reported the opposite relationships, showing less self-objectification and higher body esteem. These results emerged for both girls and boys. Considering the exploratory nature of these results, they suggest that resilience may play a more intricate role in adolescents' social media appearance activity and body image. Future studies should investigate this idea further, including the reverse pathway where resilience may build up from exposure to idealization on social media.",

          "abstract": "Teacher shortages are a serious challenge in many countries, made worse by declining enrolments in initial teacher education (ITE) programs and growing competition for talented young people making career decisions. To address this challenge, we developed and tested two digital interventions—a persuasive game (TeachQuest) and a realistic job preview (RJP)—designed to enhance undergraduate students’ teaching interest, teaching self-efficacy, and perceptions of fit with the profession. In a two-phase experimental study (N = 957), undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to TeachQuest, the RJP, or a control condition. Results from Phase 1 showed that both interventions increased participants’ interest and perceived fit with teaching, with the RJP also improving teaching self-efficacy. In Phase 2, results from a delayed post-test (six weeks later; N = 572) indicated that while motivation-related outcomes remained higher than pre-test levels, changes were non-linear, with TeachQuest sustaining interest through participants’ immersion experiences and the RJP maintaining self-efficacy through mastery experiences. Our findings suggest that immersive game-based recruitment interventions may be particularly effective in informing and engaging potential applicants, whereas RJPs may be useful in reinforcing confidence in teaching. The study provides new insights informing the design of scalable, evidence-based teacher recruitment tools that align with the interests and digital-focused lives of prospective applicants for ITE programs.",

          "abstract": "Organizations in the United States exist in a hierarchical context, with gendered, racialized, and heteronormative influences. However, leaders seeking to mitigate bias and discrimination in organizations often treat organizations as impermeable structures immune to these influences. This blindness stymies their ability to treat the core activators of interpersonal conflict, rather than solely the symptoms. Merging bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We integrate sociological, institutional, and systems psychodynamics theories to document how arbitrary hierarchies influence everything from how organizations form to interpersonal interactions. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the subtlety of the microaggression (which has been the focus of past research in this topic) to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – hegemonic organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of hegemonic hierarchies in their workplace.",

We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

          "authors": "Savannah C Lewis; Christopher Trenge; Alexa Mary Tullett",
          "abstract": "With increased interest in the replication crisis and the open science movement, it is important to examine the implications of communicating these topics to undergraduate psychology students. At the beginning of the open science movement, the effort to improve research practices was seen and discussed as both an individual and systemic endeavor. Some authors placed the focus on individual researchers, encouraging them to engage in practices like pre-registration and open data. Others, however, placed the responsibility with the system, arguing that incentive structures and norms need to reward these new practices. The current project examined whether using individual vs. systemic teaching approaches impacted psychology student’s trust, motivation, and optimism regarding the field of psychology. Undergraduate psychology students (N= 476) were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions, one specifying how researchers’ practices should change (individual), one specifying on incentive structures should change (systemic), and one summarizing general research practices in psychology. I expected to find that participants in the individual condition would show the highest levels of trust in the field, motivation to improve the field, and optimism, while participants in the systemic condition would show the highest trust in psychological researchers. Overall, while our manipulation effectively influenced participants' perceptions of the teaching approaches, the expected differences in trust, motivation, and optimism were not consistently observed. These results suggest that, regardless of whether one takes an individual or systemic approach, teaching about the replication crisis does not always undermine (or enhance) trust, motivation, and optimism.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing tradition suggests that social inferences are summarized by a few dimensions (e.g., warmth, competence). However, such findings relied on constrained stimuli (e.g., group labels, static faces). Studies using naturalistic designs instead reveal high dimensionality. We propose a new perspective that reconciles these views: mental representations of social inferences are structured as a growing network with small-world properties. In this structure, nodes (social inferences) are connected with only a few steps from one another, so even limited activation—elicited by constrained stimuli in only a small subset of nodes—propagates broadly across the network, producing covariation that mimics low-dimensional structures. However, these dimensions are not functional but emergent properties of network dynamics under constrained input. We demonstrated how this small-world-minds perspective accounts for classic phenomena—halo effect and psychological dimensions—as artifacts of stimulus limitations. We call for moving beyond low-dimensional paradigms to understand the complexity of social cognition.",

          "abstract": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as “GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY” were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as “honeypots” to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination—the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

          "authors": "Tianwei Gong; Simon Valentin; Neil R Bramley; Christopher G. Lucas",
          "abstract": "Heuristics have long been viewed as simple decision rules that sacrifice optimality for cognitive efficiency. However, this perspective fails to fully account for their effectiveness in complex, real-world environments. This paper proposes a reinterpretation of heuristics as realizations of likelihood-free approximation to Bayesian inference (LFI), bridging the gap between heuristic and normative approaches to decision-making. We argue that many heuristics can be understood as implementations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), where observed data are compared to prior predictions via summary statistics (a form of LFI). This view situates heuristics within a probabilistic framework, explaining how they can represent uncertainty and adapt to environmental structure. Our approach addresses three key challenges in the field: It relaxes strong assumptions about cue-target relationships in heuristic models, accounts for implicit uncertainty representation in heuristic decision-making, and invites a more appropriate benchmark for evaluating heuristics' performance. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we present two case studies --- a classic cue-based decision task and an ecological causal learning task. These show that an ABC model using summary statistics can well approximate the benchmark performance provided by unconstrained Bayesian inference, explain the apparent emergence of different heuristics given environmental changes, and capture human behaviors better than a rational Bayesian benchmark without introducing new mysteries. By unifying heuristics and Bayesian inference through the lens of likelihood-free methods, this work provides a more nuanced understanding of human decision-making, and provides a bridge to the literature on inference-by-sampling.",

This study examined the influence of spatial priors (pre-existing knowledge about spatial parameters) using a spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality. We proposed a novel two-dimensional framework for categorizing spatial priors based on spatial reference frame (allocentric vs. egocentric) and temporal scale (global vs. local). Participants memorized and later reproduced target locations. The spatial compactness of the target distribution was manipulated to vary the precision of the allocentric global prior. A central tendency effect, where responses were biased toward the target distribution centroid, indicated reliance on the allocentric global prior. Bias was stronger with more precise distributions, indicating greater reliance on the more precise allocentric global prior. Bidimensional regression analysis revealed additional influences from the egocentric global and egocentric local priors, but not from the allocentric local prior. These findings support the proposed framework and demonstrate that multiple forms of prior knowledge simultaneously guide navigation behavior. This work provides a foundation for future studies linking prior knowledge to spatial navigation and broader cognitive processes.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, an increasingly common practice amongst organizations has been setting representation goals, or organizational mandates intended to increase the prevalence of underrepresented employees in visible work assignments. The work of meeting these goals often falls to managers, who must also weigh additional criteria – like the employees’ workloads or skillsets – in their task assignments. Typically, when faced with a task assignment decision, managers will refrain from assigning employees who are not available or who do not have the requisite skillset. However, leaning on Tetlock’s theory of value pluralism, we predict that these goals can lead managers to set aside traditional criteria of effective task assignment (specifically, underrepresented employees’ person-job fit and/or workloads) to prioritize achieving these organizational goals. In this way, underrepresented employees are more likely to be assigned to tasks that are sub-optimal for their occupational success (i.e., by being assigned to work that does not appropriately match their skillset or that leads them to be overworked). We examine these predictions in four studies (N = 2,598). We find that this decision-making is driven by managers’ increased diversity concerns (as a consequence of the representation goals), but can be mitigated by how the organization communicates those goals. We conclude by discussing both the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",

This study used a person-centered approach to examine how personality and imagination cluster among university students and how these profiles relate to sex and disciplinary enrollment. Latent profile analysis (LPA) revealed three typologies: Reactive Realists (10.3%), with lower imagination and emotional stability; Reserved Idealists (52.6%), with lower extraversion and moderately elevated imagination; and Balanced Visionaries (37.2%), with high imagination and greater emotional stability. Chi-square analyses indicated that sex did not significantly differentiate profile membership, suggesting imagination-personality patterns are not sex-specific. However, profiles were significantly related with college disciplinary choices when sex and race/ethnicity were added as covariates. Balanced Visionaries were less likely to enroll in the sciences relative to Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, while Reactive Realists showed higher odds of enrolling in Engineering. Regression models further showed significant effects of sex and race/ethnicity: females were less likely to enroll in Business, Engineering, and Music, but more likely in Education; Asian students were more likely to enroll in Business, Engineering, and Science; and Hispanic/Latinx students had higher odds of enrolling in Engineering. These findings highlight the value of LPA for identifying imagination-personality typologies that shape educational choices in post-secondary education.",

To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy.

          "abstract": "Psycholinguistic theories traditionally assume similar cognitive mechanisms across different speakers. However, more recently, researchers have begun to recognize the need to consider individual differences when explaining human cognition. An increasing number of studies have investigated how individual differences influence human sentence processing. Implicitly, these studies assume that individual-level effects can be replicated across experimental sessions and different assessment methods such as eye-tracking and self-paced reading. However, this assumption is challenged by the reliability paradox  (Hedge, 2018). Thus, a crucial first step for a principled investigation of individual differences in sentence processing is to establish their measurement reliability, that is, the correlation of individual-level effects across multiple measurement occasions and methods. In this work, we present the first naturalistic eye movement corpus of reading data with four experimental sessions from each participant (two eye-tracking sessions and two self-paced reading sessions). We deploy a two-task Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the measurement reliability of individual differences in a range of  psycholinguistic phenomena  that are well-established at the population level, namely effects of word length, lexical frequency, surprisal, dependency length and number of to-be-integrated dependents. While our results indicate high reliability across measurement occasions for the word length effect, it is only moderate for higher-level psycholinguistic predictors such as lexical frequency, dependency distance, and the number of to-be-integrated dependencies, and even low for surprisal. Moreover, even after accounting for spillover effects, we observe only low to moderate reliability at the individual level across methods (eye-tracking and self-paced reading) for most predictors, and poor reliability for predictors of syntactic integration. These findings underscore the importance of establishing measurement reliability before drawing inferences about individual differences in sentence processing.",

Diversity training interventions based on experiential learning activities, such as role-plays, can help promote receiving society members’ awareness of acculturation as a mutual process shaped by power asymmetries. However, existing role-plays on acculturation lack theory and science-informed bases, and their effectiveness has rarely been examined by empirical research. Via two mixed-method studies, the present research assessed the learning outcomes of a role-play-based intervention, designed by incorporating well-established psychological frameworks on acculturation, among a community sample of Portuguese majority members (Study 1, N = 44) and in the academic setting among Portuguese and international university students (Study 2, N = 18). Statistical comparisons of pre- and post-test scores revealed that the intervention was effective in increasing participants’ knowledge of migration and acculturation-related issues, and in fostering Portuguese majority members’ empathy towards migrants and refugees. Qualitative data collected during the debriefing discussion and via a feedback form provide in-depth insights into participants’ experiential learning processes. The intervention appeared as a valuable tool for promoting awareness of acculturation as a mutual process and supporting the introduction of acculturation theoretical frameworks in the classroom.",

          "authors": "ALI JAMI",
          "abstract": "In a dynamic and uncertain world, the human brain must efficiently process emotions and simulate potential scenarios to enhance decision-making under ambiguity. This theoretical framework proposes that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep serves as a cognitive simulator, decoding unconscious emotions and incoming information within a safe, virtual environment. During REM sleep, limbic system structures—such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula integrate recent sensory inputs with long-term memory schemas, transforming raw emotional signals based on potential threat and reward into actionable insights. Simultaneously, REM sleep facilitates affect-centric probabilistic simulations through hippocampal-prefrontal interactions, generating symbolic reconstructions of past experiences and hypothetical scenarios to foster cognitive flexibility and resilience. This model extends traditional perspectives on REM sleep, which emphasize memory consolidation and emotional regulation, by highlighting its critical role in future-oriented decision-making. Drawing on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computational analogies with artificial intelligence, this framework underscores REM sleep’s dual function in emotional familiarization and adaptive strategy rehearsal. Recent evidence from studies on sleep deprivation and REM-specific manipulations further supports this, showing impairments in decision-making, insight generation, and risk assessment when REM is disrupted. Empirical gaps, including the need for direct neurobehavioral evidence linking REM to specific decision-making outcomes, and alternative hypotheses, such as the role of non-REM sleep or slow-wave activity, are discussed to contextualize the model’s contributions and guide future interdisciplinary research.",

Moreover, perceptions of trustworthiness and attractiveness were not associated for images with extreme filters, suggesting excessive filtering might disrupt the halo effect in dating app contexts.

          "abstract": "Groove is the pleasurable urge to move to the beat of music, a universally experienced human phenomenon. Because listeners are often inspired to move to music with groove, we asked whether high-groove music would promote greater motor system activity than low-groove music, noise, or silence, as shown by shorter latency and/or greater amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an event-related potential measure of neural response preparation and execution in the primary motor cortex. In Experiment 1, 21 participants were presented with one of two symbols (@ and #) on a computer monitor and pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on which symbol was presented, while listening to high-groove music, low-groove music, noise, or silence. Throughout the duration of the experiment, electroencephalography was recorded at the scalp and we calculated stimulus-locked and response-locked activity by averaging across correctly responded, non-artifact trials. In Experiment 2, 31 participants were tested with the same stimuli, procedure, and analysis, with the following exception: instead of responding to visual stimuli, participants pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on whether they heard an occasional increase or decrease in intensity in the music or noise. None of the analyses in either experiment showed differences in LRP latency or amplitude between the high-groove or low-groove conditions. Several of the analyses yielded Bayes Factor values greater than 3 in favor of the null hypothesis. Thus, we found no evidence that high-groove music enhances activity in the primary motor cortex. Future studies should use other brain activity measurement and manipulation techniques to conceptually replicate our findings, including techniques that can separately measure different motor and auditory cortical areas.",

The current study examined sleep benefits in older adults and chose spatial source memory as a target measure for which a recent study in younger adults showed particularly strong sleep benefits (Berres et al., 2025). This corresponds to theories of sleep and memory (e.g., active systems consolidation hypothesis) which predict sleep (especially SWS) benefits in hippocampus-dependent source memory. Using the same design as Berres et al.’s (2025) Experiment 1, we tested 58 older adults (aged 60 – 86 years) who were randomly assigned to study object pictures in left versus right screen locations either in the morning (7-10am; wake group) or in the evening (7-10pm; sleep group). Testing for item (pictures) and source (location) memory followed 12 hours later (i.e., wake group: same day evening; sleep group: next morning). Multinomial model-based analyses showed that both item and, especially, source memory were significantly improved in the sleep group. Additionally, older adults in the sleep group wore FitBitChargeHR™ wristbands for sleep tracking. Based on an extended sample of n = 61 older adults in this group, we estimated correlations to sleep parameters in a Bayesian-hierarchical multinomial analysis. Contrary to expectations, time spent in deep sleep did not predict next morning’s source memory, but time spent in deep sleep embedded in sleep cycles was positively correlated with source memory the next morning. Further, time spent awake after sleep onset was negatively correlated with source memory.",

          "authors": "Nadav Amir; John Dunne",
          "abstract": "A fundamental problem facing any learning organism is how to determine which aspects of its experience to attend to and which to ignore when guiding its goal-oriented actions. This problem, known as relevance realization, is key to understanding how cognitive agents, biological or artificial, learn purposeful behaviors through experience-based interactions with their environment. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how organisms solve the relevance realization problem is currently lacking. Here, we approach this challenge by proposing a synthesis between a contemporary computational framework of goal-oriented learning in cognitive agents and a canonical Buddhist account of concept formation, specifically as developed by the Indian philosopher Dharmakīrti (c. 6-7th century C.E.). Our approach posits that cognitive agents form goal-dependent conceptual representations of the world that reflect subjective preferences about properties of simulated sensorimotor experience streams. By drawing on Dharmakīrti’s ideas to inform computational models of goal-directed learning, our approach bears on current debates regarding the prerequisites for and implications of artificially emulating human-like cognition.",

          "authors": "Xing Su; Jeremy Cohn; Jeffrey M. Zacks",
          "abstract": "Performing actions boosts memory for descriptions of those actions; this is called the “enactment effect.” The enactment effect has been repeatedly found with verbal materials, but it is unclear if this effect generalizes to naturalistic materials that include linked sequences of actions and multimodal information. In four preregistered studies, we tested for enactment effects using naturalistic movies. Experiment 1 successfully replicated the enactment effect using descriptions of actions from the movies. In Experiment 2, participants read or acted out action descriptions and then watched a movie including those actions; no enactment effect was found. In Experiment 3, participants watched the movies while simultaneously copying the actions that the actors performed; again, no enactment effect was observed. Finally, Experiment 4 examined whether enactment affected how movies were segmented into meaningful events; once again, no enactment effect was observed. These results suggest that during naturalistic comprehension viewers may obligatorily engage motor simulations, rendering enactment manipulations redundant and thus ineffective.",

          "abstract": "Academic Miscommunication (AM) is the phenomenon of a professor’s expectations, beliefs, or goals in the classroom differing from those of the students. In this study, a survey was given to undergraduates in two introductory physics classes (one class intended for majors, another for non-majors) who had recently received their grade for the first exam of the semester. The survey measured whether the exam had matched the students’ expectations of the exam, both in form and in content. From these responses, students were assigned an \"AM score,\" a numerical value in which higher numbers indicate a greater deviation between the actual exam and the students’ expectations. Students’ exam scores were compared with their AM scores; both classes displayed an inverse linear correlation between exam scores and AM scores. The class for majors displayed R-squared = 0.291 (n=14), corresponding to a p-value of 0.031. The class for non-majors displayed an R-squared = 0.457 (n=30), corresponding to a p-value of 0.000035. The survey also inquired about several other phenomena, such as Impostor Syndrome and the growth-versus-fixed mindset paradigm; 20 graphs were plotted in total. The Bonferroni correction therefore requires a p-value of 0.0025 for statistical significance. We reject the null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for non-majors. In contrast, we fail to reject the null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for majors. Our findings indicate that non-physics-major students who performed poorly on the first exam of the semester had misunderstood the expectations about the style and content of the exam.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study accounted for heterotypic continuity of multiple psychopathology dimensions by using developmental scaling to place multi-informant ratings of children’s behavior problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N=231) development of three psychopathology dimensions—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from age-differing measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy, for externalizing problems, in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—modestly more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task (rdiff=.07–.13). Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach—modestly more accurate than average scores (rdiff=.03–.17).\nConclusion: Using (a) age-differing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Mental imagery is theorised to support important mental simulation processes, yet there remains little direct evidence of its functional impact on moral, emotional, and motivational processes. This pre-registered study examined whether the ability to generate visual mental imagery amplifies magical thinking responses to mentally constructed emotional events. Using a modified laboratory harm provocation paradigm, participants with aphantasia (minimal or absent visual imagery; N = 32) and visualisers (normal to high imagery ability; N = 48) were asked to write and elaborate on the sentence “I hope [name of a loved one] is in a car accident”, followed by an episodic elaboration phase to ensure both groups engaged in concrete-experiential mental processing of the specific event. The Visualiser group reported significantly higher anxiety, guilt, moral violation, responsibility, and urge to neutralise the thought relative to Aphantasic participants, despite similar perceptions of event likelihood and severity, and after accounting for the effects of age and trait magical thinking. However, neutralisation behaviour did not differ between groups. Mental imagery ratings and episodic detail reports confirmed that visualisers generated richer sensory representations of the imagined event. These findings support emulation theory by demonstrating that scene-based mental imagery amplifies emotional and motivational responses to hypothetical events, contributing to the phenomenological intensity of intrusive thoughts. The results have implications for understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying magical thinking and compulsive behaviours. Results suggest that aphantasia may confer reduced vulnerability to such responses.",

          "abstract": "Background: Camouflaging – the use of strategies to mask autistic traits in social contexts – has been linked to mental health challenges and lower self-esteem. While the relationship between camouflaging and mental health has been increasingly studied, its associations with self-related factors, including self-esteem, self-acceptance, and identity, remain underexplored. The aim of this systematic review was to examine existing research on the relationship between camouflaging and self-related factors in autistic adults. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024597257). Results: A total of 259 articles were identified. One hundred thirty articles were screened, and thirteen studies were included. Across studies, camouflaging was consistently associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, lower self-esteem, and reduced authenticity in interpersonal relationships. Most studies showed associations between exhaustion, identity confusion, reduced self-acceptance and camouflaging. Conversely, receiving an autism diagnosis and developing self-acceptance were associated with reduced camouflaging and greater opportunities for authentic self-expression. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that camouflaging is closely tied to difficulties in self-related factors and well-being among autistic adults. These findings highlight the importance of supports and interventions that affirm autistic identity and reduce social pressures to camouflage.",

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is essential for temporarily retaining goal-relevant visual information, yet its limited capacity renders it vulnerable to distraction. While previous studies have examined the effects of distractors occurring during encoding or maintenance, it remains unclear how stimulus presentation duration modulates these effects and whether different types or quantities of distractors exert similar costs. Across three experiments, we systematically investigated how distraction timing, distractor content, and perceptual load interact with encoding duration to influence VWM performance. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks under four distraction conditions (no-distraction, encoding-, delay-, and full-distraction) and two encoding durations (short: 200 ms; long: 1000 ms). Encoding-stage distractions impaired performance only in the short-duration, high-precision task, whereas delay-stage distractions consistently disrupted memory regardless of duration or task type. Experiment 2 manipulated distractor-target similarity (same-category vs. different-category distractors) and revealed that homogeneous distractors exerted stronger disruption, particularly when presented during the delay period. In contrast, heterogeneous distractors could be effectively suppressed when sufficient encoding time allowed for robust consolidation. Experiment 3 examined perceptual load (low vs. high) and showed that increasing distractor quantity did not amplify interference, suggesting that once memory consolidation is complete, delay-stage distractions disrupt VWM representations regardless of distractor load. Together, these findings reveal an asymmetry in how VWM handles distractions at different processing stages. While extended encoding supports resistance to early interference, maintenance-stage distractions exert persistent effects—especially when distractors are similar to targets. Our results highlight the importance of presentation duration and distractor similarity in shaping VWM robustness, and suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may underlie suppression at encoding and maintenance stages.",

          "abstract": "Despite the well-researched association between problematic video gaming and internalizing symptoms, few studies incorporate parent reports or examine possible moderators for this association. This study examined person- and dyadic-level associations between gaming disorder (GD) and internalizing symptoms among children and adolescents, along with the moderation of expressive suppression, family functioning, and parenting behaviors. A cross-sectional design was adopted, and 121 dyads of parents and their children who played video games at least once a week were recruited. Participants received questionnaires via mail and completed them independently in a paper-and-pencil format. In generalized linear regression and multilevel common fate modeling, child-reported GD and latent GD were treated as the criterion variables, respectively. Despite the significant association between child-reported GD and internalizing symptoms, β = .023, p = .03, the latent association measuring the cross-informant agreement was not significant, β = –.004, p = .86. The only significant moderator was the parent-reported positive parenting behavior in the latent association between GD and internalizing symptoms, β = –.004, p = .04. At the dyadic-level, GD and internet gaming disorder had the same pattern of associations with the other measures, whereas a different pattern emerged at the person-level. This multi-informant measurement may indicate a possible inflation of the self-reported positive association between GD and internalizing symptoms. Positive parenting behavior, including positive response, involvement, and respect, may serve as emotional support, which protects children from resorting to video gaming to alleviate psychological distress.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, the testing community has striven to ensure fairness in tests and test items. Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and  demonstrate how our approach differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study. We further illustrate its application to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam and a real dataset from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, concluding with broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "This study reports the results of a pre-registered online experiment conducted with Qualtrics panelists (N = 927) to examine the persuasive effects of brief, professionally-produced video narratives aimed at reducing anti-immigrant prejudice. Drawing on narrative persuasion and inspiring media frameworks, the study explores how protagonist type—positive role model vs. transitional character—shapes identification with the protagonist and activates psychological insight, a transformative cognitive response linked to attitude change. A 3 (character type: control, transitional character, positive role model) × 3 (rumor type: “immigration increases crime,” “immigrants are taking our jobs,” “immigrants receive excessive public assistance”) between-subjects factorial design was used. Participants were exposed to short, professionally produced audiovisual narratives, each depicting a dramatized critical incident in which a negative rumor about immigrants was introduced and, depending on the condition, either confronted by the protagonist or left unaddressed (control). After viewing, identification, psychological insight, and outcome variables (e.g., attitudes toward immigrants) were assessed. Results show that modern racism moderated the effect of character type on identification: low-prejudice individuals identified more strongly with the positive role model, while high-prejudice individuals showed lower identification in both experimental conditions. Identification predicted psychological insight, which in turn mediated key outcomes such as liking the story, willingness to share it, and attitudes toward immigrants. These findings demonstrate that short video narratives can elicit character-driven insight and promote inclusive attitudes particularly among receptive audiences, but suggest that longer narratives may be needed for counterattitudinal audiences, thereby advancing understanding of how narrative-based interventions such as Entertainment-Education can counter prejudice.",

          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

However, no significant gender disparities were observed in TPACK performance (d ̅ = -0.08). Our findings revealed considerable heterogeneity in these effects across samples, studies, countries, measures, and over time, which could be partly explained by factors such as educational level, country-level gender inequality, and economic development. These results challenge the assumption of male teachers’ advantage in all aspects of technology-related teaching competencies. Our meta-analytic review further implies that gender disparities in TPACK are not fully generalizable and stable across contexts or over time.",

Second, Think-Aloud generalizes across individuals with only a few examples, reflecting shared cognitive patterns. Third, Think-Aloud guides LLMs toward more human-like reasoning.

          "abstract": "Psychologists should analyze their data well rather than badly, but how do we know whether they are actually good at analyzing data in the real world? Currently, there is a dearth of empirically-grounded criteria for assessing real-world analytic skill, leaving us to judge analysts’ decisions on the uncertain or even arbitrary standards of routine, disciplinary norms, or what “feels right” or “seems off”. This knowledge gap is surprising given widespread concerns about low replication, high rates of questionable research practices, and the recent proliferation of data science initiatives both within and beyond psychology purporting to increase job-readiness for data-intensive workplaces. We address this gap by introducing and validating a new construct: analytic fluency, or real-world analytic decision-making that consistently produces trustworthy, informative, and reliable analyses across contexts. Drawing on interviews with experienced analysts, we identify and validate four distinct dimensions of analytic skill: Analyzing Flexibly, Appreciating the Importance of Data, Prioritizing Stakeholder Needs, and Striving for Simplicity. We show analytic fluency scores are predicted by real analytic experience, are empirically distinct from statistical knowledge, and show no bias by gender, race/ethnicity, or education level. By naming and measuring analytic fluency, we address a longstanding conceptual and empirical gap in knowledge about how data analysis is, and ought to be, carried out in practice. In so doing, we take a first small step toward scientifically defining what it means to be skilled at data analysis.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has introduced powerful tools for various research domains, including psychological scale development. This study presents a methodology for efficiently generating and selecting high-quality, non-redundant items for psychological assessments using LLMs and network psychometrics. Our approach, termed Automatic Item Generation with Network-Integrated Evaluation (AI-GENIE), reduces reliance on expert intervention by integrating generative AI with the latest network psychometric techniques. The efficacy of AI-GENIE was evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations using the Mixtral, Gemma 2, Llama 3, GPT 3.5, and GPT 4o models to generate item pools that mimic Big Five personality assessments. Additionally, items from AI-GENIE were empirically tested with five nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 4,964 total), demonstrating that AI-GENIE-generated scales achieve structural validity comparable to traditional expert-developed measures. The results demonstrated improvements in item selection efficiency, with overall average increases of 8.68-20.03 in normalized mutual information in the final item pool across all models. We also present a simulation study on the emerging construct of AI Anxiety to demonstrate AI-GENIE’s utility for underrepresented constructs. Results from newly released models (DeepSeek, GPT-OSS 20B, GPT-OSS 120B) are presented in the Appendix. The findings of our paper suggest that AI-GENIE is a highly effective tool for streamlining the scale development and validation process.",

Previous work has shown that individuals with high reward sensitivity show resilience in the face of individualized stressors. Here, we sought to investigate whether individuals with high reward sensitivity prior to pandemic onset would be resilient to the community-level stressor of the pandemic. Sensitivity to reward was defined here as neural activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum for wins as compared to losses in a reward-based task. We used data from the Human Connectome Project in Development collected before the pandemic onset, and follow-up data which was collected from the same participants during the pandemic. Activity in the left vmPFC moderated the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing psychopathology. Although those with low reward sensitivity showed a positive association between exposure to stressors and psychopathology, those with high sensitivity to reward did not show increased symptoms with increased stressors. We found no effect of activity in the striatum or right vmPFC on the association between stressors and psychopathology. These findings add to a growing literature highlighting reward sensitivity, measured prior to stressor onset, as a source of stress resilience.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption can pose health risks and cause social problems, hence harmful drinking is a global health concern. Acculturation has been theorized and examined as a key driver for drinking behaviors. In this State of the Science article, we define sociocultural and psychological acculturation, and describe three causal theories associated with socialization and learning, stress and coping, and accessibility and opportunity. Data have shown small-to-moderate associations linking acculturation factors to drinking outcomes. Many existing studies measure acculturation with demographic proxies and static cultural orientation indicators. Underlying causal mechanisms are typically inferred rather than tested directly, with limited focus on key proximal factors such as stress responses, drinking motives, and cultural norms. Furthermore, current alcohol interventions lack alignment with acculturation science and fail to target modifiable, drinking-related factors. To advance the field and bridge research-to-practice gaps, studies should move beyond broad demographic markers and examine systematically the psychological and social pathways linking acculturation to alcohol use. We advocate for the adoption of context-specific measures, daily life study methods to capture acculturation’s dynamic effects on drinking, and research across diverse global populations. We call for the field to integrate the acculturation framework into the broader alcohol research and mainstream interventions to address individual and cultural variations in drinking behaviors, incorporate sociocultural influences into existing models of alcohol use to bridge gaps in generalizability, and enhance intervention effectiveness.",

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

Recovery narratives (RNs) could foster connectedness, hope, and guidance when they feature certain active ingredients, identified in previous research. However, interventions offering RNs including these active ingredients are lacking.\n\nAims\nThis study aimed to develop and implement an RN-based intervention to enhance personal recovery among adults in specialist mental health services. A secondary aim was to identify potential outcomes for a pilot randomized controlled trial.\n\nMethods\nFollowing Bartholomew’s Intervention Mapping protocol, we conducted a literature review and four stakeholder focus groups to explore needs and inform intervention design.\nResults\nThe digital module STORY MINE was developed and integrated into the online client portal ‘Minddistrict’ at a major Dutch mental health facility. It offers twelve hopeful RNs in three modalities: video podcast, audio, and text. Hypothesized outcomes include improved mental health confidence (primary outcome) and enhanced hope, reduced self-stigma, and better personal recovery (secondary outcomes). \n\nConclusion\nOur study pioneers a targeted, evidence-based approach by purposively collecting recovery narratives that include identified active ingredients to develop a RN based intervention called STORY MINE.

          "authors": "Aleksandra Lazić; Iris Zezelj",
          "abstract": "The proportion of the population who are vaccinated against an infectious disease is significant – not only because vaccination keeps the virus from spreading, but also because learning about how many members of one’s community have decided to get vaccinated has been shown to affect individual vaccination intention. In three preregistered online experiments featuring country-level vaccination rates against a hypothetical disease, we tested two theoretical approaches which offer contrasting predictions on how public health messaging should leverage vaccination rates. If selfish rationality is assumed, a high uptake would tempt people to free-ride on herd immunity (so low uptake should be emphasized); conversely, if vaccination rates exert a descriptive normative influence, a high uptake would signal that vaccination is the best choice, and vice versa (so high uptake should be emphasized). In the pilot (N = 75) and Experiment 1 (N = 174), communicating a high (90%) vaccination rate (vs. 10% vs. no rate) increased vaccination intentions, with no detectable effect of a low vaccination rate. In Experiment 2 (N = 217), decisions to get vaccinated were frequently justified based on reasons involving self-protection, but also the protection of others and the collective, irrespective of the vaccination rate level (20% vs. 80%); participants, on the other hand, rarely endorsed any of the tested reasons for non-vaccination, including free-riding; furthermore, descriptive norms were perceived as more relevant for vaccination than non-vaccination decisions. Experiment 3 (N = 1,060) tested the effectiveness of different messages when the majority have been vaccinated (60%) but the coverage is still not optimal. Alongside a weak descriptive norm, the self-benefit message worked better than other- and collective-benefit messages. We argue that public health messaging should incorporate both theoretical approaches, closer to the notion of reasonableness (rather than pure rationality or normativity), which is context-sensitive and pragmatic.",

          "abstract": "The \"shape bias\"—the tendency to generalize new nouns by their shape rather than features like color or texture—is considered a cornerstone of early noun learning. However, the magnitude, development, and cross-cultural generality of this bias remain debated. We conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis and meta-regression of 71 studies to synthesize the evidence base. Our analysis revealed a robust overall effect, confirming the existence of a shape bias. However, this effect was characterized by extreme between-study heterogeneity (I² = 0.95). Critically, meta-regression analyses failed to support hypothesized developmental changes, with a constant model across ages providing the most parsimonious fit. The literature is overwhelmingly dominated by studies of English-speaking children, preventing meaningful tests of cross-linguistic or cross-cultural variation. We also found strong statistical evidence of publication bias, suggesting that the true effect size could be inflated in the published literature. Together, these findings indicate that procedural variation, besides a potential publication bias, more than currently testable theoretical moderators, account for the variability in the literature, severely limiting the ability to distinguish between theories of the shape bias's origins.",

However, the relationship between these constructs is debated: does essentialism cause pro-LGB attitudes, or is it motivated by preexisting pro-LGB attitudes? In an experimental test of the motivated model, we presented participants across three studies (N = 750) with a passage either promoting or critiquing “born this way” narratives. Those in the “Born this way”-critical conditions demonstrated significantly less sexual orientation essentialism than those in the “Born this way”-supportive conditions, with condition effects particularly strong among liberals. Crucially, effects on essentialism were similar regardless of whether the critique was grounded in epistemic reasons (i.e., “born this way” is inaccurate) or moral motivations (i.e., “born this way” is harmful). There were no condition differences in pro-LGB attitudes. Thus, we find support for the motivated model: moral arguments alone can prompt the strategic attenuation of essentialism.",

          "abstract": "The sunk cost effect (SCE)—the tendency to persist in a failing course of action due to prior investments—has been well-documented in survey research, but behavioral evidence remains limited and inconsistent. Moreover, while recent studies suggest that people may also escalate commitment based on others’ prior investments, the so-called interpersonal sunk cost effect has yet to be tested behaviorally. To address these gaps, we developed a novel, fully controlled task and conducted two pre-registered experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to persist after personally investing effort, even under waste-free conditions. In Experiment 2, participants showed increased persistence when a partner had invested effort, providing the first behavioral evidence of the interpersonal SCE. Additionally, we observed an unpredicted main effect of social observation: participants were more likely to persist when they believed their decisions were visible to their partner, suggesting that reputational concerns may independently shape persistence behavior. Together, these findings challenge traditional self-justification and waste-aversion accounts and point instead to broader social and normative influences, including the role of commitment and public accountability in sunk cost sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

Two exceptions to this rule have found evidence for greater lure variability: a short-term memory task (Yotsumoto et al., 2008) and in an eyewitness memory paradigm (Wixted et al., 2018). In the present work, we conducted a series of recognition memory experiments using different stimulus (faces vs. words) along with different paradigms (long-term vs. short-term paradigms) to evaluate whether either of these conditions would result in greater variability in lure items. Greater target variability was observed across stimulus types and memory paradigms. This suggests that factors other than stimuli and retention interval might be responsible for cases where variability is less for targets than lures.",

This large, multi-site replication showed no evidence to support the hypothesis that hypothetical pro-environmental behavior can be stimulated by having participants read a story designed to prime status motives. We performed several exploratory analyses to investigate whether extension variables (i.e., equating “green” choices with prosocial behavior, political beliefs, sampling methods, location, duration of data collection, and gender) moderated the hypothesized effect of status motives on pro-environmental choices, but these analyses produced null results. One limitation of the study is that most data collection sites did not include a manipulation check, and the one site that did found a much weaker effect (d = 0.32) than the extremely large effect originally reported (d = 3.78). As a result, it remains unclear whether the null result reflects a failure of this specific priming method or a challenge to the underlying theory.

          "abstract": "In recent decades, a range of competing theories have been offered to explain why individuals sometimes persist in, or escalate commitment to, a suboptimal course of action because of prior investments of money, effort or other resources – i.e., the sunk cost effect. In evaluating these theories, it is important to identify scenarios in which they generate divergent predictions. We carried out 4 pre-registered experiments (N = 1,481) implementing two such types of scenarios: (1) waste-free scenarios, in which the resource is not lost but can be repurposed to a new goal; and (2) interpersonal scenarios, in which the decision-maker is not the individual who made the prior investment. Experiment 1 demonstrates that another individual’s non-wasted effort significantly increases escalation of commitment. Experiment 2 shows that the other individual’s prior effort can boost escalation of commitment even more than one’s own. Experiment 3 provides evidence that the effect of others’ prior investments may be driven by social expectations.  Experiment 4 replicates the effect of another individual’s prior investment while yielding no evidence that it  makes any difference whether the initial decision was made jointly or by the other individual alone. Taken together, our findings challenge theories focused on waste aversion and self-justification, and highlight the complexity of ways in which social context shapes sunk cost reasoning.",

Results showed that greater peer victimization history related to increased SS, NA, and NA persistence (i.e., higher inertia).

Later, participants recalled these events while viewing either a first- or third-person photo and rated and described their memory. While first-person photos promoted more field-perspective recall regardless of dysphoria level, dysphoria was still associated with greater observer recall, reduced mental imagery, and lower internal episodic detail. Additionally, dysphoria predicted less focus on the meaning of pictured events in general, and lower positive and higher negative emotional impact of recalling the events in the presence of first-person photo cues. Thus, while photo cues can shift memory vantage point, but emotional engagement remains constrained by mood-related biases.",

Across two experiments (N = 100 each), participants first decided the level of cognitive conflict they wanted to experience and then reported their affective state. In both experiments, participants showed a preference for a high level of cognitive conflict, evaluated it as effortful yet enjoyable and linked it to positive emotions. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive conflict, not effort, is valued and functions as an intrinsic reward, challenging the neuroeconomic approach to cognitive control theories toward a hedonic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Recovery narratives (RNs) could potentially be beneficial for service users, leading to hope and a sense of recognition. It remains understudied how to adequately implement these in mental health treatment. To gather input for the development of a RN intervention, we organized focus groups (FGs) with SMI service users (n=6), autism service users (n=3), peer support workers (n=4) and other health care professionals (n=4). The audio recorded sessions followed a semi-structured interview format addressing nine topics, including the potential of RNs as an intervention, platform to offer RNs and considerations regarding sharing your own RN. Consensus of the thematic analysis of the transcripts was finalized after a member check. Analysis of the nine interview topics resulted into six major themes: 1) Potential positive vs. negative effects; 2) Narrative content and modality; 3) Public availability vs. anonymity; 4) Freedom vs. structure; 5) Platform structuring; and 6) Contact options and emotional support. Member checking confirmed credibility of the findings. Developing a structured yet tailored RN intervention as part of mental healthcare treatment seems promising. Several important considerations need to be taken into account, such as practical and hopeful RN content, to increase the potential for recovery promoting effects.",

          "abstract": "This study examined variants of psychopathic personality in adolescents based on the combination of callousness (CU) and negative affect (NA). A total of 902 school-attending adolescents participated (52.2% girls; age range: 12–19 years, M = 14.89, SD = 1.67), assessed at two time points with a one-year interval using a longitudinal design. Profiles were identified through Latent Profile Analysis based on the callousness subscale of the Inventory of Callous–Unemotional Traits (ICU) and the negative affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Additional variables were assessed through self-reports measuring personality traits, attachment styles, behavioral maladjustment, socioemotional well-being, and risk behaviors. The analysis identified five distinct profiles, including one with high CU and low NA (primary variant) and two emotionally dysregulated profiles (secondary variants): one predominantly high in CU, the other in NA. Profiles showed differences across multiple constructs at baseline and one year later, with secondary variants exhibiting greater emotional, social, and behavioral maladjustment. The findings provide empirical support for the distinction between primary and secondary variants of youth psychopathy and contribute to understanding its heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Accurate numerical estimation underlies many aspects of cognition, from basic quantity judgments to complex decision-making. One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

How do researchers draw valid causal conclusions about naturally occurring experiences of ostracism without relying on experimental designs?

Using an intuitive example, we illustrate what a causal estimand is, how to define it, and why it matters. With this article, we encourage readers to think clearly about causal estimands before conducting any data analysis.

          "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by imbalances in homeostatic processes as reflected in altered neural function at rest. Within the insular cortex, distinct subregions have been associated with predictive or evaluative coding of homeostatic states. However, it is still elusive if functional segregation of insular subregions is impaired in MDD.\n\nTo test for loss of specificity within functional connectivity (FC) profiles of insular subregions in MDD, we measured resting-state fMRI in 433 patients with MDD and 417 healthy control participants (HCP) and compared the similarity (Pearson correlation) and density (shift function) between 6 subregional FC profiles for MDD and HCP. To evaluate the clinical utility of similarity of FC profiles, we tested whether MDD can be classified on an individual level.\n\nWe found greater similarity between FC profiles of insular subregions in MDD compared to HCP which was driven by a decrease in similarity and a greater FC density within the anterior insular cortex (AIC). On the individual level, insular FC profiles significantly predicted MDD, but the accuracy scaled with symptom severity.\n\nLoss of functional segregation and a greater FC density within the AIC may indicate alterations in interoceptive signals at rest in MDD. The increase in predictive power with increasing symptom severity substantiates insular functional segregation as an index of pathophysiology and supports a model in which prolonged deviations from homeostasis might drive individuals into an energy-deficient state that characterizes depression.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

Although the goal of such a procedure is to promote these peoples’ insight in their moment-to-moment experiences, the extent to which they gain insight from their personalized feedback has not yet been quantified. In this study, we quantified whether participants (N = 100) gained insight from their personalized feedback in a pre-post- design. We provided participants with a novel type of feedback about frequency distributions of their affective experiences as captured by EMA data. We compared this feedback to frequency distributions that participants estimated of all their affective experiences, both before before and after seeing their feedback. We found that participants’ initial estimates were often close to their personalized feedback. However, there were large interindividual differences in this difference score, as well as the extent to which participants changed their initial estimate in response to the personalized feedback. Overall, participants changed their estimates such that the means and standard deviations of the distributions were closer to those of their feedback. However, the means and standard deviations of participant’s estimated distributions - both before and after receiving feedback - were usually higher than those of the respective feedback. These latter findings can either be interpreted as a persistent retrospective bias towards salient experiences, or a shortcoming of EMA data to capture salient experiences.",

          "abstract": "The persuasive power of social media influencers has been well-demonstrated in the context of commercial goals, but whether influencers can be successfully employed for health messages and in particular fear appeals remain unclear. The current research explores two factors that may enhance the effectiveness of persuasive health messages using influencers: whether media users have a pre-existing bond, i.e., parasocial relationship (PSR) with the influencer, and whether the influencer directly addresses the user on a verbal and bodily level. In two online experiments, female social media users (18-30 y/o) were exposed to a set of fictional Instagram posts on eating disorder prevention. Study 1 (N = 233) employed a 2 (pre-existing PSR: yes vs. no) x 2 (verbal addressing: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. Study 2 (N = 225) used a 2 (verbal addressing: yes vs. no) x 2 (bodily addressing: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. The results showed that messages conveyed by an influencer with whom media users had a pre-existing (vs. no) parasocial relationship elicited higher parasocial interaction (PSI), which was in turn associated with an increase in message-supporting thoughts and subsequently behavioral intentions (assessed immediately) and actual behavior (assessed one week after message reception). No significant effects of verbal and bodily addressing were found. Employing influencers for eating disorder prevention seems most effective when individuals have a parasocial friendship with the influencer. Future research should explore if and how direct addressing can be effectively applied in social media health campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cardiac anxiety (CA) is a commonly occurring condition in populations with both cardiac and mental health conditions. It is assessed using the CA questionnaire (CAQ), which has been translated to several languages and its validity and reliability has been investigated using classical test theory. The factor structure of the CAQ remains uncertain, and no study has investigated the psychometric properties of the CAQ using modern test theory approaches. The aim of this study was to use Rasch analysis to test the validity and reliability of the original 18-item CAQ in a Swedish sample of patients with myocardial infarction, as well as other scales, based on previous findings.\nMethods: Participants were 754 patients after myocardial infarction with preserved cardiac function. Data were fitted to the Rasch model, investigating dimensionality, ordering of response categories, invariance, targeting and measurement uncertainty. Additionally, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using a weighted least mean squares estimator and dynamic fit indices.\nResults: All three subscales indicated problems with dimensionality and several items had disordered response categories, and with some of them minimal distance between steps. Many items displayed local dependency. There were also small problems with differential item functioning. Person locations were lower than the item threshold locations, but there were no significant floor or ceiling effects. The CFA also demonstrated a poor model fit of the three subscales in the 18-item version of the CAQ. An iterative removal of items resulted in a modified 10-item version still with questionable poor reliability.\nConclusions: The original 18-item version of the CAQ did not fit the Rasch model. The major problems with the 18-item version were dimensionality, local dependency, and disordered response categories. No other version of the CAQ achieved acceptable fit to the Rasch model. These results indicate that the CAQ is lacking in terms of reliability and a revision of the scale is called for.",

          "abstract": "Deliberative, effortful thinking supports better reasoning about science, politics, and everyday problems, but what drives its engagement remains unclear. One possibility is that low confidence acts as a trigger for deliberation. Across four preregistered experiments (N ≈ 1,200), we provide a causal test of this hypothesis. Participants received manipulated feedback about their performance on classic reasoning problems (bat-and-ball or base-rate tasks) presented in standard, single response formats (Studies 1-2) or two-response formats in which participants give both a timed and an untimed response for each problem (Studies 3-4). In the single-response studies, negative feedback reliably reduced confidence and increased response times compared to control and positive feedback. In the two-response studies, negative feedback again reduced confidence and lengthened response times. Critically, it also increased the likelihood of revising initial answers and prolonged second-stage response times—hallmarks of deliberation. Moreover, feedback-affected confidence, measured immediately after initial, timed responses and before deliberation was possible, predicted both revisions and extended second-stage processing. Together, these findings offer robust causal evidence that confidence regulates the deployment of deliberative reasoning and clarify what makes us “think it through”.",

The current study aimed to examine the structure and composition of the healthcare network of individuals with CP and their association with treatment satisfaction, well-being (depression, anxiety, anger, social isolation), and functioning (pain interference). Key network characteristics of interest were healthcare network density, the centrality of the general practitioner in the network, and healthcare discipline heterogeneity. \nMethods\nA four-wave online questionnaire was completed by 232 individuals with CP (179 women, mean age of 49 years). \nResults\nAnalyses of 2,745 healthcare relations showed a robust association between network density and perceived treatment satisfaction; however, no significant associations were observed with depression, anxiety, anger, pain interference, and social isolation. Additionally, the findings showed that participants who perceived more communication between their GP and other healthcare providers also reported greater treatment satisfaction; but there was no association with well-being or functioning. Contrary to expectations, while the number of different healthcare disciplines was not related to depression, anger, or pain interference, it was positively associated with anxiety and social isolation. \nDiscussion\nThese findings highlight the complexity of healthcare networks in CP management and suggest that examining healthcare networks from a structural perspective may offer valuable insights for future research, clinical practice, and policy development.",

Associations between suicidality (presence and severity) and risk factors—gender, age, PTSD, disorders of self-organization (DSO), depression, insecure asylum status, flight duration, postmigration living difficulties (PMLD)—as well as the protective factor religiosity were examined via univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: SBD prevalence was 14.41% (n = 15). DSO and an insecure asylum status were associated with the presence of suicidality in univariate and multivariate analyses and with the severity of suicidality in multivariate analyses. Sexual trauma frequency was associated with the presence of suicidality, while PTSD severity and lower religiosity were linked to greater suicidality severity. Depressive symptoms were associated with suicidality only in univariate analyses.\nConclusion: Suicidality should be systematically assessed in treatment-seeking refugees, particularly those with DSO or an insecure asylum status.

This review examines the effects of contingent feedback on human vocal development using reinforcement learning frameworks, based on an analysis of 70 empirical studies. A literature search using the terms \"vocal learning,\" \"vocal reinforcement,\" and \"vocal contingency\" identified three study categories: contingent imitation effects (12 studies), other contingent feedback effects (33 studies), and additional contingent feedback effects (21 studies). Analysis using the antecedent-behavior-consequence framework revealed that contingent responses increase vocal production rates and modify vocal quality, with contingent imitation being especially effective. Three effects accompany the increase in target behavior, including phonological change, collateral increase, and preparatory learning. Evidence also demonstrates other effects of contingent feedback, such as enhanced object recognition learning and longitudinal language development outcomes. In sum, empirical studies show that contingent feedbacks on human vocal behavior have reinforcement effects, a positive correlation with vocalization rate, and longitudinal effects on development. Thus, vocal learning is not merely imitative or developmental, but also shaped by structured environmental feedback.",

In this Perspective, we synthesize genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural, and clinical research on illbeing and wellbeing. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and similar biological underpinnings for illbeing and wellbeing. In contrast, environmental factors and societal changes often exert divergent influences.

          "abstract": "A growing body of research has investigated the emergence and developmental trajectory of children’s information search abilities. In this paper, we examine the capacity of 2- to 4-year-olds to identify and select the most informative cue among several options when searching for a hidden reward—a common task in decision-making research where young children have traditionally struggled. Across two experiments—including a preregistered replication—we tested 111 children (56 female) aged 24 to 59 months using a simplified version of Lindow’s (2021) finding-presents game. Children were presented with three cue cards (e.g., color, shape, icon) to determine which box contained a hidden present. Because only one feature differentiated the target box (for example, all boxes were blue and had a sticker on top, but varied in shape), only one cue card provided informative guidance. The children’s choices of cue cards served as the primary dependent measure. In Experiment 1, children aged 2 to 4 selected the relevant cue card at rates significantly above chance. Experiment 2 focused specifically on 2-year-olds and demonstrated that their choices were not driven by a saliency heuristic. Together, these findings reveal the early emergence of pre-decisional information search abilities in preschoolers and introduce a straightforward, effective paradigm for assessing early information-seeking skills.",

          "authors": "MohammadHossein Manuel Haqiqatkhah; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Facilitation in word processing, identified as faster responses to semantically related words, has traditionally been viewed as evidence of the core cognitive mechanisms that support language processing. However, it remains uncertain whether this facilitation arises from bottom-up spreading activation, top-down prediction, or a combination of both. To address this, we developed a novel semantic priming paradigm that systematically manipulates local contextual buildup and applied drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to differentiate the decision dynamics associated with each mechanism. In our experiment, 20 participants performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one (short condition) or three (long condition) semantically related primes. We found that, as the local semantic context became more enriched (short vs. long condition), participants adjusted their decision strategies, engaging different processing mechanisms. In the short condition, participants relied on spreading activation, as indicated by increased drift rate (faster evidence accumulation), suggesting that a single related prime pre-activated the target's mental representation. In contrast, in the long condition, reduced boundary separation (participants required less evidence before responding) implied greater confidence driven by enhanced predictability from multiple primes, consistent with the predictive processing account. Together, our findings offer new insights into theoretical models of language processing; demonstrate the practical relevance of DDM in language processing and offer potential implications for translational research.",

          "authors": "Giuseppe Riva",
          "abstract": "Contemporary human-AI interaction research currently faces a significant limitation: existing frameworks are inadequate to explain how artificial intelligence systems fundamentally reshape human cognition before conscious awareness occurs. This preprocessing influence, which operates beneath the threshold of deliberate thought, represents a crucial missing layer in the understanding of distributed cognition. This paper introduces \"Cognitive Infrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\". Cognitive infrastructures – e.g., search engines, recommender systems, algorithmic curation platforms, and large language models - exhibit classic infrastructural properties: they are invisible in normal operation, becoming visible only upon breakdown; they are embedded in social and technical arrangements; they are learned as part of membership in digital communities; they link with conventions of practice; and they embody standards that shape what counts as appropriate, relevant, or true. Yet cognitive infrastructures possess distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from traditional infrastructures. Unlike physical infrastructures that passively transport matter or energy, cognitive infrastructures have agency, filtering and curating individuals’ perception of reality before it reaches human consciousness.  Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: “infrastructure breakdown methodologies”, experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.",

          "abstract": "Truly understanding the position of ideological opponents is challenging, yet crucial if our goals are to avoid escalation or further polarisation, identify areas of agreement, and ultimately reduce misunderstanding. We operationalise the idea of an ‘Ideological Turing Test’, as a behavioural measure of the extent to which people are able to accurately represent the position of their ideological opponents. The original ‘Turing Test’ challenged any artificial intelligence to successfully mimic human dialogue- the test would be passed if a human was convinced that the machine was a human. The Ideological Turing Test has been proposed (Caplan 2011 Econlib) as a requirement for would-be human debaters - can they successfully mimic their ideological opponent’s arguments to the extent that their opponent endorses the argument as strongly as their own? Crucially, this ‘Test’ offers a behavioural measure of open mindedness which goes beyond self-report measures. It is not possible to pass an Ideological Turing Test by believing you understand the other’s perspective - you must articulate those arguments to the satisfaction of those who hold them.  In this study, we operationalise the Ideological Turing Test by recruiting participants from opposite sides of commonly polarising debates (Covid-19 Vaccines, Brexit, Veganism), and asking them to provide reasons both for and against their position. These reasons were rated by participants from the opposite side of the debate. Our criteria for “passing” the Ideological Turing Test is if an argument is agreed with by opponents to the same extent or higher than arguments made by proponents. We found no difference in minority or majority positions in their ability to pass the Ideological Turing Test (i.e. no difference in passing rate between those who are for or against Covid-19 vaccines). However we did find that those who pass the Ideological Turing Test are less judgemental towards their opponents, in that they are less likely to rate them as ignorant, immoral or irrational. The Ideological Turing Test not only provides a  behavioural measure of open-mindedness, it also provides insights into the scope and diversity of arguments within and between polarising topics.",

          "abstract": "Although item memory (e.g., remembering seeing your sunglasses) and source memory (e.g., remembering seeing them on the top shelf) have been dissociated both behaviorally and neurologically, little is known about dissociations in their forgetting patterns. A neuropsychological theory of forgetting (Hardt et al., 2013) predicts dissociated forgetting patterns depending on whether a memory is represented in the hippocampus or not. Extra-hippocampally represented memories, such as item memory, should be particularly susceptible to short-term, primarily interference-based forgetting. Hippocampus-dependent source memory should be protected from short-term forgetting but prone to long-term, primarily decay-based forgetting. We tested these predictions in three experiments (Ns = 164 to 210) in which participants studied object pictures in different screen locations. Item (object) and source (location) memory were tested at different retention intervals manipulated between subjects: immediately, after a short period (~10 min) of (similar or dissimilar) mental activity or intended low activity (audio-guided breathing exercise; wakeful rest), or on the next day. Across all experiments, there was no forgetting in source memory over any of the short retention intervals, whereas item memory significantly declined across most of them. There was substantial forgetting over 24 hours in both item and source memory, with more long-term forgetting in source memory after accounting for the short-term forgetting in item memory. Thus, forgetting patterns are dissociated between item versus source memory, in line with the predictions by Hardt et al. Some questions remain regarding the role of similarity-based interference in the observed short-term forgetting in visual item recognition.",

Differential accuracy has been shown due to race, age and gender, raising important questions about the impact of facial recognition decisions on the fairness of society. Current methods for measuring bias require curating large databases of face images, which is labor-intensive, producing bespoke tests that cannot be easily shared or standardized due to data privacy. Here we develop a novel solution to this problem inspired by psychological research in face perception. We ask whether face averages can be used to predict face recognition accuracy differentials for DNNs and humans. We generate sets of average images from random samples of exemplar faces from a demographic group to measure the density of these sets in representational space. We find that this approach provides reliable predictions of differential accuracy across demographic groups in both DNNs and human participants. However, we also find evidence that face averages were not represented in the center of face categories. This finding should be addressed in future development of our approach, and also challenges influential cognitive models of face identity representation.",

In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model posits that modifiable identity-related characteristics shape depression risk, with a vitalized identity—marked by an inclusive self-concept, intrinsic valuing of living beings, and universal compassion—protective against depression. This study examined the association between identity state and depression across Black and White women and men.\nMethods: Data came from 2,008 Black and White adults aged 35–65 in the 2025 Healthy Aging with Resilient Identities study. Stratified ordinal logistic regression models generated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for race-gender–specific predictors of depression.\nResults: Severe depression prevalence was highest among White men (9.3%), followed by White women (6.0%), Black women (3.8%), and Black men (3.2%). Higher IVP Scale (IVPS) scores—indicating greater identity vitality—were associated with lower odds of worse depression in all groups except White men. Compared to those with the lowest (Q1) IVPS scores, those in the highest (Q4) had 70% lower odds among Black women (aOR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) and Black men (aOR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.8), and 90% lower odds among White women (aOR=0.1, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.3), but little difference among White men (aOR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5).\nConclusions: Findings suggest vitalized identity may reduce depression risk but also highlight the need for interventions attuned to the distinct racialized and gendered contexts shaping health.",

This quantitative cross-sectional study was an examination in to the effects of ACEs on adult morality and proposed affective personality traits and caregiving factors as possible mediating mechanisms. The researcher administered a comprehensive online survey to a global sample of N = 376 English-speaking adults, comprised of four validated survey measures that assessed both retrospective and present experiences, traits, and character styles. The survey assessed ACE exposure (10-item ACE-Q), species-typical caregiving practices (EDNH), the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS), and the 20-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-20), an assessment of moral intuitions derived from Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). The researcher designed the study to test the trauma/Thriving-Emotions-Morality (tTEM) framework, which posits that emotions are primary in moral beliefs and are cultivated through childhood relationships. Results from group comparisons between high-ACE (≥4) and low-ACE (≤ 3) participants indicated small but significant differences, with high-ACE participants tending toward higher Individualizing and lower Binding moral foundations scores compared to low-ACE participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated a mediated link between ACEs and MFT, where positive personality traits and heightened EDNH scores positively predicted both Binding and Individualizing moral foundations. These results suggest that early nurturance promotes positive emotional development, shaping moral proclivities. Such research is instructive for clinicians, educators, and policymakers alike, informing existing practices and promoting the future development of enrichment programs that support positive childhood experiences and later moral development.",

This trait-based account has shaped the dominant scientific consensus for decades, largely displacing the MBTI’s roots in Jung’s model of psychological functions. This paper offers a critical re-evaluation of that reinterpretation, demonstrating through subsequent empirical data—especially Furnham et al. (2003)—that key predictions of the 1989 model, including the “Unity hypothesis,” are not supported. Methodological oversights, such as the neglect of multivariate typological interactions, further weaken the trait-only account.\nIn response, the paper introduces the Systemic Functional (SF) Model—a polarity-based framework grounded in Jungian theory and modern typological scholarship. It interprets MBTI preferences not as isolated traits, but as indicators of an underlying systemic configuration of interacting psychological functions arranged in a coherent hierarchy. Drawing on published correlational data, the paper shows that the SF Model predicts a distinct, theoretically ordered pattern of FFM Conscientiousness across all 16 types, offering a more nuanced and empirically supported account than the simpler FFM reinterpretation.\nThe SF Model directly addresses the criteria proposed by Costa and McCrae for typological validity—demonstrating qualitative differences, functional hierarchy, and systemic interaction effects. It thereby challenges the assumption that trait-based models are inherently superior, instead proposing a theoretically grounded, falsifiable, and integrative approach. By bridging trait theory (FFM), type indicators (MBTI), and dynamic functional structure (Jungian psychology), the SF Model invites a broader scientific dialogue and lays the foundation for renewed empirical engagement with the inner structure of the psyche.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of willful inattention and argues that it accounts for many behaviors that have previously been attributed to willful ignorance. Willful inattention arises when an individual avoids paying attention to something because they expect that focusing their attention on it will evoke negative emotions or diminish positive ones. Willful ignorance, in contrast, is motivated by a desire to remain uninformed so as to avoid an unwanted change in beliefs. We show that willful inattention plays a key role in a number of important policy problems, and we discuss strategies for mitigating its negative effects.",

          "abstract": "Identification with fictional characters is a common, meaningful experience that can influence self-concept. In this review of a wide-ranging body of literature, we identify three features of characters and stories that contribute to the likelihood that character identification will occur: narrative transportation, the character’s availability to the audience, and self-character similarity. We conclude that self-relevance is the underlying aspect of self-character interaction that can lead to self-concept change via identification. Further, we demonstrate that the features of fictional characters that contribute to identification are the same as or similar to psychological phenomena that influence identification and changes in self-concept in non-fictional contexts (i.e., with “real” people). Because connections with fiction provoke mental processes similar or identical to processes experienced in real life but expand the perspectives from which these processes are approached, we posit that identifying with imaginary people is an ideal opportunity for real self-change.",

          "abstract": "Disclaimer: This is a non-peer-reviewed version of an article submitted to the special issue: Advances in Digital Interventions and AI for Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing in Behaviour &amp; Information Technology\n\nIntroduction\nThis study investigates how technology can enhance access, address needs, and improve mental health outcomes for marginalised young people on the island of Ireland. While digital supports can reach underserved groups, uptake is limited when tools are not co-produced with youth. The research aimed to identify mental health challenges and needs, explore currently used digital resources, and generate policy and practice recommendations.\nMaterials and Methods\nUsing the Design Council’s co-production framework, creative workshops and interviews-involving photo-elicitation methods- were conducted. Young people aged 16–25 from marginalised backgrounds shared their experiences with mental health, their needs, and perspectives on digital resources. Visual content was either curated by the team through youth input or created by participants themselves to prompt discussion. Narratives accompanying these visuals formed the primary data and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults\nDigital tools and platforms were viewed as both supportive and potentially undermining mental health. Benefits included supporting positive mental health, moderated peer support, and advocacy opportunities; risks involved privacy concerns, misinformation, and the impersonal nature of AI. Participants highlighted the need for culturally sensitive, youth-driven, and equity-focused interventions that link online resources to offline care, address systemic social and economic barriers, and foster safe, inclusive communities.\nDiscussion\nTechnology can meaningfully support marginalised young people’s mental health when co-designed with diverse youth and embedded within an equity-oriented system. Policy and practice recommendations include embedding inclusive co-production; developing culturally competent, gender-responsive, and intersectional resources; integrating digital supports with offline services; enhancing digital safeguarding; strengthening peer and community-based platforms; and using technology to enable meaningful youth participation in policymaking. Scalable, rights-based digital supports—aligned with national strategies in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland—can help build a more responsive, equitable mental health system.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception. This may contribute to the misattribution of self-generated content as external, suggesting an additional element of predictive processing theories of hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "The study of aperiodic neural activity – reflecting patterns of non-frequency specific activity that are observed in electrical neural recordings such as M/EEG and intracranial LFP recordings – has recently rapidly expanded as a topic of study. While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably fractured and underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.",

Third-party judges (N=140) agreed that keeping money in economic\ntasks out of financial need was not selfish, and considered such tasks to be an\nunreasonable measure of altruism and selfishness. Further, third-parties believed it would\nbe unpleasant for crowdworkers to be solicited to donate.

In an online source-monitoring experiment, we used intentionally learned pictures as items and incidentally learned horizontal and vertical screen positions as context dimensions to compare context binding in source memory for retention intervals filled with natural night sleep versus daytime wakefulness. In line with the active systems consolidation hypothesis, multinomial modeling analyses revealed a significant sleep benefit in bound source memory for horizontal and vertical spatial locations of items. Hence, not only memory for item-context associations but also memory for context-attribute bindings benefits from sleep.",

This study investigates the psychological and behavioral reasons behind non-subscription behavior among social media users. Using a survey-based approach (N = 21), the research explores demographic patterns, daily digital engagement, and self-reported motivations for not subscribing. Findings reveal that while most respondents engage heavily with digital media (5–8 hours per day on average), they rarely commit to subscribing. Key deterrents include forgetting to subscribe, aversion to notifications, and perceiving little added value in following. These results highlight the \"passive consumer\" phenomenon, wherein audiences prefer low-friction access to content. Implications suggest that creators must reduce barriers to subscription and emphasize tangible benefits. Limitations of this exploratory study include its small sample size and reliance on self-reporting. Nevertheless, the study provides valuable insights into online engagement behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Rates of youth mental disorders vary across white, Black and Hispanic youths in the United States. The weak evidence for the generalizability of diagnostic tools significantly challenge the understanding of racial and ethnic differences in mental disorder risks. The Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) is a widely used diagnostic interview. However, its applicability across racial and ethnic groups is questionable. The current study tested the statistical generalizability, or measurement equivalence, of the K-SADS across Hispanic (n=2,015), non-Hispanic white (n=6,021) and non-Hispanic Black (n=1,420) youths, using data from the Adolescent and Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The sample was diverse in terms of child’s sex assigned at birth. Our results indicated that the K-SADS screening interview had a one-factor structure that was scalar equivalent. However, nearly 50% of its items functioned differently across groups, suggesting unequal probabilities of symptom endorsement at equivalent levels of mental disorder risks. Crucially, socioeconomic factors explained many of the measurement differences across groups, implicating their role in the validity of symptom reporting. Findings from this study can help develop clinical screening tools that are generalizable across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic factors, which is important for a contextualized understanding of racial and ethnic differences in youth mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "This narrative review examines the evolving role of representations—neural, mental and computational constructs that mediate perception, reasoning, and behavior—across the intertwined histories of cybernetics, cognitive sciences, and artificial intelligence. We begin by revisiting the rise and decline of cybernetics and its influence on the cognitive revolution, foregrounding how early debates over internal representations continue to shape current approaches. We then explore three frameworks that exemplify how representations function in scientific practice: cognitive maps in neuroscience, schemas in cognitive and clinical psychology, and object relations in psychodynamic theory. These traditions, though methodologically distinct, converge in treating representations as adaptive interfaces tailored to disciplinary goals rather than static mirrors of reality. Drawing on insights from computational psychiatry and neuroAI, we argue that scientific progress depends not on converging toward a single “correct” model of representation, but on developing representations that are flexible, context-sensitive, and reflexively engaged with their own assumptions. We caution against equating engineering performance with theoretical adequacy and highlight how historical cycles of scientific hype, from cybernetics to modern AI, can obscure valuable, if marginalized, contributions. By integrating perspectives across psychology, neuroscience, and AI, this review offers conceptual tools to support transdisciplinary dialogue and encourages researchers not to treat representation as a fixed ontology, but rather as a problem space requiring ongoing negotiation and pluralistic experimentation.",

Most often, psychological theories are expressed in verbal terms and then interpreted by researchers in their operationalization. In contrast, theories can also be expressed formally in mathematical or computational terms. However, translating verbal theories of dynamical systems into formal theories, especially those represented by differential equations (DEs), often requires knowledge of physics and mathematics beyond the standard training received by psychologists. In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for researchers who wish to build a formal theory expressed in DEs from a verbal theory. We use a running example to illustrate the various steps and end with a discussion on caveats of formalizing using DE models. Our roadmap aims at the phase of formal theory development and refinement, before a researcher collects their data.

          "authors": "Merrick Robinson Osborne; Jacob W. Roberson; Leigh Tost",
          "abstract": "In recent years, an increasingly common practice amongst organizations has been setting representation goals, or organizational mandates intended to increase the prevalence of underrepresented employees in visible work assignments. The work of meeting these goals often falls to managers, who must also weigh additional criteria – like the employees’ workloads or skillsets – in their task assignments. Typically, when faced with a task assignment decision, managers will refrain from assigning employees who are not available or who do not have the requisite skillset. However, leaning on Tetlock’s theory of value pluralism, we predict that these goals can lead managers to set aside traditional criteria of effective task assignment (specifically, underrepresented employees’ person-job fit and/or workloads) to prioritize achieving these organizational goals. In this way, underrepresented employees are more likely to be assigned to tasks that are sub-optimal for their occupational success (i.e., by being assigned to work that does not appropriately match their skillset or that leads them to be overworked). We examine these predictions in four studies (N = 2,598). We find that this decision-making is driven by managers’ increased diversity concerns (as a consequence of the representation goals), but can be mitigated by how the organization communicates those goals. We conclude by discussing both the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",

Memorability reflects an observer-independent, intrinsic property of an image, which can be predicted by computational models. While semantic content has been proposed as the critical determinant of memorability, it is challenging to disentangle image content from visual features on display. Here, we find that the memorability of scene images transfers to short textual descriptions of those scenes, whether generated by humans or multimodal large language models. Furthermore, new images produced with generative AI from descriptions alone reproduce the memorability of original images. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the memorability of scene images can be explained by their semantic content, regardless of visual features on display, and that language serves as an efficient and faithful compression of memory-relevant content.",

          "abstract": "Technological and scientific advances in neuroscience, information technology, and artificial intelligence have expanded how human and machine cognition can be targeted, manipulated, and weaponized. These developments have heightened the need for a coherent framework of Cognitive Security. Following review of current definitions, conceptualizations, and applications of Cognitive Security across military, academic, and organizational sectors, we propose a unifying definition of Cognitive Security as ‘the state of having trusted boundaries protecting cognitive assets against all forms of unauthorized influence or access’. Cognitive assets are defined broadly, encompassing individual cognitive processes, artificial intelligence systems, organizational decision-making structures, and neurobiological substrates. Drawing on this definition, we identify four interdependent cognitive resilience factors essential to maintaining Cognitive Security: (1) cognitive agility, the ability to adaptively manage biases, information processing, pursued goals, and decision processes; (2) machine psychology, safeguarding cognition-like functions in AI and ML systems; (3) neurosecurity, protecting human and non-human neural systems from biological or technological intrusion; and (4) systems engineering, the design of organizational and societal structures that foster resilience. We argue that effective Cognitive Security requires a holistic, multi-level approach that integrates these factors to defend against cognitive warfare, cyber-enabled influence operations, and emerging threats in human–machine ecosystems. By consolidating fragmented perspectives into a domain- and species-agnostic framework, this paper advances Cognitive Security as a distinct discipline and provides a foundation for research, policy, and practice aimed at strengthening resilience to ensure cognitive safety and superiority.",

Studies 2a (N = 1,506) and 2b (N = 1,255), conducted as one-week longitudinal studies during the 2024 European and French parliamentary elections, revealed that an information treatment emphasizing deservingness cues strongly reduced misperceptions about immigrants, modestly reduced opposition to immigration, and had an even smaller effect for anti-immigration voting.

          "abstract": "Activists are mobilizing worldwide to address the climate crisis. In the past years, climate movements have attracted many newcomers. Yet, even among motivated individuals who contacted a movement, becoming an actively engaged member remains rare. Previous studies have focused on non-engaged people’s intentions and barriers to joining or have surveyed long-term activists, yet little is known about newcomers. We studied how newcomers join different climate movements. In co-creation with activist organizers, we aimed to identify the phases of joining a climate movement and what facilitates and hinders engagement. We interviewed 23 individuals who had joined Extinction Rebellion (XR) United Kingdom, XR Netherlands, or the International Climate Students Movement. Five months later, the interviewees completed a short follow-up survey. Using inductive thematic analysis, we identified three phases associated with specific facilitators and barriers. The first phase was often initiated based on previous experience and a strong motivation to make a change. The second phase was marked by becoming active and socially integrated. In the final phase, activists transitioned from newcomers to active members. In the medium term, feeling effective and positive within the movement was associated with sustained engagement. Based on these findings, we recommend tailoring support for interested potential activists, newcomers, and experienced activists. Providing clear information, dedicated integrator roles, and emotional check-ins can help build broad, welcoming, and persistent activist movements. We suggest future longitudinal research starting from the moment of entry, as well as quasi-experiments testing socialization tactics.",

The aim of this study was to validate the Dutch translations of the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI-60) and its short form (MPFI-24) and to examine the prospective relation with mental health. A community sample of Dutch-speaking adults (N=832; mean age: 55(SD:13)) completed self-report measures on psychological flexibility and mental health. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor second-order model representing psychological flexibility and inflexibility, providing good fit for the full and short version. Internal consistency across all subscales of both instruments was good. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that psychological flexibility and inflexibility were prospectively associated with well-being and mental health complaints, respectively. However, when both constructs were included in the regression models, only psychological inflexibility emerged as a significant predictor of mental health complaints, including depression, anxiety and stress. This has important implications for future research. The findings also support the use of the Dutch MPFI as a valuable tool for assessing psychological flexibility and psychological inflexibility, with the shorter MPFI-24 offering a more practical and efficient alternative in both clinical practice and research.",

          "authors": "Özge Bakay; Faruk Akkus; Brian Dillon",
          "abstract": "Real-time sentence comprehension relies on memory resources to establish long-distance syntactic dependencies. There is convincing evidence that formation of many dependencies is mediated by hierarchical constraints. However, it remains an open question how richly hierarchical information is represented and employed in memory processes. Here we ask whether hierarchical relations between noun phrases in a sentence as in x c-commands y (Reinhart, 1976) constrain antecedent retrieval for a local anaphor. We measure the real-time reactivation of c-commanding target antecedents and distractors in processing the Turkish reciprocal birbirleri via three visual world studies. Unlike existing studies that confounded multiple cues, we disentangled c-command from other structural information (clause-mateness, case, subjecthood) and linear order/recency. Experiment 1 compared the availability of c-commanding subjects and non-c-commanding, clause-mate, similarly case-marked distractors; and showed that c-commanding subjects were rapidly distinguished from distractors within the reciprocal window, irrespective of their linear order. Experiment 2 revealed that immediate availability of c-commanding subjects extends to c-commanding indirect objects. Experiment 3 was a pre-registered, high-power replication that yielded similar results. We found limited evidence for interference from distractors, which was not replicated. Overall, we find that hierarchical, item-to-item relations between noun phrases rapidly determine antecedent availability in retrieval beyond other cues. We suggest that hierarchical information may guide access to c-commanding items during retrieval if item representations include hierarchically informed features targeted by retrieval cues; alternatively, hierarchical information may shape the organization of items in memory, with c-commanding items represented in a privileged store allowing direct access during retrieval.",

          "abstract": "Psychological flexibility, the capacity to remain open, present, and value-driven even in the face of distress, is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of mental health. The aim of this study was to validate the Dutch translations of the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI-60) and its short form (MPFI-24) and to examine the prospective relation with mental health. A community sample of Dutch-speaking adults (N=832; mean age: 55(SD:13)) completed self-report measures on psychological flexibility and mental health. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor second-order model representing psychological flexibility and inflexibility, providing good fit for the full and short version. Internal consistency across all subscales of both instruments was good. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that psychological flexibility and inflexibility were prospectively associated with well-being and mental health complaints, respectively. However, when both constructs were included in the regression models, only psychological inflexibility emerged as a significant predictor of mental health complaints, including depression, anxiety and stress. This has important implications for future research. The findings also support the use of the Dutch MPFI as a valuable tool for assessing psychological flexibility and psychological inflexibility, with the shorter MPFI-24 offering a more practical and efficient alternative in both clinical practice and research.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is a central focus of psychological science, yet most evidence comes from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) populations, limiting the generalizability of findings. Using the UK subsample (N = 5,221 across 42 regions) of two waves of the Global Flourishing Study (GFS), a large, culturally diverse longitudinal dataset, this study examined the stability of well-being (happiness, life satisfaction, and life worth), the moderating role of demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, income), and the contribution of regional context. Multilevel models with random intercepts for regions were used to account for geographic nesting. Across outcomes, well-being was highly stable over one year, with baseline scores explaining most of the variance, leaving limited room for moderation. Consequently, moderation effects of demographic variables were generally small. Significant interactions emerged in some cases, indicating subtle differential trajectories and consistent with expectations that these structural influences unfold gradually over longer periods. Regional variance was minimal, suggesting that most variation occurs within individuals rather than across regions. Sensitivity analyses and robustness checks confirm these findings. These findings illuminate the robustness of short-term well-being measures and highlight the challenges of detecting moderation over brief intervals. Importantly, the study demonstrates the value of large-scale, culturally diverse longitudinal data and we provide lessons learned and a few statistical addendum for those working with data such as the GFS.",

          "abstract": "Scientific communication faces a dual crisis: exponential publication growth overwhelms human readers while fragmented research practices prevent automated knowledge synthesis. This crisis is exacerbated by AI-assisted writing—producing papers faster than they can be consumed. Behavioral and social sciences, in particular, suffer from incomparable stimulus databases, jingle–jangle measurement fallacies, and demographic blindness that conceals effect heterogeneity. While AI tools support comprehension and summary assistance, they cannot aggregate findings from incommensurable studies and risk amplifying biases when trained on unstructured, unverified text. We propose restructuring scientific papers for dual audiences: front-loaded narratives for time-pressed human readers, paired with machine-readable appendices containing executable code, standardized metadata, and ontologically-mapped constructs. This transforms papers into queryable research environments where readers can directly interrogate data and rerun analyses. Structured appendices enable automated verification of statistical methods and AI-assisted peer review grounded in executable rather than narrative claims. These restructured papers become nodes in continuously updating evidence networks. Each publication automatically contributes effect sizes to real-time meta-analyses, with corrections and retractions propagating instantly through dependent analyses. Widespread adoption requires institutional recognition of structured documentation as essential scholarly output and computational infrastructure that serves both human comprehension and machine analysis.",

For example, droughts become more frequent and intense. Thus, the question arises, whether visible signs of climate change diminishes nature’s beneficial effects on humans. In an experimental online study, German participants (N = 239) experienced an audio-guided imagined walk either through intact nature, nature affected by a drought, or an indoor control condition. Results showed that the imagined walk through intact nature was more restorative than through the control environment. Most importantly, the walk through drought-affected nature led to less positive effects compared to intact nature—and was similar to the control condition. Signs of drought even led to higher negative affect compared to the control condition. However, neither current connectedness to nature nor predictors of climate action (i.e., environmental concern and pro-environmental behavioural intentions) were different between the experiences in intact and drought-affected nature. Overall, our study suggests that signs of drought diminish beneficial well-being effects of nature experiences, but do not affect actions leading to climate change mitigation.",

          "authors": "Joscha Dutli; Klaus Oberauer; Lea Maria Bartsch",
          "abstract": "The semantic elaboration effect refers to the finding that semantic processing of words leads to better memory performance when the words are semantically congruent with the orienting questions with which they are studied. In Experiment 1, we were unable to replicate the congruency effect that motivated the concept of elaboration. We ran 8 follow-up experiments (Exp. S1–S8) that partially resolved our failed replication attempt: We found robust congruency effects in recognition tests, but not in free recall. This result can be explained by the hypothesis that elaboration improves memory by establishing effective retrieval cues, and elaboration is effective only inasmuch as these retrieval cues are available at test. To investigate the retrieval-cue hypothesis further, we asked whether participants are able to freely recall the orienting questions as retrieval cues. Recall of these questions was poor, providing a potential explanation for absent congruency effects in free recall. We formalized the retrieval-cue hypothesis in a simple computational model, applied it to Experiments 1 and S1–S8, and found that the model can account for the congruency effects we observed. In Experiment 3, we directly tested the models’ prediction that the size of the congruency effect is determined by the probability of recalling the orienting questions as cues by letting one group of participants learn the orienting questions before the experiment. We found a larger congruency effect in this group compared to a control group that did not learn the orienting questions, further supporting the retrieval-cue hypothesis of elaboration.",

Many cases go undetected due to a lack of contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it: predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage, remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end, we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a meaningful addition to traditional methods.",

          "abstract": "While psychological science suffers from measurement proliferation and fragmentation (Anvari et al., 2025), some measures prosper: With over 3,000 citations since its publication approximately 20 years ago, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002) has become one of the most widely used measurement instruments of the behavioral and clinical sciences. Yet, despite its widespread adoption still little is known regarding the task’s psychometric properties in terms of meta-analytic evidence—which may be related to researcher degrees of freedom and flexibility during task implementation that hinder cumulative scientific progress. We thus conducted a robust Bayesian meta-analysis synthesizing 1,667 effect sizes from 220 studies comprising the data of 51,932 participants, to (i) take stock of the psychometric properties of the BART and (ii) quantify measurement flexibility and its impact on the task’s psychometric properties. Although the BART showed satisfactory levels of test–retest reliability (r = 0.54), there was low to no known–groups validity (d = 0.10), convergent validity with other risk-taking measures (r = 0.00), and external validity (r = 0.02). The task’s convergent validity with measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking (r = 0.07) and its divergent validity with measures of cognitive ability (r = 0.12) were also low. There was substantial variability in study characteristics that had an impact on the estimates of all psychometric properties. We make recommendations for future research on the BART and its use, and how psychological science more generally may profit from adopting similar approaches to become a more integrative and cumulative field.",

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable situations are often experienced as more challenging than those within our control. Recently, it has been proposed that threat (un)controllability also affects fear learning processes. Most studies compare two variants of threat control – lacking versus having control. However, losing control might cause more distress than lacking control and be clinically relevant. The current study investigated the impact of loss of control over threat on conditioned fear. We randomly assigned 80 participants to a Continuous Control (CC) or a Loss of Control (LC) group and administered a threat (un)controllability task integrated into a fear conditioning procedure. Participants were presented with two pictures, one of which was consistently paired with an electrical stimulus (US). Participants from the CC group could learn to terminate the US with a mouse click. Participants in the LC group could terminate the stimulus initially but then lost this possibility. During the extinction and renewal phases, the pictures were repeatedly presented without the US. A new background context was introduced in the renewal phase. US-expectancy ratings, skin-conductance responses, fear ratings, and control predictions were collected throughout the procedure. The LC group displayed higher cue-elicited fear and lower expected control than the CC group. A similar pattern persisted during the extinction and renewal phases (increased skin conductance responses and reduced expected control). A general sense of control and anhedonia partially moderated the relationship between threat (un)controllability and fear renewal. These findings present initial evidence for the impact of losing control over threat on fear formation and reduction.",

Most research also focused on clinical outcomes of body dissatisfaction rather than subclinical influences on quality of life. We examined the association between sexual attraction (i.e., attraction to men or women), body dissatisfaction and quality of life in cisgender men. We hypothesised that: 1) men attracted to men would report higher body dissatisfaction, 2) men attracted to men would report lower quality of life (i.e., psychological, physiological, social, and environmental), 3) body dissatisfaction would be negatively associated with quality of life, and finally 4) body dissatisfaction mediates the association between sexual attraction and quality of life. A cross-sectional study (86 men attracted to men and 87 men attracted to women) supported these hypotheses but showed that sexual attraction was only associated with psychological quality of life. While sexual attraction was only associated with psychological quality of life, there were indirect associations with all quality of life domains acting through body dissatisfaction. Our findings emphasise that men attracted to men are at greater risk of poor body image and that body dissatisfaction is a pervasive health problem, negatively influencing subclinical health and well-being in cisgender men. We also highlight how body dissatisfaction may be one psychological process negatively influencing the psychological quality of life in men attracted to men. More resources should be directed toward preventing body dissatisfaction, particularly in sexual minoritised men.",

Method:  Focus groups informed the initial development of the HIV Anxiety Scale (HAS), revised through expert feedback. The factor structure was assessed in two studies. In Study 1, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with 251 participants. In Study 2, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 200 participants was performed alongside validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance assessments. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 supported a 3-factor model, resulting in a 16-item measure with the following subscales: Psychosocial Implications of HIV, Lifestyle Implications of HIV, and HIV Testing Anxiety. The HAS demonstrated a good factor structure, acceptable validity and excellent internal consistency across diverse groups in Study 2. Conclusions: The HAS provides a contemporary, robust measure of HIV anxiety, addressing limitations of previous tools and contributing to efforts to identify and support populations at risk of HIV avoidance behaviours.",

Vision often plays a dominant role, calibrating and aligning signals from touch, proprioception, and interoception. Yet, individuals born without sight still construct coherent and functional body representations, suggesting that the role of vision in building these representations may be more flexible than previously thought. Here, we synthesize recent behavioral and neuroimaging findings on body representations in blind individuals. We argue that blindness offers a powerful case study in how body representations can emerge through non-visual pathways, revealing the brain’s capacity to flexibly reorganize the sensory inputs supporting its internal models of the body. In doing so, we highlight the broader relevance of visual loss for understanding the plastic and multisensory nature of body representation.",

          "abstract": "Emotion differentiation — the ability to precisely label emotions — reflects a nuanced understanding of one’s emotional experiences. Researchers posit this nuance may be associated with knowing how one can use their emotions. As a result, we hypothesize emotion differentiation may be linked with holding instrumental emotion regulation motives, which involve regulating emotions to attain their benefits beyond solely feeling better or worse. In this research, we tested whether trait emotion differentiation was associated with instrumental emotion regulation motives in daily life, (1) in general and (2) at times when people felt strong emotion. To test these links, we used two experience sampling datasets collected in 2020 in Australia (Study 1, N=173; 50.3% White), and in 2016 in Belgium (Study 2, N=104; 100% European). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no direct association between trait emotion differentiation and instrumental motive use. However, as hypothesized, in both studies, trait emotion differentiation moderated the relationship between emotion intensity and instrumental motives, though only in the case of negative — not positive — emotion. This interaction was such that those higher in trait emotion differentiation endorsed fewer instrumental motives when emotion was less intense, but more instrumental motives when emotion was more intense. This pattern suggests that people high in trait emotion differentiation may endorse instrumental motives flexibly, by regulating their emotions instrumentally when they are more intense, but not when they are less intense. Our findings support the idea that trait negative emotion differentiation may help individuals channel their intense emotions in useful ways.",

Our results show that a higher perception of risk of COVID-19 and lower trust in institutions' response to the pandemic were related to feelings of anxiety and lack of control. Feeling the lack of control, but not anxiety, independently predicted COVID-19 conspiracy theory endorsement. Importantly, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were strongly correlated with generic conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs, which were likewise associated with the feeling of lack of control and lower trust in institutions.

Our findings unveil both modality-independent and modality-dependent processes in the formation of memory traces. Indeed, we observed a contribution of both prior visual and linguistic knowledge regardless of the types of stimuli to be memorised. However, the extent of this contribution differed as a function of the modality tested: visual prior knowledge is more influential in image-based tasks, while linguistic prior knowledge dominates in word-based tasks. This dual and modality-dependent contribution underscores the adaptive nature of memory processes, revealing the dynamic integration of diverse experiential traces in false memory formation.",

Afterward, they rated their agreement with conspiracy explanations of the presented information and filled in measures of sociopolitical behavioural intentions, institutional trust and powerlessness. We also controlled for differences in Dark Tetrad, paranoia, conspiracy mentality and distress. We found no difference in conspiracy explanations between neutral and conspiracy conditions, suggesting that the topic of COVID-19 vaccines was highly saturated with conspiracy theories. Importantly, the anti-conspiracy intervention led to decreased conspiracy explanations irrespective of an individual’s conspiracy mentality. Although conspiracy explanations were correlated with reported sociopolitical behaviour and institutional distrust, we found no differences between the groups in these variables, highlighting the importance of further research on the effectiveness of interventions in this regard.",

Participants (N = 690) completed questionnaires on symbolic threat from the West and Russia, belief in pro-Kremlin conspiracy theories about the war in Ukraine as well as generic anti-West and anti-Russian conspiracy theories, and blame for the war in Ukraine. The sense of symbolic threat from the West and pro-Kremlin conspiracy beliefs predicted each other in time and were substantially associated with increased blaming of Ukraine and the United States for the war in Ukraine. Conversely, symbolic threat from Russia along with the rejection of pro-Kremlin conspiracy theories predicted increased blaming of Russia over time. Motivated reasoning analyses suggested that the ideological link between the symbolic threat from the West and belief in anti-West conspiracy theories was stronger than the one between symbolic threat from Russia and belief in anti-Russian conspiracy theories. This suggests an existence of self-reinforcing relationship between the deep-rooted sense of symbolic threat and anti-West conspiracy theories which is exploited by various political actors.",

Therefore, it is important to understand the reasoning processes – such as lower analytic thinking and susceptibility to cognitive biases – that might lead to the adoption of such beliefs. In two studies, I constructed and tested a novel questionnaire on epistemically suspect beliefs (Study 1, N = 263), and used it to examine probabilistic reasoning biases and belief bias in syllogistic reasoning as predictors of the endorsement of those beliefs, while accounting for analytic thinking and worldview variables (Study 2, N = 397). Probabilistic reasoning biases, analytic thinking, religious faith, and political liberalism consistently predicted various epistemically suspect beliefs, whereas the effect of syllogistic belief bias was largely restricted to pseudoscientific beliefs. Further research will be needed to examine the role the biased evaluation of evidence plays in the endorsement of epistemically suspect beliefs.",

To address this issue, we examined the effectiveness of AI-driven climate communication in influencing pro-environmental intentions and intentions to adapt to climate change (Study 1; laboratory setting, N = 178), as well as participants’ likelihood of engaging with the communication material in the first place (Study 2; online setting; N = 295). In Study 1, both AI-driven and textual climate communication formats increased pro-environmental and adaptation intentions from pre- to post-intervention. Importantly, the effectiveness of the different communication formats depended on audience characteristics: the textual communication was more effective for highly climate-curious participants, while the AI-driven communication was more effective for those with low curiosity. Study 2 further showed that AI-driven climate communication was perceived as more engaging than a comprehensive textual scientific climate report. This was particularly pronounced for participants with low climate change curiosity and threat beliefs. We conclude that more experiential communication formats like AI-driven climate communication may help engage and impact previously unengaged audiences.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated whether the Work Ability Index can predict return to work for individuals (N=213) with a compensable personal injury. A binomial logistic regression analysis found that the overall Work Ability Index score explained a significant portion of the variance in return-to-work outcomes (McFadden’s R2 = 0.516). A comparison of the median Work Ability Index scores for the working and non-working groups revealed a clear distinction: the median score was 27 for those who returned to work (on the border of poor and moderate work ability) and 12 for those who did not (clearly classified as poor work ability). The Work Ability Index showed predictive ability, as evidenced by an AUC of 0.94. Furthermore, an analysis of the 10 questions on the Work Ability Index showed significant differences between the two groups on all but one question. The best predictor was the individual's estimated work ability in two years' time (rank biserial = 0.851), while the number of current diseases or injuries was the worst predictor (rank biserial = 0.133). It was concluded that the Work Ability Index is a useful and effective tool for predicting return to work after a compensable injury",

However,\nin contrast to earlier studies and reviews, a Cochrane network meta-analysis from 2021 concluded\nthat the estimated efficacy of fluoxetine was no longer clinically meaningful.\nStudy aim: To explain the discrepant findings between the recent Cochrane review and earlier\nreviews and to explore if this was acknowledged in guidelines and treatment recommendations\nappearing since then.\nMethods: Meta-analytical aggregation of trial results over time, exploring potential biases, and a\nnon-systematic search for recent treatment guidelines/recommendations from major medical\norganizations.\nResults: The estimated efficacy of fluoxetine in clinical trials declined over time into the range of\nclinical equivalence with placebo when more recent studies were included in analyses and when\nconsidering common thresholds of clinical significance. This remains unacknowledged in treatment\nguidelines and related publications, including some that continue to recommend fluoxetine as first-\nline pharmacological treatment. Finally, we find that the loss of efficacy over time is likely\nexplained by biases such as the novelty bias or by variations of expectancy effects.\nConclusions: The seeming lack of clinically meaningful efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of\npediatric depression needs to be considered by those who develop treatment recommendations as\nwell as by patients and clinicians.

We test this prediction in a pre-registered experiment (N = 1,949 Americans) by leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) to engage in evidence-based back-and-forth dialogues. Participants allocated $1 between their favorite charity and a highly effective charity (the Against Malaria Foundation), before and after a conversation with an LLM advocating for the effective charity, a static LLM-generated persuasive message, or a control conversation. The LLM conversation\nsignificantly increased effective donations (45.9%), a significantly larger increase than the static message or control, as well as shifting moral attitudes.

          "abstract": "Emotional experiences during music listening are supported by dynamic interactions between perceptual, cognitive, and physiological processes, yet the extent to which bodily responses reflect or predict music-induced emotions remains an open question. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between music listening enjoyment and a variety of physiological responses, testing whether any subset of these measures can be used to predict music-induced emotions. We presented each participant with obscure instrumental music excerpts, recorded several physiological responses during music listening, and asked them to subjectively rate their experienced valence (positive to negative affect) and arousal (high to low energy). Using structural equation modeling, we found that high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), skin conductance levels (SCL), and respiration rate had small yet significant correlations with arousal, while HF HRV and the range of skin conductance responses (SCR) were correlated with valence. These findings indicate that physiological responses like SCR and respiration rate could potentially serve as an objective measure of music-induced emotions. Future researchers could expand upon these findings by investigating the influence of internal state and by exploring other physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG).",

However, based on media equation assumptions it can be hypothesized that social cues displayed by the system might instill more trust than is warranted. Against this background, the present study investigates in a 2x2 between subject design (N=617) whether the social cues \"typing behavior\" and \"personalized address\" used by ChatGPT increase perceived trust (benevolence, ability and integrity) in the system and whether this is mediated by perceived similarity and moderated by anthropomorphism inclination. The results show that the social cue \"typing behavior\" leads to a significant increase in trust in the dimension benevolence. Neither perceived similarity nor anthropomorphism inclination modulate this effect. However, as a side effect, the mediator perceived similarity was found to significantly predict trust in ChatGPT.",

          "abstract": "Effective goal-directed decision-making relies on both memory and planning–processes that are each known to decline with age. We tested the hypothesis that these declines stem from a common mechanism by focusing on mnemonic discrimination, a measure of memory precision that shows unique vulnerability to age-related decline. We used a latent learning task that measures the ability to learn and make judgments about multi-step associations among interconnected stimuli, assessing performance across the adult lifespan. In Experiment 1, we examined relationships between judgment performance and mnemonic discrimination ability. In Experiment 2, we tested whether a learning schedule designed to reduce memory interference (by temporally separating overlapping object pairs) could improve performance, particularly for individuals with weaker memory abilities. We also implemented an artificial neural network simulation varying training sequence and the network’s representational capacity to model performance. Across the lifespan, both young and older adults showed evidence of successful latent learning and inference, but variability in judgment performance was explained by mnemonic discrimination ability. In Experiment 2, mnemonic discrimination interacted with training condition: intermixed training benefited those with high memory precision, whereas blocked training benefited those with low memory precision. The neural network simulation reproduced these patterns. These findings suggest that age-related declines in complex judgments may stem from declines in mnemonic discrimination. Importantly, they demonstrate that individualized, memory-based training interventions can improve learning and reasoning processes that support goal-directed planning, offering a promising approach to preserve decision-making abilities across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Reported perception can exhibit a repulsive bias away from a task-irrelevant prior stimulus. Previous research has suggested that this repulsive serial bias is driven by low-level adaptation, such that the prior stimulus repels the representation of the new stimulus during encoding. To test this account, the present study compared the repulsive serial bias with another perceptual bias that is known to be driven by an adaptation mechanism (e.g., the tilt aftereffect). We measured the repulsive serial bias using a common location delayed estimation task and the adaptation-driven bias using a location estimation task with an inducer stimulus. We predicted that if the two types of biases were driven by common mechanisms, then they should be positively correlated. However, no such correlation was observed. In addition, we found that only the repulsive serial bias was associated with a response time effect, where responses were slower when the bias was stronger. Moreover, mouse-tracking data for the repulsive serial bias exhibited a pattern that started with a stronger repulsion and ended with smaller repulsion, which cannot be explained solely by an adaptation mechanism. Taken together, our findings suggest that repulsive serial bias in continuous estimation tasks involves post-perceptual decisional processes that are not present in the adaptation-driven bias.",

Despite its severity, a third of suicidal and self-harming adolescents recover before adulthood, highlighting the importance of identifying recovery factors for effective interventions. This scoping review was aimed to synthesize how recovery from suicidality is defined and experienced by young people aged 6 to 25, and to identify the psychosocial and contextual factors that facilitate or hinder recovery. We conducted a scoping review of 49 qualitative and quantitative studies involving 26,460 participants. Studies were identified in Medline, PsycInfo, SocINDEX, and CINAHL databases. Quality was assessed using CASP and QUIPS tools. We extracted recovery factors and categorized them into thirteen thematic domains, and  social support, coping skills, and personal acceptance were most endorsed. Recovery was described both as symptom remission and as a personal transformative process involving identity development, emotional regulation, and meaning-making. Recovery was shaped by both internal capacities and external support, including therapeutic relationships, peer connections, and access to identity-affirming or culturally responsive care. Youth emphasized the long-term, personal nature of recovery, extending beyond suicidality to include positive mental health, self-worth, and purpose. Recovery from youth suicidality is multidimensional, and shaped by developmental, relational, and sociocultural contexts. Effective prevention and intervention must go beyond risk reduction to foster protective and promotive factors that empower young people. These findings support the need for more holistic, person-centered approaches to youth mental health and suicidality.",

          "abstract": "Whether people can actively suppress unwanted thoughts is highly controversial. Anderson and Green (2001) developed the Think/No-Think (TNT) task and found that suppressing a memory reduces later recall, referred to as the Suppression-Induced Forgetting (SIF) effect. While some studies replicate this effect, others do not. To better understand the factors influencing the SIF effect, we developed two TNT methodological quality checklists (a 12-item essential version and an extensive 25-item version) based on optimal test conditions proposed by Nardo and Anderson (2024). We then assessed whether following these optimal test conditions predicted SIF effects across 100 TNT studies (143 effects) conducted with non-clinical samples. We found that methodological quality significantly predicted SIF effect significance for the 25-item checklist, but not robustly for the 12-item checklist. Methodological quality did not predict the magnitude of the reported SIF effect. Because there remains considerable uncertainty on the optimal TNT test conditions, we recommend authors report their methods, using the checklists provided in this paper. Exploratory analyses further suggested that studies involving original TNT developer reported significant SIF effects more frequently (95%) than studies without developer involvement (68%). This authorship effect remained significant after controlling for higher methodological quality. More independent studies are thus needed to mitigate possible biases.",

          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

Here, we introduce a scalable method using large language models (LLMs) to analyze verbal reports and identify the articulated reasons for choices between monetary lotteries. We show that a validated LLM accurately identifies predefined decision reasons in participants' free-text reports, aligning with their actual choices in over 92\\% of trials. Our analysis reveals that reason usage varies systematically and is driven more by the choice problem's structure than by individual differences. A predictive model based on these problem-specific reason profiles outperforms prospect theory in out-of-sample prediction. This work demonstrates that verbal reports are a rich data source and that LLMs can unlock their potential, challenging foundational invariance assumptions and paving the way for more context-aware models of human decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

Methods: Participants were included from a longitudinal study of college study mental health during the pandemic, and included if they were trauma-exposed (n=612). Results: A path model revealed that COVID impact factors capturing key pandemic-related domains exerted immediate effects on mental health symptoms, but well-being (subjective quality of life) exerted immediate and longer-term effects. PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms influenced one another in the first months of the pandemic, but only PTSD symptoms impacted depression and anxiety one year later. Conclusions: Well-being may be important for mental health symptoms during the first year of the pandemic. PTSD may be an important focus in the prevention of depression and anxiety, among those exposed to trauma.",

Applying multilevel models to harmonized longitudinal panel survey data from the U.S. and 13 European nations (N = 59,030, ages 45 to 65) revealed that middle-aged adults in nations with less investment in family benefits (as % of GDP) and more income inequality report higher levels of individual-level loneliness and exhibit steeper within-person increase in loneliness over time. Findings document that policy models pertaining to family benefits and income inequalities are associated with cross-national differences in midlife loneliness.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Kayser",
          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). Less commonly, it has been applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. The present study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the validity of back-projected decomposition, and all single-trial measures showed high or adequate internal consistency. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative: it quantifies single-trial epochs based on the variance structure of the averaged data, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability, and enabling confident linkage of trial-level component measures with other trial-level variables.",

          "abstract": "Statistical power remains a central yet confusing concept in psychology. Pek et al.

We argue, however, that Cohen (1962, 1988) advanced a broader definition: the probability of obtaining a significant result, without conditioning on a specific alternative effect size. This broader perspective allows power to serve two functions—planning studies with hypothetical effect sizes and evaluating completed studies with plausible effect size estimates. The broader concept is useful to evaluate single studies and to estimate publication bias. We conclude that power analysis of published research is an important tool for the credibility revolution of psychological research.",

          "abstract": "As an alternative to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, transdiagnostic approaches that identify latent dimensions of psychopathology through factor analysis have gained prominence in recent years. A key critique of these approaches, however, is that they are performed at the level of symptoms only. This begs the question: are these dimensions truly more valid predictors of external outcomes than existing alternatives? Are there other ways, that are more data-driven, which can allow us to refine our definitions of clinical phenotypes? We tested this idea empirically, conducting a large-scale meta-scientific comparison of thousands of competing factor solutions that allowed us to determine if the latent structure underlying the covariation of psychiatric symptoms has robust and specific cognitive correlates. In nine independent datasets, comprising N=7565 individuals including patients about to start mental health treatment, healthy individuals, paid and unpaid participants, a broad set of age ranges and cognitive task variants that measured model-based planning and metacognition, we found that factors with the best fit to cognition were those derived from a first-order factor analysis on the maximal number of theoretically informed self-report symptoms available. These factors (‘Compulsivity and Intrusive Thought’ and ‘Anxious-depression’) performed better than thousands of engineered alternatives and performed twice as well as traditional questionnaire total scores. Crucially, this unsupervised approached based on symptom correlation only performed on-par with a partial least squares analysis, a supervised approach to deriving factors based on cognition. These results provide evidence that unsupervised factor analysis of psychiatric symptoms is a viable method for rethinking how we define mental health and illness, affording clear opportunities for enhancing our understanding of specific underlying mechanistic processes.",

How these stress levels relate to mood, however, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between the Garmin Stress Score and mood. Over 28 days, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data were collected five times a day for mood, and Garmin Stress Score data were collected continuously, in a sample of 95 (80F) healthy young adult university students in the Netherlands. Binary and linear multilevel models were used to associate the Garmin Stress Score with the presence of mood, and a dose-response relationship, respectively. The Garmin Stress Score was associated with high- and moderate-intensity positive mood but not with negative or low-intensity mood. The mood \"calm\" and \"relaxed\" showed a negative dose-response relationship with average Garmin Stress Score, and a positive trend was found for \"enthusiastic.\" Since the Garmin Stress Score relies on parasympathetic activation, representing the rest-and-digest state, rather than fight-or-flight, it makes sense that it is associated with states of non-relaxation. However, it was not associated with states of high arousal negative mood. This makes the term \"Stress Score\" incorrect and misleading to consumers. Our findings warrant further research into mood, particularly those associated with high arousal negative mood. We recommend stronger collaborations between commercial companies like Garmin and researchers to enhance the accuracy of feedback provided by wearable devices and mitigate any harmful effects on consumers.",

          "abstract": "Persuasion is a complex communicative process aiming at influencing others’ beliefs or behaviors. Imbuing everyday communication, persuasion is a crucial skill for children to manage social \ninteractions successfully. While theoretically persuasion has been linked with the mastery of figurative language and with pragmatics more broadly, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence exploring the relationship between persuasion and metaphor skills. Here we tackle this issue in early childhood by examining whether individual differences in metaphor skills are related to those in persuasion. A sample of 167 children (age 4-6 years) was assessed for persuasive abilities alongside metaphor comprehension and production, in addition to vocabulary and working memory skills as control variables. \nResults showed an improvement in persuasive skills at 5 years of age. Across ages, children preferred \nto use positive persuasive strategies (i.e., offering rewards) over negative ones (i.e., punishments), \nwhile psychological strategies relying on mitigation and modeling were rarely used. Regardless of the \ntype of strategy, persuasion correlated positively with vocabulary skills. Interestingly, greater use of \npsychological persuasive strategies was associated with better metaphor production skills (being con\nversely hampered by working memory), while no effect of metaphor comprehension was found. Over\nall, these findings suggest that some aspects of metaphor skills, within the broader set of pragmatic  competencies, might be a driving factor in achieving a high-level persuasive style. Such aspects possibly deal with the functions of metaphors to favor flexible conceptualization and social use of language.",

To this end, we utilised voxel-based morphometry and a novel web-based 3D object location memory task that manipulated visual perspective during encoding and retrieval. Compared to healthy younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater deficit in first-person than third-person recall of object locations, irrespective of the original encoding perspective. In older adults, left angular gyrus and precuneus grey matter volume correlated positively with the adoption of a first-person recall perspective, though not with first-person recall more generally. The volume of these regions was additionally found to be reduced in older adults relative to younger adults. Together, these findings suggest that posterior parietal cortex atrophy may underpin relatively greater age-related difficulties in first-person perspective-taking during episodic memory retrieval.",

Database searches in Medline, PsychINFO, PubMED, and PsycARTICLES were conducted on May 7th, 2024. A total of 14, 916 articles were identified following duplicate removal. Articles were screened following PRISMA guidelines. Eight articles (n = 900) met inclusion criteria. Outcomes of interest included maternal substance use, child/maternal mental health, and treatment components. All studies indicated maternal substance use treatments were at least as, or more, effective in improving maternal substance use and child/maternal mental health outcomes compared to controls. Treatment components included: mother/family mental health, basic needs, parenting skills, occupation/education, operant conditioning, crisis management, and medical education. Operant conditioning was the only treatment component which appeared to positively impact maternal substance use outcomes; no other treatment components were associated with outcomes of interest. This review provides preliminary evidence highlighting the benefits of substance use treatments for mothers of young children on substance use and mental health outcomes. Future randomized controlled trials with harmonized outcome measures and qualitative data that identifies treatment needs of mothers with lived experience are crucial to evaluate maternal substance use treatments and improve treatment development.",

In each experiment, the target stimuli were triggered by voluntary actions or externally, with FPs ranging from 0.6 to 2.8 seconds. Participants performed a go/no-go task (Experiment 1) or an orientation discrimination task (Experiments 2–4). We observed slower RTs for action-triggered stimuli than external stimuli, particularly at shorter FPs, with this effect diminishing as the FPs lengthened. This pattern was observed only in variable FP paradigms, indicating an interaction of voluntary actions and FP variability. In contrast, the constant FP paradigms did not show significant differences. These findings suggest that voluntary actions influence temporal preparation under temporal uncertainty. We discuss these results in light of current theories of temporal preparation, proposing new perspectives on the role of voluntary actions in shaping anticipatory behavior.",

We address considerations across frequentist and Bayesian frameworks and fixed as well as sequential research designs, including guidance on effect size reporting, equivalence testing, and the appropriate treatment of null results. To facilitate implementation of these recommendations, we provide the  Transparent Statistical Reporting in Psychology (TSRP) Checklist that researchers can use to systematically evaluate and improve their statistical reporting practices (https://osf.io/t2zpq/). In addition, we provide a curated list of freely available tools, packages, and functions that researchers can use to implement transparent reporting practices in their own analyses to bridge the gap between theory and practice. To illustrate the practical application of these principles, we provide a side-by-side comparison of insufficient versus best-practice reporting using a hypothetical cognitive psychology study.

Analyzing 1,578,057 posts from U.S. members of Congress (2019–2023), we found that (1) Democrats and Republicans did not differ meaningfully in what kinds of moral language they used but that (2) they used moral language for different issues.

          "abstract": "One of the methods most commonly used to assess implicit learning is the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT), which involves learning a visuo-motor sequence. However, the developmental trajectory of sequence learning and its underlying processes continues to be a matter of debate. Du et al. (2017) showed that adults primarily rely on online learning mechanisms, whereas the learning gains of 6-year-old children mainly occur during offline periods (i.e., rest intervals). Interestingly, 10-year-olds showed a mixed pattern, combining both online and offline learning processes. These findings suggest differential learning strategies (Du et al., 2016). However, Du et al.’s (2017) results were obtained using an atypical version of the SRTT (i.e., foot responses). This raises the question of whether the observed developmental changes reflect genuine age-related shifts in learning strategies or, instead, age-specific sensitivities to task design. To address this issue, we conducted a partial replication of Du et al. (2017) using a touch-screen SRTT specifically adapted to minimize age-related biases (Experiment 1). We also investigated the effect of explicit instruction on these developmental learning patterns (Experiment 2). Findings confirm age-related differences in learning dynamics. Moreover, results show that online learning was directly related to explicit knowledge assessed with verbal reports, as well as with generation and recognition tasks. Finally, providing explicit instructions disrupted established learning patterns, interfering, in particular, with sequence acquisition in 10-year-olds. These findings are discussed in terms of how individual (i.e., age) and contextual (i.e., task instructions) factors may influence the balance between online and offline learning.",

          "abstract": "Pairing a conditioned stimulus (CS) repeatedly with aversive imagery as unconditioned stimulus (US) induces conditioned subjective and autonomic fear responses which can explain fears without prior aversive experiences. To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. Similar to the classical conditioning group, the imagery-based conditioning group reported higher fear for CS+av than for both non-aversive CS and displayed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences.",

          "abstract": "Pairing a conditioned stimulus (CS) repeatedly with aversive imagery as unconditioned stimulus (US) induces conditioned subjective and autonomic fear responses which can explain fears without prior aversive experiences. To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. The imagery-based conditioning group showed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Additionally, CS+av evoked higher fear ratings than both non-aversive CS. These effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences.",

          "authors": "Elliott Bonal",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a mathematical model, grounded in category theory, which unifies neural encoding and decoding across scales and modalities and gives rise to equations incorporating individual neural codes into a unified picture. The model introduces three fundamental categories, one representing stimuli, another representing single-neurons and one representing neural networks; with functors representing encoding and decoding. At the neuronal scale, a unified coding equation represents a neuron’s code as a normalized convex mixture of component codes (such as rate code, latency code...) inputted through a nonlinearity function. At the neuronal scale, a unified coding equation represents a network’s code and combines the vector of single-neuron codes with network-level codes (such as population code, correlation code...) through convex weights. Noise is modelled as discrepancies between encoding and decoding.\n    Moreover, through an encoding functor within the categorical framework, neurons are modelled as encoding a given many-valued logical predicate (whose output is in [0,1]) applied to a given stimulus. Networks, however, are modelled as encoding a given vector of such predicates. Predicate coding thus parallels the \"feature detector neuron\" conception, but strengthens it as logical predicates can be made from any well-formed formula containing a free variable (and can thus even model a disjunction of multiple other predicates).\n   Hence, predicate-coding, its underlying categorical architecture as well as unified equations, provide a mathematically rigorous and experimentally implementable unification of neural encoding and decoding from the cellular scale to large-scale neural networks.",

          "authors": "Christopher N. Wahlheim; Lauren Richmond",
          "abstract": "Mnemonic discrimination tasks such as the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) are used to assess hippocampal pattern separation. However, lures designed to evoke pattern separation include features that trigger pattern completion. In two experiments, we modified the object-based MST by adding a final order memory test to evaluate whether lure rejections were memory-based and promoted integrative encoding with studied objects. Participants studied objects (Phase 1), classified repeated, similar, and new objects (Phase 2), and completed a two-alternative forced-choice order memory test with lures next to corresponding studied objects (Phase 3). Lure rejections in Phase 2 were associated with more accurate identification of lure objects as recent in Phase 3, especially when participants also recognized that the corresponding studied object had appeared in Phase 1. Experiment 2 further showed that lure rejections preceded by clear memories of studied objects were associated with memory benefits, suggesting that retrieval and comparison processes promoted memory integration. These findings demonstrate that lure rejections are not process-pure indicators of pattern separation but instead reflect an interplay of pattern completion and separation. The addition of a final order memory test offers a useful approach for identifying conditions under which integrative encoding supports subsequent memory for similar events.",

          "abstract": "Mnemonic discrimination of visual objects entails differentiating among repetitions of target objects, unstudied foil objects, and, critically, lure objects that are similar, but not identical to, studied objects (e.g., a different coffee mug than what was studied). Correctly rejecting lures may involve hippocampal pattern separation, a process that orthogonalizes representations of similar experiences. However, lures can also be rejected when recollection of studied objects enables detection of changed lure features. The present study examined whether verbal justifications of recognition decisions in an object-based mnemonic discrimination task could reveal recollection-rejection as the primary basis for lure rejections. Across multiple study-test trials, participants studied everyday objects and, at test, attempted to classify similar lures, studied targets, and novel foils. Participants sometimes verbally justified their decisions. Machine learning classifiers showed that verbal justifications discriminated among different classifications given to the same item types for both in- and out-of-sample data. Lure rejection language often expressed the use of recollection of studied objects to detect changes in perceived objects (viz., recollection-rejection strategy). Verbal justifications also discriminated correct from incorrect responses better than numeric confidence, which could not be explained by a model assuming a one-dimensional memory strength signal. Finally, verbal justifications best predicted accurate recognition decisions for all item types at the highest level of subjective confidence, which further implicated the use of recollection. The present findings verify that lure rejections in mnemonic discrimination tasks do not only reflect hippocampal pattern separation and instead suggest that rejections also reflect recollection of studied targets.",

          "abstract": "Fertility rates have declined in industrialized nations, and an increasing number of adults expect\nto remain childless. Non-parenthood includes diverse subgroups with distinct motivations and\npsychosocial profiles. One under-researched subgroup is antinatalists, who view procreation as\nmorally wrong. This study examined psychological functioning among antinatalist, childfree,\nand childless individuals.\n\nThis cross-sectional study recruited 492 non-parent adults from the United Kingdom via\nProlific. Participants were categorized into three groups: childless (n=258; desire children or\nare undecided), childfree (n=199; do not desire children for personal/social/economic reasons),\nand antinatalist (n=35; do not desire children for moral/ethical reasons). Participants completed\nthe Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),\nExperiences in Close Relationships–Revised (ECR-R), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ),\nand Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire–Revised (SBQ-R). Group differences were analyzed\nusing Kruskal-Wallis tests and quantile regression, adjusting for age, education, marital status,\nand ethnicity.\n\nSignificant demographic differences were found between the groups in age, education level,\nmarital status, and ethnicity. Unadjusted analyses showed that childless individuals reported\nsignificantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, attachment anxiety, and search for\nmeaning compared to childfree individuals. After adjusting for demographic covariates, most\nof these group differences became non-significant. However, childfree individuals still showed\nsignificantly lower attachment anxiety (at the median), lower reported childhood physical abuse\n(at the upper quantile), and lower suicidal ideation (at the lower quantile) compared to childless\nindividuals. No evidence emerged that antinatalists experienced greater psychological distress\nthan the other groups.\n\nAfter accounting for demographic factors, psychological differences among antinatalist,\nchildfree, and childless individuals were minimal. Findings suggest that demographic factors,\nrather than reproductive stances alone, largely account for differences observed between non-\nparent groups. This challenges narratives that portray those who choose not to have children,\nparticularly antinatalists, as psychologically maladjusted. However, differences in relative\nrepresentation of these categories may pose a limitation.",

          "authors": "Zhang Qikai; 吴静岚",
          "abstract": "Efficiently perceiving social interactions is fundamental to human social cognition, yet the underlying mechanisms remain contested. Domain-specific theories propose specialized processing for social content, while domain-general accounts attribute perceptual advantages to low-level visual features. This debate has been critically hampered by an overreliance on static stimuli, which obscure crucial temporal dynamics and introduce configural confounds. The present study addressed these limitations using a dynamic visual search paradigm that differentiated physical-contingency interactions (defined by synchronized, perceptually coupled movements) from communicative-contingency interactions (defined by sequential, meaning-based exchanges). Experiment 1 revealed a sharp dissociation: physical-contingency interactions were detected more efficiently than both non-interactive dyads and communicative-contingency interactions, while communicative-contingency interactions showed no search advantages. Experiment 2 employed eye-tracking to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Physical-contingency interaction search showed overall search advantages through enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection, despite equivalent attentional guidance compared to non-interaction search. Communicative-contingency interaction search exhibited enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection but suffered from attentional guidance deficits that eliminated overall search benefits. Additionally, communicative-contingency interactions as distractors required the longest fixation durations, indicating strongest attentional stickiness. These findings challenge existing theoretical frameworks by demonstrating that social interaction search advantages cannot be explained by either domain-specific or domain-general mechanisms alone. We propose a dual-route processing model wherein physical-contingency interactions benefit primarily from domain-general perceptual mechanisms that efficiently process motion synchrony and gestalt properties, while communicative-contingency interactions rely on domain-specific social processing mechanisms that handle complex interpersonal meaning. This integrated framework reconciles competing theoretical perspectives and advances understanding of how different types of social information are prioritized in dynamic visual environments.",

          "abstract": "Humans often co-perceive stimuli with others, yet the neurocognitive effects of such shared perceptual contexts are underexplored. We tested whether awareness that a visual stimulus is simultaneously available to another person, without interaction, modulates behavioral performance and neurophysiological signatures of perceptual decision-making. Thirty-three participants completed 640 trials of a Random Dot Kinematogram motion discrimination task while EEG and pupillometry data were recorded. A confederate was present, with a divider ensuring that, on each trial, the stimulus was either jointly visible to both or privately visible to the participant. Participants received no feedback and engaged in no interaction, isolating the effect of joint visibility. Behavioral performance was unaffected by social context, but EEG analysis revealed context-specific neural patterns emerging after cue onset and before stimulus presentation, suggesting proactive encoding of the social context. Additionally, pupil size was significantly greater during public visibility trials, indicating heightened arousal associated with social vigilance. These findings suggest that co-perception induces covert social vigilance—anticipatory arousal and neural readiness in response to shared visibility, even without interaction. Such covert markers could serve as biomarkers for altered social salience processing in clinical populations, such as those with social anxiety disorder or autism.",

We specifically investigated overall attentional\ncapacity – that is, the available processing speed – and its distribution, the relative\nattentional weight.\nBy reanalyzing a large existing dataset from Tünnermann and Scharlau (2021),\nwe found that across multiple testing days, participants either remained stable within a\n20 Hz margin or showed consistent improvements in capacity – in some cases tripling\ntheir initial capacity. The weights in response to salient stimuli were remarkably\nconsistent.\nTo determine whether increases in capacity reflect pure test-retest effects or are\nfacilitated by consolidation between days, and to quantify within-day variability, we\nconducted a second study in which participants completed five self-administered\nsessions within a single day. Capacities remained within the same magnitude and did\nnot show a consistent directional trend. The relative weights exhibited comparatively\nlittle variation in most participants, akin to the previously analyzed dataset. Further,\nestimation uncertainty increased with higher capacity values.\nThese results suggest that capacity may be subject to training effects, but that\nsuch improvements appear to depend on longer breaks between sessions. This has\nimportant implications for individualized assessment: A personal prior could be\nestimated from a single session to accelerate future estimations, as long as subsequent\nsessions occur on the same day.

This was the case both during the early phase of stimulus disengagement, as well as during a later maintained attention phase dominated by controlled strategic processes.

          "abstract": "Mental speed is a multidimensional construct that encompasses three distinct time-related measures: reaction time, processing speed, and tempo, the latter of which is defined as the rate at which individuals respond to items varying in difficulty. This study applies van der Linden’s (2007, 2009) hierarchical model to jointly analyze item responses and response times from 1,620 adults taking the nine core subtests of the Reasoning and Intelligence Online Test (RIOT; https://riotiq.com). Using Bayesian estimation of the van der Linden model, results showed strong model fit across subtests, with near-zero correlations between examinee ability and examinee tempo for verbal tasks (r = -.209 to .136) and stronger negative correlations for visuospatial tasks (r = -.467 to -.769), supporting predictions from dual process theory. Item intensity and sensitivity positively moderated response times with difficulty on most subtests, indicating that item characteristics were the cause of longer response times for more difficult items. Few examinees (2.5%) exhibited dual misfit in responses and times, but the Figure Weights subtest revealed anomalous slow responding. These findings demonstrate that tempo (i.e., examinee response times) are independent of cognitive ability level and that correlations between the two are spuriously caused by item characteristics.

To account for this, we propose a multidimensional framework based on arousal, valence, and context, which enables a more flexible characterization of how sounds are judged in everyday listening. We also examine how different methodological approaches highlight distinct facets of this evaluative process.

          "authors": "Xiaolu Dai; Ling Li Leng; Yiyan Liu; Yu-Te Huang; Daniel Fu Keung Wong",
          "abstract": "Background: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has sparked heated debate over whether Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots can serve as “digital therapists” capable of providing therapeutic support. While much of this discussion focuses on AI’s lack of agency, understood as the absence of mental states, consciousness, autonomy, and intentionality, empirical research on users’ real-world experiences remains limited.\nObjective: This study explores how individuals with mental distress engage with both generative AI and human psychotherapy in natural and unguided contexts, with a focus on how perceptions of agency shape these experiences. By drawing on participants’ dual exposure, the study seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate about “AI therapists” by clarifying the role of agency in therapeutic change.\nMethods: Sixteen adults who had sought mental health support from both human therapists and ChatGPT participated in semi-structured interviews, during which they shared and compared their experiences with each type of interaction. Transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults: Analysis revealed three themes and eight subthemes enabling comparison of what participants found helpful and challenging in their interactions with ChatGPT and human therapists: (1) encouraging open and authentic self-disclosure but limiting deep exploration; (2) the myth of relationship: caring, acceptance, and understanding; (3) fostering therapeutic change: the promise and pitfalls of data-driven solutions. Drawing on these comparative reflections, we propose a conceptual model that highlights how perceptions of agency carry both strengths and limitations for therapeutic engagement. The model also illustrates how the non-agential nature of AI chatbots shapes their capacity to support individuals with mental distress in ways that differ from human therapists.\nConclusion: The findings suggest that agency functions as a double-edged feature in therapeutic interactions. Rather than anthropomorphizing AI chatbots, their non-agential features—such as responsive behaviors, absence of intentions, objective stance, and disembodied state—should be used strategically to complement human-delivered psychotherapy. Meanwhile, practitioners should maximize the benefits of their agential qualities while remaining cautious of the potential inherent risks.",

Empirical studies on ER have increasingly focused on understanding the role of cognitive effort throughout ER processes. Cognitive effort is an essential component of various ER stages: from the identification of the need to regulate emotions, through the selection of ER strategies their implementation, to the monitoring of the regulatory behaviour. The review highlights substantial inter-individual variability in effort expenditure across eR stages and explores the impact of cognitive costs on regulatory outcomes. Findings suggest that high effort demands can increase the likelihood of regulatory failure, perpetuating negative emotional states and impairing well-being. Conversely, automatic ER processes, while less effortful, may limit adaptability to novel emotional challenges. Understanding the intertwined interplay between cognitive effort and ER is important for elucidating crucial components during ER processing and their implications for individual well-being.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how the quantity and quality of digital media use influence the language outcomes of bilingual children in Singapore. The sample includes 140 children aged 4 years 4 months to 7 years 3 months. Mobile screen use was measured with the QQ-MediaSEED, while standardized assessments such as the BLAB captured language proficiency. Preliminary analyses reveal several key patterns. Children spend more screen time in English than in their Mother Tongue, but the quality of screen use significantly predicts proficiency in both languages. Parental mediation also plays an important role: children who co-use screens with parents show stronger English receptive vocabulary, while those whose parents provide supervision during screen time perform better in Mother Tongue receptive vocabulary. These findings highlight the complex role of digital media in bilingual development and the importance of educational content and parental involvement.",

          "abstract": "Romantic partners regularly make sacrifices for each other, yet little is known about how they communicate about sacrifice. We developed the Sacrifice Communication Scale to capture seven parallel communication types for sacrificers (rational, affectionate, positive reframing, downplaying, victimizing, hostile, withdrawal) and recipients (rational, appreciative, positive reframing, undeserving, critical, withdrawal). Across a cross-sectional study (N = 463 sacrificers and 469 recipients), a weekly experience sampling study (N = 193), and a dyadic longitudinal study (N = 190 couples), sacrificers’ affectionate and recipients’ appreciative communication predicted higher relationship quality through increased intimacy, whereas sacrificers’ victimizing, sacrificers’ hostile, and recipients’ critical communication predicted lower relationship quality, primarily through increased conflict. Sacrificers’ and recipients’ chronic withdrawal also predicted lower relationship quality through reduced intimacy. These findings highlight how sacrifice communication shapes relational outcomes, positioning communication as a key way for couples to navigate sacrifices constructively and sustain relationship quality.",

          "authors": "Teri Ann Kirby; Seval Gündemir",
          "abstract": "Despite recent attempts to dismantle diversity initiatives in the US, many people and organizations continue to advocate for diversity. However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

Psyflow, built on top of PsychoPy, provided support for TAPS and offered flexible and modularized tools for participant’s information collection, block/trial management, stimulus presentation, response collection, event synchronization with various neuroimaging systems. TaskBeacon served as the community-driven platform for hosting curated tasks, managing variants, and coordinating community contributions. Finally, the model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposed tools to large language models (LLMs), allowing natural language-driven task development and localization. Together, these components form an ecosystem that advances task standardization, fosters reproducibility and collaboration, and enables LLMs–driven development of cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Recognising subtle signs of positive emotion is essential for trust, cooperation, and social connection. However, everyday barriers—such as face masks—can hinder this ability. We tested whether a brief positive mood induction via comedy viewing could enhance recognition of subtle smiles, and whether this depended on mask-wearing and individual traits. Fifty-three adults (22 males, 31 females) completed a within-subject experiment, watching either a comedy performance or a neutral weather broadcast, then judging the valence of morphed facial expressions (10–30% intensity) shown with or without a mask. Comedy viewing significantly increased positive mood (POMS2-BF VA: p &lt; .001, r = .43) and reduced negative mood (e.g., TA: p = .004, r = .69). Recognition accuracy for subtle positive expressions improved after comedy for unmasked faces (p = .0016, r = .09) but not for masked faces (p = .27), where performance remained at chance. Greater perspective-taking and lower depressive mood predicted greater improvement. Even participants with higher depressive symptoms showed measurable gains. These results demonstrate that a short, enjoyable activity—watching comedy—can sharpen attunement to others’ positive emotions, but only when key facial cues are visible, highlighting both the potential and limits of mood-based interventions for social communication.",

          "abstract": "Social isolation is a major public health concern linked to increased risk for both psychiatric and physical health conditions. Yet despite the potential consequences of social isolation, our understanding of its nature and how it emerges and evolves over time remains limited. We propose that social isolation should be understood and analyzed as a complex dynamical system. First, we introduce core principles of dynamical systems theory and describe how they can be applied to better understand social isolation. Second, we formalize a dynamical systems model using differential equations. Third, we present simulations showing how changes in system dynamics may increase or decrease the likelihood of individuals entering a socially isolated state. Finally, we offer an illustrative example of how intensive longitudinal data could be used to identify early warning signs of transitions between healthy and isolated states. Overall, this approach may ultimately help inform personalized interventions capable of detecting early warning signs of social isolation.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) cases in various countries, including Indonesia, resulted in the paralysis of most services, including in the government sectors. The enactment of Work from Home (WFH) policy for State Civil Servants (PNS) indicates the massive level of urgency for the spread of this deadly virus, leading to the Social Distance policy being also applied in the government environment. This article aims to examine civil servants' work effectiveness in implementing WFH during Covid-19 pandemic in Sleman Regency, with a case study at the Department of Social Service. This research uses an exploratory case study approach, emphasizing the exploration of a phenomenon such as WFH policy. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews and literature reviews were used to obtain reliable data analysis. The findings of this study show that the adaptation of civil servants in the Sleman Social Service to the WFH policy is seen as complex in several divisions, because they are not accustomed to working in a home environment where teleconference facilities may be urgently required and the dependence on communication and coordination between employees is crucial. Another issue is that in the Department of Social Service there are no sanctions for civil servants who do not work under the guidance of WFH policy. In addition, knowledge and skills needed to operate and administer online services are still limited, affecting civil servants' ability in delivering a community’s public service needs. Hence, the implementation of WFH policy may not be effective in all types of public operations.",

          "abstract": "The strategic placement of pedestrian crossings is critical for promoting road safety in urban environments. While previous research has used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify underserved areas, existing approaches often fail to integrate empirical data with stakeholder expertise, or directly link road safety concerns with wider spatial equity considerations. This study develops a novel GIS-Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) framework to evaluate the suitability of sites for new pedestrian crossings, incorporating four key criteria: existing provision of pedestrian infrastructure, road safety risks, proximity to urban amenities, and socio-demographic vulnerability. Applied to Liverpool City Region as a policy case study, the framework integrates advanced spatial analysis techniques with stakeholder informed weights, to assess the suitability of postcodes for new pedestrian crossings. Site suitability scores are generated which reflect both the considerations relevant to key stakeholders, as well as the distribution of controlled pedestrian crossings, road traffic collisions, urban amenities and census-derived vulnerability indicators. The results reveal significant spatial inequalities where, specific locations with high socio-demographic vulnerability also experience the greatest road safety risks and poorest access to pedestrian crossings, despite proximity to essential services. The framework successfully pinpoints priority locations where road safety and spatial inequality concerns compounded negatively, providing evidence-based guidance for data-driven, stakeholder-informed pedestrian infrastructure investment.",

          "abstract": "Much of the existing work on LGBT+ placemaking relies on qualitative or historical narratives, which lack the empirical precision to systematically evaluate the structural factors driving the presence and evolution of LGBT+ establishments over time. To address these shortcomings, my paper examines the spatial evolution of LGBT+ establishments in US cities between 1990-2000, using a novel panel dataset combining geocoded Damron Guide entries from Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG) with contextual data from the NHGIS/U.S. Census Bureau. Employing fixed-effects panel models and difference-in-differences frameworks, my analysis investigates how establishment-level and MSA-level factors predict the presence and turnover dynamics of LGBT+ establishments over time. My findings reveal that bars/clubs and erotic shops have a higher likelihood of presence in MSAs relative to accommodations. Theatre/entertainment venues exhibit higher entry and stability into MSA markets, whereas other establishment types face volatile turnover. I also find that the so-called “great cities,\" ubiquitous in works on LGBT+ placemaking, exhibit conditions favorable to the viability of LGBT+ establishments and yet exhibit no significant differences in turnover dynamics compared to other MSAs. My findings extend qualitative narratives by quantifying the impacts of economic changes, demographic shifts, and cultural influences, which should inform urban policy and advocacy efforts to sustain inclusive LGBT+ spaces amidst changing urban landscapes.",

I compare and contrast TEA with other common estimands in similar research settings, highlighting its unique use. I demonstrate the use of TEA through two applications: the effect of college completion on income gradient in health and the effect of college completion on issue alignment, using NLSY97 and GSS respectively. By exploring how treatments modify associations between outcomes, TEA offers a valuable tool for sociological research on inequality, stratification, and public opinion, providing insights into the mechanisms sustaining social inequalities and informing policy interventions.",

          "abstract": "While much progress has been made to understand what “globalization losers” want from future democracy, much less is known is about respective preferences of “globalization winners”, or cosmopolitans (representing the other side of the \"transnational cleavage\"). Given cosmopolitans’ active engagement in politics and society, their democratic preferences are decisive for future democratic reform both at the national and global level. This article investigates the heterogeneous governance preferences of German cosmopolitans. Acknowledging theoretical conceptions, the article defines cosmopolitanism as a multidimensional concept, and first empirically determines these dimensions as moral, cultural, institutional and anti-nationalist cosmopolitanism. These dimensions are connected to preferences for representative, technocratic and participatory forms of democracy. This shows that each cosmopolitanism dimensions implies distinct preferences. While nearly all dimensions relate positively to governance by experts (except for the anti-nationalist dimension), only the institutional dimension of cosmopolitanism is connected to significant and consistent support for representative government. There is strong disagreement on participatory forms of democracy. Moral cosmopolitanism is associated with an endorsement referendums and citizen assemblies, whereas the anti-nationalist dimension connects with the rejection of both. These results are explained by different values connected with moral and cultural cosmopolitanism on the one hand, and institutional and anti-national cosmopolitanism on the other.",

          "abstract": "How we remember our past can be shaped by the realities of our present. This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank, and how this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects, as increases in current financial satisfaction are associated with decreases in childhood income rank, but increases in current perceived relative income are associated with increases in childhood income rank. We argue these opposing effects follow from theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. This demographic heterogeneity suggests that recall bias is not evenly distributed across the population and has important implications for how different groups perceive their own pasts. Our findings further highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",

          "authors": "Elisabetta Adami",
          "abstract": "Addressing a gap in extant research on social media content creation, the paper presents a time-space-interaction analytical framework for the investigation of content creators’ development of practices through time and orchestration across the spaces of their online presence, cross-checked through interactions with followers. While the framework is potentially applicable to any research focus, the paper focuses its application on the analysis of translocal trajectories as entextualised in the semiotic practices of social media video-based food content creators. The application takes as a case study @foodqood, a food content creator based in Italy who gained megainfluencer status (with over 23 million followers on TikTok) and analyses the creator’s whole production on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The framework is structured along four analytical semiotic layers, i.e., the resources of the subject matter (food), the embodied and disembodied resources of the creator’s performance, the video-specific visual and auditory resources, and the resources in the paratext. The semiotic layers are considered by intertwining three dimensions of analysis, i.e., the creator’s trajectories through time, across the different social media platforms of their online presence, and in the interactions with followers. The findings show distinct phases in the creator’s development of practices, from experimentation to institutionalisation, and trace trajectories of the creator’s identity performances marked by distinctive strategies in the combined use of the three layers of semiotic resources; the development of these through time, across spaces and in relation to followers’ prompts reveals the creator’s shifting interests in terms of audience reaches, as well as a nuanced effort to appeal to different audience segments. The conclusions point to the usefulness of a social semiotic framework that includes a languaging perspective to observe transnational phenomena, and of such a time-space-interaction analysis to trace the complex dynamics of influence between practices from below and institutional ones, and between agency in sign-making choices and semiotic regime ideologies.",

I suggest this theory also applies to different boundaries in both education and other fields, and that policies which reduce middle-class uncertainty can equalize opportunity better than technocratic reforms given boundary defense.",

          "authors": "James Ackland; Ana Basiri",
          "abstract": "Democratic government relies on a great deal of voluntary participation from the population. This participation is not guaranteed, and when citizens are absent from the data collecting processes of the state, a missing data problem occurs. The co-occurrence of the Scottish local elections and the Scottish Census in 2022 provides an unusual opportunity to test hypotheses about common and context-specific drivers of civic non-participation. Using a geospatial approach, we show that ward-level census nonresponse is highly correlated with electoral abstention despite abstention being about five times more common than initial census nonresponse. Statistical modelling demonstrates strong common roles for deprivation and English-language speaking in driving the participation rates of a ward. Meanwhile relatively specific effects are shown for cohabitation in driving census response, and the proportion of young people in driving voting behaviour. We conclude that the similarity between these nonresponse processes represents an opportunity for improving practice in increasing response rates. For example, census “hard to count” indices can incorporate data from elections as “interim” predictions for low-response areas, and framing voting as a household duty, rather than an individual one, may improve turnout.",

          "abstract": "Traditional sources of population data, such as censuses and surveys, are costly, infrequent, and often unavailable in crisis-affected regions. Mobile phone application data offer near–realtime, high-resolution insights into population distribution, but their utility is undermined by unequal access to and use of digital technologies, creating biases that threaten representativeness. Despite growing recognition of these issues, there is still no standard framework to measure and explain such biases, limiting the reliability of digital traces for research and policy. We develop and implement a systematic, replicable framework to quantify coverage bias in aggregated mobile phone application data without requiring individual-level demographic attributes. The approach combines a transparent indicator of population coverage with explainable machine learning to identify contextual drivers of spatial bias. Using four datasets for the United Kingdom benchmarked against the 2021 census, we show that mobile phone data consistently achieve higher population coverage than major national surveys, but substantial biases persist across data sources and subnational areas. Coverage bias is strongly associated with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic features, often in complex nonlinear ways. Contrary to common assumptions, multi-application datasets do not necessarily reduce bias compared to single-app sources. Our findings establish a foundation for bias assessment standards in mobile phone data, offering practical tools for researchers, statistical agencies, and policymakers to harness these datasets responsibly and equitably.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates journalists’ perceptions of how artificial intelligence (AI) affects disinformation risks within the news ecosystem. Drawing on a structured survey of 504 journalists in the Basque Country administered online and by telephone in May–June 2024, the study examines associations between perceived risk and professional variables, including experience and AI usage. Results show that 89.88% of respondents believe AI will considerably or significantly increase disinformation risks, a pattern consistent across genders and media types, though somewhat less pronounced among digital-native outlets. Experience matters: perceptions of risk rise with years in the profession. Conversely, intensive users of AI in the newsroom tend to report more moderate views of its harmful effects. The most frequently cited risks concern difficulties identifying false content and deepfakes, and the likelihood of obtaining inaccurate data; co-occurrence analysis indicates these concerns are commonly linked in journalists’ mental models. Additional worries include exposure to scams and biases related to data provenance. The paper argues for targeted AI literacy, ethical training, and transparent verification workflows to calibrate expectations and bolster resilience against information disorders. Overall, the findings underscore both the scale of perceived threat and the potential of professional familiarity to nuance risk assessments.",

The contribution of this paper is to provide a systematic assessment of this linearity assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily empirical results can be overturned when it is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents use survey scales in ways that deviate from linearity, but only mildly so. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 40,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Coefficient signs are remarkably robust to the mild departures from linear scale-use we document experimentally. However, estimates of relative effect sizes, which are crucial for policy applications, are unreliable even under these modest non-linearities.",

          "abstract": "A caveat of much of the existing demographic literature is that it decomposes population change into the components of fertility, mortality, and migration, treating ageing merely as a consequence of natural change while neglecting the role of age structure in the observed dynamics. This study applies a scenario-based decomposition approach, using counterfactual scenarios for each factor of population change (fertility, mortality, migration, and age structure) to assess their individual contributions. The 37 NUTS-2 units of the Visegrád Group countries (Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary) were selected as units of analysis. The research focused on the origins of regional differences and on the explanatory role of age structure. The results indicate that differences at the regional scale cannot be attributed solely to national-level variation, as cross-border groupings also emerge in the cluster analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that initial age structure constitutes an independent and essential explanatory factor of population heterogeneity, both at the national and regional levels.",

          "abstract": "The 2023 judicial reform crisis in Israel intensified a growing democratic divide. This article employs a cultural-sociological lens to interpret the conflict as part of a broader struggle over national identity. Drawing on original panel survey data and Latent Class Analysis, it identifies five distinct nationalist belief clusters among Jewish Israelis that structured divergent responses to the reform initiative. A key cleavage separates those concerned about democratic backsliding from those endorsing majoritarian rule. This divide has heightened political polarization and reinforced alignment between national identity and party affiliation. Contrary to expectations, the October 7 Hamas attack did not unify the public but entrenched existing divisions. The article considers whether rising concern over democracy might catalyze a broad political realignment with implications for Israel’s democratic future.",

The consequences of accommodation remain contested. This paper leverages a pre-registered quasi-experimental design exploiting within-individual variation from as-good-as-random exposure to UK Labour leader Keir Starmer’s “Island of Strangers” speech -- a major rhetorical turn toward anti-immigration positions. We find that exposure significantly altered perceptions of Labour, making it appear more anti-immigration and right-leaning. Crucially, these shifts carried electoral costs: support for Labour declined within individuals following the speech. While we detect no corresponding gains for the radical right Reform UK party, there is also no evidence that Labour’s adoption of nativist rhetoric diminished Reform’s appeal. Our findings highlight the risks of strategic convergence, showing that accommodation of exclusionary rhetoric by social democratic parties is electorally costly for them rather than for their radical right competitors.",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Research on housing and populism has produced conflicting findings – evidence suggests declining housing affordability can have both a negative and positive association with populist support. Focusing on the UK, this paper argues these findings can be reconciled by decomposing the heterogeneous effects of housing affordability into distinct, but related, housing crises. Furthermore, it argues these crises will be related to political preferences through the interaction between geography and tenure. The paper hypothesises that homeowners in areas of high house prices will be less likely to hold populist political preferences due to a wealth effect that legitimises the existing socio-political system. By contrast, social renters in unaffordable areas will be more likely to support populism due to their higher likelihood of experiencing housing insecurity and as the scarcity of affordable housing will provide a conducive context in which to scapegoat immigrants. Analysis using data on local housing conditions and political preferences finds broad support for these hypotheses. The analysis finds that social renting in an area of widespread housing insecurity is positively associated with both opposition to immigration and voting for the Reform Party. It also finds that homeownership does negatively interact with local house prices in predicting attitudes to immigration, but the effect is to attenuate the positive association between house prices and opposition to immigration. This contradicts previous studies which may have been subject to omitted variable bias. No evidence is found for an interaction between homeownership and affordability in predicting support for the Reform Party. The paper contributes to an emergent research agenda around housing discontent and populism. It concludes with reflections on the future direction of this research agenda, suggesting there is value in measuring housing insecurity at the individual level, rather than as a contextual variable, and interrogating causality.",

Traditional approaches to characterising language production typically incorporate linguistic complexity metrics, which, while useful for various tasks such as learner proficiency evaluation and text readability assessment, have limited pedagogical relevance. There have been calls for more fine-grained annotations of linguistic structures in recent research, particularly in the field of second language acquisition (SLA), where grammar is a central part of second language (L2) learning. However, there is a lack of comprehensive tools for systematically analysing detailed grammatical structures. To address this gap, we present POLKE (Pedagogically-Oriented Language Knowledge Extractor), a tool for automatically annotating English grammar use based on the English Grammar Profile (EGP). In this paper, we introduce the POLKE system and outline the results of its evaluation, which yielded satisfactory results.",

Our results show that while politicians’ news visibility is positively associated with their popularity in Google search queries, this association is substantially stronger among MPs of ethnic minority background and female MPs.

          "abstract": "The expansion of higher educational systems in Western countries in the latter half of the 20th century is central to the reversal of the gender gap in education. In Norway, major reforms starting in the late 1960s aimed at making higher education more accessible for large segments of the population. This occurred through the establishment, upgrading, and gradual expansion of local colleges across the country, especially in female-dominated fields associated with work in expanding welfare sectors. Previous research has suggested that the gendered profile of educational expansions contributed to the cementing of horizontal gender segregation patterns in education and the labor market. We shed light on these processes using new and detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of higher educational institutions between 1969 and 1993. Linking these to individual-level register data, we study how regional variation in educational opportunities affected the educational attainment and field of study choices of young women and men, using an event study approach. While increased access to college education was a prerequisite for the reversal of the gender gap, our results suggest that the location of colleges had, at most, a very modest impact on local educational attainment and gendered field of study choices.",

Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

This article reports on a realist interview study which aimed to understand the mechanisms that underpin successful inter-agency collaboration in support of people experiencing self-neglect, and the barriers to achieving it. Based on semi-structured interviews with 78 practitioners from Adult Social Care, Health, Housing, Fire &amp; Rescue, and Environmental Health, 16 people with experience of self-neglect, and 2 family carers, the study proposes 9 principal programme theories of inter-agency dynamics under the headings of: policies and procedures; mutual inter-agency understandings of roles and task; keeping a collective shared focus on the person experiencing self-neglect; and support from management. It is argued that professional curiosity in safeguarding must be complemented by greater ‘inter-professional curiosity’ if inter-agency working is to fulfil its potential contribution to improving the lives of people experiencing self-neglect.",

Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 as a quasi-natural experiment, I test this model by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans using five surveys that collectively span from 2016 to 2024. The findings consistently show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement—much more so among younger than older individuals. Moreover, the changes persisted for younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization.

We develop a game-theoretic model of liquidity provision that reveals a fundamental toxicity-competitiveness trade-off in LP decision-making, which shapes the equilibrium strategy. Specifically, while arbitrageurs' toxic swaps generate non-competitive payoffs that are independent of other LPs' strategies, noise traders' non-toxic swaps create competitive payoffs that depend on aggregate liquidity provision. We demonstrate that LP equilibrium payoffs under the concentrated liquidity mechanism increasingly outperform those without it as swap toxicity rises. However, when toxicity is substantially low, competitive pressure of concentrated liquidity can worsen LP payoffs. Our comparative statics analysis identifies several patterns that can guide LPs in adapting their strategies to market conditions.",

          "title": "When is Minimum and Maximum RPM Competitive?: Demand Uncertainty and Retailer Competition",
          "authors": "Kohei Kawaguchi; Jeff Qiu; Zhang Yi",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes how retailer competition affects the welfare implications of resale price maintenance (RPM) under demand uncertainty. We extend the classic model of Deneckere et al. (1997) by introducing imperfect competition among retailers, which creates tension between double marginalization and business-stealing effects. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes determined by demand uncertainty and market concentration. In highly uncertain, competitive markets, minimum RPM enhances efficiency by encouraging inventory holding. However, in markets with lower uncertainty or more concentrated retail sectors, maximum RPM better promotes competition by mitigating double marginalization. The effectiveness of each RPM type depends on whether retailers optimize for all demand states or focus primarily on high-demand scenarios. These findings suggest that antitrust authorities should evaluate RPM cases by considering both the level of demand uncertainty and the degree of retail competition, as different market conditions may call for different forms of vertical price restrictions. For managers, our results provide actionable guidance on selecting the appropriate RPM strategy based on market structure and demand predictability.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the competitive effects of resale price maintenance (RPM) through inventory decisions under demand uncertainty. We focus on the Japanese publishing industry where printed books are excepted from RPM prohibition. We develop and estimate a model of RPM in which price and inventory are determined before demand is realized. Counterfactual simulations show that the price ceiling due to RPM plays a welfare-enhancing role, whereas the price floor can improve supply-side welfare at the expense of consumer surplus. The parameter region for which price floor can improve consumer surplus exists but is narrow.",

          "abstract": "L’articolo esplora il ruolo del conflitto come risorsa nella costruzione di virtù collettive nei processi di innovazione tecnologica, con particolare attenzione all’intelligenza artificiale (IA). Piuttosto che essere considerato un ostacolo, il conflitto emerge come un momento generativo, in cui divergenze di valori, interpretazioni e interessi possono stimolare la riflessione critica e la creazione di norme condivise. Sfruttando il dialogo tra i classici della sociologia (Simmel, Durkheim, Weber, Bourdieu) e approcci contemporanei (MacIntyre, Boltanski &amp; Thévenot), e integrando la teoria delle virtù collettive, il conflitto diventa un motore per innovazioni etiche e socialmente responsabili. Il contributo evidenzia come la gestione efficace dei conflitti interni nei team di IA possa favorire la coesione, la responsabilità condivisa e l’apprendimento collettivo. Attraverso il caso della sanità pubblica, l’articolo mostra come le tensioni tra precisione algoritmica e diritti dei pazienti possano generare virtù collettive quali fiducia e trasparenza. La ricerca sottolinea l’importanza di trattare i conflitti come dispositivi generativi, in grado di allineare il progresso tecnologico con la sostenibilità sociale, proponendo un modello di conflitto che promuove un’innovazione etica e sostenibile.",

          "abstract": "The digitalization of the immigration system through the implementation of electronic visas ( e-Visa ) and Autogate was a strategic way for Indonesia in facing the increasingly complex challenges of international mobility. The digitalization in the immigration sector has been widely studied, research specifically analyzing its impact on Indonesia's national resilience is still very limited. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the implementation of e-Visa and Autogate at Soekarno-Hatta Airport on national resilience from a security, economic, and socio-political perspective, and to identify implementation challenges. This study used a qualitative method with a library research approach, analyzing various regulations, official documents, and related academic studies for the period 2020-2025. The results showed that the implementation of e-Visa and Autogate significantly accelerates the immigration administration process, strengthens border control, improves service efficiency, and supports the national economy by increasing tourist visits by 15%. There were many challenges such as cybersecurity risks, personal data protection, and maintaining technological infrastructure, which are serious obstacles. This research was important for providing strategic policy recommendations to ensure the effectiveness of the immigration digitalization system and strengthen national resilience in a sustainable manner.",

          "abstract": "The recruitment of children into armed groups remains a critical yet under-researched issue in North Darfur, Sudan. While disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts have historically focused on post-recruitment responses, this study explores the overlooked role of women-led, community-based prevention strategies. Using a qualitative case study approach, the research draws on interviews, focus group discussions, and written narratives from 112 participants, including displaced women, civil society actors, and children associated with armed groups. The findings highlight the pivotal role of traditional female mediators—particularly the Hakamate—as cultural influencers who use oral storytelling to discourage recruitment and foster social cohesion. Despite their contributions, these women are systematically excluded from formal DDR frameworks and face structural barriers such as lack of funding, political marginalization, and security threats. This paper argues for a paradigm shift in child protection strategies: from reactive reintegration to proactive prevention, anchored in local knowledge and gender-inclusive policies. The study concludes that recognizing and supporting women’s preventive roles is essential for sustainable peacebuilding in conflict-affected regions like Darfur.",

          "abstract": "Microfinance banks have been critical players in enhancing financial deepening hence fostering socioeconomic development. Despite anchoring socioeconomic transformation and fostering societal wellbeing of households in Kenya, financial performance and sustainability of microfinance have been a concern to players in the industry. The study investigated the mediating effect of transformative capabilities in the nexus between late-mover strategies and the performance of Microfinance Banks. The anchoring theory was dynamic capability theory supported by the balanced scorecard model and theory of change. Positivism research philosophy was employed while integrating descriptive and explanatory research designs. The study population was 13 microfinance banks within Nairobi City County with a target population of 389-unit managers. The sample size was 197-unit managers. To select the sample size, both simple random sampling and stratified sampling were employed. Primary data was employed collected using semi-structured questionnaire. In ascertaining the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was adopted where a value of 0.7 and over indicated the tool is consistent. Validity was ascertained by using content, construct and face validity. Baron and Kenny techniques were employed to investigate mediating role of transformative capabilities on the association between late mover strategies and performance of microfinance banks. It was found out that transformative capabilities mediate the relationship between late movers' strategies and the performance of microfinance banks. The study recommends that mangers in charge of training should regularly organize in-service training, workshops, and seminars in collaboration with industry experts and regulatory bodies to strengthen employee competencies that are key in fostering performance.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

          "abstract": "Aesthetic experiences are a universal and constant phenomenon, affecting our decision making, job performance, and emotional reactivity. While the effects of aesthetic experiences reach far beyond the simple appreciation of art, most research in the field still focuses on subjective ratings of fine art. The current study explored the effect of decorating a lab space on a participant's inhibitory control and emotional reactivity. First, we used an online survey to confirm that participants found the aesthetic room (i.e., decorated lab space) more pleasing and comforting, and expressed a greater willingness to work in that space compared to the bare room. Next, participants performed a Proportion Congruent Stroop task to examine inhibitory control and a Emotion Vocabulary Stroop task to test inhibitory control in the context of emotional stimuli, or their emotional reactivity. Average response times on both tasks were faster in the aesthetic room, while accuracy did not differ between the rooms. These results suggest that participants in the bare room were less efficient at task performance. This research provides a controlled and standardized attempt at understanding the role that aesthetics plays in our daily lives by elaborating on the, understudied, link between aesthetics and inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the Pre-Texts protocol as an innovative educational intervention that operationalizes key principles of positive psychology to foster wellbeing and learning in diverse populations. Pre-Texts integrates collective reading, questioning, artistic creation, reflection, and associative thinking to create conditions for human flourishing aligned with Seligman’s (2011) PERMA model. Drawing on implementations across marginalized communities, we argue how the protocol’s synthesis of aesthetic education, critical pedagogy, and Montessori-inspired principles generates measurable improvements in both psychological wellbeing and cognitive development. The protocol's emphasis on collective creativity and non-competitive engagement provides an alternative to individualistic educational approaches, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations who face barriers to traditional mental health and educational resources. Through an analysis of the protocol’s theoretical foundations and empirical outcomes, we argue that Pre-Texts represents a significant advancement in understanding how creative, text-based interventions can promote mental health, social inclusion, and lifelong learning. The paper contributes to the positive psychology literature by demonstrating how relatively simple, low-cost interventions can create virtuous cycles of learning and wellbeing, offering a replicable model for fostering human flourishing across diverse cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Dominant wellness models have long shaped frameworks in public health, behavioral care, and education. However, they often overlook the structural, cultural, and systemic conditions that define wellness for marginalized and justice-impacted communities. Foundational models such as Hettler’s Six Dimensions and Swarbrick’s Eight Dimensions provide essential scaffolding but fail to capture the full spectrum of harm and potential for healing within communities shaped by colonizing systems: the structures and ideologies that perpetuate colonialism.\n\nThis article introduces the 12 Dimensions of Wellness: a justice-rooted, community-informed framework that incorporates four essential yet underrepresented domains in mainstream literature: creative, cultural, digital, and the newly defined carceral wellness. Carceral wellness, introduced here for the first time, is defined as a relative state of immunity to, resilience from, or recovery after the physical, psychological, social, and systemic harms imposed by carceral systems. It reflects both the enduring impacts of criminalization and the capacity to construct life-affirming alternatives.\n\nGrounded in lived experience and participatory insight, this framework offers a culturally situated and structurally aware reconceptualization of interdimensional wellness. The article explores the model’s theoretical underpinnings, its intersections, and envisioned applications across health, legal, and social systems, advocating for a wellness paradigm rooted not only in individual behavior but in collective liberation.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the emergence of religious hobbyism as a measurable social pathology that mirrors Eitan Hersh's concept of political hobbyism. Religious hobbyism is defined as shallow, consumerist, performative engagement with religion that prioritizes personal gratification over genuine spiritual commitment or civic action. Drawing on data from Pew Research Center, Gallup, World Values Survey, and analysis of social media religious engagement, this paper demonstrates how religious hobbyism undermines civic trust, deepens social polarization, and weakens traditional religious institutions. The research reveals that religious hobbyism manifests through commodified spirituality, social media performativity, and consumer-driven religious engagement that strips faith traditions of their deeper meaning and social function. Key findings include a 300-1500% growth in commodified spiritual products, declining institutional religious participation despite maintained spiritual identity, and concerning pathways from hobbyist spirituality to extremist ideologies. This paper argues that religious hobbyism represents a significant threat to democratic participation and social cohesion, requiring urgent scholarly attention and policy intervention.",

The legal solutions applied to solve those questions are also addressed, including technical solutions, fair use guidelines and legal solutions (litigation, legislative reform, and negotiation).

          "authors": "Femke H. Reidsma; Amanda Henry",
          "abstract": "Fire is a key component of human technology, but when and how we first developed the ability to use and create fire remains heavily debated. Some argue that control of fire developed early and quickly became an essential tool for cooking food, based on morphological changes that first appeared in Homo erectus. Others emphasize the lack of widespread and consistent traces of fire in the early archaeological record, and argue that control of fire came relatively late, post 500ka. In looking for archaeological evidence for fire use, most studies focus on the co-occurence of fire traces and other signs of human activity (e.g., stone tools, cut-marked bones). This assumes that our ancestors first focused on the idea of the hearth, either bringing the fire back to the activity area, or performing activities near a spatially-constrained fire. However, recent research has highlighted the potential importance of intentional burning of landscapes as a tool that could similarly provide nutritional and energetic benefits to the earliest hominin fire users. If landscape burning was the first type of intentional fire use, then we should not expect the co-occurrence of fire traces and other signs of hominin activity. Inspired in part by Wil Roebroeks’ emphasis on off-site activities and longstanding interest in fire, here we provide a suggestion for a new approach to explore the archaeological record for evidence of intentional landscape burning. Future analyses using this approach may help us better understand the deep history of fire use and resolve the potential mismatch between the early appearance of morphological traits associated with the consumption of cooked food and the late co-occurrence of fire traces and hominin activity in the archaeological record.",

          "abstract": "The second generation of web tools shook the journalist profession approximately two decades ago with the proactive incorporation of audiences into the media. Citizen journalism and user-generated content arose as an object of interest due to the democratising value of participation attributed to them, with empowered citizens who could emulate the professional and institutional practises of journalists. However, difficulties soon came to the surface, and audience participation in news media began to be limited. Within this context, this article conducts a critical review of studies on audience participation in news media based on a systematic literature review. The results indicate that, in general, audiences showed low interest in the creation of informative content and that their participation has grown increasingly problematic. In addition, journalists are reticent as they defend their professional role above all else, while company strategies have prioritised making participation profitable. For this reason, the idea of citizen journalism that offers user-created content through the media appears to be a thing of the past, with many characteristics that could define it as a failed innovation. Therefore, the text concludes that audience participation in the media could be defined as mediatised participation.",

El artículo contribuye así a visibilizar y comprender tipo de estrategia y liderazgo de las grandes marcas mediáticas en redes sociales en lo relativo a los temas principales de interés del público y a su capacidad para mediar e influir ante fuentes y audiencias hiperconectadas.\n---\nFor decades, traditional and digital-native media brands have competed with a diverse array of actors, challenging their journalistic leadership, authority, and public legitimacy. Simultaneously, the current media system, both hybrid and disruptive, offers these brands various opportunities to reclaim their centrality as reference media and provide safeguards against disinformation threats. This context is of particular interest for investigating the presence and conversational leadership of these reference media on X (Twitter), through an empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods supported by Social Network Analysis (SNA). This article, therefore, examines the activity metrics, thematic agenda, engagement capacity, and follower dynamics exhibited over one year by twenty-two Spanish media outlets on the mentioned social network. The results provide the first scientific evidence of the extent to which these reference media brands capitalize on the digital public debate on current events. The conclusions distinguish the conversational weight or leadership of these media in the political agenda and topics related to entertainment at both the national and global levels. Thus, the article contributes to highlighting and understanding the strategies and leadership of major media brands on social networks regarding the main topics of public interest and their ability to mediate and influence hyperconnected sources and audiences.",

          "abstract": "This article focuses on the BasqueParl project, which uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze political rhetoric in the Basque Parliament (Spain). It is a good example of political code-switching in the context of bilingualism and a quantitatively balanced political representation between men and women. The investigation builds on the documentary analysis of parliamentary records (2012 and 2020), comprising 13,872,105 words in Basque and Spanish. Variables such as date, speaker, birth year, sex, party, language, slogans, and entities are considered. To visualize the results, we present an experimental dashboard divided into four sections: Interventions, Tables, LDA, and Scattertext, using lemmatization and recognition tools for named entities, among others. The dashboard offers a graphic view of parliamentary activity, showing that 21 % of rhetorical production is in Basque. Other findings include that women speak less and that minority parties have a disproportionate discursive presence. Furthermore, there is a traditional genre-based distribution of political issues. We conclude that in the era of open government and open data, these tools are essential to promote transparency in public administration.\n---\nEste artículo se centra en el proyecto BasqueParl, que utiliza técnicas de machine learning y procesamiento del lenguaje natural (PLN) para analizar la retórica política en el Parlamento Vasco (España).

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are very promising when applied to conduct interviews, typically implemented through a conversational chat interface. These “chatbot interviewers” can be used to (a) collect large-scale in-depth opinion data and (b) run prompt experiments with personalized conversational interventions. In this work, we use the open-source Python package boterview, designed for social scientists, to conduct chatbot interviews in an experimental setting. To investigate whether chatbot interviewers can develop theoretical sensitivity, we ran a pilot interviewing experiment on 26 university students and staff, compared to a group of 12 student interviewers, on the topic of a Universal Basic Income. Based on a content analysis of interviewer questions, we find that chatbot interviewers provided with theoretical background information are more likely to ask theoretically relevant questions, and are more likely to pick up theoretically relevant cues from interviewees. On the other hand, compared to (in-person) human interviewers, responses to (written) chatbot interviewers are shorter and less informative, and chatbots tend to more strongly stick to the script. We conclude by discussing avenues for improving the technical abilities and theoretical sensibilities of chatbot interviewers.",

          "abstract": "Journalists have incorporated social networks into their work as a standard tool, enhancing their ability to produce and disseminate information and making it easier for them to connect more directly with their audiences. However, this greater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure to harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists. This study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n = 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X (formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following the July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results indicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political hate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional ones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization—particularly during election periods—in shaping the hostility that journalists face. Moreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages was similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist messages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was identified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed at them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue, particularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the media must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to the individual level, where this issue usually applies.",

The results reveal that, although such technologies provide opportunities to improve teaching–learning processes, their inclusion in the curriculum is limited and often superficial. In addition, we identify shortcomings in how teachers are trained to manage these tools effectively, hindering the development of critical thinking by students. The conclusions suggest a need for critical media literacy that not only educates students in the use of technologies but also allows them to question and evaluate the content they consume, all within an ethical and reflective framework that promotes participatory and critical citizenship.",

          "abstract": "Social media have been fundamental in the daily lives of millions of people, but they have raised concerns about content moderation policies, the management of personal data, and their commercial exploitation. The acquisition of Twitter (now X) by Elon Musk in 2022 generated concerns among Twitter users regarding changes in the platform’s direction, prompting a migration campaign by some user groups to the federated network Mastodon. This study reviews the onboarding of users to this decentralised platform between 2016 and 2022 and analyses the migration of 19,000 users who identified themselves as supporters of the platform switch. The results show that the migration campaign was a reactive response to Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and was led by a group of highly active academics, scientists, and journalists. However, a complete transition was not realised, as users preferred to straddle their presence on both platforms. Mastodon’s decentralisation made it difficult to exactly replicate Twitter’s communities, resulting in a partial loss of these users’ social capital and greater fragmentation of these user communities, which highlights the intrinsic differences between both platforms.",

Current systems, such as the Model for\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), save many lives by prioritizing urgency, but they can reduce\nlong-term survival gains. We introduce Harm-Threshold Utilitarianism (HTU), a framework\nthat seeks to maximize expected post-transplant benefit while enforcing guardrails for epis-\ntemic confidence, catastrophic harm, and computational simplicity. Using retrospective U.S.\nliver transplant registry data, we simulated organ offers under HTU and MELD. HTU consis-\ntently selected candidates with greater predicted post-transplant survival, producing measurable\nimprovements in 5-year restricted mean survival time (≈ 0.25 years per transplant) without\nsystematically abandoning high-risk patients. Sensitivity analyses show that the harm threshold\ngoverns the trade-off between efficiency and urgency, while the epistemic screen curbs over-\nreliance on uncertain model differences. By making these thresholds explicit, HTU transforms\nimplicit value judgments into transparent rules. The approach offers a principled path toward\norgan allocation policies that are both ethically defensible and outcome-improving.",

          "authors": "James Ackland; Ana Basiri",
          "abstract": "Democratic government relies on a great deal of voluntary participation from the population. This participation is not guaranteed, and when citizens are absent from the data collecting processes of the state, a missing data problem occurs. The co-occurrence of the Scottish local elections and the Scottish Census in 2022 provides an unusual opportunity to test hypotheses about common and context-specific drivers of civic non-participation. Using a geospatial approach, we show that ward-level census nonresponse is highly correlated with electoral abstention despite abstention being about five times more common than initial census nonresponse. Statistical modelling demonstrates strong common roles for deprivation and English-language speaking in driving the participation rates of a ward. Meanwhile relatively specific effects are shown for cohabitation in driving census response, and the proportion of young people in driving voting behaviour. We conclude that the similarity between these nonresponse processes represents an opportunity for improving practice in increasing response rates. For example, census “hard to count” indices can incorporate data from elections as “interim” predictions for low-response areas, and framing voting as a household duty, rather than an individual one, may improve turnout.",

The intervention involved training teachers from 45 state-schools to deliver 20 hours of drama-based strategies, rooted in ensemble practice and active engagement with Shakespearean texts, within the English curriculum. \t\nThe impact of the intervention was assessed using measures of reading, language, and writing skills. While no significant effects were observed on self-concept, reading or language, the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and emotional expressiveness in their writing. Pupils exposed to the rehearsal room approaches used more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures, and their narratives reflected deeper character understanding and emotional insight. These findings suggest that drama-based pedagogy can enhance written language skills, even when writing is not explicitly taught. \nThe study provides proof of principle that rehearsal room strategies can be integrated into mainstream teaching and positively influence pupils’ writing. Future research should explore longer-term impacts, generalisation to other writing contexts, and potential gains in oracy and teacher confidence.",

This study explores the psychosocial, behavioural, and physical effects of these platforms on young adults aged 18 to 30. The researcher employed a questionnaire survey of 111 respondents, in conjunction with existing research. This study investigates the psychosocial effects of binge-watching on young adults and society as a whole. The findings suggest that long watch hours often lead to disturbed sleep, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, mood changes, and a decline in face-to-face engagement with family and friends. While OTT platforms offer unmatched convenience and cultural variety, they also introduce risks that are often overlooked. The study recommends increasing awareness among users, conducting additional research into long-term effects, and implementing proactive measures by policymakers to promote healthier digital habits.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the argument that there are two types of technocratic attitudes in post-communist CEE countries.  the first is unsurprisingly associated with authoritarian attitudes. The latter, however, is not an expression of authoritarianism, but is primarily associated with the so-called democratic deficit: the gap between the importance attached to democracy and (dis)satisfaction with the current state of democratic governance. Previous research has tended to view technocratic attitudes as rather one-dimensional; I show that there are in fact two distinct forms – authoritarian and democratic. The results of the study are relevant from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Technocratic governance thus represents, in the eyes of part of the population of the CEE region, a way of solving the problems of democratic governance.  Technocratic governance is therefore not necessarily and solely associated with authoritarianism, illiberalism, and democratic backsliding, as suggested by the existing scholarly discourse. From an empirical point of view, this study also presents a novel finding: evidence of the heterogeneity associated with technocratic attitudes.",

          "abstract": "The United States saw a series of economic crises that severely impacted the economy between 1970 and 1980. While the crises and the subsequent presidency of Ronald Reagan have been studied extensively, a perspective from U.S. Congress is lacking. This paper analyzes Congressional discourse between 1960 and 1990 and how the crises of the 1970s have affected it. It looks at how Congressional institutions as well as ideological factors have contributed to and structured the economic discourse during these years. The paper draws on a temporal concept of crisis and the “strategies of action”-approach to model the dynamics of Congressional discourse through the 1970s and 1980s. By analyzing Congressional speech transcripts, this paper tracks the salience of policy instruments in floor speeches. The results show that, in stable years, economic discourse is structured primarily by Congressional committees. In years of crisis, their structuring power weakens, emphasizing the power of ideology and personal background. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) It shows that Congressional discourse in the stable 1960s and late 1980s is structured by its institutions. (2) During the economically unstable 1970s, discourse is additionally structured by Republicans and highly educated representatives, who talk significantly more about issues of taxation than most others.",

          "abstract": "Czymara et al. (2025) find that antisemitism is more prevalent among Muslims than among Christians and the religiously unaffiliated. They examine whether these relationships depend on educational attainment or religiosity and aim to explain them using a set of variables, including region of origin, religiosity, and education. I argue that adopting the estimands approach clarifies the research questions, reveals key identification assumptions, and demonstrates the need for causal mediation analysis. Using this approach, I distinguish between confounders and mediators, present revised estimates of what might be considered total effects, and examine the mediating and moderating roles of education and religiosity. The results indicate that caution is warranted when interpreting the link between Muslim denomination and antisemitism. Without controlling for confounders, total effects are overstated. Furthermore, differences in antisemitism between Muslims and Christians are minor among less religious people. However, even among highly educated Muslims, a substantial gap remains relative to Christians and the unaffiliated. I conclude by outlining how the estimands framework may help accomplish one key aim of Czymara et al. (2025): identifying mechanisms that could inform the design of targeted interventions to mitigate antisemitism.",

Yet, evidence of motherhood penalties in the labor market is well documented. To systematically assess parenthood discrimination in employers' hiring decisions across countries and time, we conducted the first meta-analysis of correspondence studies in this field. We synthesized data from 23 studies (N = 65,440 applications) across 11 countries between 1978 to 2022. Using random-effects models, we calculate discrimination risk ratios and conducted subgroup analyses to examine variation by applicant characteristics, occupational context, and national family policies. Our main findings are: (I) Statistically significant status-based discrimination against parents is evident—but primarily driven by anticipated rather than realized parenthood, as it almost exclusively affects women. (II) These penalties are more pronounced in countries lacking supportive family policies, such as paid maternity leave and high female part-time employment. (III) While parents are not systematically penalized across occupations, women—independent of parental status—face discrimination in management roles, and (though not significantly) in highly qualified and male-dominated occupations.",

          "authors": "Matthias Kuppler",
          "abstract": "This study analyzes the exchange of book translations between countries. Existing research is split over the question of whether translation flows are driven by literary, economic, political, or cultural factors. The forces that stratify countries into centers and peripheries are thus debated. To advance the debate, this study leverages newly collected data on N = 147,443 translations of literary works to reconstruct the network of translation flows between 32 European countries for the time period from 2018 to 2020. The relative impacts of literary prestige, economic infrastructure, state support, and cultural proximity on translation flows are estimated with Generalized Additive Models and the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate that translation flows are best explained by a combination of literary prestige and economic infrastructure. Translations flow from countries with high literary prestige and a strong publishing infrastructure to countries with little prestige and weak infrastructure. The transnational circulation of literature appears as a game in which economic infrastructure confers power and in which the accumulation of literary prestige is the ultimate stake. This suggests a logic of competition in which translations are the medium through which economic power is converted into symbolic recognition. In this view, the market logic and the artistic logic are not contradictory orientations but different steps in ongoing accumulation processes.

          "authors": "Alicea Peyton",
          "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",

Using a novel dataset of over 39 million news comments on Korea's largest online news source (Naver News), we examine changes in the share of comments that are categorized as uncivil before and after the introduction of two automated interventions aimed at flagging incivility. We trained two deep learning models to categorize comments and replicate each intervention. The ?findings reveal signifi?cant decreases in uncivil content following each intervention. Interestingly, we find mixed effects of the interventions on total engagement: while the numbers of comments and commenters decreased after the ?rirst intervention, both metrics increased after the second. Examining individual level data reveals that the aggregate reduction in incivility cuts across all users regardless of pre-intervention incivility or commenting frequency.",

          "abstract": "How has the retrenchment of U.S. democracy promotion under President Donald Trump affected processes of autocratization in U.S. allies globally and in the Middle East specifically? We provide theory and evidence to address this question by analyzing two U.S. allies with pre-existing processes of executive aggrandizement: Israel and Turkey. We argue that the decline in U.S. pro-democratic pressure has enabled autocratization in both countries; however, the causal mechanisms and degree of U.S. “autocracy promotion” differ depending on two domestic factors. The first factor is political leaders’ pre-existing control over the state. When incumbents face domestic institutional constraints, the decline of U.S. democratic promotion can actively enable the dismantling of these constraints and transform into autocracy promotion. The second factor is domestic attitudes toward the United States. When public attitudes are pro-American, illiberal political leaders can leverage U.S. support as part of their domestic legitimation strategy. By contrast, in anti-American societies, leaders practice what we call “managed incoherence,” in which a leader’s anti-American narratives coexist uneasily with U.S. acquiescence to autocratization. We demonstrate the theory in Israel and Turkey, two U.S. allies with differing levels of incumbent control over the state and contrasting public attitudes toward the United States. We find that in both Israel and Turkey, the retrenchment of U.S. democracy promotion has enabled autocratization, but through different causal pathways. Our findings contribute to scholarly understanding of the international dimensions of democratic backsliding, authoritarianism in the Middle East, and the effects of U.S. hegemony.",

          "authors": "Ian Lundberg",
          "abstract": "Segregation---whether across schools, neighborhoods, or occupations---is regularly invoked as a cause of social and economic disparities. But segregation is a complicated causal treatment: what do we mean when we appeal to a world in which segregation does not exist? One could take societal contexts as the unit of analysis and compare across societies with differing levels of segregation. In practice, it is more common for studies of segregation to take persons or households as the unit of analysis within a single societal context, focusing on what would happen if particular individuals were counterfactually assigned to social positions in a more equitable way. Taking this latter framework, this paper shows how to study segregation as a cause. The first step is to theorize a counterfactual assignment rule: what would it mean to assign people to social positions equitably? The second step is to identify the causal effect of those social positions and simulate counterfactual outcomes. The third step is to interpret results as the impact of a unit-level (rather than society-level) intervention. A running example and empirical analysis illustrates the approach by studying the causal effect of occupational segregation on a racial health gap.",

Cultural competence (CC) is recognised as a core graduate capability for global citizenship and professional effectiveness, yet empirical evidence on how Gen AI can nurture CC remains scarce. This study investigates how an in-house Gen AI chatbot can cultivate CC in university students. Guided by the ACT model of cultural competence, transformational learning theory, and critical pedagogy, we conducted a qualitative study of student experiences with an AI-simulated debate platform that stages contested dialogues and provides rubric-based feedback. 32 undergraduates at a Thai university engaged in three debates and reflective questionnaire. Thematic analysis indicates meaningful growth across all ACT domains—Activating consciousness, Connecting relations, and Transforming practices. The AI-mediated simulations exposed learners to disorienting uncertainties, reconfiguring cognitive schemas, catalysing critical reflection, and prompting action oriented toward social justice; participants also reported heightened AI literacy. The intervention thus enabled transformative pedagogy across cultural contexts, while underscoring the imperative for universities to purposefully integrate AI in order to equip graduates with future-critical skills. However, remaining ambiguities concerning the shifting positionalities of educators, learners, and AI warrant further investigation.",

          "authors": "Wendy Wagenaar; Marieke Christina van Egmond; Joyce Bierbooms",
          "abstract": "Background: Digital health technologies offer promising opportunities to support physical health. However, their acceptance, use and associated benefits are not equally distributed across society. While existing research has mainly focused on traditional socioeconomic indicators, broader sociological influences, including economic, cultural, social and personal capital, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of these inequalities. Yet, too little is currently known about how these forms of capital relate to individuals’ intentions to acceptance and use digital health technologies.\n\nObjectives: This study aimed to: (1) identify distinct subgroups of individuals based on their acceptance and use of digital technologies to support their physical health; and (2) examine how these subgroups differ in terms of economic, cultural, social and personal capital.\n\nMethods: We used cross-sectional data from the LISS panel (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences), including data from the LISS Core Study on health, economic situation, and social integration and leisure. To supplement this data, we conducted an additional online survey in November 2023 via the LISS panel to assess participants' acceptance and use of digital technologies to support their physical health. The final sample included 1,096 participants. We applied three-step Latent Class Analysis to identify subgroups based on constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Post hoc comparisons were used to characterize the subgroups based on 22 indicators of economic, cultural, social and personal capital.\n\nResults: Five subgroups were identified: neutral users (43.8%), uninterested users (21.4%), engaged users (20.6%), resistant users (9.3%) and enthusiastic users (4.8%). The largest group, neutral users, neither fully adopted nor rejected digital technologies to support their physical health. Higher levels of economic, cultural and social capital were generally associated with greater acceptance and use of digital health technologies. However, personal capital showed a different pattern: neutral users reported low self-confidence despite moderate use, while resistant users reported high self-image despite low acceptance and use. This suggests that personal capital does not always align with traditional predictors of digital engagement.\n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the need to move beyond socioeconomic indicators when addressing digital health inequalities. Broader factors, including economic, cultural, social and personal capital, should be considered when developing strategies to promote equitable acceptance and use of digital health technologies across society.",

          "authors": "Maik Hamjediers",
          "abstract": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a turning point in European security politics. In this context, the population's willingness to fight is often interpreted as an indicator of societal inclination toward military self-defense and a precondition for strengthening defensive capacities. Yet, causal evidence on what shapes this willingness remains limited, and studies on the effects of Russia's invasion on public attitudes have been largely confined to European countries. I employ Russia's invasion within an unexpected event during survey design to estimate its impact on respondents' willingness to fight for their own country. Drawing on data from the World Values Survey in the Czech Republic and Uruguay, the analysis reveals a significant increase in willingness to fight among Czech respondents -- a country geographically and historically proximate to Russia -- but no comparable effect in Uruguay. These findings offer novel causal evidence that proximate interstate conflict can increase willingness to fight for one's country, which contributes to broader debates on conscription and military security.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the infrastructuring of the European Union’s Entry/Exit System (EES) at the juxtaposed border controls of the United Kingdom and France. Drawing on expert interviews, industry conferences, and fieldwork conducted at the ports of Dover, Calais, and the Eurotunnel terminals, it traces the detours EES has taken on its journey from imaginary to implementation in response to material, political, and technical challenges. Requirements for the system such as capturing fingerprints to fulfil eu-LISA's interoperability objectives and enrolling biometrics within ‘line of sight’ of a European border guard have created thorny problems at the Channel ports where travellers arrive to the border in vehicles rather than on foot. Solving these problems has necessitated hard infrastructures and political compromises which have provided opportunities for other actors to influence the sociodigital future of EES through infrastructuring their preferred solutions. The fact that what EES is and will be has changed substantially before it has even entered into operation, shows the moment of suspension, between when work on a system starts and before it is complete, to be a decisive one for materially intervening in sociodigitial futures in the making.",

          "authors": "Rotem Medzini",
          "abstract": "The ‘assurance problem’ has traditionally centred around verifying that ‘tangible’ products and services comply with legal or regulatory standards through state-led, self-regulatory, or third-party assurances. Its modern accounts focus on proving the trustworthiness of digital services, especially AI-powered ones. This paper applies the regulatory intermediation framework to assess whether third-party assurances, especially those provided by the European New Approach to Technical Harmonisation and Standards, effectively provide assurances, including digital assurances, compared to centralised, state-led authorities. It addresses three key questions: (1) Who are the regulatory intermediaries providing assurance for digital services under the New Approach? (2) How does reliance on these intermediaries differ across three regimes, specifically, the Medical Device Regulation, certifications under the General Data Protection Regulation, and the regulation of high-risk AI under the AI Act? (3) How do these intermediaries perceive the strengths and weaknesses of relying on third-party assurance under the New Approach in providing effective assurances when compared to centralised state-led approaches? This paper utilises document analysis, expert interviews, and stakeholder workshops to identify four key intermediary groups involved in standard setting and conformity assessment, and maps how the three regimes assign responsibilities to them to provide assurances to varying degrees. The paper then demonstrates how intermediaries perceive the strengths and weaknesses of these third-party assurances compared to centralised state-led assurances. It argues that their familiarity and knowledge regarding procedures, interactions, organisational structures, and routines related to their responsibilities can lead to more effective assurances, especially digital ones, with them acting as protectors of fundamental rights, health, and safety.",

          "authors": "Samuel Coavoux; Abel Aussant",
          "abstract": "Do digital technologies affect diversity in cultural tastes? Digital sociologists have warned of “filter bubbles,” attributed to shifts in the way culture is accessed online, and of persisting digital inequalities, while sociologists of culture have shown that diversity in consumption is valued as a marker of upper-middle-class status. Few empirical studies have connected these findings. We estimate the effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption using survey data from France. We apply template matching to adjust for six sets of confounders. We find a significant, positive effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption, measured by the number of cultural genres declared to be consumed, across three domains (music, movies, and TV shows) as well as on cosmopolitanism, measured by the propensity to watch movies and TV shows in a foreign language. The magnitude of this effect is relatively low for music(0.1 sd, 0.2 genres), intermediate for movies (0.2 sd, 0.6 genres), but high for TV shows (0.46 sd, 1.2 genres). The study brings new evidence against the filter bubble thesis; it shows that platforms do reinforce cultural inequalities by increasing the gap in consumption diversity between the working classes and the elite. It further suggests that the effect of technology on cultural consumption might be mainly mediated through its impact on cultural markets rather than changes in cultural experience.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

The Digital Ecology of Belief offers a systems-level framework for studying these recursive processes. It introduces two diagnostic constructs: spiral velocity, the rate at which beliefs consolidate, and epistemic friction, the resistance that slows, redirects, or fractures belief formation. The framework is organized into two layers. The Interaction Layer examines how infrastructural and interpretive forces shape belief trajectories through recursive feedback. The Cross-Platform Ecology layer shows how circulation across platforms accelerates, sustains, modifies, or destabilizes those trajectories. By integrating rhetorical, sociocultural, and cybernetic traditions with platform studies, the model explains how beliefs stabilize, reverse, or fracture in high-feedback systems. It offers a comparative vocabulary for analyzing how platforms shape conviction and provides a path for reconnecting fragmented communication theories with contemporary conditions.",

From the first sharpened stick to contemporary algorithms, functional artifacts accumulate meaning until the symbol eclipses the tool. Digital platforms accelerate this dynamic, manufacturing personalized illusions at planetary scale. Combining historical genealogy with three case studies: gamification, cryptocurrency, and the metaverse, I map a tri-phasic transformation: (1) pre-modern myths and rituals coordinated collective action; (2) modern promises of progress and control legitimated industrial rationalization; (3) digital engagement engines harvest behavioral data while posing as free, authentic connection. Drawing on Baudrillard, Debord, and Zuboff, I reveal the political economy that converts attention into profit yet sustains the appearance of choice. Contradictions remain: outages, opt-out movements, and open-source platforms expose cracks in the spectacle. I argue that symbolic beings cannot escape illusion; they can only inhabit it wisely. Four practices: illusion literacy, strategic inhabitation, temporal sovereignty, and creative misuse, outline how phronesis might redistribute agency within the fictions that make cooperation possible.",

          "authors": "ANGELICA JEANICE MARTINS ANDERSEN",
          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

          "abstract": "Do people define ethnic/racial categories more narrowly or weigh ascriptive criteria more strongly when material stakes incentivize others to identify in certain ways? Realistic group conflict theory predicts as much. We join this theory with recent research that treats ethnic/racial classification as an outcome. We report the results of conjoint survey experiments with two samples, one of undergraduates from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds, the other of U.S. resident adults. By randomly varying whether respondents racially classify hypothetical profiles completing a scholarship application or an anonymous survey, we examine under what conditions people are more or less likely to classify others as White, Black, Latino, Asian, MENA or POC. We also test whether classification relies more on ascriptive factors (skin tone or descent) when presumed benefits are involved. Our experiments uncover evidence that respondents rely more on ancestry when deciding whether scholarship candidates are White. However, for other classifications, the substantive differences between the scholarship and survey conditions are small, and respondents from different backgrounds behave similarly. These results are consistent with the basic thesis that stakes matter; they also highlight widely shared concerns about fairness and claiming disadvantage inappropriately.",

          "authors": "martina mchenga",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Corporal punishment by teachers remains one of the most pervasive forms of school-based violence in sub-Saharan Africa, undermining adolescent wellbeing and educational attainment despite statutory prohibitions. While most research has focused on prevalence, teacher behaviours, or household risk factors, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments shape their vulnerability to teacher violence.\n\nMethods: This study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five countries: Eswatini (2021), Mozambique (2019), Kenya (2019), Namibia (2019), and Lesotho (2018), focusing on 10,904 school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years. Logistic regression models estimated associations between individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes (measured using leave-one-out peer endorsement), and reported experience of teacher violence. Results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nFindings: show that 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher corporal punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, with peer endorsement averaging 53%. Adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of experiencing teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI:1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Gender moderated these associations: while boys were generally more exposed, girls who endorsed corporal punishment in pro-corporal peer contexts faced sharply elevated risks. Associations varied across countries, with the strongest effects in Kenya.\n\nConclusion: The findings highlight adolescents and peers as overlooked but critical drivers of school violence. Prevention strategies must therefore extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also shift adolescent attitudes, peer climates, and home–school linkages. Evidence from interventions such as the Good School Toolkit (Uganda), Green Dot bystander program (U.S.), and SASA! (Uganda) demonstrates that norms change is possible. Adapting such models to address corporal punishment could provide a sustainable pathway to safer schools across Africa.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the challenges and strategies of agricultural e-commerce platforms in enhancing digital visibility, with a focus on the case of Nông Sản Bán Buôn in Vietnam. Using a case study approach, the research highlights how early adoption of search engine optimization (SEO) enabled rapid growth, but also how structural vulnerabilities, shifting digital algorithms, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted platform stability. The findings show that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture face unique barriers to sustaining online presence, including limited resources, technological dependence, and competitive asymmetries compared to larger players. By situating these experiences within broader academic debates on digital marketing, platform economies, and rural development, the study contributes to understanding the systemic inequalities embedded in digital commerce. The paper concludes with practical recommendations for SMEs to diversify marketing strategies, balance SEO with multi-channel engagement, and strengthen resilience in rapidly changing digital environments.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a practitioner-led case study of Nông Sản Bán Buôn, a small agricultural e-commerce platform in Vietnam that aimed to connect rural producers to international markets. Unlike most research on digital trade which focuses on large platforms or macroeconomic policy, this study examines the practical barriers facing small, mission-driven ventures operating under resource constraints. Drawing on firsthand experience and qualitative documentation from 2017 to 2024, the paper identifies six core challenges: digital visibility, buyer trust, regulatory compliance, logistics infrastructure, access to capital, and pandemic-induced market shocks. The findings illustrate that technical innovation alone is insufficient for sustainability in emerging market contexts. Long-term success in agri-tech requires trust-building, inclusive infrastructure, and ecosystem-level coordination. This study contributes grounded insights to the literature on agricultural digital transformation and highlights policy directions to support small platforms in the Global South.",

          "abstract": "Most of the 7.1 million current global COVID deaths could likely have been prevented if the initial behavioral response in Wuhan, China had been different. Since the virus has spread globally, national death rates have varied from less than 1 to 660 deaths per 100,000. If all countries had responded like neighboring countries in Asia, half of global deaths could have been prevented. The United States with 1.2 million COVID deaths, 17% of the global total, has one of the highest COVID death rates, more than five times higher than expected from age, income, and temperature and more than six times the rate in Japan, which has more elderly. Five-year age-adjusted COVID death rates in US states vary from 66 to 410 per 100,000 in Non-Hispanic Whites, a six-fold difference. The state’s percentage of Trump votes in 2020 explains 51% of these differences, with death rates 69% higher in high vs low percentage states overall and 225% higher in 2021, the year with the most deaths. Residents of states with more Trump votes have been half as likely to be vaccinated and to practice social distancing. If the US had responded to COVID like Japan, almost a million American lives would have been saved. If all states had responded like the best Blue State, Hawaii, more than 900,000 lives would have been spared. In addition, using death certificate data, we estimate that the prevalence of Long COVID is 2.7 times higher in states with more vs less Trump votes (10.5±2.3% vs 3.8±1.2%). We discuss how three mental traits evolved through natural and sexual selection may help to explain such dysfunctional behavioral responses to life threatening danger: the tendency to form dominance hierarchies, rampant ingroup favoritism, and the often lethal combination of risk taking and overconfidence, especially in males.",

Healthcare professionals play a key role in addressing alcohol consumption, yet little is known about older adults’ attitudes towards these conversations. This study aimed to: 1) examine older adults’ attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations with GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and volunteers; and 2) explore associations between these attitudes and older adults’ socio-demographic characteristics and alcohol consumption.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey (N = 424) was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between personal characteristics and attitudes. \n\nResults: Support for routinely asking about alcohol consumption was highest for GPs (60.4%), followed by practice nurses (55.0%), district nurses (46.7%) and volunteers (17.5%). Older adults aged 75 and older were more likely to view alcohol use as a personal matter and were less likely to initiate conversations with GPs (OR 0.66, CI 0.43–1.00) or district nurses (OR 0.60, CI 0.38–0.94), compared to those younger than 75. High-risk drinkers were more likely to have negative attitudes towards district nurses routinely addressing alcohol consumption (OR 0.54, CI 0.29–0.99). \n\nConclusions: Attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations differ across healthcare professionals, with GPs viewed most favourably and volunteers least.

          "abstract": "This paper provides novel empirical evidence that the medium-term relationship between trade liberalization and growth varies substantially with countries’ economic structure. Using a multi-method strategy, I examine per capita income dynamics after tariff reductions in a panel of 161 countries from 1960 to 2019. Baseline local projections reveal a sharp divergence: GDP per capita rises in manufacturer countries following tariff reductions, and notably falls in nonmanufacturers. A local projections difference-in-differences framework strengthens the analysis by accounting for treatment effect heterogeneity and variation in treatment timing. Finally, I study tariff reductions during the WTO-era reform period (1986 to 1994), a policy episode that historical evidence supports as plausibly exogenous, providing complementary evidence that confirms the observed heterogeneity. An exploration of mechanisms using local projections links these patterns to shifts in productivity, capital stocks, and manufacturing shares in GDP, consistent with theoretical expectations. The findings suggest that rising protectionism in manufacturer countries may be harmful, while further liberalization in nonmanufacturers could have unintended consequences.",

          "abstract": "Peer review has long been regarded as a cornerstone of scholarly communication, ensuring high quality and credibility of published research. Although academic journals trace their origins back three centuries, the procedures for evaluating submissions, particularly peer review, have undergone continuous evolvement. Peer review’s formal institutionalization in the mid-20th century represents a significant, yet natural, phase in this ongoing transformation of scholarly communication. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (Business Process Model and Notation –BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.",

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

Most segregation metrics, however, rely on aggregate data with arbitrary spatial boundaries. The sensitivity of segregation measures to those boundaries is well theorized but rarely measured. Leveraging modern redistricting software, we simulate millions of alternative Census tract maps that satisfy Census guidelines, compute segregation for each, and recover the full probabilistic distribution of common indices. These simulations yield new estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and, crucially, measure the aggregation‑induced variability hidden in conventional estimates. Encouragingly, values calculated with official tract definitions closely track the mean of the simulated distribution, exhibiting only a slight upward bias, and segregation metrics shift modestly across maps—though variability grows in smaller cities. While our findings confirm the practical robustness of Census tracts, our data and software provide a general framework for diagnosing and correcting spatial‑aggregation error in other contexts.",

This paper contributes to the research on the politics of expertise by presenting the results of an innovative multi-level mini-public approach, in which citizens from five European countries – France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland – were asked to discuss and deliberate on questions relating to the place and role of experts in policymaking, scientific information, and communication. The results of these discus- sions not only yield more fine-grained and nuanced evidence on citizens’ attitudes on these topics than currently available via survey research but also allow for the formulation of actionable advice that will be of interest to policymakers at the national as well as EU level.",

While larger platforms such as YouTube and Meta have moderators in many languages, we find that millions of EU-based users on smaller platforms, including Twitter/X, post in languages without any human oversight. Even when languages have at least one moderator, moderator allocation varies widely and disproportionately to content volume, with Twitter/X mainly prioritizing English while YouTube invests proportionally more in other European languages. Across platforms, languages primarily spoken in the ‘Global South’—such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic—consistently receive proportionally fewer moderators than English, ranging from an average of 55% of English’s allocation on YouTube to only 7.5% on Twitter/X.

Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

          "abstract": "Are policies that contribute to reducing climate vulnerability electorally advantageous? Political science has long studied the politics of carbon dioxide mitigation, but we know less about the political logic of climate impacts. As adaptation lies at the intersection of environmental, social, and disaster policy, its electoral effects are puzzling from a theoretical perspective. We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles. In contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program. We also posit that reductions in reliance on inadequate water sources are a mechanism that explains this result. Our findings suggest that climate adaptation may be less contentious than mitigation, therefore giving politicians strong incentives to implement them. Moreover, we contribute to the climate politics literature by providing a theoretical framework to understand the political logic of adaptation action, regardless of its specific form or domain.",

          "title": "Elite philanthropy: how do we understand the givers? A scoping review of empirical research",
          "authors": "John CH Godfrey; Alexandra Williamson",
          "abstract": "Elite and Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) philanthropy is widely debated for its social impact, motivations, and consequences - yet much of this discourse relies on assumptions or theoretical critiques that lack a robust empirical base. This scoping review addresses this gap by systematically mapping published empirical research on elite philanthropy to answer a core question: what is actually known, where is evidence strong or weak, and how can future research be better directed? \n\nDrawing on 182 empirical studies identified through comprehensive database searches and citation analysis, this review shows that existing research is geographically skewed towards the United States and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal patterns in research themes, theoretical perspectives, and methodological choices - alongside major gaps, including limited studies in non-Western contexts, consequently failing to explore differing cultural and religious dimensions, and highlights the sparsity of empirical support for widely held critical assumptions. \n\nBy describing what the empirical literature does and does not show, this paper argues for a more globally inclusive, theoretically diverse, and methodologically rigorous research agenda. The review provides scholars and practitioners with an evidence-based foundation to challenge untested claims, develop new theory, and inform more effective philanthropic practice in an era of growing economic inequality and global wealth concentration.\n\nThe paper calls for more research into topics such as the philanthropy of younger entrepreneurs, gender dynamics, the influence of effective altruism, and recent global phenomena - including the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and technological innovation.",

          "title": "Sanctified Space and Sovereign Pews: A Land-Use History of Black Church Autonomy from Mainstream Denomination Architecture, Storefront Churches, and Mega Ministries",
          "authors": "Alicea Peyton",
          "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",

          "title": "Non-English Illness Narratives: New theoretical approaches",
          "authors": "Ayuno Kawakami",
          "abstract": "The necessity of advancing the study of illness narratives written in non-English languages and produced in non-Anglophone contexts, as well as for developing theoretical frameworks that account for the linguistic and cultural specificities of those settings is the argument of this paper. Specifically, it advocates for a linguistically and theoretically grounded approach to illness narratives that engages with the distinctive cultural and social background of Japan.\n\nIt examines how, in countries like Japan—where traditional patriarchal ideologies remain deeply rooted, and where women's speech and eloquence are often culturally devalued and suppressed—the theoretical framework of illness narratives, which centers on the act of \"telling\" as a form of self-expression, patient agency, and meaning-making, may not fully align with the cultural realities of Japanese society. Drawing on published Japanese illness narratives, this study highlights the discrepancies between these narrative theories—largely developed in Anglophone contexts—and the sociocultural conditions in Japan, where women have historically been valued more for their silence and obedience than for their ability to express or articulate their experiences.\n\nAnalysing illness narratives through published works, both fiction and nonfiction, has become a common methodological approach in the medical humanities. However, this practice often presumes that the texts being analysed are written in English. Examined in this study is how established methods of illness narrative analysis may encounter limitations when applied to a Japanese literary text: Mitomerarenu Yamai (1992) by Keiko Yanagisawa. The book is based on the author’s experience of living with an undiagnosed illness and feeling abandoned by the medical system, both as a woman and as a person. The interpretive dissonance that arises when theories developed in Anglophone contexts are applied to narratives shaped by different cultural and linguistic backgrounds is explored. Also reflected in the study is the discomfort that may emerge when researchers translate and present such illness narrative texts as though they were originally written in English without explaining how they were translated.\nUltimately, greater attention to the linguistic, gendered, and cultural dimensions of illness narratives is called for. The argument in this paper is for the inclusion of non-Anglophone perspectives, which have been largely overlooked, in the broader discourse of illness narratives, narrative medicine and the medical humanities.",
