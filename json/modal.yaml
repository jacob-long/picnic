title: "Building a Permanent Filter"
text: To filter journals, append the URL parameters `hide` and `show` and bookmark the resulting URL. For example by appending `?hide=JOC` to the `picnic.jacob-long.com/communication`, all articles from the Journal of Communication are hidden. To filter out content from multiple journals, use a comma separated list, i.e., `?hide=JOC,JCMC,CR`. To only show content from specific journals, use the `show` parameter, e.g., `?show=JOC,JCMC,CR`.
