          "authors": "ALBERT CHIU, XINGCHEN LAN, ZIYI LIU, YIQING XU",
          "abstract": "Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced numerous new estimators and procedures, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 studies from leading journals that employ TWFE models for causal inference using observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.",

          "title": "Beyond Retraumatization: Trauma-Informed Political Science Research",
          "authors": "Amanda Weiss",
          "abstract": "Ethics guides for political science instruct researchers to avoid retraumatization of human subjects (for example, APSA 2022; Fujii 2012). Meanwhile, human subject research on sensitive topics, including violence and repression, has increased. This paper clarifies what is at stake when we talk about research participant distress and provides recommendations for handling concerns about trauma and retraumatization. It offers a new framework for trauma-informed political science research. This framework reflects the conclusions of the empirical literature on the risk of distress in different research settings as well as critical normative perspectives on consequentialist research ethics. In particular, it identifies two approaches for trauma-informed political science research: one for research in less vulnerable contexts and one for research with contexts that are vulnerable in terms of limited resources, ongoing suffering, and/or geopolitical instability. The framework details best practices for informed consent, debriefing, and more within each approach. The paper also addresses the special challenges of political violence research. While the literature suggests that retraumatization as such is rarely a major risk of research, the paper highlights that a narrowly defined concept of retraumatization can lead us to neglect other trauma-informed concerns.",

          "authors": "Nathalie Giger, Miguel M. Pereira",
          "abstract": "A key challenge when surveying political elites is recruitment. Low response rates can lead to biased samples and underpowered designs, threatening the validity of descriptive and experimental scholarship. In a randomized control trial, we test the effects of sending postal invitations in a large survey of local elected officials. We find that German and UK local politicians are more likely to complete the survey if invited by postal mail, rather than simply by email. Recruitment mode does not impact the quality of responses but shapes the population of local officials recruited. Officials invited via postal letter were more likely to come from smaller municipalities and less likely to have a college degree. Costs per response are relatively high but can be reduced as we learn more about selection into elite surveys.",

          "authors": "Makito Takei",
          "abstract": "How can states credibly commit to peace and assure other countries? One source of credible assurance identified in previous studies is the cost to a state’s international reputation. When a state violates a prior commitment to peace, it suffers reputational damage, which can be costly in various ways. These reputational costs, in turn, serve as a tying-hands signal that enhances the credibility of peaceful commitments. Nonetheless, empirical research on whether and under what conditions such reputation costs arise remains limited. To address this gap, this study conducts a preregistered survey experiment in the United States, using a hypothetical scenario involving military buildups by China and Japan. The results indicate that violating commitments to peace undermines the credibility of future commitments, particularly when the violator is a rival country. These findings suggest that, with some limitations, international reputation costs can serve as a reliable mechanism for ensuring the credibility of assurances.",

          "authors": "Or Dar, Ronen Mandelkern",
          "abstract": "As consistent critics of neoliberalism, Radical Left parties have enjoyed a unique political position after the 2008 financial crisis. One main factor affecting these parties’ electoral success was whether they adopted more “flexible” political strategies and discourse that could appeal to a broader audience of voters. That raises the question of why only some Radical Left parties have adopted a “flexible” strategy while others have not. This article develops a novel theoretical framework to answer this question, arguing that the strategic choices of Radical Left parties were affected by a set of external conditions - primarily the severity of social and economic conditions and the features of political competition - and internal features - primarily ideological heritage and the degree of party leadership autonomy. Empirically, those findings are based on an extensive in-depth comparative analysis of six Radical Left parties in three countries: Denmark, France, and Spain.",

          "abstract": "We investigate a bracketing property that purports to yield upper- and lower bounds on the treatment effects obtained from a fixed effects (FE) and lagged dependent variable (LDV) model. Referencing both analytical results and a Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the conditions under which the bracketing property holds, confirming this to be the case when the data generating process (DGP) is characterized by either unobserved heterogeneity or feedback effects from a lagged dependent variable. However, when the DGP is characterized by both features simultaneously, we find that bracketing of the treatment effect only holds under certain conditions—but not in general. Practitioners can nevertheless obtain the lower bound estimate by referencing a model that includes both FE and an LDV. While the Nickell bias in the coefficient of the LDV is known to be of order $1/T$ , we show that the Nickell-type bias in the estimator of the treatment effect is of order $1/T^2$ .",

          "abstract": "How do voters make up their minds when voting on a citizens’ initiative? Motivated reasoning theory makes a strong case for a partisan bias in the way citizens process information, but empirical evidence is mixed. We offer a more systematic test of the “party over policy” argument by integrating prior attitudes into the analysis of how voters respond to cues and policy information. Results of a survey experiment with pre-post measures of vote intentions on a California citizen initiative on online sports betting in 2022 provide support for partisan motivated reasoning. Regardless of the direction of policy information, voters who change their minds tend to follow the cue of their preferred party, even when the cue contradicts their initial vote intention. These results have important normative and practical implications.",

          "authors": "Jaap van Slageren, Michelle Rosmalen, Hester I. Mennes",
          "abstract": "While democracy is meant for all, not all citizens feel equally confident to participate in it. This sense of confidence, often referred to as political efficacy, is important since it boosts citizens’ engagement with political democracy. The literature on political efficacy shows sharp sociodemographic inequalities in how self-efficacious citizens feel regarding political processes. These differences are already manifesting before adolescents formally take part in political democracy. Yet, there is limited understanding of how these inequalities develop over time and what accounts for these inequalities. In this paper, we analyze panel data among Dutch adolescents during their formative years (ages 12 to 16). The results demonstrate that internal and external political efficacy develop differently during adolescence; while internal political efficacy constantly rises, external political efficacy fluctuates more. In addition, while stark inequalities in internal political efficacy are already visible at age 12, these inequalities are less prominent in external political efficacy. The existing inequalities in internal and external efficacy, however, are substantially diminished by the time adolescents are 16 years old. Furthermore, political conversations with parents and peers correspond with growth in internal political efficacy but do not play a role in external political efficacy. Finally, contrary to our expectations, discussions with teachers play no role in the development of both political efficacy types. Our results show the stark distinct nature of internal and external political efficacy and that we should study them separately. Additionally, the results indicate that the sharp differences among adults are not yet solidified during adolescence.",

          "authors": "Daniel J. Hopkins, Gall Sigler",
          "abstract": "America’s major political parties have been riven by ideological factions which contest for power partly through partisan primaries. Ideological factions can only be grounded in voting behavior to the extent that primary voters are consistently ideological across primaries. Yet, prior research has relied overwhelmingly on cross-sectional analyses. This paper thus provides new, over-time evidence on the extent of ideological voting in partisan presidential and Senate primaries. It first uses population-based panel data which measures the same respondents’ presidential primary preferences in 2008, 2016, and 2020 to investigate ideology’s role in stabilizing primary vote choices. Across pairs of primaries, over one third of respondents prefer candidates representing different ideological factions within the same party. To extend these analyses to Senate races and address concerns about sampling biases, it also draws on precinct-level returns in five states’ primaries (2008–2024). Evidence from these varied sources points to one conclusion: ideological considerations influence primary voting, but their modest association with vote choice and limited over-time stability leaves substantial room for other factors.",

          "abstract": "The highly polarized nature of American politics today has been attributed, in part, to the power of partisanship as a social identity and the increasing alignment of party affiliation, political ideology, and other social identities. The overlap between political and racial identities in particular has been given much attention. The current report compares results from two cross‐categorization studies designed to (a) examine the relative weight of race and political identity in cooperative decision‐making and (b) to explore individual differences in pattern of response as a function of participant's own race and political ideology. Study 1 was a re‐analysis of data reported in an earlier research article by Ugular and colleagues (2023, Experiment 2) and Study 2 was a conceptual replication with some modifications. Results from both studies revealed significant interactions between participant identities and partner characteristics such that the relative effects of partner race and partner political ideology on cooperative behavior differed as a function of the combined racial (Black or White) and political (liberal or conservative) identity of the respondent. Similarities and differences in the pattern of results between the two studies are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of political polarization.",

          "abstract": "As societal conceptions of gender have evolved, so too have survey-based approaches to the measurement of gender. Yet, most research innovations and insights regarding the measurement of gender come from online or phone surveys in the Global North. We focus on face-to-face surveys in the Global South, specifically in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. Through in-person interviews, an online experiment, and survey experiments, we identify and assess an open-ended approach to incorporating respondent-provided gender identity in face-to-face interviews. Our results affirm that the measure is comparatively effective in minimizing discomfort and does not have substantial consequences for data quality across a diverse set of LAC countries. We discuss the potential traveling capacity of our approach and identify paths for further research on best practices in recording interviewee gender in face-to-face surveys in the LAC region and beyond.",

Evidence of this is shown through a brief overview of the limitations of LLMs and by searching for words that are disproportionately used by the most popular LLM, ChatGPT, in peer-reviewed articles. What is found is a rapid spike in the use of words that are unremarkable except for their popularity in ChatGPT’s output as determined by an AI professional. This shows that this method can be used to indicate the likelihood of plagiarism in a given article. It then concludes with the limitations of this keyword detection method and recommendations for limiting LLM plagiarism in the field of political science as a whole.",
