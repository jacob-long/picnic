          "authors": "Juan Felipe Campos-Contreras, Camilo Nieto-Matiz, Luis L. Schenoni",
          "abstract": "How do state interventions targeting illicit economies influence armed violence? Using Colombia as a critical case, we argue that aerial spraying of coca crops exacerbates violence by destabilizing local power dynamics and disrupting interactions among armed actors, civilians, and the state. Using municipal-level data from 2000 to 2015, we find that aerial spraying increases overall levels of violence in affected areas. Aerial spraying, we find, propitiates retaliatory violence against the state, stimulates turf wars between armed organizations, and produces civilian victimization. Moreover, we show that paramilitaries and criminal organizations respond more sharply to aerial spraying, escalating retaliation against the state and violence against civilians. By contrast, insurgent violence remains more consistent, driven by ideological goals and largely independent of eradication efforts. These findings reveal how fleeting large-scale interventions can inadvertently fuel conflict by altering the strategic equilibria of violent actors in illicit economies.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the extent to which local incidents of political violence reshape political competition. Specifically, the extent to which they influence party system fragmentation. It draws on data from over two thousand municipalities in Mexico across three consecutive elections (2018, 2021, and 2024), as well as on a series of generalized least squares models with random effects and clustered standard errors. These show that political violence significantly suppresses party system fragmentation, and that this suppressive effect intensifies over time. The study argues that political violence functions as a ‘shadow institution’ that mimics the effects of formal electoral rules by altering the costs, risks, and incentives of political participation. In all, this study highlights the need to account for both temporal dynamics and informal coercive pressures when analyzing the structure and evolution of party systems.",

          "authors": "David Randahl, Jonathan P. Williams, Håvard Hegre",
          "abstract": "Forecasting of armed conflicts is a critical area of research with the potential to save lives and mitigate suffering. While existing forecasting models offer valuable point predictions, they often lack individual-level uncertainty estimates, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. Several approaches exist to estimate uncertainty, such as parametric and Bayesian prediction intervals, bootstrapping, quantile regression, but these methods often rely on restrictive assumptions, struggle to provide well-calibrated intervals across the full range of outcomes, or are computationally intensive. Conformal prediction offers a model-agnostic alternative that guarantees a user-specified level of coverage but typically provides only marginal coverage, potentially resulting in non-uniform coverage across different regions of the outcome space. In this article, we introduce a novel extension called bin-conditional conformal prediction (BCCP), which enhances standard conformal prediction (SCP) by ensuring consistent coverage rates across user-defined subsets (bins) of the outcome variable. We apply BCCP to simulated data as well as the forecasting of fatalities from armed conflicts, and demonstrate that it provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across various ranges of the outcome. Compared to SCP, BCCP offers improved local coverage, though this comes at the cost of slightly wider prediction intervals.",

          "authors": "Bryan McLaughlin, Nathaniel Geiger, Pedro H. P. Rocha",
          "abstract": "Americans are increasingly unwilling to talk about politics with out-partisans. One potential barrier to such cross-cutting partisan conversations may be partisans’ tendency to stereotype out-partisans as lacking the deliberative traits necessary to have a productive conversation (i.e., partisan deliberative bias ). Here, three studies examine the presence of partisan deliberative bias, its relationship to cross-cutting political talk, and potential pathways to reducing partisan deliberative bias. Study 1 (two-wave panel; Wave-2 N = 695) provides evidence that partisans perceive out-partisans possess less deliberative traits than in-partisans and these perceptions are related to reduced cross-cutting political talk (at Time 2). Study 2 (experimental; N = 417) provides evidence that exposing individuals to more examples of out-partisans who display deliberative traits (vs. anti-deliberative traits) leads to increased perceptions that out-partisans possess deliberative traits, which is associated with greater willingness to engage in a political conversation. Study 3 (experimental; N = 825) provides evidence that a deliberative bias-correcting intervention can reduce stereotypes about out-party members’ deliberative traits. Further, findings from an alternative model that includes in-group favoritism suggest that perceptions of deliberative traits are significantly related to cross-cutting political talk even when accounting for affective polarization. Findings across all three studies are similar for Republican and Democratic participants. Taken holistically, these results highlight the prevalence of partisan deliberative bias, suggest that such bias reduces cross-cutting conversations, and provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to address this bias.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how public support for due process in corruption investigations is affected by partisan biases. Using a survey experiment conducted with a representative sample of Portuguese voters, it finds that voters' support for legally enshrined due process rights is conditional on their partisan alignment with the corruption suspects. Specifically, respondents exhibit greater support for due process protections for in‐party than for out‐party suspects, with out‐party derogation prevailing. By focusing on public attitudes towards legal fairness and horizontal accountability, these results expand our understanding of the role of partisan loyalties in accountability for corruption beyond their better‐known role in electoral processes.",

          "authors": "Nils B. Weidmann, Mats Faulborn, David García",
          "abstract": "Current political developments worldwide illustrate that research on democratic backsliding is as important as ever. A recent exchange in Political Science &amp; Politics (February 2024) highlighted again that the measurement of democracy remains a challenge. With many democracy indicators consisting of subjective assessments rather than factual observations, trends in democracy over time could be due to human biases in the coding of these indicators rather than empirical facts. This article leverages two cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for the coding of democracy indicators from the V-Dem project. With access to huge amounts of information, these models may be able to rate the many “soft” characteristics of regimes at substantially lower costs. Whereas LLM-generated codings largely align with expert coders for many countries, we show that when these models deviate from human assessments, they do so in different but consistent ways. Some LLMs are too pessimistic and others consistently overestimate the democratic quality of these countries. Although the combination of the two LLM codings can alleviate this concern, we conclude that it is difficult to replace human coders with LLMs because the extent and direction of these attitudes is not known a priori.",

          "title": "Introducing the American Women Political Leaders’ Operational Codes Dataset",
          "authors": "Baris Kesgin, Katherine Graham McCormick",
          "abstract": "Although women leaders assume prominent national offices in the United States (and the world), one of the well-established specializations in political science and psychology (i.e., leadership studies) is inundated with male-centric benchmarks. This research often relies on a reference group to develop leaders’ profiles in comparison to other elites. They are predominantly populated, however, with male leaders. This article suggests a remedy and introduces a women leaders reference group for operational code analysis, which is a quantitative approach measuring leaders’ beliefs about politics. We gathered American women leaders’ speeches from the Iowa State University Archives of Women’s Political Communication. Using an automated content analysis, we developed a norming group exclusively for American female politicians in national politics. Whereas our findings indicate noticeable differences and suggest similarities with existing reference groups, we aspire to initiate a conversation and hope that more data will follow and shed more light on women leaders. This reference group can serve as a crucial tool in providing contextualized political-personality profiles of American women leaders and also provide an illustrative example to bridge leadership and gender studies in advancing the study of women leaders in the United States (and beyond).",

          "abstract": "Student debt heavily shapes the life decisions and outlook of those living with it. This article examines the relationship between undergraduates’ views of President Joe Biden’s actions on student debt and their support for him in the 2024 election prior to his dropping out of the race. Using a representative survey from a large private university in the Northeast, we assess how student views of Biden’s handling of student loan relief correlated with voting intentions among registered student voters. Our analysis reveals that students who believed the Biden administration adequately addressed student debt were significantly more likely to support him compared to those who believed he had done too little. Additionally, our findings suggest that whereas increased student debt relief could have bolstered Biden’s support among liberal and very liberal students, its impact on moderate and conservative students was more limited. This study highlights the electoral implications of student debt relief policies, particularly in shaping young voters’ preferences, and it underscores the potential for targeted economic benefits to influence voter behavior in a highly polarized political environment.",

In this article, we investigate their claims about what drives differences between the two researcher led projects the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and ACLED. In the process, we address some general issues that arise in event data collection, including the importance of stable definitions, how demands on sourcing varies with the type of data collected, and how strategies for dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity impact the data. Contrary to the claims made in the target article, the differences between ACLED and UCDP in the cases put forth by the authors are not primarily due to differences in sourcing or inclusion thresholds. Analyzing the same cases, we show that most of the differences are due to auxiliary coding rules, standards for source evaluation and misrepresentations of UCDP data in the original article.",
