          "authors": "Rasmus Skytte",
          "abstract": "News media routinely offer cues about the stances of party elites, but to what extent do these cues shape the policy opinions of the public? While numerous experiments find that partisans adopt the stances of their leaders, these findings may not generalize easily to the context of real news, which often contains richer policy information and more subtle, ambiguous party cues than the artificial stimuli commonly employed. To investigate the impact of party cues as they naturally appear in news coverage—what I term real‐news party cues —I develop a new experimental paradigm. I first sample 70 articles covering political proposals from a large pool of real news and prepare two versions of each: one with and one without these cues. These articles then serve as stimuli in survey experiments among representative samples of Americans ( n  = 12,177). I find that real‐news party cues have mostly modest effects on policy opinions.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Maggie Penn, John W. Patty",
          "abstract": "Classification algorithms are increasingly important in areas such as obtaining credit, employment, health care, housing, law enforcement, and national security. These classification decisions affect people's lives and, accordingly, can shape their behaviors. We present a formal model of optimal classification by an algorithm designer who may want to affect the distribution of behavior in a population. Our model allows the designer to have a wide array of objectives (such as maximizing compliance or maximizing accuracy, among many others), and these objectives shape equilibrium behavioral outcomes in the population, sometimes in surprising ways. Our results also speak to questions of algorithmic fairness in settings where behavior and algorithms are interdependent, and where measures of fairness focusing on statistical parity across groups may not be appropriate.",

          "title": "How FDI reshapes host markets’ trade profile and politics",
          "authors": "In Song Kim, Steven Liao, Sayumi Miyano",
          "abstract": "A fast‐growing literature indicates that firms’ engagement in foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade is key to understanding deepening global value chains and their political implications. However, existing studies have mainly focused on the ramifications for FDI home countries while often overlooking the firm‐product level interactions between FDI and trade, where their interdependencies manifest. This study examines how firms’ FDI reshapes host countries’ trade profiles at this level, empowering new political coalitions for trade liberalization. Analyzing greenfield FDI projects globally since 2003, we find that hosts experienced an average increase of over 45 export products in the following year. To overcome the challenges of connecting firms to products, we link FDI data with Vietnamese customs records. We find that Vietnamese export (import) volumes of FDI‐related products increased by 90% (30%) within 4 years of initial investments. Importantly, these products also benefited from more substantial tariff cuts in bilateral Free Trade Agreements.",

          "authors": "Jintao Zhang",
          "abstract": "Despite the rapid growth of video-based memes, their actual influence on politics remains underexplored. This study investigates how political memes on TikTok affected the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Using a mixed-methods design, we combined expert evaluations of meme content ( N = 121) and a survey experiment ( N = 240) to assess the roles of humor level, knowledge quality, and candidate focus in affecting political outcomes. Structural equation modeling revealed that humor level significantly increased political engagement intention but had a negative direct effect on attitude change, while knowledge quality directly promoted attitude change. We also found that political cynicism moderated these effects: among cynical individuals, highly humorous memes more strongly boosted political engagement intention. Polarization analysis highlights that in-party memes reinforce existing beliefs, and Trump-focused or high knowledge quality content sways independent audiences. This study explores the complex dynamics of video-based memes, contributing to the understanding of digital media’s role in political processes.",

          "authors": "Lukáš Linek, Michael Škvrňák",
          "abstract": "Does state funding of parties lead to petrification of the party systems with very few new parties, or to competition that is more open where new parties proliferate? According to the cartel party thesis, the provision of state funding leads to the establishment of barriers to the entry of new parties. In contrast, strategic entry theory posits that state funding represents an electoral benefit and thus reduces the costs of entry; as a result, the electoral success of new parties should increase. This study covers 11 post-communist countries that joined the EU and analyses the relationships between state funding and new party support in 84 elections. Using various measures of state funding of parties (eligibility threshold, timing of financing, and amount of subsidies), this article shows a negative relationship between state funding of parties and electoral support of new parties.",

          "authors": "Adeline Lo, Santiago Olivella, Kosuke Imai",
          "abstract": "Many networks in political and social research are bipartite, connecting two distinct node types. A common example is cosponsorship networks, where legislators are linked through the bills they support. However, most bipartite network analyses in political science rely on statistical models fitted to a “projected” unipartite network. This approach can lead to aggregation bias and an artificially high degree of clustering, invalidating the study of group roles in network formation. To address these issues, we develop a statistical model of bipartite networks theorized to arise from group interactions, extending the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. Our model identifies groups within each node type that exhibit common edge formation patterns and incorporates node and dyad-level covariates as predictors of group membership and observed dyadic relations. We derive an efficient computational algorithm to fit the model and apply it to cosponsorship data from the United States Senate. We show that senators who were perfectly split along party lines remained productive and pass major legislation by forming non-partisan, power-brokering coalitions that found common ground through low-stakes bills. We also find evidence of reciprocity norms and policy expertise impacting cosponsorships. An open-source software package is available for researchers to replicate these insights.",

          "authors": "Yida Zhai",
          "abstract": "Emergencies and crises, such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, pose significant challenges to a country's governance, and public approval is crucial for effectively managing such crises. China and Japan are two East Asian countries that share Confucian cultural legacies but have undergone distinct political transformations since World War II. In light of these contextual differences, this study argues that the benevolent authority system of governance remains influential in China, while its influence has diminished in Japan, where public approval of the government is primarily rooted in democratic values. Using survey data from the general public in both countries, the results reveal that benevolent authority beliefs continue to sustain public approval in China, while their effects were insignificant in Japan. Democratic values were positively associated with public approval in Japan but negatively associated with that in China. Moreover, democratic values among younger generations in Japan were significantly lower than those of their older counterparts, whereas younger individuals in China exhibited higher levels of benevolent authority beliefs compared to the older generation. Economic recession and widening income inequality may help explain the conservative shift among younger generations.",

          "authors": "Donka Darpatova‐Hruzewicz, Paweł Boski",
          "abstract": "Prosocial collective action has been abundantly theorized across political and social science. Related scholarship tends to focus mostly on attitudes or intentions, and less often on actual behaviors. Moreover, emphasis is placed on individual prosocial acts and their aggregation rather than on conceptions of collective, nonreducible phenomena. In this study, we invoke metatheoretical systems thinking to examine more closely the emergence of political assemblages. Drawing on collective action and cultural psychology literature, we argue that in the aftermath of the Russian invasion, a unique climate (assemblage) of solidarity was created in Poland, one conducive to helping, constitutive of affective, discursive, axiological, ideological, and cultural components. The results of latent SEM provide evidence for excellent fit (robust CFI = .986) of the non‐recursive model (hypothesizing a reciprocal relationship between helping and affect) to the data from a nationwide sample of participants ( N = 1034). The model tested as invariant across three groups of participant‐helpers: (1) housing refugees, (2) volunteers, and (3) those helping indirectly. However, differences were found among these groups suggesting that the motivations for helping and the mechanisms involved were varied. Overall, the research highlights the centrality and reciprocity of affect in collective prosociality, as well as its axiological directionality through humanism, with political orientation serving a complementary mediating role.",

          "authors": "Michael J. Gigante, Justin Gest",
          "abstract": "Japan is one of the world’s fastest aging societies, with projections showing a population decline of almost 40 million people as the country grays during the next 40 years. By the end of this period, those aged 65 and older will comprise almost 40% of the population. Despite efforts to boost fertility rates and millions of septuagenarians working full-time, Japan remains one of the least receptive immigration destinations. In this study, we investigate how information about these demographic trends affect attitudes toward immigration. In a survey experiment with 1,000 Japanese voters, we evaluate the impact of exposing participants to demographic data on aging and its implications. The prime results in a 10-percentage-point increase in immigration support for the treatment group. Younger, urban respondents responded positively and elderly and rural respondents reacted less positively. Follow-up interview-based fieldwork reveals that restrictionist subgroups view a shrinking population as vulnerable to increased immigration, whereas other participants are less concerned with identity issues and more concerned with economic competitiveness. Taken together, this research provides a new understanding of Japan’s unique perceptions of immigration policy relative to peer countries, which may foreshadow political developments in Western democracies that are becoming increasingly xenophobic and increasingly older.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Issues and Leaders model for forecasting the 2024 U.S. presidential election’s popular vote, grounded in the theory of prospective voting. The model focuses on voter perceptions of candidates’ competence in handling key issues and leadership qualities, departing from traditional retrospective models based on incumbent performance and economic fundamentals. Designed with campaign strategy in mind, the model provides actionable insights for messaging and public positioning. Throughout the final 100 days of the campaign, it consistently predicted a close race. Its Election Eve forecast—a near tie with Donald Trump at 50.2% and Kamala Harris at 49.8% of the two-party vote—was more cautious than most polling-based forecasts, many of which showed a Harris lead. Ultimately, Trump won the popular vote by 1.5 points, and the model’s average error across the campaign was just 0.65 points. By emphasizing dynamic voter evaluations, the model offers a forward-looking framework for understanding electoral behavior and improving election forecasting.",
