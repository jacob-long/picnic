          "authors": "DANIEL STEVEN SMITH",
          "abstract": "A prominent literature on pre-modern warfare and institution-building holds that intense military competition in pre-modern Europe encouraged institutional innovations—for example, centralized bureaucracies and monopolies on coercion—that empowered rulers and enhanced state capacity, with salutary effects on long-run political development. States that adopted these innovations were more likely to survive, whereas those that did not succumbed to invading armies. Yet links between geopolitical competitiveness and capacity building are largely theorized and tested based on the European historical experience. A broader view of that period reveals a more complicated picture. The dominant mode of warfare throughout much of medieval and early modern Eurasia, Inner Asian cavalry warfare (IACW), favored succession institutions that selected for competent military leaders at the expense of long, secure reigns and cumulative capacity-building potential. I explore these links between IACW, succession practices, and rule duration with a novel dataset of over 300 Eurasian dynasties.",

          "authors": "Andrew Halterman, Katherine A. Keith",
          "abstract": "Codebooks—documents that operationalize concepts and outline annotation procedures—are used almost universally by social scientists when coding political texts. To code these texts automatically, researchers are increasingly turning to generative large language models (LLMs). However, there is limited empirical evidence on whether “off-the-shelf” LLMs faithfully follow real-world codebook operationalizations and measure complex political constructs with sufficient accuracy. To address this, we gather and curate three real-world political science codebooks—covering protest events, political violence, and manifestos—along with their unstructured texts and human-coded labels. We also propose a five-stage framework for codebook-LLM measurement: Preparing a codebook for both humans and LLMs, testing LLMs’ basic capabilities on a codebook, evaluating zero-shot measurement accuracy (i.e., off-the-shelf performance), analyzing errors, and further (parameter-efficient) supervised training of LLMs. We provide an empirical demonstration of this framework using our three codebook datasets and several pre-trained 7–12 billion open-weight LLMs. We find current open-weight LLMs have limitations in following codebooks zero-shot, but that supervised instruction-tuning can substantially improve performance. Rather than suggesting the “best” LLM, our contribution lies in our codebook datasets, evaluation framework, and guidance for applied researchers who wish to implement their own codebook-LLM measurement projects.",

          "authors": "David C. Francis, Robert Kubinec",
          "abstract": "This paper puts forward a theoretically derived measure of firm-level political influence defined over a sample of firms from a diverse set of countries, permitting new inferences into state-business relations. We derive this measure from original surveys of 27,613 firms in 41 countries, which include information on several interactions with political actors. Using a Bayesian item response theory measurement model that incorporates non-ignorable missing data, we estimate influence scores that incorporate survey data on diverse mechanisms by which firms attempt to obtain influence. From the measurement model, we learn that membership in a business association contains the most positive information about a firm’s influence, while bribes, state ownership, firm size, and a reliance on collective lobbying tend to be substitutes for influence in equilibrium. Empirically, we are able to show for the first time how such influence is distributed across different types of political regimes using a measurement model, leading to intriguing hypotheses about how the costs and benefits of political activity structure corporate influence-seeking.",

          "authors": "Natalie Ayers, Gary King, Zagreb Mukerjee, Dominic Skinnion",
          "abstract": "Teaching political methodology classes typically requires a set of technical, instructor-led lectures on sophisticated statistical concepts (such as probability modeling, inference, and proper interpretation), followed by chances for students to iteratively adjust methodological specifications, parameters, and data sets so they can understand how each combination affects the results. Iteration is essential to learning complicated concepts, but until now has required simultaneous mastery of a statistical programming language (such as R), which makes learning both harder. Teaching R the semester before would make methods classes easier but also delay research experiences and demotivate our students eager to begin substantive research. We address both problems through a new type of interactive teaching tool that lets students iterate while learning the big conceptual picture and all its separate parts, without having to simultaneously become programmers. We make this tool available for use in classes now (via one click in a web browser) and as an example of a new type of more friendly methods instruction for students and instructors alike.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented federal transfers to state and local governments. Did this funding benefit incumbent politicians electorally? The conditions that triggered this funding influx might also affect incumbents for other reasons. We therefore develop an instrument to predict allocations to states based on variation in congressional representation. Using over a decade of election data, we find that incumbents in state-wide races performed significantly better in 2020 and beyond in states that received more relief funding due to their overrepresentation in Congress. These results are robust across specifications and after adjusting for a variety of economic and political controls. We uncover larger effects for governors and other statewide executive office holders than for legislators, providing suggestive evidence on underlying mechanisms. This paper contributes to our understanding of economic voting during times of crisis, the downstream electoral consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of unequal political representation.",

          "authors": "Reinhard A. Weisser",
          "abstract": "Over the last decades, Europe has attracted an increasing number of internationally mobile students. The related influx of talent into European labour markets constituted an important factor in the knowledge economy. This research addresses the question of whether changing political landscapes in Europe, such as increasing support for right-wing parties, could translate into a diminishing attractiveness of European economies. To this end, international graduates’ staying behaviour in 27 European destination countries is compared based on bilateral stay rates for 144 countries of origin from 2009 to 2019. International graduates are found to display a notable sensitivity concerning the electorate’s preferences: If the potential median voter is located on the right of the political spectrum, the number of international graduates willing to stay declines by about one quarter. This effect is stronger in election years when voters’ political preferences become more salient. Further results suggest that international graduates are also more prone to leaving if the political centre erodes or one of the political fringes becomes too dominant. Eventually, this amounts to a considerable loss for European economies since international graduates have acquired destination country-specific human capital and are easily integrated into host societies.",

          "title": "When repression surprises: Contextual deviations and protest mobilization",
          "authors": "Hansol Kwak",
          "abstract": "Many studies examine whether state repression deters or increases protest mobilization, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. This study argues that mobilization depends less on the absolute level of repression than on how current repression deviates from what people have come to expect in a given context. It introduces discrepancy-based measures that capture these deviations relative to cumulative patterns of state violence, offering a context-sensitive alternative to conventional absolute measures such as fatality counts or arrests. Drawing on event-level data from ACLED, NAVCO, and SCAD, this article analyzes both country- and local-level panels using two-way fixed-effects regression and cumulative link mixed models. Across multiple datasets and specifications, the discrepancy measures consistently produce a U-shaped relationship: participation increases when repression is either higher or lower than established baselines. Comparisons with absolute measures show that the discrepancy approach more reliably explains variation in mobilization, helping to reconcile fragmented results in the repression–mobilization literature. These findings highlight the importance of expectations and contextual baselines in shaping how repression is interpreted and acted upon, suggesting that studies of contentious politics should move beyond static metrics toward measures that account for how actors evaluate state actions over time.",

          "abstract": "Populist leadership has surged globally, yet its influence on climate adaptation remains insufficiently explored. This study examines the effects of left-wing and right-wing populist regimes on national readiness for climate adaptation. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset encompassing 24 countries from 1995 to 2020, the analysis applies advanced econometric techniques, utilizing the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to assess changes in institutional and fiscal capacities for climate adaptation. The results indicate that (a) populist governments are generally associated with reduced readiness, with (b) left-wing populist regimes exhibiting the most significant decline. (c) The findings underscore the pivotal role of political ideology in shaping climate policy outcomes. This study highlights the politicization of climate governance and offers critical insights for public policy debates, demonstrating that leadership ideology substantially influences whether a country progresses toward or regresses from sustained climate change preparedness.",

          "abstract": "Do different economic shocks favor different types of political leadership? Using a survey experiment conducted on 3500 American respondents, we offer causal evidence for an unexpected relation between different types of economic shocks and a demand for a radical political response. First, we show that individuals believe politicians have a role in preventing layoffs due to both offshoring and automation, compared to run-of-the-mill bankruptcies. Second, we find strong evidence that economic shocks due to offshoring lead to greater demands for leaders who display authoritarian traits, with no equivalent effect for layoffs due to automation. When presented with news of an offshoring event, respondents favor leaders who claim to be more willing to flout the rule of law, to implement divisive policies, and to employ force. By contrast, traits commonly associated with populism, such as siding with “the people” or preferring political outsiders, see no association with either offshoring or automation shocks. Our findings support the view that some economic shocks provide a greater opportunity for political candidates willing to turn to radical political solutions.",
