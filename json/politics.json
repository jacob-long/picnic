          "abstract": "Why do individuals participate in civil conflict? Materialist explanations have dominated quantitative scholarship on the causes and conduct of civil wars. Yet, a substantial body of qualitative, historical, and ethnographic evidence suggests that nonmaterial, ideological motives contribute to individuals' decision to enter combat and their battlefield performance. We bridge these two perspectives by developing a model of civil war recruitment where potential fighters trade off ideological and material incentives to enlist. More ideologically committed individuals are (i) more willing to sacrifice income to enlist, (ii) more likely to exert greater effort in combat and accordingly are assigned to riskier tasks, and (iii) less responsive to changes in enlistment costs. Using detailed biographical data on members of the British Battalion of the Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War, we find support for all three implications. Individuals indeed trade off economic and ideological incentives to participate and perform in conflict.",

          "abstract": "US state legislatures are critical policymaking institutions that are increasingly polarized, yet data and measurement limitations have prevented researchers from understanding how state legislative elections contribute to this polarization. To address this gap, we construct new measures of candidate ideology based on campaign contributions and roll‐call votes, and we use them to offer the first systematic study of the relationship between candidate ideology and electoral outcomes in primary and general elections in state legislatures, 2000–2022. We find that the set of people running for state legislature has polarized substantially in recent decades. More‐moderate candidates enjoy a meaningful advantage in contested general elections, but that advantage has declined somewhat in recent years. At the same time, more‐extreme candidates are favored in contested primary elections. These new measures and data will allow researchers to build on these basic findings to understand how elections function in lower information, lower salience environments like American state legislatures.",

          "authors": "MARCO MORUCCI, MARGARET J. FOSTER, KAITLYN WEBSTER, SO JIN LEE, DAVID A. SIEGEL",
          "abstract": "Measurement is the weak link between theory and empirical test. Complex concepts such as ideology, identity, and legitimacy are difficult to measure; yet, without measurement that matches theoretical constructs, careful empirical studies may not be testing that which they had intended. Item response theory (IRT) models offer promise by producing transparent and improvable measures of latent factors thought to underlie behavior. Unfortunately, those factors have no intrinsic substantive interpretations. Prior solutions to the substantive interpretation problem require exogenous information about the units, such as legislators or survey respondents, which make up the data; limit analysis to one latent factor; and/or are difficult to generalize. We propose and validate a solution, IRT-M, that produces multiple, potentially correlated, generalizable, latent dimensions, each with substantive meaning that the analyst specifies before analysis to match theoretical concepts. We offer an R package and step-by-step instructions in its use, via an application to survey data.",

          "authors": "Theres Matthieß, Petra Vodová, Fraser McMillan",
          "abstract": "Pledge fulfilment studies frequently anticipate that party control of a given ministry increases the chance campaign promises within that brief will be enacted. However, existing evidence is mixed, and few studies have looked beyond ministers’ partisan affiliation. It stands to reason that other personal and political characteristics may influence ministers’ ability and motivation to pursue manifesto commitments from within government. Following the ministerial selection and survival literature, which shows that certain characteristics are prioritized by parties, in this paper we investigate the effect of ministers’ previous political and policy-relevant professional experience on the fulfilment of election pledges within their competence. We test these by combining existing election pledge data with information on ministers’ characteristics in five institutionally distinct, small-to-medium sized democracies: Austria, Canada, Czechia, Slovakia and Sweden. We demonstrate that prior ministerial experience enhances ministers’ capacity to deliver on party policy, but that other characteristics have varying effects cross-nationally.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies of party politics suggest that non-policy attributes, or valence, of political parties significantly influence voter decision-making. However, no research to date has established exactly what types of valence matter and how they interact with parties’ policy platforms. This study therefore conducted a conjoint experiment in Japan and found that voters care more about party valence attributes with respect to presence, power, and legislative productivity, as well as the prevalence of scandals, compared to the level of continuity and experience. This pattern persists regardless of electoral system and partisanship. The results also imply that valence is not a substitute for policy and that the effects of valence and policy behave additively. These findings paint a picture of electoral competition centered on both a party’s policy offerings and its ability to meaningfully engage in the legislature rather than its continuing existence or the prevalence of incumbent members.",

          "authors": "Nicolas Bichay",
          "abstract": "In recent history, the participation of far-right and far-left parties in government coalition has become quite a frequent occurrence in Europe. While much important work has been done analyzing the myriad effects of this quickening trend, one aspect of their participation remains unclear: what effect, if any, does serving in coalition government have on the party itself? There are clearly many pressures exerted on these politicians post-transition to governor, as factions often develop between those who wish to maintain their radical ideology and rhetoric, and those who instead feel a need to moderate and focus on competent governance. For a variety of strategic reasons, I argue in the aggregate we see far-right and far-left parties moderate while in office. I analyze European party manifestos and find robust evidence of post-coalition moderation. Party manifestos written by these parties in the aftermath of serving as a coalition partner tend to be much more moderate ideologically than manifestos published at any other point in time.",

          "authors": "Annika Björkdahl, Sofia Cognini",
          "abstract": "In the past years, anti-genderism has become a growing force in politics. The word ‘gender’ has become an empty signifier to attack queer and feminist agendas, sexual and reproductive rights but also gender studies scholars and courses. Social media, particularly Twitter stands out in the spread of anti-genderism despite its 280-character limit. Using political netnography and feminist critical discourse analysis, this article maps and analyses discursive patterns in the anti-gender tweets by Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the two faces of Italian right-wing politics. Applying a Foucauldian theoretical framework on power and knowledge, this article identifies ways of exercising epistemic power, as well as three discursive patterns associated with Salvini’s and Meloni’s anti-genderism, namely, appeals to the traditional family and the protection of children, whataboutism, and femonationalism. The theoretically informed analysis of the politicians’ tweets contributes to a deeper understanding of the Italian anti-gender movement and the relations between power and political language.",

          "authors": "André Luis Leite de Figueirêdo Sales",
          "abstract": "While global discontent with democracy has reached its highest rates since 1995, there is no consensus on what is causing so much democratic backsliding. In Brazil, scholars discussing how to reinvigorate citizens's trust in democratic systems emphasize the need for an understanding of political representation to include issues such as recognition, inclusion, and a thorough assessment of institutional affordances provided by the available instruments for mediation of conflictive political interests. Meanwhile, grassroots activists are exploring the space between civil society and the state to reshape political representation through collective candidacies and mandates. The former refers to organized groups of four or more activists campaigning together for a single seat in government office. The latter involves legislative seats run collaboratively by groups committed to sharing their representative power with their constituents during their term in office. Using abductive reasoning to discuss secondary data and review literature, the paper argues that: (a) growing dissatisfaction with democracy stems from a perceived decline in the ability of its established mechanisms to equitably aggregate and negotiate citizens' diverse interests; (b) power‐sharing, civic imaginaries, trust, mistrust, distrust, and interests are key psychopolitical elements that simultaneously inform citizens' skepticism about democratic institutions and are mobilized to rebuild these mechanisms. Presenting these experiments as products of the Brazilian political system's affordances and highlighting their relevance for creating accountable and inclusive institutions, the paper encourages political psychologists to apply their interdisciplinary tools to study democratic innovations emerging at the intersection of theory and practice.",

          "authors": "Julia Schnepf, Selma C. Rudert, Felicia Pratto",
          "abstract": "This research explores how individual status positions and changes within an economic game influence attributional biases and support for redistribution. Across three studies, participants were assigned roles as losers, winners, or observers of the game. In a pilot study, losers perceived the game as less fair, attributed others' failures more to external factors, and showed greater support for social game policies than winners. Two follow‐up studies replicated some of these findings and examined the additional effects of status changes, such as moving from loser to winner or vice versa. Contrary to expectations, transitioning from a winner to a loser did not reduce attributional biases or increase support for social policies. Notably, shifting from a loser to a winner position actually strengthened these biases. Consistent with our predictions, participants in stable conditions, like winner–winner or observer–observer, perceived the game as the most fair, while those in the loser–loser condition viewed it as the least fair. These findings highlight how status positions and changes influence perceptions of fairness and support for redistribution, with implications for understanding the psychological mechanisms behind attributional biases and policy support.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the hypothesis that the effects of objective and subjective socioeconomic status on Americans' economic and political attitudes are curvilinear in nature, with middle‐status Americans being more economically conservative and more opposed to welfare than linear trends suggest. Across five studies ( N = 9307), including data from Pew Research Data and the International Social Survey Programme, we consistently found that middle‐status participants opposed welfare programs and reported being more economically conservative than linear trends indicated, such that middle‐status Americans appeared more similar to high‐status Americans than previously considered. These results indicate curvilinear effects of status and suggest that middle‐status Americans may be overlooked in research focusing on linear effects of status on political and economic attitudes. Discussion surrounds the potential explanations for these curvilinear effects and the implications of these effects on economic and political outcomes as well as research on related topics.",

          "authors": "Marius Frenken, Roland Imhoff",
          "abstract": "In Western democracies, commentators have noted an unprecedented diversity in protest movements opposing ecological and health regulations, including traditional right‐wing authoritarians alongside conspiracy and spiritual believers. Some of these beliefs appear to be incompatible with one another, since authoritarianism is a hallmark of (extreme) right‐wing movements, while spirituality is typically expected to be more prevalent in liberal alternative milieus. This research aims to examine the co‐occurrence of these attitudes and their connection to the endorsement of illegal and violent protests. The study employed Latent Profile Analyses and moderated regressions on four extensive quota‐based datasets from Germany (total N = 8202), demonstrating that while most participants did not adhere to any of these beliefs, they often co‐occurred. Each of these beliefs was found to independently predict support for illegal and violent protests, even when controlling for anger. The findings suggest that political authoritarianism, conspiracy beliefs, and spirituality can exhibit a high degree of alignment in Western democracies. Moreover, the study discusses the potential implications of these beliefs as a threat to the democratic system, positing that they could legitimize violent protests.",

This study uses a MultiTrait MultiError approach to assess the data quality of issue questions by separating four sources of variation: trait, acquiescence, method, and random error. The questions generally achieved moderate data quality, with 76% on average representing valid variance. Random error made up the largest proportion of error (23%). Error due to method and acquiescence was small. We found that 5-point scales are generally better than 11-point scales, while answers by respondents with lower political sophistication achieved lower data quality.

          "abstract": "Using county-level voting data from the 2008 presidential election in New York State, we find evidence that durable cultural factors influence voting behavior. After controlling for contemporaneous socio-economic factors, our econometric models imply that antebellum votes—the 1860 vote for Lincoln and an 1846 referendum on black suffrage—have statistically significant predictive power for the 2008 vote for Barack Obama. Antebellum support for emancipation and the rights of blacks in New York emerged primarily in ‘Yankee’ counties founded by migrants from New England, the descendants of English Puritans. In contrast, so-called ‘Yorker’ counties founded by the Dutch or other groups were less amenable to reforms promoting racial equality. Our estimates indicate that differences in antebellum cultural factors predict an additional Obama vote of 2 − 4% points. This correlation of factors dated some 150 years apart suggests persistence of culture in voting behavior, and the consistency of moral expression in this voting behavior lends support to the ethical voter hypothesis.",
