          "authors": "THEODORE TALLENT, MALO JAN, LUIS SATTELMAYER",
          "abstract": "As climate change effects become increasingly salient, the need for stringent climate policies becomes more pressing. The implementation of such policies is often met with resistance from the public due to their perceived costs and distributional implications. Scholars have mostly focused on material compensations to increase public support among policy losers. This article goes beyond the existing literature by showing how what we term symbolic policies can enhance support for costlier policies. We define symbolic policies as policies sending meaningful messages to the public but having low material impacts. We argue that without changing the material costs that climate policies impose, symbolic policies increase public support by altering the message that costly policies convey. We demonstrate our argument using survey experiments and qualitative interviews conducted in France, showing that symbolic policies can significantly increase support for costly climate policies and increase perceptions of fairness, elite behavior, and government credibility.",

          "abstract": "A large literature explains the rise of populist parties with the economic insecurities stemming from globalization and technological change. But despite the long-standing focus of the comparative and international political economy literature on fiscal policy, these studies largely ignore governments and their economic policies. This article brings policy back into the picture by reviewing the research agenda on the political effects of fiscal policy, and fiscal austerity in particular. This research finds that governments, especially those with a large electoral margin, can implement austerity and still survive in office. Support for austerity varies with the composition of the austerity package, the public discourse, and the narratives to which voters are exposed. Nonetheless, austerity has important political effects even if governments do not collapse: They increase votes for nonmainstream, often populist, parties among economically vulnerable voters because austerity magnifies rather than alleviates the social risks of these voters.",

          "abstract": "The United States continues to evade scrutiny as a place that actively represses, expels, and rules over subsets of its population. This oversight has foreclosed investigation into the empirical relationship between digital technologies, civic engagement, and political control in the United States. For example, how are digital technologies used as a resource for the individual and collective power of marginalized people? How are digital technologies deployed to suppress or disorganize the individual and collective power of marginalized people? To integrate existing work and generate new lines of inquiry, we offer an analytical framework that centers the experiences of marginalized groups, interrogates the United States as a racial authoritarian democratic regime, and examines how institutions and actors leverage digital technologies in a complex political landscape. We argue that digital technologies can have both enhancing and destructive effects on the civic engagement and collective power of marginalized groups in the United States.",

          "authors": "Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Ignacio Jurado, Markus Wagner",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, support for the far right has surged in many countries. One common explanation for this is that far-right support is a backlash against left-wing governments and their policies. We investigate the causal effect of the partisan make-up of governments on the electoral results of far-right parties. Evidence from over-time comparative data and a quasi-experimental analysis based on a regression discontinuity design in Spain indicates that far-right parties benefit electorally when the current government is on the left. In further analyses, we employ a novel regression discontinuity design (RDD)-based sampling strategy to examine original individual-level survey data from Spanish municipalities close to the discontinuity cutoff. These data show that the likely mechanism underlying the backlash effect is an ideological shift to the right among the electorate when left-wing parties govern. Overall, the far right benefits more when the mainstream left governs than when the mainstream right does.",

          "abstract": "Political representation is challenged by social acceleration, the rise of populism, and electoral volatility. Politicians’ need for prioritizing time and energy is acute and consequential for democracy. Voters’ preferences constitute one democratically relevant standard for guiding such priorities. However, current research mainly focuses on voters’ preferences for representatives’ personality traits or policy outcomes, which are hard for an individual politician to control. This study provides a conceptual framework for analyzing politicians’ task priority by separating functional legislative tasks from relational representative tasks, and employs this framework in surveys among Danish, German, UK, and US voters. Analyses of open-ended answers, time allocations, and conjoint experiments show that voters assign higher importance to functional tasks compared to relational tasks. The framework offers a new approach to studying political representation in practice, and the results provide guidance for how politicians should prioritize scarce resources for political representation in a high-speed, volatile political context.",

          "authors": "Corinna Kroeber, Lena Stephan, Sarah C. Dingler, Camila Montero",
          "abstract": "Legislative oversight is an important element of the relationship between parliament and government. However, little research explores how the characteristics of ministers incentivize MPs to oversee some more thoroughly than others. This article studies whether and why the oversight activities of parliamentarians are shaped by ministers’ gender. We argue that legislators control women ministers more tightly than men due to stereotypical competence ascriptions and perceptions of lower trustworthiness of women. Studying original data for five European democracies since 1990, we show that legislators ask more written and oral questions to women compared to men ministers. Moreover, we underpin the causal mechanisms behind this pattern using semi-structured interviews with thirty-two parliamentarians inquiring about a specific replacement in that country. Revealing gender bias in legislative oversight has broader implications for women in government and parliamentary democracies.",

          "authors": "Natalia Umansky, Maël Kubli, Ana Kotarcic, Laura Bronner, Selina Kurer, Philip Grech, Dominik Hangartner, Fabrizio Gilardi, Karsten Donnay",
          "abstract": "Efforts to curb online hate speech depend on our ability to reliably detect it at scale. Previous studies have highlighted the strong zero-shot classification performance of large language models (LLMs), offering a potential tool to efficiently identify harmful content. Yet for complex and ambivalent tasks like hate speech detection, pre-trained LLMs can be insufficient and carry systemic biases. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for the given task and empirical context could help address these issues, but, as we demonstrate, the quality of data used for fine-tuning decisively matters. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini using a unique corpus of online comments annotated by diverse groups of coders with varying annotation quality: research assistants, activists, two kinds of crowd workers, and citizen scientists. We find that only annotations from those groups of annotators that are better than zero-shot GPT-4o-mini in recognizing hate speech improve the classification performance of the fine-tuned LLM. Specifically, fine-tuning using the highest-quality annotator group – trained research assistants – boosts classification performance by increasing the model’s precision without notably sacrificing the good recall of zero-shot GPT-4o-mini. In contrast, lower-quality annotations do not improve and may even decrease the ability to identify hate speech. By examining tasks reliant on human judgment and context, we offer insights that go beyond hate speech detection.",

          "authors": "Andreas Bågenholm, Stephen Dawson, Birgitta Niklasson, Jenny De Fine Licht, Elsa Höök",
          "abstract": "Why is compromising information about misconduct in political parties leaked to the media by party insiders? Drawing on previous research and interviews with political and investigative journalists, we hypothesize that such media disclosures are made with political intent and thus more likely when (1) party list nominations take place and (2) when parties are losing popular support. Through an analysis of 349 newspaper articles of misconduct in political parties leaked by party insiders to Swedish print media between 2010 and 2024, we find support for both expectations. We therefore conclude that intra-party leaks are indeed likely to be made with political intent, at least indirectly. This paper contributes novel theoretical and empirical insights to research on political parties, political scandals, and leaks and whistleblowing by illustrating the role media disclosures made by party insiders play in internal party power struggles.",

          "authors": "Hanspeter Kriesi, Chendi Wang, Argyrios Altiparmakis",
          "abstract": "Elections are not only verdicts on incumbents but also contests over the issues that parties emphasize. This paper asks whether parties’ issue-specific campaign strategies influence their electoral success, and how parties decide on those strategies. We leverage a new dataset on parties’ electoral campaign efforts in 15 European countries to examine three dimensions of campaign strategy: the salience of issues, the position they take on those issues, and the extremity or moderation of those positions. As for the parties’ strategic choices, the results confirm that European parties organize their issue-specific campaigns largely in line with their ideological positions and their status as challengers or mainstream parties. In response to the electoral effect of their campaign strategies, the results confirm the received wisdom that the parties’ issue-specific campaigns have only a limited effect on the electoral outcome. However, this general result has to be nuanced by party family: challengers and mainstream party families have benefited to varying degrees from their respective strategies. The effects of campaigns on electoral success are the largest for the radical right, which has benefited from putting the emphasis on cultural issues and taking clear-cut or even extreme positions on economic issues. Our findings shed new light on party responsiveness and the limits of political persuasion, showing when campaign appeals can sway voters and when structural factors trump campaign effects.",

          "abstract": "Some argue that the American public is extreme and polarized along party lines. Paradoxically, others argue that members of the public lack meaningful policy preferences and exhibit low constraint across issues. These conclusions are typically drawn from binary policy questions or scales with ambiguous values, both of which are ill-suited for measuring extremism, polarization, or constraint. In this paper, I reassess these claims by analyzing policy questions that allow respondents to express their preferences on a well-defined continuum. Across a wide range of issues, most Americans appear to have moderate preferences over policy. As expected, Democrats tend to be more liberal than Republicans, but there is significant overlap on every issue, and the average extent of disagreement is modest. Lastly, positions across issues appear more constrained than standard tests suggest.",

          "abstract": "Political participation is considered an important path for people to influence politics. However, whether those who participate actually see more of their preferred policies implemented remains an open question. We address this question by analyzing cross-national data connecting opinions to subsequent policy implementation on multiple policy issues. Based on an analysis of data on more than 270,000 survey respondents in 40 countries from 1996 to 2016, we show that voters are at most only slightly, but not substantially better represented than nonvoters. In contrast to the negligible effect sizes for voting, citizens who are active in multiple types of nonelectoral political activity are better represented than those who are inactive. We subsequently examine whether the observed relationships can be explained by socio-economic status, as well as attitudinal engagement such as political trust and political efficacy. Our findings show that the cross-national positive association between nonelectoral participation and opinion-policy congruence remains even when controlling for these factors. Our concluding discussion highlights directions for future research that pinpoint the causal mechanisms that link nonelectoral participation with subsequent opinion-policy congruence.",

We further analyzed how the erosion of these key values might be negatively associated with people's well‐being. We found support for our contentions through multiple studies, including a cross‐national study comprising 82 countries surveyed over 32 years (Study 1, n = 210,207). This large‐scale study was further supported by two experimental studies (Studies 2 and 3, n = 449) elucidating the mechanisms and causality involved in these processes. Our findings showed that corruption leads individuals to ascribe lower morality to politicians, which in turn is associated with lower perceptions of justice. Our data show that this process is negatively associated with well‐being, contributing to a broader understanding of how corruption impacts individuals and societies.",

Here we report on two surveys, exploring the relationship between affective style (i.e., the individual propensity to either tolerate, adjust, or conceal emotions) and social and political trust. We base our study on large‐n representative survey data from Denmark ( N = 1048) and the United States ( N = 1046), including the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) battery of questions. We observe strong cross‐country similarities that adjusting positively correlates with trust, while concealing negatively correlates with trust. We furthermore show that affective style contributes novel explanatory power beyond personality traits. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the role of emotions in politics, providing salient insights into individual ways of processing and responding to emotions and how that impacts politically salient outcome variables like trust.",

          "authors": "Thomas Leavitt, Viviana Rivera-Burgos",
          "abstract": "Researchers frequently deliver treatments through messages, as in many audit and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) experiments. These message-based experiments often hinge on intermediary variables—actions subjects must take to actually receive the treatment or control embedded in a message. Whether subjects open the message is a crucial intermediary step, which can serve as a condition for estimating downstream treatment effects or as an outcome of interest in its own right. Yet opens are often measured with error, most notably when some openers are misclassified as non-openers in email-based studies. We characterize the resulting bias, derive interpretable bounds on effects for well-defined subgroups, and provide sensitivity analyses for mismeasurement, thereby offering practical guidance for message-based experiments conducted through email and other communication technologies.",

          "authors": "Adam J. Ramey",
          "abstract": "Measuring party loyalty (and party effects, more broadly) in roll call voting has long been a contentious matter in the study of legislative behavior. While techniques for measurement in this arena are numerous, most of them suffer from a fatal flaw: they improperly (or insufficiently) separate measures of preferences from party effects. A significant part of this measurement challenge is the identification of (a) which roll calls leaders care about and (b) in which direction they desire their members to vote. In this paper, we use a novel dataset of party leader speeches from the 101st to 113th Congresses to develop a model of party loyalty and measure loyalty across members and time. Unlike existing techniques, we allow for party influence to vary across legislators and time. Additionally, our model provides estimates of legislator ideology and party loyalty disentangled from one another. Using these estimates, we explore the dynamics of loyalty in the contemporary Congress and unearth findings quite different from extant measures in the literature.",

          "authors": "Zach Warner, Garrett N. Vande Kamp, Soren Jordan",
          "abstract": "Many political science theories posit empirical relationships that are conditioned by some moderating variable, which scholars model using a multiplicative interaction term in a regression. In recent years, scholars have begun using such terms in dynamic regression models with time series data. However, the lack of guidance on adding multiplicative interactions to these workhorse models exposes problems with the consistency of the estimator, model restrictions, and interpretation. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidance to address these problems. First, we define the conditions under which scholars can ensure consistent estimates when estimating relationships conditioned by a moderating variable in dynamic models. Second, we introduce a general model that makes no theoretical assumptions about precisely how conditional relationships unfold over time. Third, we develop a flexible approach for interpreting such models. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework with simulation evidence and an empirical application.",

          "authors": "Jackie S.H. Wong",
          "abstract": "Is an autocracy’s official rhetoric a reliable proxy for forecasting military escalation? While the conventional hands-tying mechanism argues that official rhetoric binds leaders to stated positions and limits their ability to back down, recent scholarship on bluster suggests that autocracies may employ hawkish rhetoric to justify de-escalation ex-post. This study evaluates these competing perspectives by analyzing China’s official rhetoric and military behavior in the Taiwan Strait from 2016 to 2022. Employing a word-embedding approach, I construct an original Chinese-language lexicon capturing implicit threats from over two million state-media articles. I show that increases in China’s implicit threats toward Taiwan are associated with a higher likelihood of military escalation, implying that official rhetoric conveys predictive information rather than mere cheap talk.",

          "abstract": "Corruption indices can provide valuable insights into varying levels of misconduct across regions, but they may also encourage statistical discrimination by transferring group-level attributes onto individuals. This paper examines how information about within-country regional corruption affects perceptions and trust. Using a pre-registered online experiment, we matched participants with partners from three Russian regions that differ in their corruption rankings. Participants estimated how many individuals from each region would report a favorable outcome in a coin toss, and decided how much to trust them as first movers in a trust game. Knowing the corruption indices not only led participants to view individuals from more corrupt regions as more dishonest and less trustworthy, but this information also prompted them to see those from less corrupt regions as more honest and trustworthy. This widened the perceived differences in honesty and trustworthiness between residents from and less corrupt regions. When allowed to choose their sources of information, about half of the participants opted to view the corruption index, further magnifying these perception gaps. Our findings highlight how group-level corruption data can influence individual-level interactions and foster statistical discrimination.",

          "abstract": "We test a social media conversational agent for canvassing on the topic of anti-transgender prejudice, replicating and benchmarking treatment effects. In-person deep canvassing is the gold standard for durably changing attitudes on polarizing topics. However, door-to-door canvassing is costly, and many populations may not be feasibly reached in this manner. Campaigns are already conducting outreach using digital tools, including text messages and social media. If appropriately trained agents messaging over social media can achieve a fraction of the effect of in-person canvassing, canvassing may be scaled up to achieve large overall impacts at lower costs. Scripts used in this application are based on those used by transgender allies in the original study. To personalize messaging, the conversational agent uses natural language processing to detect conversational topics, and shares relevant pre-scripted messages of information and third-person experiences, encouraging respondents to engage in perspective-taking with respect to an outgroup. This study demonstrates the potential of automated social media messaging for deep canvassing, with possible applications by governments, public health agencies, and political organizations. Estimated effects are positive and significant under covariate adjustment and reweighting; due to important differential attrition, partial-identification bounds are also reported and include zero.",
