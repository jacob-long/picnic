          "abstract": "Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced numerous new estimators and procedures, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 studies from leading journals that employ TWFE models for causal inference using observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.",

          "title": "Beyond Retraumatization: Trauma-Informed Political Science Research",
          "authors": "Amanda Weiss",
          "abstract": "Ethics guides for political science instruct researchers to avoid retraumatization of human subjects (for example, APSA 2022; Fujii 2012). Meanwhile, human subject research on sensitive topics, including violence and repression, has increased. This paper clarifies what is at stake when we talk about research participant distress and provides recommendations for handling concerns about trauma and retraumatization. It offers a new framework for trauma-informed political science research. This framework reflects the conclusions of the empirical literature on the risk of distress in different research settings as well as critical normative perspectives on consequentialist research ethics. In particular, it identifies two approaches for trauma-informed political science research: one for research in less vulnerable contexts and one for research with contexts that are vulnerable in terms of limited resources, ongoing suffering, and/or geopolitical instability. The framework details best practices for informed consent, debriefing, and more within each approach. The paper also addresses the special challenges of political violence research. While the literature suggests that retraumatization as such is rarely a major risk of research, the paper highlights that a narrowly defined concept of retraumatization can lead us to neglect other trauma-informed concerns.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge when surveying political elites is recruitment. Low response rates can lead to biased samples and underpowered designs, threatening the validity of descriptive and experimental scholarship. In a randomized control trial, we test the effects of sending postal invitations in a large survey of local elected officials. We find that German and UK local politicians are more likely to complete the survey if invited by postal mail, rather than simply by email. Recruitment mode does not impact the quality of responses but shapes the population of local officials recruited. Officials invited via postal letter were more likely to come from smaller municipalities and less likely to have a college degree. Costs per response are relatively high but can be reduced as we learn more about selection into elite surveys.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that non-mainstream parties are expanding their issue emphasis beyond their owned issues. In this article, we expand this research to understand radical right parties’ environmental issue emphasis and what explains this increasing emphasis. We argue that radical right parties engage in a two-pronged strategy of responsiveness and differentiation on the environment. In response to green parties’ and the public’s increase in environmental salience and green parties’ polling success, radical right parties increase their emphasis on both the environment more generally and on environmental chauvinism, a particular nationalist brand of environmentalism. We demonstrate this using Twitter/X data from radical right parties in Western Europe from 2019 to 2021. These findings have important implications for understanding issue evolution and party competition in the changing party systems of Europe.",

          "abstract": "We investigate a bracketing property that purports to yield upper- and lower bounds on the treatment effects obtained from a fixed effects (FE) and lagged dependent variable (LDV) model. Referencing both analytical results and a Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the conditions under which the bracketing property holds, confirming this to be the case when the data generating process (DGP) is characterized by either unobserved heterogeneity or feedback effects from a lagged dependent variable. However, when the DGP is characterized by both features simultaneously, we find that bracketing of the treatment effect only holds under certain conditions—but not in general. Practitioners can nevertheless obtain the lower bound estimate by referencing a model that includes both FE and an LDV. While the Nickell bias in the coefficient of the LDV is known to be of order $1/T$ , we show that the Nickell-type bias in the estimator of the treatment effect is of order $1/T^2$ .",

          "authors": "Jaap van Slageren, Michelle Rosmalen, Hester I. Mennes",
          "abstract": "While democracy is meant for all, not all citizens feel equally confident to participate in it. This sense of confidence, often referred to as political efficacy, is important since it boosts citizens’ engagement with political democracy. The literature on political efficacy shows sharp sociodemographic inequalities in how self-efficacious citizens feel regarding political processes. These differences are already manifesting before adolescents formally take part in political democracy. Yet, there is limited understanding of how these inequalities develop over time and what accounts for these inequalities. In this paper, we analyze panel data among Dutch adolescents during their formative years (ages 12 to 16). The results demonstrate that internal and external political efficacy develop differently during adolescence; while internal political efficacy constantly rises, external political efficacy fluctuates more. In addition, while stark inequalities in internal political efficacy are already visible at age 12, these inequalities are less prominent in external political efficacy. The existing inequalities in internal and external efficacy, however, are substantially diminished by the time adolescents are 16 years old. Furthermore, political conversations with parents and peers correspond with growth in internal political efficacy but do not play a role in external political efficacy. Finally, contrary to our expectations, discussions with teachers play no role in the development of both political efficacy types. Our results show the stark distinct nature of internal and external political efficacy and that we should study them separately. Additionally, the results indicate that the sharp differences among adults are not yet solidified during adolescence.",

          "abstract": "When diversification becomes salient, a sizable share of white Americans experiences status threat and reacts with backlash. In this paper, we argue that status threat arises because white Americans tend to perceive racial minorities as competing outgroups, not as fellow Americans. Building on recent research suggesting that shared American identity primes can reduce partisan conflict, we test whether reminders of a shared American identity may reduce status threat and thus mitigate subsequent backlash. Across four experiments (total N = 4,062), we replicate status threat as the key mechanism between diversification salience and backlash. Despite various American identity primes and accounting for confounding variables, however, we find little indication that a shared American identity could reduce racial (and, in exploratory analyses, partisan) conflict in America. We discuss the implications for future research and the practical use of a shared American identity when little remains that is shared.",

          "abstract": "The highly polarized nature of American politics today has been attributed, in part, to the power of partisanship as a social identity and the increasing alignment of party affiliation, political ideology, and other social identities. The overlap between political and racial identities in particular has been given much attention. The current report compares results from two cross‐categorization studies designed to (a) examine the relative weight of race and political identity in cooperative decision‐making and (b) to explore individual differences in pattern of response as a function of participant's own race and political ideology. Study 1 was a re‐analysis of data reported in an earlier research article by Ugular and colleagues (2023, Experiment 2) and Study 2 was a conceptual replication with some modifications. Results from both studies revealed significant interactions between participant identities and partner characteristics such that the relative effects of partner race and partner political ideology on cooperative behavior differed as a function of the combined racial (Black or White) and political (liberal or conservative) identity of the respondent. Similarities and differences in the pattern of results between the two studies are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of political polarization.",

          "abstract": "As societal conceptions of gender have evolved, so too have survey-based approaches to the measurement of gender. Yet, most research innovations and insights regarding the measurement of gender come from online or phone surveys in the Global North. We focus on face-to-face surveys in the Global South, specifically in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. Through in-person interviews, an online experiment, and survey experiments, we identify and assess an open-ended approach to incorporating respondent-provided gender identity in face-to-face interviews. Our results affirm that the measure is comparatively effective in minimizing discomfort and does not have substantial consequences for data quality across a diverse set of LAC countries. We discuss the potential traveling capacity of our approach and identify paths for further research on best practices in recording interviewee gender in face-to-face surveys in the LAC region and beyond.",

Evidence of this is shown through a brief overview of the limitations of LLMs and by searching for words that are disproportionately used by the most popular LLM, ChatGPT, in peer-reviewed articles. What is found is a rapid spike in the use of words that are unremarkable except for their popularity in ChatGPT’s output as determined by an AI professional. This shows that this method can be used to indicate the likelihood of plagiarism in a given article. It then concludes with the limitations of this keyword detection method and recommendations for limiting LLM plagiarism in the field of political science as a whole.",

          "abstract": "This article theorizes hetero-modernity as generating the heterosexualization of modernity, enacting a colonial sexual order that attempts a queer-death project through the dialectics of (re)integration and elimination. It is, in essence, the colonization of sexual existence. The emergence of the hetero-modern world pursues queer death via multiple sites of violence—political, economic, and ontological—culminating in the systemic dehumanizing of queer subjects. This sexual domination produces and sustains manifold forms of anti-queer violence. As such, the article not only proffers the queering of modernity as a critique of sexuality but also provides an intersectional analysis with raced, classed, and gendered implications. By situating Black studies and queer studies in dialogic exchange, it contends that queering modernity necessitates queering universal emancipation for sexual liberation.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research has used exogenous shocks in voter turnout to analyze the relationship between turnout and election results. However, the findings of these studies with regard to the legitimacy of election results remain unclear because an increased turnout does not necessarily translate into an election result that is more representative of the entire electorate. We developed a new three-step method for elucidating the trade-off between turnout and the representativeness of election results and applied it to a referendum held in the Netherlands in 2018. First, we used regression analysis to decompose election results into the voting preferences of two voter groups: those who voted irrespective of any turnout shock and those who voted because they were affected by the shock. Second, we obtained an estimate of a fully representative counterfactual election result using the results of a survey. Third, we estimated how the exogenous shock affected the representativeness of the election result and analyzed the trade-off between turnout and representativeness.",

          "authors": "Juan Ignacio Martín-Legendre, Paolo Rungo",
          "abstract": "This paper argues that the characteristics of place of residence, be it urban or rural, influence how income inequality translates to political behavior. We build on previous research that posits an inverted U-shaped relationship: Rising inequality initially boosts turnout but ultimately discourages participation. We extend this framework by examining how location influences this association. In low-inequality contexts, the combination of institutional support for mobilization and increased awareness of inequality’s effects in large cities may lead to a steeper rise in turnout compared to small towns. Conversely, small towns may experience a sharper decline in turnout at high inequality levels due to heightened feelings of marginalization and disenfranchisement. Employing a panel data set of Spanish municipalities and an interaction-based regression model, our findings support the inverted U-shaped relationship and the moderating effect of location. Urban areas exhibit a stronger initial positive association between inequality and turnout, while rural areas and smaller cities see a steeper decline at high inequality levels. These results underscore the importance of social and geographical context in understanding the link between inequality and political participation.",

Key features include dividing districts into subdistricts with plurality voting, allocating proportional seats using a restricted Jefferson-D’Hondt method, and reducing the number of candidates per party. We explain the MLP system’s mechanics, simulate election results based on recent election data, and discuss variants. Expected political consequences include improved territorial representation, reduced intra-party competition, reduced voter cognitive overload, and stronger ties between voters and MPs.
