          "authors": "ALYSSA BATTISTONI",
          "abstract": "The low value of reproductive labor, and the related “crisis of care,” are often attributed to gendered attitudes about work. This article traces this explanation to the attempted synthesis of Marxist and feminist theories of ideology in the 1970s and offers a sympathetic critique with implications for both contemporary theories of labor and the “new ideology critique.” It reconstructs the explanatory role of ideology in feminist analyses of unwaged housework and tracks its uptake in theories of “reproductive labor” more broadly, via what I call the “naturalization thesis.” While these analyses have been influential, I show that they do not provide a convincing account of either gender oppression or the low value of reproductive labor. I offer an alternative explanation for the latter rooted in labor processes and patterns of capital accumulation and argue for the reintegration of ideology critique with the critique of political economy.",

          "authors": "ADAM MICHAEL AUERBACH, SHIKHAR SINGH, TARIQ THACHIL",
          "abstract": "Governments across the Global South have decentralized a degree of power to municipal authorities. Are local officials sufficiently knowledgeable about how to execute their expanded portfolio of responsibilities? Past studies have focused on whether citizens lack the requisite information to hold local officials accountable. We instead draw on extensive fieldwork and a novel survey of small-town politicians in India to show that local officials themselves have distressingly low levels of procedural knowledge on how to govern. We further show that procedural knowledge shapes the capabilities of officials to represent their constituents and that asymmetries in knowledge may blunt the representative potential of these bodies. Finally, we show that winning office does not provide an institutionalized pathway to knowledge acquisition, highlighting the need for policy-based solutions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing knowledge deficits among politicians, and not only citizens, to make local governance work.",

          "abstract": "We analyze the winner-loser gap in affective polarization. Using data from 37 countries over years 1996 – 2016 from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), we find that winners’ affective polarization is significantly greater than losers’, and the difference is due to winners’ consistently higher in-party favoritism. These findings are robust when controlling for partisanship and ideological distance to winning party. Although much of the literature focuses on the impact of out-party dislike on affective polarization, our results align with research in social identity theory indicating that intergroup discrimination is driven primarily by in-group favoritism rather than out-group dislike. Given that winners are more likely than losers to support their favored party’s violation of democratic norms, our work suggests that in-party favoritism is an important but overlooked contributor to problematic implications of affective polarization.",

          "abstract": "The party organization literature has long acknowledged that changes in a party’s internal power structure bring about changes in leadership personnel. However, empirical assessments of how such personnel changes relate to party behavior are rare. We explore personnel renewal in the party executive as a driver of party policy change and argue that focusing on these processes provides for an encompassing perspective on the connection between intra-party power and party behavior. Building on the party change literature, we theorize on personnel renewal in the party executive as a potential stand-alone driver of party policy change as well as on its interplay with other explanatory factors and test empirical implications based on all major Austrian parties (1949–2019). Findings suggest that personnel renewal in the party executive has a profound effect on party policy and that these personnel changes are in part driven by party performance.",

          "abstract": "Ostracism—being ignored and excluded—has been shown to fuel threats to democracies, including increased willingness to engage in violent actions, endorsement of partisan falsehoods, and belief in political conspiracy theories. Recently, low social belonging has been linked with lower voter turnout and increased populist party support, thus illustrating how an individual's social experiences may prove consequential for political processes. Importantly, low levels of belonging may originate from social ostracism, as ostracized individuals are denied social partaking by others. In a registered report, we analyzed large survey data including reported voting behavior in the past national election from 11 European countries, and we found that ostracism is associated with lower voter turnout. Ostracism was not connected to populist party vote, irrespective of their ideological orientation (far‐left vs. far‐right). The findings highlight the need to better understand and consider how individuals' social experiences are relevant in safeguarding modern democracies.",

          "abstract": "Scholars acknowledge that adolescents' political discussions with peers and adults contribute to political development, yet longitudinal relationships between discussions and political motivation remain unclear. To address this issue, we analyzed data from students enrolled in government courses at three Midwestern high schools, who completed political engagement surveys at the beginning and end of the spring 2016 semester ( N = 350; 47.8% Hispanic; 37.2% White; 53.7% male). Informed by theories of motivation and political socialization, we used cross‐lagged panel models to examine the longitudinal associations between the frequency of political discussions (with friends, classmates, teachers, and parents) and motivational constructs (political interest, internal and external political efficacy). Multigroup analyses examined differential effects for students with low, average, and high political open‐mindedness. Results indicated that frequency of political discussions with parents predicted later political motivation for adolescents with low open‐mindedness. Interest, internal and external political efficacy distinctively predicted types of discussions over time, with interest emerging as the most consistent predictor. Findings suggest that educational practices could better cultivate youth political motivation by considering fadeout effects for different types of conversational partners and tailoring discussions to suit adolescents' open‐mindedness.",

          "authors": "Kristin Layous, Negin R. Toosi, Gretchen M. Reevy",
          "abstract": "Because political leaders have the power to shape policy and social norms surrounding important societal issues, we wondered what U.S. politicians said following George Floyd's death. We gathered, coded, and analyzed the first relevant formal statement from members of the U.S. Senate (Study 1a; N = 94) and House of Representatives (Study 1b; N = 355), and participants rated deidentified versions of these statements (Study 2; N = 317). Across the U.S. Senate and House samples, even after controlling for potential covariates, Democrats were more likely to acknowledge harm toward the Black community, express forbearance, and call to repair the system (elements of an apology) whereas Republicans were more likely to praise the system, praise police, and condemn violent protests. In Study 2, we found that statements by Democrats were viewed as more effective than those by Republicans, and Democratic congressmembers were viewed more favorably overall by a relatively liberal sample. These participant ratings were partially explained by the coded statement content. Future research would do well to continue to explore what leaders say in the wake of tragedy, how the public receives these statements, and whether these statements are linked to positive change.",

          "authors": "Brian Libgober, Connor T. Jerzak",
          "abstract": "Scholars studying organizations often work with multiple datasets lacking shared identifiers or covariates. In such situations, researchers usually use approximate string (“fuzzy”) matching methods to combine datasets. String matching, although useful, faces fundamental challenges. Even where two strings appear similar to humans, fuzzy matching often struggles because it fails to adapt to the informativeness of the character combinations. In response, a number of machine learning methods have been developed to refine string matching. Yet, the effectiveness of these methods is limited by the size and diversity of training data. This paper introduces data from a prominent employment networking site (LinkedIn) as a massive training corpus to address these limitations. By leveraging information from the LinkedIn corpus regarding organizational name-to-name links, we incorporate trillions of name pair examples into various methods to enhance existing matching benchmarks and performance by explicitly maximizing match probabilities. We also show how relationships between organization names can be modeled using a network representation of the LinkedIn data. In illustrative merging tasks involving lobbying firms, we document improvements when using the LinkedIn corpus in matching calibration and make all data and methods open source.",

          "abstract": "Networks among legislators shape politics and policymaking within legislative institutions. In past work on legislative networks, the ties between legislators have been defined on those who serve in the same legislature or chamber. Online information networks, which have been found to play important roles in legislative communication at the national level, are not bounded by individual legislative bodies. We collect original data for over four thousand US state legislators and study patterns of connection among them on Twitter. We look at three types of Twitter networks—follower, retweets, and mentions. We describe these networks and estimate the relationships between ties and salient attributes of legislators. We find that networks are organized largely along geographic and partisan lines and that identity attributes—namely gender and race—exhibit strong associations with the formation of ties.",

          "abstract": "Lobbying expenditures are widely used as a proxy variable for measuring lobbying activity. However, the validity of this approach has rarely been examined and existing justifications do not account for heterogeneity in expenditure formats across types of lobbyists. I address the question using unique lobbying disclosure data from Wisconsin, where lobbying organizations report both expenditures on lobbying-related activities and lobbyists’ hours worked. Strong overall correlations between changes in expenditures and hours worked within organization–lobbyist dyads indicate that lobbying expenditures can serve as a reasonable proxy. However, caution is warranted due to substantial heterogeneity, with contract lobbyist relationships exhibiting weaker correlations than in-house relationships. I conclude by providing suggestions to improve empirical analyses that rely on lobbying expenditures.",

This work takes the perspective that individuals not only harbour selfish preferences regarding material possessions, but also experience emotions such as envy and guilt regarding the possessions of others. By exploring how these emotions, manifested as inequity aversion, shape collective decision-making, this research deviates from the predominant focus on self-interest. Instead, it delves into the influence of guilt and envy on distributive politics, proposing two sensible constraints on these emotions, called limited and chained other-regardingness . These domain conditions on social preferences are aligned with the empirical estimates of inequity aversion; and they aim to ensure the stability (non-emptiness), uniqueness, and fairness of the majority-rule core.",

          "authors": "Reut Itzkovitch-Malka",
          "abstract": "This study explores how a crisis situation affects voter bias towards women leaders. In an era of global pandemics, frequent climate disasters, economic recessions, and violent conflicts, this question is especially timely. Using an experimental research design, fielded prior the 2019 Israeli elections, we simulate a crisis in one of three policy areas. One typically regarded as masculine (defense), another as feminine (education), and a third with mixed perceptions (finance). We examine whether the framing of a crisis in one of these policy areas changes voters’ gender stereotypes regarding the suitability of women or men for the relevant ministerial positions. We then interact the crisis condition with voters’ gender baseline preference to see how their predispositions towards men and women in politics moderate the effect of a crisis on gender stereotypes. We find that while men are generally regarded as better suited to serve as Ministers of Defense and women to serve as Ministers of Education, a crisis situation increases the perceived suitability of men for both ministerial roles. Thus, a crisis situation strengthens the conventional notion of men as the most competent leaders. These effects are more pronounced among voters whose gender baseline preferences align with existing gender stereotypes.",
