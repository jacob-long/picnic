          "authors": "Allan Hsiao, Nicholas Kuipers",
          "abstract": "We surveyed voters and politicians in advance of the 2024 Indonesian election to measure preferences for environmental policy. We find that politicians underestimate voter concerns. We conducted an informational experiment with politicians to correct these misperceptions, and we document evidence of learning but no greater support for policy action. We explore three explanations for why voter preferences do not translate into policy. First, politicians only consider acting when their initial misperceptions are particularly large. Second, elite capture prevents politicians from implementing environmental protection. Third, voters prioritize progress in other domains. Our results underscore the multiplicity of challenges facing climate action.",

          "authors": "Harry Oppenheimer",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the first empirical analysis demonstrating how international security influences global data flows. Firms exchange data traffic to achieve fast, stable, and affordable access to digital infrastructure, driving digital interdependence. While international security shapes economic interdependence, the mechanisms linking the two – sanctions, tariffs, boycotts, and contracts – create little risk for Internet interconnection, which is commonly exempted from sanction and tariff regimes, not directly consumed by the public, and not enabled through traditional contracts. I theorize that international conflict generates cybersecurity externalities as state and non-state actors directly weaponize digital interdependence. Firms and their networks sit directly in the path of future conflicts. Leveraging network topographical measurements from computer engineering, I test whether conflict expectations increase states’ mutual reliance to move data. I find robust evidence that power politics shapes digital interdependence and use additional analyses to argue that externalities, rather than state preferences, drive this process.",

          "abstract": "Many countries struggle to heal the wounds caused by past governmental discrimination against minorities, a process sometimes made difficult by continuing instances of injustice. One tool to improve majority-minority relations is Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs), which document historical injustices. We collect data before and after the release of the Norwegian TRC report on the treatment of the Sámi and other national minorities, which allows us to investigate its effects on reconciliatory attitudes. We further leverage the unrelated outbreak of demonstrations against current injustices, allowing us to examine responses to both past and current injustices. We find greater support for some aspects of reconciliation, but mainly in areas with a small presence of national minorities. Our results show the limits of TRCs when current conflicts shape the interpretation of historical injustice.",

          "title": "The Backlash Against Civil Society Participation in International Organizations: The Case of Human Rights Complaints Mechanisms",
          "authors": "Christoph Valentin Steinert, Hannah Marietta Smidt",
          "abstract": "What are the repressive consequences of civil society participation in international human rights complaints mechanisms? Such mechanisms allow civil society actors to make governments’ human rights violations known to international organizations. International organizations can respond by ‘naming and shaming’ states. We expect that complaint-based shaming increases repression against civil society organizations (CSOs). In particular, governments exploit the specific and personalized information contained in complaint-based shaming to repress challengers and deter future complaints. We test our theory with three studies – (i) a cross-national analysis, (ii) a CSO-level analysis with original survey data, and (iii) a media-based analysis – using multiple identification strategies, including instrumental variables. Our evidence shows that shaming in response to complaints has detrimental effects for CSOs in both democracies and autocracies. Our findings highlight that personalized shaming creates the risk of targeted reprisals and call for reforms that take this risk more seriously.",

          "authors": "R. Michael Alvarez, Jacob Morrier",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a new approach for measuring the quality of answers in political question-and-answer sessions. We assess the quality of an answer based on how easily and accurately it can be recognized among a random set of candidate answers given the question’s text. This measure reflects the answer’s relevance and depth of engagement with the question. Drawing a parallel with semantic search, we can implement this approach by training a language model on the corpus of observed questions and answers without additional human-labeled data. We showcase and validate our methodology within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our analysis reveals that while some answers only have a weak semantic connection to questions, suggesting some evasion or obfuscation, they are generally at least moderately relevant, far exceeding what we would expect from random replies. We also find meaningful correlations between the quality of answers and the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions.",

          "abstract": "Since the Chilean social outburst in 2019, the country has experienced a process of political polarization and radicalization. The social support and participation in violent, disruptive, and radical protests rapidly increased, particularly among young individuals. However, in 2022, a rapid deradicalization process took place and ended with the constitutional proposal derived from the social outburst being rejected. Nowadays, national surveys reveal that the support for radical and violent protests decreased, and the support for police repression (earlier severely criticized) increased. This rapid and unprecedented process of radicalization and deradicalization invites the exploration and identification of the factors associated with the deradicalization of opinions in young people. With this view, we will conduct qualitative research using semi‐structured interviews with a sample of male and female young adults that radicalized their opinions due to the outbreak in 2019 and changed their minds later on.",

          "authors": "Colin R. Case, Rachel Porter",
          "abstract": "Political professionals and scholars maintain that raising money early in the election season is critical to a successful campaign, having downstream consequences on a candidate’s future fundraising potential, the stiffness of competition she will face, and her likelihood of electoral victory. In spite of early money’s perceived importance, there is no common operationalization for money as “early.” Moreover, existing measures often fail to reflect definitional aspects of early money. In this paper, we first lay out a theoretical framework regarding the utility of early campaign fundraising for candidates. We argue that early fundraising can be expressed as two conceptually distinct quantities of interest centered on either a candidate’s own fundraising performance (candidate-centered) or her fundraising performance relative to her electoral competitors (election-centered). We next lay out steps for operationalizing candidate- and election-centered measures of early fundraising. Lastly, we demonstrate that both our proposed measures for early campaign fundraising are predictive of a candidate’s future fundraising and electoral success. By putting forward a set of best practices for early money measurement and, additionally, producing off-the-shelf measures for early fundraising in U.S. House elections, we fill an important gap in scholarly research on the measurement of money in politics.",

          "abstract": "How did the COVID-19 outbreak affect citizens’ democratic preferences? Were the changes persistent or temporary? We track a representative sample of Spanish citizens before, during, and after the pandemic, with eight survey waves from January 2020 to January 2024. We compare democratic attitudes before and after the pandemic with individual fixed effects models. We identify a sharp increase in preferences for technical rather than ideological policy-making at the very onset of the pandemic, as well as significant changes in voters’ preferences for competent rather than honest politicians. These changes are sudden and persistent over 4 years. Using a set of repeated survey experiments, we also document a widespread willingness to sacrifice rights and freedoms to deal with the pandemic as compared to other global threats, such as international terrorism and climate change. But this effect quickly faded over time. Overall, we identify significant changes in democratic attitudes during the pandemic and a durable shift in technocratic preferences that outlived the pandemic, setting the conditions for the long-term legacies of COVID-19 on democracy.",

          "authors": "Marnie Howlett, Lauren C. Konken",
          "abstract": "The “home–field” dichotomy has long been a core assumption of fieldwork in political science. As in other social science disciplines, political scientists rely on these categories to contextualize our research within particular time–space nexuses and to separate our personal lives and private dwellings and institutions from our sources, participants, and broader research environments. Although the spatial, temporal, and emotional divisions between our “homes” and “fields” have always been arbitrary, they are increasingly blurred when we use remote and online methods for research, especially for qualitative studies. This article problematizes the home–field dichotomy within the context of remote and online political science field research. We contend that the overlap of our homes and fields in digital fieldwork poses different challenges for our professional boundaries than offline research, particularly in terms of separating our personal and research lives, mitigating risk, and protecting our mental health. Given the growing use of remote and online methods, we argue that the discipline of political science must account more seriously for the muddling of our homes and fields to support rigorous, transparent, and ethical empirical research.",

          "authors": "Ricardo R. Noé",
          "abstract": "How do political leaders in states with limited institutional constraints enforce property rights? In 20th-century Guatemala, German coffee producers benefited from the country’s export-led growth policies—trade agreements, land grants, and infrastructure concessions that allowed them to become the primary producers of the country’s coffee. The security of their property rights depended on their contributions to government revenue through the production of coffee and customs duties. When contributions declined during both world wars, so did security of ownership, leading to two bouts of large-scale expropriation—during the dictatorships of Manuel Estrada (1898–1920) and Jorge Ubico (1931–44). Through a comparative analysis of the two regimes that draws from original qualitative and quantitative evidence, this article argues that political leaders limit expropriation to encourage production and maximize government revenue. However, when revenue falls below the expected gains from expropriation, the likelihood of state appropriation of property rights—whether through asset seizure or regulatory restrictions—increases.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Rivera, Fernando Severino, Giancarlo Visconti",
          "abstract": "People living in communities where protests occur are exposed to various forms of violence, including state-perpetrated violence, such as police brutality, as well as violence from protesters, such as riots and looting. Does exposure to such protests influence people’s support for violence, whether from the state or protesters? To address this question, we analyze data from a multi-year panel study conducted in Chile (2016–2022) to examine how the massive demonstrations of 2019 shaped attitudes toward violence. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that exposure to protests decreases support for state repression, but only for a short time. However, such exposure does not significantly influence support for the violence perpetrated by protesters. This nuanced understanding of attitudes toward violence provides new evidence to explain the support for different forms of violent actions during social movements.",

Existing experimental studies, however, have found relatively little support for that conjecture. In this note, we extend this line of research by exploring whether language impacts perceptions about unauthorized immigrants, such as their association with criminal behavior. Our study uses a conjoint design with experimentally manipulated instructions: respondents are randomly asked to identify profiles that belong to “illegal” or “undocumented” immigrants. We find that language used in the conjoint instructions does not impact perceptions about unauthorized population. At the same time, our observational results show that respondents’ preferences for terms “illegal” and “undocumented” are related to attitudes toward immigration. We discuss the implication of these results for the debate regarding the role of labels in political conflict over immigration.",
