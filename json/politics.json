          "abstract": "No systematic framework exists to analyze the different forms of fictions in politics. We develop the concept of fictive politics to illuminate how actors simulate selective, alternative, or entirely fictional representations of reality while dissimulating incompatible facts. We distinguish three ideal types: deceptions, where audiences are unaware that they are facing a fiction; veiled facts, where audiences suspect a fiction but choose not to probe it; and open fictions, where audiences are fully aware that they are witnessing a fiction. We show that fictions answer critical political needs, including maintaining systems of domination, managing conflicts between competing interests and values, and facilitating cooperation between state and society.",

          "authors": "Adrián Lucardi, Agustín Vallejo, Germán Feierherd",
          "abstract": "Successful coordination around a Duvergerian equilibrium requires accurate and consistent information about parties’ expected electoral support. In practice, such information is often unreliable and rarely available at the local level, thus hindering voters’ coordination. In this paper, we leverage Argentina’s Open, Mandatory, and Simultaneous Primary Elections as a large-scale survey of voter preferences. Using data from 135 municipalities in the province of Buenos Aires (2011–23), we show that a narrower margin between the top-two placed parties in the primary increases both turnout and the proportion of positive votes in the general election, while decreasing electoral fragmentation. We further show that the second-placed party in the primary is substantially more likely to win the election than the third-placed one. Also consistent with theory, these effects are more pronounced (a) in concurrent elections; (b) in smaller municipalities; and (c) when the second-placed party is closer to the first-placed one.",

          "authors": "Natalia Umansky, Maël Kubli, Ana Kotarcic, Laura Bronner, Selina Kurer, Philip Grech, Dominik Hangartner, Fabrizio Gilardi, Karsten Donnay",
          "abstract": "Efforts to curb online hate speech depend on our ability to reliably detect it at scale. Previous studies have highlighted the strong zero-shot classification performance of large language models (LLMs), offering a potential tool to efficiently identify harmful content. Yet for complex and ambivalent tasks like hate speech detection, pre-trained LLMs can be insufficient and carry systemic biases. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for the given task and empirical context could help address these issues, but, as we demonstrate, the quality of data used for fine-tuning decisively matters. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini using a unique corpus of online comments annotated by diverse groups of coders with varying annotation quality: research assistants, activists, two kinds of crowd workers, and citizen scientists. We find that only annotations from those groups of annotators that are better than zero-shot GPT-4o-mini in recognizing hate speech improve the classification performance of the fine-tuned LLM. Specifically, fine-tuning using the highest-quality annotator group – trained research assistants – boosts classification performance by increasing the model’s precision without notably sacrificing the good recall of zero-shot GPT-4o-mini. In contrast, lower-quality annotations do not improve and may even decrease the ability to identify hate speech. By examining tasks reliant on human judgment and context, we offer insights that go beyond hate speech detection.",

          "title": "From context to congruence: Immigration salience and voter socialization",
          "authors": "Leonardo Carella, Francesco Raffaelli",
          "abstract": "This paper considers how issue salience environments affect long-term patterns of political choice via processes of political socialization. Drawing on the well-known ‘impressionable years’ hypothesis, we theorize that voters who grew up in high-immigration salience contexts subsequently exhibit higher levels of voter-party agreement on immigration (issue congruence). We find support for this hypothesis from two studies, which leverage cross-sectional variation within cohorts in exposure to immigration salience in voters’ formative years. The first employs congruence data from a survey of 10 European countries, linked to historical salience data from the Comparative Manifesto Project. The second is a within-country study, measuring salience and congruence from two long-running German public opinion survey series. The analysis suggests that growing up at times when immigration is high on the political agenda can have long-term consequences for the relationship between voters’ preferences on that issue and their political choices, shedding light on the mechanism behind ‘generational realignment’.",

          "abstract": "We examine whether different information frames affect how people perceive the domestic costs of sanctions and support sanctions. Using data from an information provision experiment in Germany and Poland, we demonstrate that people overestimate the costs of sanctions (Gross Domestic Product loss due to an energy embargo) in sending countries. Yet, this perception can be corrected through the provision of actual information, which in turn enhances the support for the sanction. Contrasting sanctions’ costs with other costs – Covid-19 costs and costs imposed on target countries – has no additional effect.",

          "abstract": "New parties have emerged across European democracies, forcing established parties to develop strategies to campaign against them. But how do supporters want their established parties to respond to these new parties? Using survey experiments in 14 European countries, we examine how party supporters react to responses their preferred parties might take to the rise of a hypothetical new party. Our results primarily highlight that voters care about substantive representation. They endorse accommodative responses towards a new party offering a policy they agree with. Thus, the extent to which party responses bind supporters to established parties is highly contingent on the distribution of policy positions among their supporters. Often, established parties must walk a precarious tightrope, balancing the need for unity with some degree of tolerance for dissent. Hence, our results explain why parties accommodate the position of new parties, despite recent evidence that doing so can be electorally detrimental.",

          "abstract": "The article examines the impact of the recent crises – the Eurozone crisis, the refugee crisis, Brexit, COVID-19, and the war in Ukraine – on the structuration of party competition in six Northwestern European countries. Situating the multiple crises in a long-term perspective on the transformation of party systems, we emphasize their reinforcing effect on the structuring capacity of the new cultural divide. In some countries, this divide and its main driving forces have become so powerful in transforming the political space that we observe an emerging multi-polar pattern of party configurations. This pattern is characterized by a green new left opposed to the populist radical right on the new cultural dimension. In contrast, the center-left and the center-right, despite converging, still oppose each other on the economic dimension. Empirically, the article examines election campaigns in Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, drawing on the original PolDem relational content analysis of mass media coverage published before national elections from the 1970s up to 2022.",

          "authors": "Lucienne Engelhardt",
          "abstract": "Far-right communication often portrays a division between ‘the people’ and perceived antagonists, potentially fuelling intergroup tensions. A pivotal element is the politicisation of religion: in Christian-shaped regions, far-right parties invoke Christianity as part of Western identity – despite their weak religious ties and growing secularisation. This paradox raises questions about religion’s function in far-right discourse. I argue that far-right parties systematically use a conservative reading of Christianity as a demarcation tool – marking not only Islam but also cultural liberalism as incompatible with a Christian-framed ingroup. Using parliamentary data from Europe, I conduct automated text classification to identify religious markers and their co-occurrence with inclusionary–exclusionary rhetoric across countries and over time. Results reveal group-specific framing, distinct patterns of religious invocation compared to other parties, and links of these patterns to events. This study demonstrates how Christian narratives serve as rhetorical resources for boundary construction, challenging the cohesion of even secularised societies.",

          "abstract": "In this research, we argue that corruption adversely affects individuals' perceived morality of politicians and their sense of justice, eroding some key values by which societies are guided. We further analyzed how the erosion of these key values might be negatively associated with people's well‐being. We found support for our contentions through multiple studies, including a cross‐national study comprising 82 countries surveyed over 32 years (Study 1, n = 210,207). This large‐scale study was further supported by two experimental studies (Studies 2 and 3, n = 449) elucidating the mechanisms and causality involved in these processes. Our findings showed that corruption leads individuals to ascribe lower morality to politicians, which in turn is associated with lower perceptions of justice. Our data show that this process is negatively associated with well‐being, contributing to a broader understanding of how corruption impacts individuals and societies.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the relationship between collective and individual forms of narcissism and two contrarian political orientations that are oppositional and purposefully destructive—need for chaos and anti‐establishment orientation. In three studies (total N = 4144), we demonstrate that (1) national collective narcissism independently predicts higher need for chaos and anti‐establishment orientation, (2) non‐narcissistic ingroup satisfaction independently predicts lower levels of both contrarian orientations, (3) grandiose narcissism independently predicts higher need for chaos but not anti‐establishment orientation, and (4) vulnerable narcissism independently predicts higher levels of both outcomes. We provide evidence for these relationships in cross‐sectional regression analyses and in panel analyses that examine within‐person construct changes from before to after the 2023 Polish election and better account for time‐invariant confounders. Together, these findings suggest contrarian orientations may reflect a (frustrated) narcissistic demand to be recognized as better than others, both collectively and individually.",

          "abstract": "Many political science theories posit empirical relationships that are conditioned by some moderating variable, which scholars model using a multiplicative interaction term in a regression. In recent years, scholars have begun using such terms in dynamic regression models with time series data. However, the lack of guidance on adding multiplicative interactions to these workhorse models exposes problems with the consistency of the estimator, model restrictions, and interpretation. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidance to address these problems. First, we define the conditions under which scholars can ensure consistent estimates when estimating relationships conditioned by a moderating variable in dynamic models. Second, we introduce a general model that makes no theoretical assumptions about precisely how conditional relationships unfold over time. Third, we develop a flexible approach for interpreting such models. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework with simulation evidence and an empirical application.",

While increasingly common across Western democracies, its impact on citizens’ preferences remains underexplored. This paper provides evidence from a preregistered survey experiment with 3,118 U.S. citizens, showing that femonationalist rhetoric can enhance opposition to pluralist policies in defense of progressive gender achievements. The effect is conditional on citizens’ prior immigration attitudes: anti-immigration individuals liberalize their gender views, while pro-immigration individuals demand stricter integration policies. The findings suggest that citizens are not consistent in their ideological preferences, especially when political elites frame liberal values as conflicting.",

While the conventional hands-tying mechanism argues that official rhetoric binds leaders to stated positions and limits their ability to back down, recent scholarship on bluster suggests that autocracies may employ hawkish rhetoric to justify de-escalation ex-post. This study evaluates these competing perspectives by analyzing China’s official rhetoric and military behavior in the Taiwan Strait from 2016 to 2022. Employing a word-embedding approach, I construct an original Chinese-language lexicon capturing implicit threats from over two million state-media articles. I show that increases in China’s implicit threats toward Taiwan are associated with a higher likelihood of military escalation, implying that official rhetoric conveys predictive information rather than mere cheap talk.",

          "abstract": "We test a social media conversational agent for canvassing on the topic of anti-transgender prejudice, replicating and benchmarking treatment effects. In-person deep canvassing is the gold standard for durably changing attitudes on polarizing topics. However, door-to-door canvassing is costly, and many populations may not be feasibly reached in this manner. Campaigns are already conducting outreach using digital tools, including text messages and social media. If appropriately trained agents messaging over social media can achieve a fraction of the effect of in-person canvassing, canvassing may be scaled up to achieve large overall impacts at lower costs. Scripts used in this application are based on those used by transgender allies in the original study. To personalize messaging, the conversational agent uses natural language processing to detect conversational topics, and shares relevant pre-scripted messages of information and third-person experiences, encouraging respondents to engage in perspective-taking with respect to an outgroup. This study demonstrates the potential of automated social media messaging for deep canvassing, with possible applications by governments, public health agencies, and political organizations. Estimated effects are positive and significant under covariate adjustment and reweighting; due to important differential attrition, partial-identification bounds are also reported and include zero.",
