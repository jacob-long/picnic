          "authors": "Giacomo Floris",
          "abstract": "Harm reduction is one of the most controversial and widely discussed approaches in public health and social policy, addressing a broad range of pressing societal issues, including drug addiction, sex work, alcohol and tobacco use, and homelessness. Surprisingly, however, harm reduction has received very little philosophical scrutiny. In this article, I aim to fill this gap. First, I provide a systematic analysis of the core features and normative commitments of harm reduction. Second, I propose a novel, relational egalitarian justification for harm reduction. I argue that the provision of harm reduction services is not solely or primarily a matter of mitigating the negative consequences associated with high-risk behaviours. Rather, most fundamentally, it is the appropriate response to the status of vulnerable individuals as equal members of society.",

          "authors": "Diogo Ferrari, Brianna A. Smith",
          "abstract": "Past research indicates that support for conservatism increases when individuals perceive threat to their group’s social status – i.e., prestige and respect. However, the causal link between status threat and increased electoral support for conservative candidates has not been established. Most prior studies rely on observational data, and it remains unclear how the effect of status threat on candidate support varies depending on the specific conservative policies adopted by candidates. Additionally, previous research has not fully addressed whether and how these effects are constrained by voters’ party loyalty. This article investigates these questions by conducting a joint experiment combining vignette and conjoint designs. White Americans were randomly exposed to status threat communication, and then choose between different hypothetical candidates with varying degrees of conservatism on various issues. The results show large effects of candidates’ issue positions and partisanship, but very little effect of status threat.",

          "abstract": "Research has examined the co-existence of pro-Jewish discourse and antisemitic incidents within the populist radical right parties (PRR), Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). This paper analyses this phenomenon through the lens of populist discourse, and finds that Jews are accepted into “the people” when they agree with the parties’ (mostly anti-Islam and anti-elitist) message. However, Jews are excluded, aligned with “the elite”, when they do not. This paper also finds that only the FPÖ demonstrates this same approach towards Israel. The parties thus pursue a dual strategy with regards to Jews and Israel: they use populist discourse as a way to “normalise” their framing of Jews and legitimise exclusion, but the overlap between antisemitic and anti-elitist ideas can make this appear as antisemitic dog-whistling.",

Using a novel application of the synthetic control method, I estimate the overall and partisan effects of BLM on aggregate public opinion. Rather than comparing places with more or less BLM activity, I compare confidence in police to confidence in other institutions, and support for police spending to support for other priorities. I find small or non-existent effects for the overall population, substantial negative effects for Democrats, and substantial positive effects for Republicans. Moreover, and despite Democratic politicians’ attempt to distance themselves from the “defund” position, these partisan effects have persisted, with Democratic backlash against police notably larger than Republican increases in support.",

          "authors": "Marie‐Isabel Theuwis",
          "abstract": "Populism among citizens is often perceived as a problem for democracies due to its rejection of representative practices. In response, scholars have put forward new democratic designs that enhance the democratic system's inclusiveness and popular control, thereby aiming to decrease populism among citizens, or so‐called populist attitudes. However, it is not known whether populist attitudes are even changeable, and whether they respond to such democratic improvements or merely reflect the populist ideas supplied by populist parties. This paper explores the behavior of populist attitudes over time and considers possible drivers of populist attitudes change. For doing so, it conducts a latent growth curve analysis of panel data from the Netherlands and Great Britain spanning approximately four years and containing 16 and 6 waves, respectively. The analyses show that populist attitudes fluctuate over time, and that changes in populist attitudes are associated with changes in democratic satisfaction. This implies that populist attitudes could function as a thermometer of a political system's perceived democratic quality.",

          "authors": "Maciej Siemiątkowski, Michał Bilewicz, Maria Babińska",
          "abstract": "The key aim of the present research was to analyze the causal effects of authoritarian submission on intergroup helping intentions and susceptibility to anti‐helping misinformation in a context where authorities are mobilizing national support for the outgroup. Employing a longitudinal design, we surveyed a sample of Polish residents ( N in t 3 = 710) to examine distinct effects of RWA facets (authoritarian aggression, conventionalism, and authoritarian submission) on intergroup helping intentions and susceptibility to anti‐helping misinformation. For the first time, we have shown that while characteristics related to certain RWA facets can encourage supportive actions that align with the directives of authorities, others may simultaneously exacerbate existing negative attitudes. Our study revealed that while conventionalism predicted increased susceptibility to anti‐helping misinformation, authoritarian submission had a negative effect on this variable. Furthermore, only authoritarian submission increased intergroup helping intentions over time, reflecting adherence to norms endorsed by authorities. These findings highlight the complexity of RWA effects, suggesting that due to their opposite signs, certain relationships might be reduced when RWA is treated as a unidimensional construct. This emphasizes the need to recognize the multifaceted nature of RWA when designing both research as well as strategies aimed at promoting harmonious intergroup relations.",

Using simulations and case studies, we propose a grid‐search framework that allows researchers to evaluate the extent to which their target estimates generalize to their study population. We use simulated datasets to estimate plausible values for how many people changed, how much they changed, and who changed, based on observed response trajectories. Our results suggest that researchers should think carefully about the conditions under which they may make claims about belief change at the individual level. To guide substantive theory‐building, we propose a concise diagnostic routine researchers can use to translate their claims into a set of plausible alternatives and evaluate potential generative processes. We provide an R package to help researchers implement this procedure in their own work.",

          "abstract": "How does a ruler implement state-building at the local level? This paper examines state-building in late 16th-century Japan by focusing on Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s land surveys, which were crucial for establishing a centralized regime. We argue that Hideyoshi strengthened control over the locality via land surveys as a strategic response to the perceived threats emanating from Catholic missionaries. Using various empirical strategies including spatial econometrics, sensitivity analysis, and an instrumental variable approach, we find that the presence of Catholic churches significantly increased the likelihood of a locality being surveyed. These results highlight the importance of information-gathering beyond fiscal purposes for security objectives and emphasize the role of threats from foreign religious institutions in state formation processes.",

I address this gap in the scholarship by leveraging cryptocurrency transaction data to assess how specific regulatory design features shape compliance. Using bunching estimation, I demonstrate that customers strategically adjust transaction sizes to avoid threshold-based screening requirements, while exchanges fail to adequately address this behavior through risk-based monitoring. Analysis of British Virgin Islands exchanges using difference-in-differences estimation before and after regulatory changes provides additional evidence supporting these conclusions. The findings reveal how regulatory design features shape behavior in cryptocurrency markets and suggest specific improvements for regulatory frameworks.",

Using a regression discontinuity design that leverages close mayoral elections, we find that women mayors reduce some of the most egregious violent crimes committed against women, with estimates suggesting a 64.7% reduction in homicides of women over their 3-year terms. As evidence of potential mechanisms, we find that women mayors actively work to combat VAW, appoint more women to leadership and support roles, and expand specialized services for crime victims. These findings suggest that women’s representation in local politics may be an important factor in advancing women’s safety.",

          "abstract": "As the use of computational text analysis in the social sciences has increased, topic modeling has emerged as a popular method for identifying latent themes in textual data. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the results produced by this method, given that it is largely automated and inductive in nature, and the lack of clear guidelines for validating topic models has been identified by scholars as an area of concern. In response, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of 789 studies that employ topic modeling. Our goal is to investigate whether the field is moving toward a common framework for validating these models. The findings of our review indicate a notable absence of standardized validation practices and a lack of convergence toward specific methods of validation. This gap may be attributed to the inherent incompatibility between the inductive, qualitative approach of topic modeling and the deductive, quantitative tradition that favors standardized validation. To address this, we advocate for incorporating qualitative validation approaches, emphasizing transparency and detailed reporting to improve the credibility of findings in computational social science research when using topic modeling.",

          "abstract": "The increasing multimodality (e.g., images, videos, links) of social media data presents opportunities and challenges. But text-as-data methods continue to dominate as modes of classification, as multimodal social media data are costly to collect and label. Researchers who face a budget constraint may need to make informed decisions regarding whether to collect and label only the textual content of social media data or their full multimodal content. In this article, we develop five measures and an experimental framework to assist with these decisions. We propose five performance metrics to measure the costs and benefits of multimodal labeling: average time per post, average time per valid response, valid response rate, intercoder agreement, and classifier’s predictive power. To estimate these measures, we introduce an experimental framework to evaluate coders’ performance under text-only and multimodal labeling conditions. We illustrate the method with a tweet labeling experiment.",

          "abstract": "Since 2002, the regular size of the German Bundestag has been 598 seats. However, due to overhang and compensatory mandates, the Bundestag was enlarged to 709 seats after the 2017 election and to 736 seats after the 2021 election. This made the Bundestag the largest parliament of any democratically governed nation state in the world. To address this issue, the Bundestag passed a reform of the electoral law on March 17, 2023. This article explains the mechanics behind the significant increase in seats in 2021. Furthermore, it analyzes the conditions that must be met for a significant increase to occur. Specifically, it examines the relationship between the increase in surplus seats that triggered the expansion and the change in the party system’s structure. This relationship is demonstrated by developing a simple formal model. The German electoral system is a system of personalized proportional representation. However, as shown, some essential and desirable normative requirements that such a system should fulfill are mutually incompatible. Against this background and considering the history of the reform, it is demonstrated how the chosen reform option developed.",

          "title": "Winners and losers of a Russian oil-export restriction",
          "authors": "Johan Gars, Daniel Spiro, Henrik Wachtmeister",
          "abstract": "Russia has on several occasions threatened to limit its oil exports as part of its energy-economic warfare. Using a quantifiable short-run model of oil trade and detailed production and consumption data, this paper evaluates the winners and losers of potential Russian oil-export reductions and connects these to the potential interests of the Russian regime, including Russia’s oil producers and consumers and its international friends and foes. We find that Russian producer profits would fall for any export restriction even as world oil prices increase. For example, a reduction of 10% of exports would yield Russian producer-profit losses of USD 290 million per day, equivalent to 5% of GDP, mostly due to lower domestic prices. Hence, an export restriction would substantially harm Russia’s oil-industry interests, including the oligarchs and elites benefiting from this trade. However, Russian consumers benefit from an export restriction, as they get access to cheaper oil if Russia exports less. Adding these benefits, an export restriction up to 12% causes net gains for Russia’s oil producers and consumers combined. Categorizing countries into those Russia may consider as foes, friends, and neutrals and using data on their oil consumption and production, we find that foe countries lose the most in absolute terms but friend countries lose more relative to their GDP. Hence, the Russian regime cannot restrict its oil exports without incurring a high collateral cost on its international friends. In sum, to motivate an export restriction, the Russian regime would need to put an order of magnitude more weight on its interest in causing international harm than on its own oil industry’s profits; or it would need to put a high weight on benefiting its own consumers instead of its oil industry.",

          "title": "Risk diversification and vote decisions in mixed-member electoral systems",
          "authors": "Susumu Shikano, Erik S. Herron",
          "abstract": "This paper builds on the literature about mixed-member electoral systems, exploring how ballot design interacts with voter behavior. We present a theoretical model for vote decision-making in mixed-member systems that takes into account the interaction between both tiers. The model is grounded in a spatial model for vote decision-making under risk and inspired by the logic of portfolio diversification under risk. Accordingly, voters are modeled as risk-averse decision-makers who may prefer diversified vote packages (i.e. split-ticket) when party and candidate uncertainties are highly correlated. The risk diversification strategy abates when voters cast their votes sequentially. This finding provides a potential explanation for the impact of vote sequence in mixed-member systems, an under-investigated topic in the literature. It thus links the established literature on mixed-member systems with scholarship on ballot design and its effects. Additionally, the paper’s analysis explores the implications of combining the proposed model with the well-established wasted vote model.",
