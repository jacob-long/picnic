          "authors": "CHRISTOPHER J. CLARK, STEVEN ROGERS",
          "abstract": "Stauffer (2021) shows that when Americans perceive their legislatures as having more gender diversity, they perceive these institutions to be more responsive. In this letter, we use an independently fielded survey to validate Stauffer’s findings and investigate whether her findings extend to race. We successfully replicate Stauffer’s analyses. We also newly demonstrate that perceptions of Black representation in legislatures are related to increased external efficacy, and perceptions of gender descriptive representation are associated with increased trust. Such findings underscore the importance of studying citizens’ perceptions of descriptive representation to understand their attitudes toward government.",

          "authors": "CHARLES H. T. LESCH",
          "abstract": "This article draws from Frederick Douglass’s antebellum and wartime writings to reconstruct his approach to natural rights. Douglass admired many elements of the Enlightenment legacy. Yet in the same motion that he echoes European and American thinkers, he subtly qualifies, corrects, and revises their ideas, sometimes in radical ways. In his depictions of slavery, natural rights cease to be metaphysical abstractions and instead become embodied in our social relations. While they persist in outline, their substance is transformed to account for racialized power and structural violence. In this way, Douglass redefines a number of liberalism’s key moral and political concepts, including freedom, reason, dignity, and moral responsibility. He develops a political theory designed to reinforce the Enlightenment’s bare foundations with social insights of the oppressed: a philosophy of natural rights, told from below.",

          "abstract": "More people are mobilized in response to the deaths of Black men than those of Black women. Kimberlé Crenshaw understands this asymmetry as being rooted in Black women’s lack of “narrative capital” and has called on women to “share their stories” of violence to occasion greater mobilization. In this essay, I argue that the work of Toni Morrison, and specifically her conception of truant democracy, provides a blueprint for how and with whom Black women should share their stories—that is, for how they should mobilize the narrative capital they have and build more. I make this argument by juxtaposing the democratic visions of Morrison and W. E. B. Du Bois, including the ethical foundations of their envisioned democracies, the forms of violence to which they attend, their visions of justice, and the people—or, in Morrison’s case, the ephemeral collectives—they sought to build via storytelling.",

          "authors": "JEREMY BOWLES, KEVIN CROKE, HORACIO LARREGUY, SHELLEY LIU, JOHN MARSHALL",
          "abstract": "Exposure to misinformation can affect citizens’ beliefs, political preferences, and compliance with government policies. However, little is known about how to durably reduce susceptibility to misinformation, particularly in the Global South. We evaluate an intervention in South Africa that encouraged individuals to consume biweekly fact-checks—as text messages or podcasts—via WhatsApp for six months. Sustained exposure to these fact-checks induced substantial internalization of fact-checked content, while increasing participants’ ability to discern new political and health misinformation upon exposure —especially when fact-check consumption was financially incentivized. Fact-checks that could be quickly consumed via short text messages or via podcasts with empathetic content were most effective. We find limited effects on news consumption choices or verification behavior, but still observe changes in political attitudes and COVID-19-related behaviors. These results demonstrate that sustained exposure to fact-checks can inoculate citizens against future misinformation, but highlight the difficulty of inducing broader behavioral changes relating to media usage.",

          "authors": "Liam Shields",
          "abstract": "All children have rights to care, education, food, shelter, and more besides. The creation of children is, therefore, the creation of costly entitlements. But who, other than the parents, can be expected to share these costs? And how much can they be expected to contribute? To date, political theorists have only attended to the first question. But without a well-reasoned answer to the second question, we won’t know whether sharing should be generous or very little, equal or unequal. In this paper, I provide the first examination of the extent of cost sharing required if children are public goods. I argue that viewing children as public goods places important limits on the total costs to be fairly shared by non-parents. This casts doubt on the view, assumed by many political theorists, that the costs of all children’s entitlements must be equally shared between parents and non-parents.",

          "abstract": "Commonsense morality suggests that an unjustly invaded democracy may conscript its own citizens and bar them from emigrating when such a policy is necessary to sustain resistance to the invader. What does this assumption regarding ‘internal conscription’ entail for ‘external conscription’ – for foreign countries who might close their borders to many citizens of the invaded democracy, to push them to fight? Could it have been morally appropriate for Ukraine’s neighbours, for instance, to close their borders to (many) Ukrainians at the onset of the Russian assault on Kyiv, with the aim of sustaining Ukraine’s resistance to Putin’s invasion? I take up such questions by examining the seeming discrepancy between internal and external conscription. I argue that, notwithstanding its surface appeal, a categorical divide between the two kinds of conscription is unwarranted. At the level of fundamental moral principles, the two stand and fall together.",

          "abstract": "How does cognitive household labour – the ‘mental load’ involved in anticipating, fulfilling, and monitoring household needs – influence decisions about whether and how to participate in public life? Studies suggest women take on the vast majority of this load, yet the impact of these private sector inequalities on participation in public life is underexplored. To make progress on these questions, we contribute new causal evidence about the effect of prompting respondents to think about their own mental loads in a survey experiment fielded to employed British parents. Our main argument is that priming the mental load will crowd out interest in political and labour market participation. In line with expectations, our survey experiment finds a strong negative effect of mental load priming on intentions to engage in politics and at work. Our results offer new insights about the continuing relevance of household-based inequalities to gender equality in public life.",

          "authors": "Christian Houle, Jeffrey Conroy-Krutz",
          "abstract": "One common explanation for ethnicized politics and limited national identification in Africa lies with colonial boundaries. Europeans frequently divided ethnic groups as they divvied territory in the nineteenth century; this might have long-run repercussions, as individuals prioritize ties with coethnics in neighboring states rather than with non-coethnic co-nationals. Contra these expectations, we argue that divided groups should have weaker attachments to their ethnicity than non-divided groups will, because partition particularly disrupted pre-existing traditional institutions of governance and exchange within these groups. We argue that partition weakened traditional authorities and, consequently, ethnic identities through three mechanisms: (1) administrative shifts that reduced traditional authorities’ power; (2) limitations on leaders’ capacity to raise revenues; and (3) exacerbating intra-group divisions among co-ethnics living on different sides of the borders. We test this using georeferenced data from rounds 3-6 of the Afrobarometer and find support for our argument. These results are robust to different measures of the extent to which an ethnic group was split and various considerations of ethnic groups’ local and national demographic and political power. Our findings have important implications for studies of the legacies of colonialism and identity politics in Africa today.",

          "authors": "Andreas Videbæk Jensen",
          "abstract": "It is a long-standing view that educational institutions sustain democracy by building an engaged citizenry. However, recent scholarship has seriously questioned whether going to college increases political participation. While these studies have been ingenious in using natural experiments to credibly estimate the causal effect of college, most have produced estimates with high statistical uncertainty. I contend that college matters: I argue that, together, prior effect estimates are just as compatible with a positive effect as a null effect. Furthermore, analyzing two-panel datasets of $n \\approx 10,000$ young US voters, using a well-powered difference-in-differences design, I find that attending college leads to a substantive increase in voter turnout. Importantly, these findings are consistent with the statistically uncertain but positive estimates in previous studies. This calls for updating our view of the education-participation relationship, suggesting that statistical uncertainty in prior studies may have concealed that college education has substantive civic returns.",

Leveraging this unique event, we conducted an original survey experiment of registered Republican voters to analyze how awareness of the leader’s approval influences their assessment of the ouster, approval of their party, and trust in the House. We argue that if a leader’s hold over the base and association between him and the party brand remains strong, his endorsement should boost Republican voters’ approval of the ouster, their party, and trust in the US House. We find consistent empirical support for these expectations, with significant implications for the leader -- party -- constituent relationship and the health of the American party system.",

          "abstract": "Scholars often face a choice when designing conjoint experiments: to allow for or to exclude “odd” combinations of attribute levels in the randomized conjoint profiles shown to respondents (such as a profile of a Democratic candidate who does not support abortion rights or an individual who is a medical doctor but does not have a graduate degree). While previous work has studied the statistical and theoretical implications of this decision, there has been little effort to analyze how it impacts the behavior of survey respondents. Utilizing eye-tracking, this study considers how respondents’ attention, information search behavior, and choice patterns respond to odd combinations of attributes included in conjoint profiles. We find that the impact of odd attribute-level combinations is minimal. They do not impact attention, search, or choice behavior substantially or consistently. Our conclusion is that scholars should prioritize other considerations—such as statistical, theoretical, and substantive considerations—when designing conjoint experiments.",

As we adopt the tools of geographers, we must also consider the methodological challenges they have identified. We focus on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)—the idea that the size of aggregate spatial units and the location of their borders affect the empirical results we obtain. We first describe the logic of the MAUP, and then demonstrate the MAUP through simulations, showing MAUP-related inconsistency in regression results in randomly generated and real-world data. We identify MAUP concerns, and best practices, in top journals in political science. We conclude by suggesting how scholars may respond in theoretical and empirical terms to concerns about validity and reliability that arise from the MAUP.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists often use ranking questions to study people’s opinions and preferences. However, little is understood about the general nature of measurement errors in such questions, let alone their statistical consequences and what researchers can do about them. We introduce a statistical framework to improve ranking data analysis by addressing measurement errors in ranking questions. First, we characterize measurement errors from random responses—arbitrary and meaningless responses based on a wide range of random patterns. We then quantify bias due to random responses, show that the bias may change our conclusion in any direction, and clarify why item order randomization alone does not solve the statistical issue. Next, we introduce our methodology based on two key design-based considerations: item order randomization and the addition of an “anchor” ranking question with known correct answers. They allow researchers to (1) learn about the direction of the bias and (2) estimate the proportion of random responses, enabling our bias-corrected estimators. We illustrate our methods by studying the relative importance of people’s partisan identity compared to their racial, gender, and religious identities in American politics. We find that about 30% of respondents offered random responses and that these responses may affect our substantive conclusions.",

First, we examined the extent to which CBs predicted economic anxiety using the European Social Survey data, round 10, from 17 countries (Study 1). Second, using data from a balanced (in terms of age, gender, education, and region) Slovak sample, we employed a cross‐lagged panel analysis to determine the direction of the association between adherence to CBs and economic anxiety (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that adherence to CBs was significantly associated with higher levels of economic anxiety across cultural contexts. Study 2 compellingly showed that adherence to CBs increased the sense of economic anxiety over time, whereas the reverse causal path from economic anxiety to CBs was consistently nonsignificant. This work provides evidence that adherence to CBs may be increasingly associated with adverse subjective appraisals of economic realities. We discuss how our results can contribute to the understanding that curbing adherence to CBs could also alleviate the sense of economic anxiety. Finally, we recommend a research agenda to better understand the psychological boundary mechanisms accounting for these effects.",

          "abstract": "Exploiting the increased prominence of debates on immigration, right‐wing parties often frame and campaign against immigrants as a threat to national societies. Research on national identity has shown that these parties are particularly successful among voters with an ethnically charged, exclusionary conception of nation. National identity, however, tends to be rather latent and stable, while far‐right voting is much more volatile. Explaining a temporal influence of national identity on political behavior, social‐psychological theories argue that identities need to be activated to become behaviorally relevant. The main argument of this article is that the presence of immigration‐related news in the mass media can serve as such a situational factor for thinking about the nation and thus increase its salience for electoral behavior. Combining individual‐level panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study's Short‐term Campaign Panel (GLES, 2019) with a measure of media salience of immigration‐related news in news articles, this study is the first to examine whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through the salience of immigration‐related issues in the mass media using panel data.",

          "abstract": "Radical right‐wing groups are often linked to conspiratorial beliefs that can fuel political extremism but understanding how these beliefs translate into real‐world action remains a challenge, as these communities tend to operate in insular networks. This study examines how migration‐related narratives shape political behaviour among Italy’s radical right. Using Facebook’s advertising system, we recruited supporters of these movements for an experimental survey. Applying Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT), we measured group consensus on anti‐migrant beliefs and tested the impact of media exposure by presenting participants with either positive or negative portrayals of migrants. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, radical right‐wing communities exhibit deeply entrenched anti‐migrant beliefs that function as cultural truths and are resistant to shifts in media framing. Second, negative media exposure does however amplify support for hostile political actions, including protests and political violence. Conversely, positive portrayals reduce the coherence of anti‐migrant consensus but do not significantly lower preferences for confrontational actions. These results suggest that media exposure does not change the core extremist beliefs of radical right‐wing supporters but instead triggers emotional responses that shape political behavior. Specifically, negative portrayals of migrants increase support for direct actions, such as protests and political violence, even though they do not reinforce or strengthen consensus on anti‐migrant beliefs. This finding underscores that countering violent extremism requires more than just challenging harmful narratives—it also demands addressing the emotional triggers that translate these attitudes into mobilization and political action.",

          "abstract": "We argue that more female candidates on the ballot will decrease the gender participation gap at the polls. We test this hypothesis with data from Italian local elections between 2008 and 2020, taking advantage of a 2012 law requiring at least a third of local council candidates to be women in localities with 5000+ inhabitants. Exploiting the exogenous geographic variation and timing in the implementation of the electoral reform, we evaluate the effect of this exogenously driven variation in women's candidacy on the gendered voting gap. We find a significant and substantively strong causal relationship between the share of women on the ballot and the gendered gap, driven by an increase in women's, but not men's, participation at the polls.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we assess the availability of reproduction archives in political science. By “reproduction archive,” we mean the data and code supporting quantitative research articles that allows others to reproduce the computations described in the published article. We collect a random sample of quantitative research articles published in political science from 1995 to 2022. We find that—even in 2022—most quantitative research articles do not point to a reproduction archive. However, practices are improving. In 2014, when the DA-RT symposium was published in PS: Political Science and Politics , about 12% of quantitative research articles point to the data and code. Eight years later, in 2022, that has increased to 31%. This underscores a massive shift in norms, requirements, and infrastructure. Still, only a minority of articles share the supporting data and code. In 2014, Lupia and Alter wrote, “Today, information on the data production and analytic decisions that underlie many published works in political science is unavailable.” They could write the same today; much work remains to be done.",

          "authors": "Christina Lai",
          "abstract": "Taiwan’s achievement in passing a marriage-equality law in 2019 and the democratic backlash against LGBTQ+ rights deserve scholarly attention in Asia and beyond. Specifically, Taiwan’s road to marriage equality led to these empirical puzzles: What explains the conservative shift in Taiwan’s public perceptions toward LGBTQ+ rights? How would the backlash against LGBTQ+ rights impact Taiwan’s democracy? What does Taiwan’s experience inform us about norm localization and LGBTQ+ politics in Asia and beyond? The strategic framing of the Christian right—that is, the symbolic use of family and its localization of conservative values using Confucian norms—enabled them to couch their religious beliefs and facilitate collective action among different groups. This study offers a culture-based explanation of how the Christian right successfully established a single-issue coalition against LGBTQ+ rights. The article is organized as follows. First, it engages current literature on discourse analysis, norms contestation, and contentious politics. Second, the study proposes a two-part framework for understanding how the Christian right effectively constructs their conservative claims to gain public support. A comparative analysis of the discourse from the conservative and progressive sides sheds light on how their narratives shaped the marriage-equality debate. Third, it addresses how this countermovement impacts Taiwan’s democracy and human rights.",

          "abstract": "Since the first Trump administration, historically marginalized groups in the United States have been subjected to greater instances of bigotry and discrimination due to conservative influence on sociopolitical institutions. These actions suggest a shift in the “Overton Window,” whereby policy preferences previously deemed “unacceptable” are given consideration in the mainstream, especially by conservative policy actors. “Project 2025” is a comprehensive plan to restructure the federal government according to conservative dictates in the second Trump administration. This article is an examination of how higher education may be impacted by this plan, especially as it relates to LGBTQ+ 1 faculty, administration, staff, and students.",

          "authors": "Abigail Devereaux",
          "abstract": "The space of human possibilities is vast and ever-growing in a creative, unpredictable fashion. Still, prices form. Acknowledging the costs of choice invokes the famous infinite regress argument wherein utility can’t be calculated without first computing an infinite chain of transaction costs. Rational individuals, to avoid getting stuck in infinite regress, must look outside themselves to make decisions. Heuristics, culture, aesthetics, and other elements of human sociality can be understood as grappling hooks to scale the unknown. Contextual or heuristic decision-making appears irrational under perfect knowledge assumptions, but theorists of creatively evolving systems cannot sufficiently explain emergent system features like prices, tradeoffs, and transaction costs without marshaling a nontrivial theory of knowledge acquisition and use. A price theory of creatively evolving social systems must, therefore, minimize a priori agent knowledge, like the “classical price theory” developed by Inoua and Smith (Economics of markets: neoclassical theory, experiments, and theory of classical price discovery, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2023). I motivate and then discuss the contours and implications of a price theory that takes the costs of choice seriously, such that the primary modeling assumption isn’t epistemic heroism but epistemic humility.",

          "authors": "Tim Henrichsen, Philip Leifeld, Lorien Jasny, Iain Weaver, Dana R. Fisher",
          "abstract": "Political elites express their ideological positions on contentious issues across various arenas in the public sphere. Social science research often relies on data extracted from various media or political and administrative sources, as well as surveys that are administered directly with the political actor. Although some studies compare ideology across different sources, few systematically analyze how political actors adjust their ideological messaging to the audiences in the respective communication arenas and how such changes are associated with systematic bias in data sources. This paper uses a unique dataset combining climate policy belief observations from three arenas—social media, Congressional testimony, and surveys—on identical ideological variables and during the same time period. We apply item response theory to understand how responses differ by arena and find that ideological communication on Twitter is most left-leaning, Congressional testimony is most right-leaning, and surveys, the data source with the smallest potential arena effect, is in the middle. We also find that actors with strong ideological leaning moderate their positions on social media and in Congress. These findings enhance our understanding of strategic communication depending on audience context and inform social research on biases when analyzing specific data sources.",
