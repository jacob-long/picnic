          "title": "Should Political Discrimination be Unlawful?",
          "authors": "Thomas W. Simpson",
          "abstract": "Should people be protected by law from discrimination on the grounds of political affiliation and belief? I argue that individuals’ democratic right to exercise political agency – which implies freedom of association and freedom to express one’s political belief – requires that individuals should not be vulnerable to being treated disadvantageously because of their political affiliation and belief. To accomplish this, the protectorate of discrimination law should be expanded where relevant to include that characteristic. Moreover, in contexts where political and specifically affective polarisation is severe, the risk of such treatment increases, further justifying the legal innovation. While this thesis has received almost no prior discussion in the literature on the normative justification of discrimination law, and is revisionary in the UK and the USA, this absence is striking both in a comparative legal context and especially given the centrality of these freedoms to democratic politics.",

          "authors": "Julius Diener",
          "abstract": "How do young politicians perceive their function as representatives? Do they prioritize their own, their party’s or their voters’ views? I argue that young politicians should be more genuinely motivated to prioritize the views of voters due to their experience of belonging to an underrepresented group. I use data from a candidate survey in Germany 2021 to estimate the probability that politicians report prioritizing their voters’ views across different candidate ages. I find that, while all candidates are most likely to focus on their own views, young candidates are more likely than their older colleagues to prioritize the views of voters over their own or their party’s. Variation in incumbency and prior political experience explains parts of this effect. This finding advances our understanding of how young politicians perceive their function as representatives and the role young politicians play in substantive youth representation.",

          "abstract": "There continues to be a pressing need to design and test effective corrections in response to political misinformation, as citizens must have accurate information to be able to meaningfully participate in politics. Critical race theory (CRT) is an issue marked by widespread misinformation and controversy, leading to efforts in multiple states to ban CRT. In a three‐wave panel design with a nationally diverse U.S. sample, a correction of misinformation about CRT was tested. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a control condition; (2) a misinformation‐only treatment; or (3) a misinformation plus correction treatment. Those in the misinformation plus correction condition had significantly higher accuracy scores than those in the control and misinformation‐only conditions. Moreover, this increased accuracy in the misinformation with correction condition was stronger among those most predisposed to accept CRT misinformation, that is, participants who scored high on a measure of unawareness of institutional discrimination. In contrast, participants' attitudes toward CRT bans were unaffected by the treatments, suggesting that correction can improve accuracy but does not change related opinions.",

          "authors": "Benjamin S. Noble",
          "abstract": "Presidents are often viewed as national policy leaders. Yet, they increasingly use negative rhetoric to attack the opposition rather than forge legislative compromise, contrary to theories of going public. Why? I argue presidents facing congressional obstruction eschew short-term policy persuasion. They speak as negative partisans to mobilize co-partisans and shape the longer-term balance of power in Congress, improving future policy-making prospects. I collect all presidential speeches delivered between 1933 and 2024 and use transformer methods to measure how often, and how negatively, presidents reference the out-party. They do so when the policy-making environment is unfavorable: when majorities are tenuous, government is divided, and as elections approach. I provide additional support with a case study of Democrats’ 2009 filibuster-proof Senate majority. Finally, this rhetoric has behavioral impact: presidential negative partisanship decreases co-partisan approval of the opposition. This research alters our understanding of going public and reinforces the partisan dimension of modern presidential representation.",

          "authors": "Jenn M. Jackson",
          "abstract": "Surveys continue to be the most common research tool in American politics. Yet, there are normative, ontological, and conceptual concerns that render these techniques incomplete, especially when deployed in the study of marginalized people. This article argues that survey research is limited mainly in the study of race, gender, sexuality, and class because it fails to capture the intricacies of political life. Furthermore, the general exclusion of marginalized voices in survey research represents a major concern for the veracity of our findings. In response, I suggest three recommendations to help political scientists extend survey methods and tell more comprehensive stories about the political experiences and attitudes of marginalized people. I contend that political science departments must make qualitative methods required training for graduate students; political scientists must engage in feminist methodologies in building their research agendas; and researchers studying marginalized people must engage in multimethodological research approaches that provide context and detail about the lived experiences of vulnerable people.",
