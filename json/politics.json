          "authors": "Daniel L. Tavana",
          "abstract": "How do opposition elites succeed in authoritarian elections? Existing theories of authoritarian politics suggest a pivotal role for elections in enhancing the survival of incumbent dictators. Yet, in many contexts, opposition elites attract considerable support and constrain the policymaking authorities of these dictators. This article presents a theory of endogenous opposition that traces the electoral success of opposition elites to the strategic use of symbolic ideological appeals, or campaign appeals that cast politicians as allies of particular ideological movements. I present quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of my argument from Kuwait. I show that minority elites who use symbolic ideological appeals are more likely to capture voters from other minority groups. Once elected, these legislators are more likely to oppose the ruling family in the legislature. These findings challenge existing theories of authoritarian politics and point to ideology as an understudied source of opposition success in authoritarian elections.",

          "authors": "Michael S. Thomas",
          "abstract": "This article recovers an overlooked strand of nineteenth‐century Latin American political thought that I call, “enchanted democracy.” It is epitomized in the work of the Chilean radical democrat, Francisco Bilbao (1823–1865). Deployed in the generation after the Spanish American Wars of Independence, “enchanted democracy” was a postcolonial democratic theory that aimed to justify mass expansion of suffrage, direct democracy, and social equality. This political vision was inescapably theological. Bilbao relied upon scripture, the lives of saints, and sacraments to justify political inclusion, construct a theory of democratic solidarity, and to motivate affection and sacrificial love among citizens. By using theological concepts and popular religious expression to build a future politics, I argue that “enchanted democracy” broadens theoretical approaches to the relationship between religion and democracy. This article also signals the importance of Latin American political thought for contemporary democratic theory.",

          "authors": "BRANDICE CANES-WRONE, JONATHAN P. KASTELLEC, NICOLAS STUDEN",
          "abstract": "While Supreme Court nominations have become increasingly high-salience political events, we know little about their prioritization relative to other issues by core constituency groups. We examine how individual donors and the mass public prioritize nominations, as well as factors they believe presidents should consider when selecting judges. To do so, we constructed original questions for a survey of over 7,000 validated donors and a comparison general population sample. We find donors are substantially more likely to prioritize nominations than their general public co-partisans, particularly Republican donors. Further analysis suggests the prioritization gap is consistent with theories that donors are motivated to move policy toward the ideological extremes. Analyzing policy positions, the largest donor-public difference occurs for diversity in appointments, but for all positions we find smaller differences than for prioritization. Overall, the findings highlight donors’ policy priorities may diverge from those of the public even more than policy positions do.",

          "abstract": "How can governments in racially divided societies protect vulnerable populations from political violence after large-scale internal conflict? When the dominant majority is bent on perpetuating its power and privileges in the racial hierarchy, benevolence by government interveners is unlikely to curb oppressive violence against subordinate groups. There is thus no alternative to using military coercion to crush insurgents and their civilian supporters. However, failing to maintain this coercive apparatus can exacerbate violence over the long term by triggering racialized revenge dynamics, particularly in communities that were occupied by troops of the subordinate minority. To substantiate these claims, we show that different parts of the postbellum American South experienced uneven spikes in white supremacist violence following the end of federal military occupation in the 1870s: counties that had previously been occupied by Black troops witnessed higher incidences of anti-Black violence than other areas. This effect persisted for many decades, contributing to the dismal climate of violence that prevailed during the nadir of American race relations.",

          "abstract": "Democratic theorists hold that voting contributes to some political good: individual and collective autonomy, equality, justice, pluralism, stability, better policies, and many others. But elections are common under authoritarianism, and empirical research finds that holding elections can stabilize authoritarian regimes. This creates what we term the democrat’s dilemma, where citizens who vote in authoritarian elections may bolster the regimes they wish to unseat, even when they cast a vote for the opposition. We identify three major ways of thinking about the democratic value of electoral participation—justice-based, epistemic, and proceduralist approaches—and use them to examine the complex moral considerations that confront voters in authoritarian regimes. We contend that authoritarian elections’ residual democratic value can justify voting, even when doing so could further entrench the autocrat. Our argument also implies that the democratic principles that justify voting in authoritarian elections oblige citizens to choose the most democratic alternative.",

          "abstract": "China's approach to international finance is shaped by both its domestic political economy and a desire to increase its global influence. The prevailing economic model in China, which combines state control with market dynamism, means that China's preferences over the global governance of finance are sometimes at odds with the liberal principles embedded in the global financial order. Moreover, economic competition and geopolitical rivalry with the United States, the main architect of the global financial order, often shape China's engagement with existing rules and institutions. While China has challenged and disrupted some aspects of the international financial order, including the dominance of the US dollar and approaches to international development finance, it has been a largely supportive reformer in other domains, such as the global financial safety net. China's influence on the economic order in international finance generates important spillovers for other emerging and developing economies, creating both opportunities and challenges.",

          "abstract": "Why do citizens fail to punish political candidates who violate democratic standards at the ballot box? Building on recent debates about heterogeneous democratic attitudes among citizens, we probe how divergent understandings of democracy shape citizens’ ability to recognize democratic transgressions as such and, in turn, affect vote choice. We leverage a novel approach to estimate the behavioural consequences of such individual-level understandings of democracy via a candidate choice conjoint experiment in Poland, a democracy where elections remained competitive despite an extended episode of backsliding. Consistent with our argument, we find that respondents who adhere less strongly to liberal democratic norms tolerate democratic violations more readily. Conversely, voters with a stronger liberal understanding of democracy are more likely to punish non-liberal candidates, including co-partisan ones. Our study identifies political culture, particularly the lack of attitudinal consolidation around liberal democracy, as a missing variable in explaining continued voter support for authoritarian-leaning leaders.",

          "abstract": "One of the most important global political developments is the current wave of autocratization. Most research identifies this as an executive-led process, while others highlight the role opposition actors play in resisting it. We combine this work into a common framework asking, how (anti-)democratic are party systems? Party-system literature emphasises and measures policy differences, while we conceptualise party systems’ democratic positions highlighting to what extent divergent regime preferences are prevalent across parties. To estimate this dimension, we introduce the Party-System Democracy Index (PSDI), capable of tracking regime preferences across party systems from 1970 to 2019 across 178 countries and 3,151 country-years. We implement well-established content, convergent, and construct validity tests to confirm the PSDI’s reliability. Finally, we also show that the PSDI is an important predictor for regime changes in either direction and that changes in the PSDI can signal a looming regime change. This work provides a new framework for studying regime changes and contributes to the renewal of the party-systems literature.",

In a controversial, overturned election in Malawi, I show how online exposure can reduce incumbency advantages and improve election administration. Leveraging geocoded polling station returns and the expansion of 3G coverage in a difference-in-differences setting, I show that ruling party vote share and election irregularities decline in areas newly exposed to the Internet. This is robust to a series of specifications, including matching on pre-treatment characteristics and adjusting for polling station complexity. To examine mechanisms, I turn to interviews and focus group discussions with voters, party figures and election officials. These reveal that opposition groups used social media to campaign and organise, online platforms expanded the reach of civic education efforts, and election staff used WhatsApp to coordinate on polling day. The paper contributes to the literature on information technology, party strategy, and election administration in low-income settings.",

Using a benchmarking approach, we argue that people compare their country’s performance within the EU to that of a non-EU country, shaping their attitudes. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in 2020 provides an ideal test case, as governments launched vaccination programs at different speeds. The UK began weeks before EU countries, allowing us to examine its impact on EU support. Using an Unexpected Event during Surveys Design (UESD) with Eurobarometer data, we find that the UK’s early rollout significantly reduced specific policy support for the EU but did not consistently affect diffuse support. Our findings offer key insights into attitudes toward European integration and performance evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup attitudes and identity ties can shape foreign policy preferences. Anti-Muslim bias is particularly salient in the USA and the UK, but little work assesses whether this bias generalizes to other countries. We evaluate the extent of anti-Muslim bias in foreign policy attitudes through harmonized survey experiments in thirteen European countries (N=19,673). Experimental vignettes present factual reports of religious persecution by China, counter-stereotypically depicting Muslims as victims. We find evidence of anti-Muslim bias. Participants are less opposed to persecution and less likely to support intervention when Muslims, as opposed to other religious groups, are persecuted. However, this bias is not present in all countries. Exploratory analyses underscore that pre-existing intergroup attitudes and shared group identity moderate how group-based evaluations shape foreign policy attitudes. We provide extensive cross-national evidence that anti-Muslim bias is country-specific and that social identity ties and intergroup attitudes influence foreign policy preferences.",

          "authors": "Jae Yeon Kim, Efrén Pérez, Kasheena G. Rogbeer",
          "abstract": "Mounting research finds that shared discrimination boosts solidarity between people of color (PoC), with downstream increases in support for pro-outgroup policies. However, these experiments measure the proposed mediator (solidarity), rather than manipulate it, which raises reasonable doubts about its causal impact. We report two pre-registered experiments (N = 2,692) that reassess solidarity’s causal influence by “blocking” its downstream effects. We conducted these studies with Black adults – the prototypical person of color who define this mega-group’s norms and values. Both studies focus on Black-Latino relations and reveal that manipulating shared discrimination between these groups heartily boosts Black solidarity with PoC ( d ∼.40). Critically, after solidarity’s activation, manipulating differences in the bases of discrimination against Black and Latino people (i.e., slavery versus immigration) modestly reduces its downstream effect on Black support for pro-Latino policies. A pre-registered internal meta-analysis finds this “blockage” effect is modest but statistically reliable ( d ∼.10), leading us to conclude that solidarity’s mediating influence is likely causal and resistant to this divisive threat. We discuss our results’ implications for inter-minority politics.",

          "abstract": "To what extent does physical attractiveness affect the placement of candidates on party lists in proportional representation systems? Studies show that good-looking politicians fare better electorally than their less attractive peers. Research suggests that this is because voters use physical appearance as a heuristic. In proportional list systems, however, who wins office is conditional on where party leaders place them on the party list. In this paper, we argue that physically attractive candidates fare better in proportional list systems than their less attractive co-partisans because party elites place them in preferable list positions. Drawing on data from Ecuador’s 2019 municipal elections, where ballots featured photos of candidates, we show that physically attractive candidates are placed higher on party lists and therefore have an electoral advantage. Our finding suggests that physical attractiveness can be an important determinant of electoral success even when voters do not cast preference votes.",

Building on a novel data set covering 679 regional election manifestos in Austria and Germany between 1990 and 2019, we assess the influence of party-specific and contextual factors on subnational parties’ issue attention. More specifically, we hypothesize that a party’s national issue ownership has a positive influence on its issue attention in regional election manifestos. This effect should, however, be moderated by whether a regional party is in government at the regional and/or national level. Our results support our hypotheses: While issue ownership has a positive influence, government participation decreases this effect.",

We distinguish between assembly-based and plebiscitary IPD which represent two distinct logics of intra-party decision-making. The instrument was developed in the context of the first round of the Political Party Database Project (PPDB) covering 146 parties in 25 countries. It is now applied for the first time to parties in countries on all continents. We cover 274 parties from the second round of the PPDB in 51 countries, which provides us with a unique opportunity to assess the applicability and validity of this measure and compare it over time. Our results show that the expected stability of IPD values go together with plausible change over time. This opens up the potential to trace changes of IPD in detail and to investigate possible reasons for these changes. Furthermore, the new data are ideally suited to be applied in different institutional and cultural contexts.",

While prior research explores voter attributes and institutional factors in corruption voting, the role of party responses remains underexamined, despite the ubiquity of party response “in the real world”. Using a survey experiment of 3,531 U.S. voters, we find that voter sanctioning of corrupt politicians increases significantly when their own party condemns the corruption, a pattern observed across Republicans and Democrats. Extreme partisanship amplifies this effect. Alternative party responses—such as party non-response, support for the corrupt politician, or condemnation by the opposition—have weaker effects on voter behavior. These findings indicate that voters rely heavily on party cues when processing corruption allegations. Parties’ public stances on co-partisan corruption thus play a critical role in shaping voter accountability, offering insights into how political rhetoric influences electoral outcomes in cases of corruption.",

In this paper, we explore the psychological dispositions driving positivity about the political future. We draw on psychologists’ distinction between optimism—a dispositional belief that good things will happen, come what may—and hope—a trait of envisioning, pursuing and believing one’s goals to be achievable. We assess pre-registered hypotheses about the distinct influences of optimism and hope on valence expectations—beliefs about whether there will be good or bad societal outcomes—and electoral expectations—beliefs about likely election outcomes—in a representative-sample survey experiment in the United Kingdom. We find that optimism drives positive valence expectations, but hope drives partisan electoral expectations. Indeed, partisan bias in electoral expectations is exhibited only by those scoring higher in hope. We show experimentally that positive information from polls and expert commentary dampens this impact of hope by raising the expectations of the otherwise unhopeful. Our findings suggest that so-called ‘wishful thinking’ about election outcomes might stem from a sense of agency around electoral politics, but that this sense of agency does not extend to how citizens envision society’s prospects.",

Third, we employ a principled machine learning method, causal forest, to detect and estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. Contrary to previous literature, we find that affect is the sole moderator of partisan cueing processes, and only for out-party cues. These findings not only contribute to the literature on political behavior, but underscore the importance of careful measurement and robust subgroup analysis.",

          "authors": "Stephen Pettigrew, Dylan Radley",
          "abstract": "Voters express their electoral preferences through their ballot. More states and local jurisdictions are adopting ranked choice voting (RCV), which affects how voter preferences are translated into electoral results by introducing a more complex ranked ballot and accompanying tabulation process. This research provides empirical estimates of rates of improper marking and vote rejection, and compares them to those rates on non-ranked offices (particularly single-mark, ‘choose-one-candidate’ offices). We describe a new, general typology for categorizing the ways voters can improperly mark a ranked ballot. We apply this typology to a database of ranked choice ballots that includes 3 million cast vote records representing over three-quarters of all Americans living in a jurisdiction that uses RCV. The data show that in a typical ranked choice race, nearly 1 in 20 (4.8%) voters improperly mark their ballot in at least one way. We argue that these improper marks are consistent with voter confusion about their ranked ballot, and find evidence that this mismarking rate is higher in areas with more racial minorities, lower-income households, and lower levels of educational attainment. We further find that votes in ranked choice races are about 10 times more likely to be rejected due to an improper mark than votes in non-ranked choice races. These findings raise key questions about voter participation and representation in ranked choice systems and have important policy implications for jurisdictions that already have or are considering adopting ranked choice voting.",

          "title": "Media Influence and Spatial Voting: The Role of Perceived Party Positions",
          "authors": "Lucas Paulo da Silva",
          "abstract": "If media outlets influence voters, media elites could hold disproportionate sway over elections. However, little is known about the paths through which these outlets influence voting behavior. Based on spatial voting theory, I argue that ideological media exposure alters two key mediators — ideological positions and perceptions of party positions — to influence voting behavior. The literature on media effects often assumes that the former is the mediator and ignores the latter. This study examines the effects of ideological media exposure on these two potential mediators and on voting behavior. However, it is difficult to study these relationships because audiences usually select like-minded media content, which introduces reverse causality. To address this endogeneity, I use a quasi-experiment: Liverpool’s longstanding boycott of the popular right-wing British tabloid newspaper, The Sun . This was an exogenous boycott that was not caused by political factors. Rather, it was due to The Sun falsely blaming the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster on Liverpool Football Club supporters. I estimate triple differences for the effect of this boycott on lower working-class respondents (who complied with the boycott much more than others) in Liverpool. The results indicate that media outlets influence ideological positions, perceptions of party positions, and, ultimately, voting behavior. The effect of media on perceived party positions appears to be particularly powerful and may indicate that it is an important mediator. Thus, this study provides timely and relevant insights about the specific ways in which media outlets influence elections.",

          "abstract": "Populism presents a democratic paradox, portrayed both as a democratic threat and a fundamental tenet of democracy. We investigate the paradoxical relationship between populism and pro‐ and anti‐democratic attitudes, focusing on the role of status quo rejection, feelings of powerlessness, and social justice support. Study 1 ( United Kingdom, N = 293 ) and Study ( United Kingdom, N = 350, pre‐registered ) show that populist attitudes are associated with decreased support for representative democracy and increased support for direct democracy and autocracy. These relationships are explained by status quo rejection. Study 2 ( United States, N = 397, pre‐registered ) experimentally shows that a populist worldview increases support for such alternative regimes due to dissatisfaction with the status quo and feelings of powerlessness. Study 3 (United Kingdom, N = 298 ) disentangles the pro versus anti‐democratic facets of populism, showing that social justice positively mediates the relationship between populist attitudes and direct democracy, while negatively mediating the relationship between populist attitudes and autocracy. Study 4 (United States, N = 400, pre‐registered ) experimentally demonstrates that populist attitudes may lead to greater support for direct democracy due to increased support for social justice and to greater support for autocracy due to increased feelings of powerlessness. Together, these studies elucidate the complex populism–democracy nexus.",

          "abstract": "The ubiquity of office is rivaled only by its scholarly neglect. The stable realities and the debates and ethics attached to institutions of office are poorly reflected in political science and public administration. Offices serve as ministerial trusts (directed toward service, not to be owned, inherited or seized), they are structured by accountability institutions and ethics, and they are ineluctably relational – they exist in correspondence to other offices, those governed (who make claims upon offices), and notions of just and right. Examining public administrative offices from republican Rome through the medieval Catholic episcopacy to early modern England, I argue that institutions and ethics of office took shape that indelibly shaped American and Western public administration as we know it today. Fertile research agendas include the existence and evolution of public offices, the mechanics of their constraints upon behavior, oaths and commitment, their simultaneous embedment of obligation and authority, and rewards (fee, emolument, rent, benefice, salary).",

In this research note, we evaluate changes to the Canadian Election Study (CES) gender questions from 2019 to 2021. Our analyses suggest researchers should add “nonbinary” as a close-ended option and an open-ended response option to gender identity questions. They also suggest that researchers should not include “transgender” in a separate, mutually exclusive response option alongside men and women in gender identity questions but instead identify transgender men and women through a follow-up question. These recommendations can help guide the design of future surveys.",

          "abstract": "Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars have debated whether digital fieldwork can effectively substitute for on-site field research. The prevailing view is that digital fieldwork is a last resort when in-person access is limited. Reflecting on my recent field research in Vietnam and Malaysia, I advocate for integrating digital and on-site fieldwork as complementary components of the research process. This approach is particularly valuable for scholars who are unable to spend extended periods in the field. The integrative approach helps researchers (a) prepare effectively for on-site fieldwork, (b) adapt the data collection process flexibly while in the field, and (c) continue data collection and maintain working relationships with local networks after leaving the field. Through this reflection, I encourage researchers to normalize the integration of both methodologies to leverage the strengths of each approach.",

          "abstract": "Scholars of democratic representation argue that polity size affects political representation in a multitude of ways. Studies of elections consistently show a negative correlation between population size and political participation, particularly in first-past-the-post (FPTP) elections. Less research has investigated the effects of size scaling in mixed electoral systems. I posit that tier linkage is critical in determining whether or not mixed systems using FPTP are subject to the “size effect”. To test this hypothesis, I study recent legislative election returns from 10 national assemblies. I find that unlinked systems using “parallel voting” tiers are vulnerable to the size effect on turnout. In five out of the six assemblies  that use parallel voting, there is a negative association between turnout and constituency population size. By contrast, in the remaining four assemblies that use tier linkage, there is not a negative correlation between turnout and size with the exception of South Korea, which recently adopted reforms. The results underscore the potential of seat and/or vote linkage to improve representational outcomes in mixed systems.",

          "abstract": "Deforestation is highly damaging to the global climate system and biodiversity. It varies strongly across countries and time, and is driven by several idiosyncratic as well as structural factors. Political regime types belong to the latter. Some studies suggest that more democratic countries are associated with lower rates of deforestation, whereas others report that such states might well be related to more clearing of forested land. We contribute to resolving the currently mixed evidence by re-examining, extending, and contextualizing the findings of one of the most recent empirical studies on how democracy affects deforestation. Based on a comprehensive empirical analysis using different data sources and estimation procedures, we show that levels of democracy are linked to deforestation in a U-shaped, curvilinear way: deforestation rates are less strongly pronounced in both the least and the most democratic states, but higher in partial democracies. In this U-shaped curve, however, the most democratic countries have a better forest-conservation record than states with lower democracy scores.",
