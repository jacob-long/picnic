          "authors": "Beatrice Magistro, Sophie Borwein, R. Michael Alvarez, Bart Bonikowski, Peter John Loewen",
          "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping labor markets and sparking political debates. Like economic globalization, AI developments promise benefits, including job creation and lower prices, but also costs such as job displacement, raising crucial questions about public perceptions. Will AI, like globalization, challenge existing paradigms and trigger a backlash? Leveraging a conjoint experiment with 6,000 respondents from the United States and Canada, we examine public opinion toward offshoring and generative AI, focusing on the multidimensional trade‐offs between job and price changes. Across all scenarios, respondents are equally or more sensitive to price changes than employment shifts. AI is favored over offshoring, especially among Democrats, highlighting an emerging partisan divide in the United States. Republicans and Canadians show more varied support, indicating AI is not immune to opposition. By focusing on the microfoundations of opinion formation, we identify scenarios that may trigger or temper protectionist stances.",

          "authors": "Daniel L. Tavana",
          "abstract": "How do opposition elites succeed in authoritarian elections? Existing theories of authoritarian politics suggest a pivotal role for elections in enhancing the survival of incumbent dictators. Yet, in many contexts, opposition elites attract considerable support and constrain the policymaking authorities of these dictators. This article presents a theory of endogenous opposition that traces the electoral success of opposition elites to the strategic use of symbolic ideological appeals, or campaign appeals that cast politicians as allies of particular ideological movements. I present quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of my argument from Kuwait. I show that minority elites who use symbolic ideological appeals are more likely to capture voters from other minority groups. Once elected, these legislators are more likely to oppose the ruling family in the legislature. These findings challenge existing theories of authoritarian politics and point to ideology as an understudied source of opposition success in authoritarian elections.",

          "authors": "Shane P. Singh",
          "abstract": "Equal turnout fosters equal representation. As such, researchers have long sought to understand what causes gender differences in voter participation. I argue that compulsory voting increases men's turnout relative to that of women. This is because men are particularly receptive to external incentives, while women are more intrinsically motivated. Within Brazil and across countries, I use administrative data to show that compulsory voting increases men's turnout most. I also argue that, due to social desirability bias, nonvoting women are most likely to claim to have participated under mandatory voting. With comparisons of official and reported turnout, I demonstrate compulsory voting increases women's turnout overreporting relative to that of men. By increasing men's relative turnout, compulsory voting could introduce or accentuate representational disparities in favor of men, and this potentiality can be obscured by survey data.",

          "authors": "Emma Saunders‐Hastings",
          "abstract": "Recently, empirical political scientists have challenged presuppositions about voter behavior that they take to be widespread in normative democratic theory, charging that democratic theory is unmoored from empirical reality. For their part, many normative democratic theorists have rejected empiricists’ characterizations of their subfield and denied that normative theories are threatened by empirical findings about voter behavior. This article argues that both camps are partly right and partly wrong. Normative democratic theories are more varied than empirical critics recognize, and some avoid grounding their defenses of democracy on an unrealistic “folk theory” of popular control. However, even these more promising normative theories may import “folk theory” assumptions in subtler ways and neglect empirical evidence to their own cost. I focus on social or relational egalitarian theories of democracy as an illustration of this problem, which should be addressed by more productive and dynamic engagement between normative and empirical democratic theory.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes the anticolonial worldmaking of postcolonial Indonesia's first president Sukarno, during Guided Democracy (1959–1965). Using worldmaking as a conceptual interface, the article offers three interconnected interventions. First, Sukarno's range of anticolonial activity allows for a conceptual advance by revealing three dimensions of worldmaking: discursive, institutional, and dramaturgical. This typology works towards arresting worldmaking's conceptual overextension without sacrificing its generative character. Second, it integrates Southeast Asian trajectories of worldmaking into scholarly discussion of anticolonial political thought. Contrary to other anticolonial figures, Sukarno's worldmaking revolved around a postcolonial vision of global order outside the United Nations. By analyzing Sukarno's contextually specific vision of the relationship between international organizations and decolonization, this article underscores the importance of sensitivity to situated understandings of anticolonialism. Third, this article reorients Sukarno scholarship by inter alia resituating him within the Third World. The article closes by laying out some contradictions of Sukarno's anticolonial worldmaking project.",

          "authors": "David Szakonyi",
          "abstract": "How does the opposition govern under autocracy? Most authoritarian regimes tolerate some degree of internal opposition, allowing it to contest and even take power. Yet we know little about how such power‐sharing dynamics affect governance. In this paper, I exploit a unique instance where an opposition won control of political institutions in a prominent electoral autocracy: the 2017 Moscow municipal elections. Using a difference‐in‐differences design, I find that opposition control of municipal councils reduced the financial returns from office for ruling party deputies. This decrease in earnings comes from opposition‐held councils removing rent‐seeking opportunities by organizing more competitive procurement, reducing unnecessary budget expenditures, and curbing over‐the‐top compensation. Using a survey experiment, I then show that voters prefer opposition candidates with municipal governing experience over ruling party ones without it. Even in repressive environments, challenging autocratic rule may be well served by joining rather than boycotting institutions.",

          "authors": "Shmuel Nili",
          "abstract": "Politicians and philosophers alike have warned that the spread of anti‐migrant bigotry in the Western world requires a tragic trade‐off regarding immigration policy: Although millions of asylum‐seekers might be owed admission to Western democracies, there are many cases where they nonetheless ought to be denied entry, because their admission is overly likely to increase the electoral appeal of extreme rightwing figures and parties, thus endangering the host country's liberal democracy. This article scrutinizes this influential view, by juxtaposing electorally driven migration policy with electorally driven military strikes abroad. If turning millions of asylum‐seekers away can be tragically appropriate as a means of thwarting the electoral rise of the extreme right, why cannot the same be true for military strikes overseas that might harm a far smaller number of innocent outsiders? I examine what—if anything—explains the difference between these two cases.",

          "abstract": "What drives ideological division about political problems? When prioritizing which problems are most in need of redress, voters might disagree about the severity of individual outcomes that constitute such problems; the prevalence of those problems; or whether such problems are amenable to solution by government action. We field a large survey experiment in the United Kingdom and the United States and develop a new measurement approach that allows us to evaluate how ideological disagreements change when respondents consider the individual badness, social severity, and priority for government action of a set of 41 political problems. We find that large ideological divergences are observed in beliefs about social severity and priority for government action, not individual problem badness, and only in the United States. An important implication of these results is that perceptions of problem prevalence are a key source of polarization over problem‐prioritization in the United States.",

          "abstract": "In contrast to the expansive work on how community policing affects citizens’ attitudes toward police, existing research says little about how community policing affects officers’ attitudes toward citizens. We examine officer-facing outcomes using an experiment in the Philippines, in which a random subset of a province’s 705 officers were assigned to intensive community policing activities for seven months. Treatment officers saw improved understanding of citizen concerns, but did not develop greater empathy or trust toward civilians, nor an increased sense of accountability for citizen-facing misconduct. We build from the experiment to develop an inductive theory of bureaucrat-citizen contact, relying on qualitative observations and exploratory analyses of heterogeneous effects. We propose that contact with citizens is only likely to improve attitudes among frontline bureaucrats who are not ex-ante embedded in their communities. Moreover, contact may have negative effects when it reveals threats to bureaucrats’ personal safety.",

          "abstract": "How can governments in racially divided societies protect vulnerable populations from political violence after large-scale internal conflict? When the dominant majority is bent on perpetuating its power and privileges in the racial hierarchy, benevolence by government interveners is unlikely to curb oppressive violence against subordinate groups. There is thus no alternative to using military coercion to crush insurgents and their civilian supporters. However, failing to maintain this coercive apparatus can exacerbate violence over the long term by triggering racialized revenge dynamics, particularly in communities that were occupied by troops of the subordinate minority. To substantiate these claims, we show that different parts of the postbellum American South experienced uneven spikes in white supremacist violence following the end of federal military occupation in the 1870s: counties that had previously been occupied by Black troops witnessed higher incidences of anti-Black violence than other areas. This effect persisted for many decades, contributing to the dismal climate of violence that prevailed during the nadir of American race relations.",

          "abstract": "Democratic theorists hold that voting contributes to some political good: individual and collective autonomy, equality, justice, pluralism, stability, better policies, and many others. But elections are common under authoritarianism, and empirical research finds that holding elections can stabilize authoritarian regimes. This creates what we term the democrat’s dilemma, where citizens who vote in authoritarian elections may bolster the regimes they wish to unseat, even when they cast a vote for the opposition. We identify three major ways of thinking about the democratic value of electoral participation—justice-based, epistemic, and proceduralist approaches—and use them to examine the complex moral considerations that confront voters in authoritarian regimes. We contend that authoritarian elections’ residual democratic value can justify voting, even when doing so could further entrench the autocrat. Our argument also implies that the democratic principles that justify voting in authoritarian elections oblige citizens to choose the most democratic alternative.",

          "abstract": "China's approach to international finance is shaped by both its domestic political economy and a desire to increase its global influence. The prevailing economic model in China, which combines state control with market dynamism, means that China's preferences over the global governance of finance are sometimes at odds with the liberal principles embedded in the global financial order. Moreover, economic competition and geopolitical rivalry with the United States, the main architect of the global financial order, often shape China's engagement with existing rules and institutions. While China has challenged and disrupted some aspects of the international financial order, including the dominance of the US dollar and approaches to international development finance, it has been a largely supportive reformer in other domains, such as the global financial safety net. China's influence on the economic order in international finance generates important spillovers for other emerging and developing economies, creating both opportunities and challenges.",

In this review, I outline the foundations of the literature and identify major conceptual and analytical advancements since the early 2000s, including the development of capacity investment models, the notion of intermediate institutions, and the emphasis on political agency. This review builds on research employing diverse methodologies, draws on examples from advanced economies and developing countries, and is intended for both novice and experienced readers. After taking stock of the state of the field, I discuss and reflect upon three avenues for further research—the big unknowns: Do civil wars make or break the state? How do economic openness and international hierarchy shape the incentives and opportunities for state building? And what are the perils that highly capable states pose for liberal rights and democratic governance?",

          "abstract": "Across the world, women continue to be underrepresented in parliaments. As gatekeepers to candidate lists, party leaders are in a pivotal position to promote gender balance. But do party elites consider women’s underrepresentation when deciding who to nominate? Leveraging a large-scale conjoint experiment with 1,389 party elites in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, we find that the more underrepresented women are in candidate lists, the better the chances of women aspirants. Awareness of women’s underrepresentation influences selectors for whom promoting gender equality may be a less crystallized priority: centrists and men. Women’s underrepresentation also reinforces preferences for women aspirants among those for whom gender equality may be a core value (left-wing and women selectors) but does not affect those for whom opposing gender equality may bring electoral advantages (right-wing party elites). Our findings shed light on the potential role that signalling underrepresentation may have on party elites’ selection of women aspirants.",

This paper argues that the differential attention politicians pay to public services over their tenure cycle can explain levels of absenteeism. Using the case of teachers in India, teachers and politicians are embedded in a dynamic principal-agent relationship that allows for absenteeism when electoral incentives are not salient and results in increased accountability when they are. I constructed a panel of all schools across India between 2006 and 2018, employed an event study design, and found that teacher absenteeism decreases the year before an election and is higher the year after an election. I found inconsistent effects in the private sector, lending support for a channel of political control in the public sector. Political interference has an effect on bureaucratic performance, and relationships between public sector workers and politicians can ameliorate absenteeism.",

We also map the social basis of regime support coalitions and opponents, using a 14-category scheme covering various social groups. These data provide a unique quantitative history of the social underpinnings of regimes in the modern era.

Party-system literature emphasises and measures policy differences, while we conceptualise party systems’ democratic positions highlighting to what extent divergent regime preferences are prevalent across parties. To estimate this dimension, we introduce the Party-System Democracy Index (PSDI), capable of tracking regime preferences across party systems from 1970 to 2019 across 178 countries and 3,151 country-years. We implement well-established content, convergent, and construct validity tests to confirm the PSDI’s reliability. Finally, we also show that the PSDI is an important predictor for regime changes in either direction and that changes in the PSDI can signal a looming regime change. This work provides a new framework for studying regime changes and contributes to the renewal of the party-systems literature.",

The UK began weeks before EU countries, allowing us to examine its impact on EU support.

          "authors": "EMANUELA LOMBARDO, PALOMA CARAVANTES, SILVIA DÍAZ FERNÁNDEZ",
          "abstract": "Democracy and gender equality are increasingly contested in European parliamentary contexts, with the rise of political parties and movements that oppose feminist politics and the rights of women, LGBTI* and racialised people. Existing literature exploring far‐right and anti‐gender actors in institutional settings has focused on their discourse and impact on parliamentary politics and governments. Yet, limited attention has been paid to the feminist responses articulated in parliamentary contexts that face active opposition to gender and LGBTI* equality. This article addresses this gap by analysing feminist parliamentary responses to such opposition, and the factors that enable and constrain these responses, by undertaking a multi‐level comparison between the Catalan Parliament (2021–2024) and the Spanish Parliament (2019–2023), based on content analysis of 21 parliamentary debates and 42 in‐depth interviews. We argue that the capacity of parliaments to respond to anti‐gender, far‐right opposition to gender, racial and LGBTI* equality is structured by macro‐, meso‐ and micro‐level enabling and constraining factors that include the state of democracy and its legacies, state structure, the constellation of anti‐gender and pro‐equality forces, the institutionalisation of equality, and the role of critical actors. By identifying a range of feminist strategies employed in the Spanish and Catalan parliamentary contexts – including ‘knowledge’, ‘coalition‐building’, ‘rule‐making’ and ‘everyday pragmatic engagement’ – this article contributes to developing the emerging scholarly field of feminist institutional responses to anti‐gender politics, thereby advancing the theory of feminist institutionalism, state feminism and anti‐gender politics in parliamentary contexts.",

          "abstract": "How do welfare systems affect natives' attitudes to immigration? The impact of immigration on public support for welfare and redistribution has received considerable scholarly attention, but we know much less about how welfare policies shape citizens' views about immigration. We focus on two mechanisms: an instrumental channel and a values‐based approach. Our empirical strategy is two‐pronged. Hierarchical models leveraging variation in immigration attitudes and welfare generosity both between countries and over time (2002–2019) suggest that more comprehensive welfare regimes are associated with more positive views of immigrants. Furthermore, a regression discontinuity design drawing on a natural experiment in Denmark reveals that hostility towards immigrants increased following the announcement of a welfare retrenchment reform. Together, these analyses shed light on how the welfare state influences immigration attitudes.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines why some ethnic minorities in Europe have successful ethnic parties while others pursue their political interests through mainstream parties. To study differential success of ethnic minorities in establishing successful ethnic parties, I adapt threats‐vs‐resources approach, comparing relative importance of ethnic threats (acting as motivator for collective political activism) and ethnic resources (providing different opportunities facilitating ethnic mobilization). Empirically, I focus on the post‐Cold War period, including ethnic minorities in Western and Eastern Europe. I find that both ethnic threats and ethnic resources matter for success of ethnic parties. I show that increased salience of issues tied to ethnicity, either through promotion of majority ethnonationalism, or through advancement of minority ethnic rights, can foster successful ethnic parties. I also show that the logic behind successful minority political mobilization differs between Western and Eastern Europe.",

          "abstract": "A prominent paradigm demonstrates many White Americans respond negatively to information on their declining population share. But this paradigm considers this “racial shift” in a single hierarchy-challenging context that produces similar status threat responses across conceptually distinct outcomes, undercutting the ability to both explain the causes of Whites’ social and political responses and advance theorizing about native majorities’ responses to demographic change. We test whether evidence for Whites’ responses to demographic change varies across three distinct hierarchy-challenging contexts: society at large, culture, and politics. We find little evidence any racial shift information instills status threat or otherwise changes attitudes or behavioral intentions, and do not replicate evidence for reactions diverging by left- versus right-wing political attachments. We conclude with what our well-powered (n = 2100) results suggest about a paradigm and intervention used prominently, with results cited frequently, to understand native majorities’ responses to demographic change and potential challenges to multiracial democracy.",

Research so far only scarcely focused on parties’ attention towards specific issues at the subnational level—even though some issues are primarily dealt with at this level. Building on a novel data set covering 679 regional election manifestos in Austria and Germany between 1990 and 2019, we assess the influence of party-specific and contextual factors on subnational parties’ issue attention. More specifically, we hypothesize that a party’s national issue ownership has a positive influence on its issue attention in regional election manifestos. This effect should, however, be moderated by whether a regional party is in government at the regional and/or national level. Our results support our hypotheses: While issue ownership has a positive influence, government participation decreases this effect.",

We distinguish between assembly-based and plebiscitary IPD which represent two distinct logics of intra-party decision-making. The instrument was developed in the context of the first round of the Political Party Database Project (PPDB) covering 146 parties in 25 countries. It is now applied for the first time to parties in countries on all continents. We cover 274 parties from the second round of the PPDB in 51 countries, which provides us with a unique opportunity to assess the applicability and validity of this measure and compare it over time. Our results show that the expected stability of IPD values go together with plausible change over time. This opens up the potential to trace changes of IPD in detail and to investigate possible reasons for these changes. Furthermore, the new data are ideally suited to be applied in different institutional and cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Corruption undermines political and economic progress, yet corrupt politicians frequently win elections. While prior research explores voter attributes and institutional factors in corruption voting, the role of party responses remains underexamined, despite the ubiquity of party response “in the real world”. Using a survey experiment of 3,531 U.S. voters, we find that voter sanctioning of corrupt politicians increases significantly when their own party condemns the corruption, a pattern observed across Republicans and Democrats. Extreme partisanship amplifies this effect. Alternative party responses—such as party non-response, support for the corrupt politician, or condemnation by the opposition—have weaker effects on voter behavior. These findings indicate that voters rely heavily on party cues when processing corruption allegations. Parties’ public stances on co-partisan corruption thus play a critical role in shaping voter accountability, offering insights into how political rhetoric influences electoral outcomes in cases of corruption.",

In this paper, we explore the psychological dispositions driving positivity about the political future. We draw on psychologists’ distinction between optimism—a dispositional belief that good things will happen, come what may—and hope—a trait of envisioning, pursuing and believing one’s goals to be achievable. We assess pre-registered hypotheses about the distinct influences of optimism and hope on valence expectations—beliefs about whether there will be good or bad societal outcomes—and electoral expectations—beliefs about likely election outcomes—in a representative-sample survey experiment in the United Kingdom. We find that optimism drives positive valence expectations, but hope drives partisan electoral expectations. Indeed, partisan bias in electoral expectations is exhibited only by those scoring higher in hope. We show experimentally that positive information from polls and expert commentary dampens this impact of hope by raising the expectations of the otherwise unhopeful. Our findings suggest that so-called ‘wishful thinking’ about election outcomes might stem from a sense of agency around electoral politics, but that this sense of agency does not extend to how citizens envision society’s prospects.",

These relationships are explained by status quo rejection. Study 2 ( United States, N = 397, pre‐registered ) experimentally shows that a populist worldview increases support for such alternative regimes due to dissatisfaction with the status quo and feelings of powerlessness. Study 3 (United Kingdom, N = 298 ) disentangles the pro versus anti‐democratic facets of populism, showing that social justice positively mediates the relationship between populist attitudes and direct democracy, while negatively mediating the relationship between populist attitudes and autocracy. Study 4 (United States, N = 400, pre‐registered ) experimentally demonstrates that populist attitudes may lead to greater support for direct democracy due to increased support for social justice and to greater support for autocracy due to increased feelings of powerlessness. Together, these studies elucidate the complex populism–democracy nexus.",

          "abstract": "Religious nationalism occurs when people combine their religious beliefs with their attitudes about national politics and identity. Scholars have examined how religious nationalism predicts various sociopolitical attitudes; yet less attention has been dedicated to examining the predictors of this ideology. We report studies exploring the possibility that different images of God predict religious nationalism. Analyses of Waves I ( N = 1076) and II ( N = 1099) of the Baylor Religion Surveys found that US Christians harbor different images of God (benevolent, authoritarian, engaged, and angry) and that believing in a God that is benevolent, angry, and engaged predicted stronger religious nationalism. We partially replicate these findings in a preregistered study using US and Italian Christians ( N = 465). Stronger religious nationalism predicted a conspiracy mentality and more xenophobia across both contexts. The findings suggest that different images of God can predispose people to harbor an ideology of religious nationalism.",

We conducted two studies in the context of two real‐world social movements in France. Study 1 ( N = 1386) examined collective action against COVID‐19 restrictions, a movement that defended typical right‐wing values. Study 2 ( N = 418) examined collective action against pension reform, a movement that defended values typical of the left. In both studies, we found that the congruent political ideology (right‐wing in Study 1 and left‐wing in Study 2) and political extremism were both associated with greater intentions (Studies 1 and 2) and greater participation (Study 2) in collective action. Anger partially mediated the relationship between political extremism and collective action in both studies. Overall, our results call for considering political extremism in addition to the left/right dimension of political ideology in order to better understand engagement in collective action.",

This success of populist politics may evoke a backlash effect among more dominant groups in general, and the higher educated in particular, potentially triggering support for elitism. Based on preregistered analyses of survey data from four countries (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Greece), we find that support for elitism is more prevalent among members of groups that occupy dominant social positions in society (i.e., the higher educated, higher subjective income). We also find that education‐based identity, but not income‐based identity, amplifies these differences. Finally, elitist attitudes are embedded in a broader worldview that represents the status quo as fair (system justification) and opposes measures aimed at increasing social equality (anti‐egalitarianism).",

          "abstract": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has been criticized for numerous social, political, and environmental issues. While an important call to boycott the tournament spread worldwide, research has yet to document the motives underlying a boycott of such a mega sporting event. We investigated fans' intentions to boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in four countries of the Francophonie engaged in the World Cup ( N = 1635). We found that being highly identified with the team and enjoying football for aesthetic pleasures predicted rejection of the boycott, while the most robust predictor of boycott intentions was a concern for environmental issues. When assessing actual boycott behaviors among fans after the World Cup ( N = 286), we found a significant decrease compared to boycott intentions. Importantly, this intention–behavior gap was even more pronounced among politicized fans with high awareness of social and environmental issues who had initially planned to boycott the tournament. We discuss the paradox of calls to boycott mega sporting events: Unlike other consumer products, these events often have no alternatives, yet they are central to the social identity of sports fans. As a consequence, such a boycott may be better explained by a low level of fandom rather than solely by strong political values, with remaining boycotters likely being those who had little interest in the event from the outset.",

Study 2, a natural field experiment with a large dataset ( N = 12,489), demonstrated that the entry of a far‐right party into the German federal parliament reduced majority Germans' intentions for intergroup contact with refugees.

          "authors": "Mia Cotan Utomo, Luisa Batalha, Emina Subasic, Katherine Reynolds",
          "abstract": "There is much debate about how best to approach ethnocultural diversity in increasingly plural societies. Sustainable co‐existence of different group interests presents an ongoing challenge. In Australia, for example, discussion continues about the merits of multiculturalism (promotion of diversity and recognition of minority rights) versus assimilation (dampening of diversity through conformity to the dominant ethnoculture). The current research examines the impact of these political forces on both minority and majority group members. Can these debates and ideologies get under the skin, so to speak, and affect people's sense of place in society and consequently their wellbeing? A key concept in this research is the degree of (mis)alignment between personal ideology on the one hand and the social normative ideology on the other. Limited research to date has explored the impact of ideological differences on individual functioning. We explore the impact of ideological misalignment in two separate studies using different methodologies (i.e., cross‐sectional N = 195 and experimental N = 96). The results suggest that, for both ethnic minority and majority group members, misalignment reduces sense of belonging in mainstream society, which in turn hinders wellbeing. This was only part of the picture, however, as we find that misalignment can also indirectly lead to positive wellbeing. We argue that this occurs when misaligned individuals are able to find an alternative context for subgroup belonging. Altogether, this research highlights how social normative factors can powerfully impact individual functioning. As a theoretical framework, the social identity perspective provides valuable insights into why and how this occurs. This research is the first to investigate the wellbeing consequence of political misalignment with a focus on cultural diversity. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of the findings, acknowledging research limitations, and providing directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "By many accounts, the state of reviewing is in dire straits. Editors cannot get people to respond to review requests, much less to say yes and complete the review on time. In previous work (Djupe 2015; Djupe, Smith, and Sokhey 2022) conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, reviewing was heavily concentrated in a core set of reviewers, reviewing increased with age and rank, and political scientists stood by the value of peer reviewing for themselves, the discipline, and the research. Is any of that still true in the post-pandemic period? This article analyzes a Summer 2024 survey of 637 political scientists in comparison with 2013 data and finds an evident decline in reviewing post-pandemic from those who historically review the most. This pattern likely reflects broader movements, especially toward diversification, in the discipline and in higher education.",

          "abstract": "How are LGBTQ+ issues represented within labor organizing and how are they linked to broader debates about inequality? We answered these questions by examining press releases, internal resolutions, and online resources from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and the Pride at Work (PAW) constituency group. We find that they significantly differ in their approaches to symbolic and substantive representation and agenda setting. Across all three outcomes, PAW and the AFL-CIO vary in LGBTQ+ issue representation. The AFL-CIO engages in more symbolic representation but also devotes resources to collective action that can improve the lives of LGBTQ+ people. PAW places greater emphasis on the interconnectedness of LGBTQ+ and labor issues to mobilize LGBTQ+ people. Our findings highlight the marginal position of LGBTQ+ labor activism in the labor and LGBTQ+ movements, and they demonstrate the challenges associated with linking LGBTQ+ issues to broader debates about inequality in American politics.",

          "abstract": "When we open a random political science journal, we have a roughly two-to-one chance that the article is written by a man. Beyond this general finding, we know little about the gender gaps within political science knowledge production: Are women more represented in lower- or higher-ranked journals? Do they publish more single-authored or multiauthored papers? Do they publish more content in some fields than in others? This article answers these questions by analyzing an original dataset based on the International Political Science Abstracts (a peer-reviewed academic journal) from 2022 consisting of more than 7,000 articles and more than 13,000 authors in political science from around the world. We find no difference in the percentage of female authors between higher- and lower-ranked journals. We find a slightly higher propensity among women to publish in teams. Regarding subfields of study, women are particularly underrepresented in political theory, in which they publish only 21.6% of all published articles—which is an approximate 12-percentage-point deviation from the overall average.",

          "authors": "Jacob M. Lollis, Mackenzie R. Dobson",
          "abstract": "Are LGBTQ legislators effective lawmakers? We build on theories that link voter discrimination to legislative effectiveness by arguing that voters’ biases against LGBTQ candidates narrow the candidate pool, leading to the election of only the most experienced and qualified LGBTQ candidates. As a result of this electoral selection effect, we expect that LGBTQ legislators will be more effective lawmakers than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. To test this, we combine data on state legislators’ LGBTQ identification with their State Legislative Effectiveness Scores (SLES). Our findings reveal that LGBTQ legislators are meaningfully more effective than non-LGBTQ legislators. To link our findings to voter discrimination, we leverage over-time variation in discrimination toward LGBTQ individuals. Across four tests, we consistently find that LGBTQ lawmakers elected in high-discrimination environments are more effective than those elected from less discriminatory environments.",

          "authors": "Andrej Angelovski, Werner Güth, Simón Lodato, Christos Mavridis",
          "abstract": "We study charitable behaviour when genuine donations can be misinterpreted as being greedy. This is relevant when private benefits from donating, like tax exemptions, bring into question whether donors are truly altruistically motivated. In our experiment, a potential donor, the distributor , decides how to split a sum of money between themselves, a paired non-distributor , and a charity of their choice. Choosing to donate part of the sum to charity is socially efficient because the charity receives four times the amount, with the difference covered by the experimenters. Our conditions vary in the choice set available to the distributor and whether the choice set becomes known to the non-distributor . With the choice set unknown, the distributor may be concerned that the non-distributor will believe the money has been split unfairly, with the distributor keeping a larger share. Overall, we find this not to be the case: the number of individuals who donate to charity is not significantly lower when donating could be perceived as greedy.",
