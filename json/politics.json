          "authors": "Lucia Motolinia, Marko Klašnja, Simon Weschle",
          "abstract": "We provide a comprehensive theoretical and empirical account of the relationship between campaign finance pressures and the wealth of politicians. We argue that the heavily right‐skewed wealth distributions observed in contemporary societies translate into similarly skewed distributions of campaign resources. Such unequal resources mean that greater pressures to spend on campaigns disproportionately benefit the very wealthy. We also identify several conditions that determine the extent of the financing advantages of the very rich, and at whose expense they accrue. We test our propositions using a unique original data set on the wealth of more than 23,000 national legislators from 41 countries, as well as by exploiting quasi‐random variation in financing pressures provided by recent campaign finance reforms in Brazil and Chile. The analyses consistently show that greater financing pressures lead to greater shares of wealthy, and especially very wealthy legislators, and that these advantages vary in ways consistent with our predictions.",

          "authors": "Giacomo Floris",
          "abstract": "Harm reduction is one of the most controversial and widely discussed approaches in public health and social policy, addressing a broad range of pressing societal issues, including drug addiction, sex work, alcohol and tobacco use, and homelessness. Surprisingly, however, harm reduction has received very little philosophical scrutiny. In this article, I aim to fill this gap. First, I provide a systematic analysis of the core features and normative commitments of harm reduction. Second, I propose a novel, relational egalitarian justification for harm reduction. I argue that the provision of harm reduction services is not solely or primarily a matter of mitigating the negative consequences associated with high-risk behaviours. Rather, most fundamentally, it is the appropriate response to the status of vulnerable individuals as equal members of society.",

          "authors": "Diogo Ferrari, Brianna A. Smith",
          "abstract": "Past research indicates that support for conservatism increases when individuals perceive threat to their group’s social status – i.e., prestige and respect. However, the causal link between status threat and increased electoral support for conservative candidates has not been established. Most prior studies rely on observational data, and it remains unclear how the effect of status threat on candidate support varies depending on the specific conservative policies adopted by candidates. Additionally, previous research has not fully addressed whether and how these effects are constrained by voters’ party loyalty. This article investigates these questions by conducting a joint experiment combining vignette and conjoint designs. White Americans were randomly exposed to status threat communication, and then choose between different hypothetical candidates with varying degrees of conservatism on various issues. The results show large effects of candidates’ issue positions and partisanship, but very little effect of status threat.",

          "abstract": "How are experiences from socialist rule reflected in support for the former regime and ideological stances after democratization? This study examines how varied experiences under socialism—whether as regime supporters or victims of repression—continue to be linked to political behavior decades after transition. Using three decades of intergenerational panel data from the former German Democratic Republic, the findings show that repression is associated with long-term opposition to the regime’s successor party, Die Linke, while former party membership corresponds with lasting support. These experiences also relate to ideological self-placement, with distinct left-right patterns persisting based on past affiliations. Within families, the extent to which these political legacies are passed down depends on political interest, highlighting that they are not uniformly inherited. By exploring how socialist-era experiences remain embedded in post-transition political attitudes, this study underscores the role of historical experiences in shaping political behavior in new democracies.",

          "authors": "Claire Burchett",
          "abstract": "Research has examined the co-existence of pro-Jewish discourse and antisemitic incidents within the populist radical right parties (PRR), Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). This paper analyses this phenomenon through the lens of populist discourse, and finds that Jews are accepted into “the people” when they agree with the parties’ (mostly anti-Islam and anti-elitist) message. However, Jews are excluded, aligned with “the elite”, when they do not. This paper also finds that only the FPÖ demonstrates this same approach towards Israel. The parties thus pursue a dual strategy with regards to Jews and Israel: they use populist discourse as a way to “normalise” their framing of Jews and legitimise exclusion, but the overlap between antisemitic and anti-elitist ideas can make this appear as antisemitic dog-whistling.",

          "abstract": "Political parties as the sole vehicle for collective organising in the electoral arena are coming under increasing pressure in systems of representative democracy. A serious disruptor to party dominance has emerged in Australia where local community groups are self-organising to replace their federal party representative with a ‘community independent’. Collectively these groups are referred to as the “Community Independents Movement” (CIM), whose broad goal is to provide voters with an alternative to the “broken” party system. This article asks: what in practice is the alternative form of political organising offered by the CIM? An analysis finds that the CIM performs many conventional functions of political parties, but its localised approach affords greater flexibility and local autonomy. The case of the CIM speaks to global debates on the conceptual and functional differences between parties and other modes of political organising.",

Using a novel application of the synthetic control method, I estimate the overall and partisan effects of BLM on aggregate public opinion. Rather than comparing places with more or less BLM activity, I compare confidence in police to confidence in other institutions, and support for police spending to support for other priorities. I find small or non-existent effects for the overall population, substantial negative effects for Democrats, and substantial positive effects for Republicans. Moreover, and despite Democratic politicians’ attempt to distance themselves from the “defund” position, these partisan effects have persisted, with Democratic backlash against police notably larger than Republican increases in support.",

          "authors": "Marie‐Isabel Theuwis",
          "abstract": "Populism among citizens is often perceived as a problem for democracies due to its rejection of representative practices. In response, scholars have put forward new democratic designs that enhance the democratic system's inclusiveness and popular control, thereby aiming to decrease populism among citizens, or so‐called populist attitudes. However, it is not known whether populist attitudes are even changeable, and whether they respond to such democratic improvements or merely reflect the populist ideas supplied by populist parties. This paper explores the behavior of populist attitudes over time and considers possible drivers of populist attitudes change. For doing so, it conducts a latent growth curve analysis of panel data from the Netherlands and Great Britain spanning approximately four years and containing 16 and 6 waves, respectively. The analyses show that populist attitudes fluctuate over time, and that changes in populist attitudes are associated with changes in democratic satisfaction. This implies that populist attitudes could function as a thermometer of a political system's perceived democratic quality.",

          "authors": "Maciej Siemiątkowski, Michał Bilewicz, Maria Babińska",
          "abstract": "The key aim of the present research was to analyze the causal effects of authoritarian submission on intergroup helping intentions and susceptibility to anti‐helping misinformation in a context where authorities are mobilizing national support for the outgroup. Employing a longitudinal design, we surveyed a sample of Polish residents ( N in t 3 = 710) to examine distinct effects of RWA facets (authoritarian aggression, conventionalism, and authoritarian submission) on intergroup helping intentions and susceptibility to anti‐helping misinformation. For the first time, we have shown that while characteristics related to certain RWA facets can encourage supportive actions that align with the directives of authorities, others may simultaneously exacerbate existing negative attitudes. Our study revealed that while conventionalism predicted increased susceptibility to anti‐helping misinformation, authoritarian submission had a negative effect on this variable. Furthermore, only authoritarian submission increased intergroup helping intentions over time, reflecting adherence to norms endorsed by authorities. These findings highlight the complexity of RWA effects, suggesting that due to their opposite signs, certain relationships might be reduced when RWA is treated as a unidimensional construct. This emphasizes the need to recognize the multifaceted nature of RWA when designing both research as well as strategies aimed at promoting harmonious intergroup relations.",

          "abstract": "We investigate whether studies on political belief change can identify change trajectories at the individual level. Using simulations and case studies, we propose a grid‐search framework that allows researchers to evaluate the extent to which their target estimates generalize to their study population. We use simulated datasets to estimate plausible values for how many people changed, how much they changed, and who changed, based on observed response trajectories. Our results suggest that researchers should think carefully about the conditions under which they may make claims about belief change at the individual level. To guide substantive theory‐building, we propose a concise diagnostic routine researchers can use to translate their claims into a set of plausible alternatives and evaluate potential generative processes. We provide an R package to help researchers implement this procedure in their own work.",

          "abstract": "Although much has been written on legislative reciprocity, rarely have scholars had an opportunity to leverage a randomly assigned asset to assess whether and how legislators reciprocate when their colleagues assist them. Using the lottery that allows Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs) to propose bills or motions, we examine whether MPs’ priority numbers affect their proclivity to second motions made by other MPs, which would be expected if MPs sought to build support for their own proposals by supporting proposals by others. Although MPs almost always make a proposal if their priority number allows them to do so, we find a weak relationship between MPs’ priority numbers and their probability of seconding others’ proposals. Moreover, when we look at successive parliaments, we see only faint indications that those who, by chance, won the right to propose in the previous session (and who therefore were eligible to attract seconds) are more likely to second others’ proposals in the current session. Although subject to a fair amount of statistical uncertainty that will gradually dissipate as future parliaments are examined, this pattern of evidence currently suggests that correlated seconding behavior among legislators is more the product of homophily than reciprocity.",

          "abstract": "There have been growing concerns that political polarization is intensifying. These concerns, however, are primarily based on anecdotal evidence, aggregate measures related to political competition, or survey data that aim at eliciting public opinion. We adopt a different approach and look at polarization among the political elite. We examine the degree of consensus in parliamentary voting in the Polish parliament between 2005 and 2023. We find that political polarization was on the rise and that reaching agreement between the parties was more difficult when the votes concerned economic issues. Our results also demonstrate that voting in Parliament essentially became one-dimensional in that it was mainly driven by the government-opposition divide. We also document that voting against the party line was extremely rare, whether the MPs were in the government or an opposition party. This suggests that party discipline may be an important driver of political polarization.",

These findings are in tension with existing work on the ideological structure of specific support of the Supreme Court, which finds more tolerance for ideological disagreement among liberals than among conservatives. In this note, we replicate and extend Haglin et al. (2021), whose analysis ends in 2018. We find that asymmetries in the association between Supreme Court approval and Americans’ ideological disagreement with the Court have changed substantially and abruptly, depressing aggregate Supreme Court approval. However, this break in the structure of Supreme Court approval occurred in the year preceding Dobbs . These results indicate the roots of Americans’ turn against the Supreme Court run deeper than Dobbs and suggest a startling erosion in judicial legitimacy.",

Surprisingly, we find that Americans do not meaningfully distinguish between 6-week and 12-week bans. This suggests that attempts by some Republican officials to navigate the post-Dobbs landscape by proposing “moderate” abortion restrictions may be ineffective. However, we find that framing does matter: pro-life framing of bans increases support for candidates who endorse them, while pro-choice framing increases support for candidates who oppose them. Overall, our findings indicate that in the post-Dobbs era, the abortion debate has largely been flattened to a binary of “ban” versus “no ban,” rather than distinctions between ban timelines. As the post-Dobbs legal and political environment continues to evolve, our research provides valuable insights into how the public is responding to this new landscape of abortion politics in America.",

          "title": "ConflLlama: Domain-specific adaptation of large language models for conflict event classification",
          "authors": "Shreyas Meher, Patrick T. Brandt",
          "abstract": "We present ConflLlama, demonstrating how efficient fine-tuning of large language models can advance automated classification tasks in political science research. While classification of political events has traditionally relied on manual coding or rigid rule-based systems, modern language models offer the potential for more nuanced, context-aware analysis. However, deploying these models requires overcoming significant technical and resource barriers. We demonstrate how to adapt open-source language models to specialized political science tasks, using conflict event classification as our proof of concept. Through quantization and efficient fine-tuning techniques, we show state-of-the-art performance while minimizing computational requirements. Our approach achieves a macro-averaged AUC of 0.791 and a weighted F1-score of 0.753, representing a 37.6% improvement over the base model, with accuracy gains of up to 1463% in challenging classifications. We offer a roadmap for political scientists to adapt these methods to their own research domains, democratizing access to advanced NLP capabilities across the discipline. This work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI developments and practical political science research needs, enabling broader adoption of these powerful analytical tools.",

          "authors": "Sarah Maxey, Taryn Butler",
          "abstract": "Access to and control over the classification process is a key component of executive power in the United States. This power is rooted in the public’s trust that the White House will safeguard national secrets and use its authority to protect national security. Secrecy, however, is in tension with democratic norms of transparency, making political backlash possible if leaders stretch their powers too far. What are the consequences of mishandled documents for the public’s trust in the government? We argue that the abuse of classified documents undermines not only presidential approval but also confidence in democratic institutions writ large. We test these expectations using survey experiments that vary information about the type of document classified, whether the White House handled top secret documents correctly, and evidence of mishandling by either civilian or military officials. The findings show that while the public generally tolerates secrecy and executive power, the consequences when the White House breaks this trust are wide-ranging and undermine public confidence in democracy as a whole.",

          "title": "Islamophobia in Western Europe is unrelated to religiosity but highly correlated with far right attitudes",
          "authors": "Kai Arzheimer",
          "abstract": "The far right’s relationship with religion has become a major focus of current research. Even in Western Europe, one of the most rapidly secularising areas of the world, far right actors claim to defend Christian values against the alleged threat of Islam and Muslim immigrants, a rhetorical strategy known as ‘Christianism’. Yet, little is known about how religiosity, Islamophobia, and populist far-right ideology are connected at the level of mass belief systems in Western Europe. Most of the literature is focused either on religiosity’s effect on voting or on the connection between religiosity and ethnic prejudice, without considering religiosity’s relationships with the wider spectrum of far-right ideology. The present article fills this gap by analysing survey data from Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. It uses SEM to uncover the relationships between Christian religiosity on the one hand and Islamophobia and far-right attitudes on the other. The results are broadly similar across different contexts: religiosity is mostly unrelated to Islamophobia, nativism, right-wing authoritarianism, and populism. Conversely, Islamophobia overlaps considerably with both nativism and authoritarianism: people who perceive immigration as a threat and favour strict laws and harsh enforcement also tend to reject Islam, but not for religious reasons. This pattern is compatible with the strategy of Christianism, which is largely devoid of religiosity, yet facilitates the “othering” of Muslims as a cultural out-group. It also helps to explain why there is no genuine, electorally relevant religious far right in Western Europe.",
