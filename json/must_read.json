    "abstract": "The rise of social media has sparked extensive research on its relationship with well-being, yet drawing definitive conclusions remains challenging due to the multifaceted nature and diversification of these platforms. To gain a clearer understanding of this relationship, it is essential to explore how various social media platforms both cross-sectionally and longitudinally relate to well-being as well as to explore direct and indirect relationships mediated by other factors. Such investigation is lacking especially in Non-Western context. To address this gap, the author examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of X (formerly Twitter) and LINE use with life satisfaction—a key indicator of well-being—both directly and indirectly through the quality of online relationships, within a 4-year cohort of 1,674 Japanese adults. Multivariate latent growth curve modeling revealed a mixed relationship between X use and life satisfaction. Direct relationships with life satisfaction were negative, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In contrast, an indirect relationship—mediated by online relationships—was positive both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In contrast, LINE use consistently showed positive relationships with life satisfaction, with both direct and indirect positive cross-sectional associations through online relationships. These findings underscore the growing diversity of social media platforms and the need to recognize that the relationship between social media use and life satisfaction varies depending on the platform in both Western and non-Western contexts. To support well-being, public education and digital literacy efforts should address the risks of excessive use of open-network platforms like X, while avoiding overgeneralizations to closed-network platforms like LINE, which may enhance well-being through supportive relationships."

    "abstract": "The erosion of public trust in health information and government communication, particularly during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, highlights a critical challenge in how health policies are transmitted and received. This study examines the dramatic shift in public sentiment toward Covid-19 vaccination in South Africa during 2021, a period that saw a decline from initial high acceptance to significant hesitancy. We argue that a process of social media selection allowed extreme views to proliferate as official sources retreated. Our findings suggest that sustained or increased mainstream media engagement, particularly from official sources like government and health authorities, could have mitigated the dominance of anti-vaccine narratives and have crucial implications for government communication and public health policies in the digital age. We collected and classified 482,450 original tweets about vaccination. We show that, by the end of 2021, Twitter activity was characterized by a progressive surge in anti-vaccination tweets and a decline in pro-vaccination and factual information, particularly from mainstream media. This shift mirrors the decrease in actual vaccination rates. Employing agent-based modeling, we simulated counterfactual scenarios to assess the impact of media presence on vaccine discourse. The results indicate that sustained or increased media engagement could have mitigated the dominance of anti-vaccine narratives. Conversely, a simulated media downturn led to a steeper decline in pro-vaccination content. The findings suggest that mainstream news media play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of and support for health policies and that their disengagement creates an informational void exploited by misinformation."

In the first part, the article outlines the context of the analytical framework at the intersection of three main research fields: political communication, in particular the study of electoral campaigns via social media; visual culture and communication, precisely the analysis of the visual representation, self‐representation, and counter‐representation of political leaders; and computer science, in particular the application of machine learning techniques for computer vision to recognize and categorize visual political content. In the second part, the article offers an application of the analytical framework by sharing some empirical results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the visual content published by 21 Italian political actors on Facebook and Instagram during the campaign, focusing on their main visual formats, themes, and strategies of representation of political leadership. In the analysis, deep learning models are also employed to detect specific image characteristics by cross‐referencing their outputs with manual cataloguing performed on the same images and for the same attributes. In the end, on the basis of the research carried out, the article suggests possible paths for future interdisciplinary analysis of online visual political communication."

    "abstract": "Criticism of the EU has become a common feature of political communication in Central and Eastern Europe and it is often tied to broader concerns about democratic erosion and distrust in institutions. This study investigates how anti-EU rhetoric was employed on Facebook by political actors in the Visegrád countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) during the 2024 European Parliament elections and how it relates to the populist style of communication. Drawing on a comparative content analysis of more than 6,000 posts, the study examines how messages that negatively target the EU incorporate elements of populist rhetoric and emotional tools, such as fear speech and patriotic symbols. The findings show that populist actors were the most frequent users of anti-EU messaging, with anti-elitist framing as the strongest and most consistent rhetorical strategy, often accompanied by other emotional tools. Despite political differences, anti-EU campaigning showed consistent regional patterns. This article contributes to research on political communication by offering a regional comparison, incorporating visual analysis, and challenging the idea that negative messaging is a reliable strategy for mobilising audiences online."

Adolescents ( N = 573; M age = 15.38, SD = 1.34; 68.2% female) completed online surveys twice over 4 months. A cross-lagged mediation model demonstrated unidirectional relationships, whereby body dissatisfaction predicted higher investment and lower posting 4 months later. Mediation was only found via one pathway; body dissatisfaction predicted greater selfie investment via upward comparisons. Gender did not moderate the relationships. These findings provide little support for sociocultural mechanisms, suggesting researchers pursue alternative frameworks."

US adults ( N = 1054) participated in a pre-registered ( https://osf.io/9wnm2 ) online experiment, indicating their trust in five experts and evaluating the accuracy of four claims. Claims were attributed to experts from impact fields (focused on the consequences of industry and policy), production fields (industry-focused), scientists in general, or no source. Results show that liberals trust all experts more than conservatives and generally perceive claims as more accurate. However, the trust gap between liberals and conservatives is smaller for production experts. While no difference was found between the perceived accuracy of claims attributed to production versus impact experts, expert attribution increased some claims’ perceived accuracy. These findings reveal some political-ideology preferences and that attributing a claim to an expert can improve its perception."

While numerous experiments find that partisans adopt the stances of their leaders, these findings may not generalize easily to the context of real news, which often contains richer policy information and more subtle, ambiguous party cues than the artificial stimuli commonly employed. To investigate the impact of party cues as they naturally appear in news coverage—what I term real‐news party cues —I develop a new experimental paradigm. I first sample 70 articles covering political proposals from a large pool of real news and prepare two versions of each: one with and one without these cues. These articles then serve as stimuli in survey experiments among representative samples of Americans ( n  = 12,177). I find that real‐news party cues have mostly modest effects on policy opinions."

    "abstract": "Many networks in political and social research are bipartite, connecting two distinct node types. A common example is cosponsorship networks, where legislators are linked through the bills they support. However, most bipartite network analyses in political science rely on statistical models fitted to a “projected” unipartite network. This approach can lead to aggregation bias and an artificially high degree of clustering, invalidating the study of group roles in network formation. To address these issues, we develop a statistical model of bipartite networks theorized to arise from group interactions, extending the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. Our model identifies groups within each node type that exhibit common edge formation patterns and incorporates node and dyad-level covariates as predictors of group membership and observed dyadic relations. We derive an efficient computational algorithm to fit the model and apply it to cosponsorship data from the United States Senate. We show that senators who were perfectly split along party lines remained productive and pass major legislation by forming non-partisan, power-brokering coalitions that found common ground through low-stakes bills. We also find evidence of reciprocity norms and policy expertise impacting cosponsorships. An open-source software package is available for researchers to replicate these insights."

    "abstract": "Codebooks—documents that operationalize concepts and outline annotation procedures—are used almost universally by social scientists when coding political texts. To code these texts automatically, researchers are increasingly turning to generative large language models (LLMs). However, there is limited empirical evidence on whether “off-the-shelf” LLMs faithfully follow real-world codebook operationalizations and measure complex political constructs with sufficient accuracy. To address this, we gather and curate three real-world political science codebooks—covering protest events, political violence, and manifestos—along with their unstructured texts and human-coded labels. We also propose a five-stage framework for codebook-LLM measurement: Preparing a codebook for both humans and LLMs, testing LLMs’ basic capabilities on a codebook, evaluating zero-shot measurement accuracy (i.e., off-the-shelf performance), analyzing errors, and further (parameter-efficient) supervised training of LLMs. We provide an empirical demonstration of this framework using our three codebook datasets and several pre-trained 7–12 billion open-weight LLMs. We find current open-weight LLMs have limitations in following codebooks zero-shot, but that supervised instruction-tuning can substantially improve performance. Rather than suggesting the “best” LLM, our contribution lies in our codebook datasets, evaluation framework, and guidance for applied researchers who wish to implement their own codebook-LLM measurement projects."

Our data are consistent with our hypotheses, and, as expected, we find particularly strong relationships for Democratic respondents. The results highlight the importance of considering mental health when studying the approval of politicians both in and out of office. We conclude with a discussion of next steps for a research agenda on depression and political evaluations."

    "abstract": "Household surveys are an important means of obtaining standardized data; unfortunately, response rates have been declining for decades. Evidence based on social exchange theory supports the use of small, unconditional monetary incentives (pre-incentives) to increase survey response and completion rates. However, the optimal pre-incentive amount is unclear. Our project team was contracted to conduct a large survey (census) of all households in Indiana at which an individual with a developmental disability who was on the waitlist for certain state-based services resided. In the absence of a clear answer from the literature about what pre-incentive amount to use, we preregistered a sub-study to obtain clarity. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing a $1 cash pre-incentive to a $2 cash pre-incentive in a large, mail push-to-web household survey in the midwestern US, examining both response rates and completion rates (&amp;gt;80 percent of the survey). We hypothesized that a $2 pre-incentive would result in significantly more responses and completed surveys than a $1 pre-incentive. Using 1:1 blinded allocation, 6,525 households were randomized to receive either a $1 or $2 cash pre-incentive. All other procedures were identical between study arms. Of the 960 valid responses, 467 were from Arm 1 ($1) and 493 were from Arm 2 ($2). Of those, there were 798 complete responses (&amp;gt;80 percent of the instrument). We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that there was a difference in either response (OR = 1.07, p = .361, 95 percent CI [0.929, 1.223]) or completion (OR = 1.07, p = .362, 95 percent CI [0.924, 1.242]) rates depending on the amount of pre-incentive included in the invitation. Although we provide multiple caveats and encourage caution when interpreting these findings, we suggest that individuals planning to use a small pre-incentive to encourage survey responses should not by default assume that a $2 incentive is superior to a $1 incentive."

    "abstract": "As visual content becomes increasingly prominent on social media, automated image categorization is vital for computational social science efforts to identify emerging visual themes and narratives in online debates. However, the methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently used in the field are unable to fully capture the connotative meaning of images, and struggle to produce easily interpretable clusters. In response to these challenges, we test an approach that leverages the ability of Vision-and-Large-Language-Models (VLLMs) to generate image descriptions that incorporate connotative interpretations of the input images. In particular, we use a VLLM to generate connotative textual descriptions of a set of images related to climate debate, and cluster the images based on these textual descriptions. In parallel, we cluster the same images using a more traditional approach based on CNNs. In doing so, we compare the connotative semantic validity of clusters generated using VLLMs with those produced using CNNs, and assess their interpretability. The results show that the approach based on VLLMs greatly improves the quality score for connotative clustering. Moreover, VLLM-based approaches, leveraging textual information as a step towards clustering, offer a high level of interpretability of the results."

In this work, we propose an example of an exploratory multiverse simulation to empirically compare various decision pathways to identify an effect’s sensitivity to different analytical choices. The approach is demonstrated on the congruency sequence effect (CSE), a well-studied phenomenon in cognitive control research. We reviewed existing literature to identify common non-theory-specific analytical decisions, such as outlier exclusion criteria and hypothesis testing methods, and incorporated these into our simulation framework. Using 20,000 simulated datasets, we compared the true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) across 50 different decision pathways, resulting in a total of 1 million analyses. Our results indicate substantial differences in power and type I error rates across the analytical pathways, with some posing a significant risk of producing high false positives. The findings underscore the importance of running extensive simulations to investigate different data handling and hypothesis testing approaches in certain research fields. This case study serves as an example for conducting similar simulation procedures in research fields characterized by high variability in analytical decisions when investigating an otherwise widely accepted effect."

    "abstract": "Social norms approaches have been widely applied in health promotion as a cost-effective behaviour-change strategy, but have been little evaluated as a whole. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using social norms messaging in developed countries targeted at changing health behaviours among 16+-year-olds to evaluate their effectiveness. Relevant studies were identified through searches in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, TRIP, Cochrane and grey literature sources. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis standardized effect sizes to Cohen’s d , assessed heterogeneity with I ² and applied robust Bayesian meta-analysis to adjust for publication bias. Searches resulted in 89 studies ( n = 85,759), which exhibited a small effect of social norms messaging on health behaviours (Cohen’s d = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.19], P &lt; 0.001). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for publication bias. We conducted moderator analyses, finding no significant differences from the overall effect for different types of social norms message, delivery modalities, health domains or target populations. The review is limited by the lack of studies assessing whether normative information changed participant perceptions, inconsistent use of manipulation checks, and high heterogeneity across studies in terms of target behaviour, population and intervention delivery, affecting the robustness of conclusions. Our analysis suggests that when appropriately controlling for publication bias, social norms messages are not effective at improving health behaviours. Thus, future attempts at improving public health should focus on alternative approaches."

    "abstract": "Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,078 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 46.1% in reposts, 44.1% in likes, 21.9% in replies, and 13.5% in views after being attached. Over the posts’ entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.6% fewer reposts, 13.3% fewer likes, 6.9% fewer replies, and 5.5% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep and less “viral,” but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach."

    "abstract": "Affective polarization is a corrosive force in American politics. While numerous studies have developed interventions to reduce it, their capacity for creating lasting, large-scale change is unclear. This study comprehensively evaluates existing interventions through a meta-analysis of 77 treatments from 25 published studies and two large-scale experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals that the average effect of treatments on animosity is modest (a 5.4-point shift on a 101-point scale), and decays within two weeks. We experimentally test whether stacking multiple treatments in one sitting or repeating them over time as “booster shots” enhances their impact. We find no evidence that multiple or repeated exposures produce substantially larger or more durable reductions in partisan animosity. This reveals the uneven utility of these interventions. They serve as valuable tools for testing the psychological mechanisms of polarization, but our findings indicate they are not, on their own, a scalable solution for reducing societal-level conflict. We conclude that achieving lasting depolarization will likely require a shift in focus, moving beyond individual-level treatments to address the elite behaviors and structural incentives that fuel partisan conflict."
