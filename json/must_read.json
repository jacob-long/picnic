    "authors": "Emilija Gagrčin",
    "abstract": "This article introduces the Scope of Civic Online Platform Engagement (SCOPE) framework to explain how users interpret and negotiate civic action on social media. It distinguishes between responsibility, which pertains to the obligation side of action (who should act) and legitimacy, which concerns who may act with authority and appropriateness. Building on affordance theory, boundary theory, and research on heuristics, SCOPE demonstrates how affordances shape the conditions for action. Users apply heuristics to interpret cues of visibility, relational ties, spatial mandates, and temporal urgency. These interpretations are then translated into boundary work, shaping responsibility and legitimacy judgments. To operationalize this process, the article proposes decision-making matrices that condense boundary judgments into simple two-question tests of when and by whom civic action is expected. The framework reorients the study of digital citizenship from abstract prescriptions of “good citizenship” to situated and recursive practices of boundary negotiation in platform environments.",

    "authors": "Christian Baden, Annett Heft, Michael Vaughan, Barbara Pfetsch",
    "abstract": "Social media have profoundly changed social communication practices across a vast range of contexts. To theorize these changes, numerous authors have proposed digital affordances as a conceptual lens. Yet, to date, most accounts of digital affordances either gloss broadly over cross-platform or use-dependent differences in practices; or they are highly context-specific, obstructing theoretical integration. In this article, we conceptualize social media affordances on an intermediate level of abstraction that foregrounds consequential differences in how digital social media platforms structure social communication practices. Focusing on the characteristic communication needs of social movements as an exemplary case, we identify how social media platforms present users with differential affordances for articulating public claims, building collective identities, and mobilizing contentious performances. We examine how key contextual conditions alter the value of differential affordances, potentially resulting in differential communication practices and platform preferences. We conclude by discussing key opportunities of our approach for comparative research and theory building.",

    "authors": "Yannic Meier, Philipp K Masur",
    "abstract": "Using internet technologies exposes individuals to constant surveillance by companies and other actors. Perceptions of constant surveillance—termed “dataveillance”—are theorized to induce chilling effects (i.e., inhibiting legal and legitimate online activities) posing risks to individuals and societies. In this preregistered longitudinal 3-wave experiment (N = 774), we investigate whether news articles addressing constant online surveillance induce feelings of dataveillance and behavioral inhibitions. Moreover, we extend theoretical notions of dataveillance by examining whether perceived dataveillance relates to other factors that drive privacy behaviors—privacy resignation and critical privacy literacy. Results of Bayesian random-effects within–between models indicate that perceived dataveillance is positively associated with inhibited behaviors, resignation, and literacy. However, these relations only pertain to the between-person level as the within-person associations are possibly too small to be meaningful. Critical privacy literacy might be central for privacy behaviors as we find both between- and within-person associations with self-inhibition.",

A meta-analysis of 223 effect sizes from 103 studies supported the presence of both reciprocal and self-causing relationships, suggesting their robustness as communication phenomena. Time lag moderated self-causing effects, such that longer intervals weakened these effects. Longer lags attenuating the influence of media/communication on subsequent outcomes approached but did not reach statistical significance, and did not significantly alter the reverse pathway. Exploratory moderation analyses showed that effect sizes varied by audience age, analytic methods, topic areas, and media types. Findings highlight the importance of time lag specification in studying dynamic media effects.",

    "abstract": "For those with marginalized identities, social media may offer opportunities for identity exploration and affirmation but may also pose challenges of context collapse, wherein the presence of multiple audiences makes identity-related posting awkward or dangerous. To probe short-term longitudinal patterns, 337 LGBTQ+ 15- to 22-year-olds completed six weekly surveys during Pride Month. As hypothesized, identity exploration was associated with self-reported frequency, positivity, and authenticity of youths’ LGBTQ+ self-presentations online, primarily among those who, on average, rated their online audiences as less heterogeneous (i.e., perceived less context collapse). Consistent with the self-effects model, positivity of self-presentations predicted increases in self-acceptance and self-esteem, with the latter association stronger for those who, on average, received more supportive feedback. In contrast, frequency and authenticity of self-presentations did not predict self-acceptance and self-esteem.",

In line with research on relational maintenance and the communicate bond belong theory, a need for connection can drive individuals to reach out to relational partners through mobile and social media, which might boost overall well-being. Using 3 longitudinal datasets that differ by time period (i.e., 6 years, 1 year, 1 month) and context (i.e., older adults’ pandemic-era communication, college student communication with friends, daily diary study of social media use), we test whether change in sociality moderates the association between frequency of mobile and social media use and well-being. In contrast to our hypothesis, when experiencing declines in sociality, the use of mobile and social media was either unrelated to well-being or associated with a decline in well-being. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about relational maintenance through media.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that platform differences can affect users’ online political engagement. However, there are few studies exploring the impact of different terminals on the online political engagement of netizens on the same platform. To explore this issue, this study captured user messages from four different terminals of the Leadership Message Board on People's Daily Online : the WeChat Mini Program; application client; mobile webpage; and PC webpage. The aim was to discover the differences in user political engagement behavior when using different terminals for the same platform. The findings show that although users try to engage in political issues online on the same platform with similar purposes, the differences in what terminal they use to access it significantly affect the results of such engagement. Concepts of “rehearsal space,” “psychological ownership,” and “redirection convenience” are introduced to help explain this phenomenon.",

    "authors": "Sylvain Parasie, Antoine Machut, Béatrice Mazoyer",
    "abstract": "This article explores the role played by legacy media in the pervasive situation where far-right activists highly politicize migrant crimes on social media. Focusing on particular crimes they consider indicative of a state’s failure to secure borders and protect its citizens, they utilize social media platforms to mobilize and garner political and media attention. However, little is known about the dynamics of influence between far-right activism on social media and legacy media in the process of politicizing migrant crimes. To overcome the analytical and methodological limitations of current research, we have developed a computational method to capture the public discussion that took place in France around a single event – the murder of a young teenager in Paris in October 2022. Applying an event identification algorithm to a vast corpus of Twitter data has enabled us to analyze the dynamics of public discussion held in various arenas, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This article’s main argument is that legacy media act as a “moral compass” vis-à-vis far-right mobilizations that politicize migrant crimes on social media. While they were unable to influence the volume of attention that social media users pay to this murder, the French legacy media have contributed to setting limits to the form and spread of politicization by the far right on social media. More specifically, they were able to influence the attention paid to the facts that serve as the basis for discussion on social media and to steer that discussion toward questioning the relevance of politicizing the crime.",

To answer this fundamental question, we examine how well federal lawmaking reflects the preferences of 520,000 Black, Latino, Asian American, and white citizens from 2006 to 2022. Average racial gaps in responsiveness are small regardless of issue area. However, white voters are significantly advantaged when Republicans control the government. Respondents’ class, age, and ideology cannot explain this disparity. Respondents’ partisanship explains some, but not all, of it. To further investigate, we analyze roll call votes in Congress, focusing on the Senate—the pivotal lawmaking institution. Similar patterns emerge: Republican Senators better represent white (versus Black or Latino) constituents. Moreover, Black-white disparities are larger in states where Black Americans comprise more of the population. This suggests a role for white racial attitudes, and, indeed, we find that state-level white racial resentment predicts Black-white representational disparities.",

This study investigates the impact of political scandals in multilevel political systems and explores three possibilities: contagion , where trust erodes across all political levels; containment , where evaluations are limited to the specific institutions involved; and contrast , where actors at other levels appear more trustworthy in comparison. We present the first experimental test of vertical contagion, containment, and contrast effects following real-world scandals in UK and Scottish politics: Partygate and Campervangate. We find weak evidence of contagion in the Scottish-level ‘Campervangate’ scandal, although trust reductions were small and often not significant. However, the ‘Partygate’ scandal reveals a distinct contrast effect: trust decreased in UK political actors but increased at the Scottish level. These results suggest that scandals in multilevel polities can influence evaluations of ‘innocent’ political actors, with troubling consequences for democratic accountability mechanisms.",

This practice has been recognized by journalists and political actors over the years, but the questions of what sorts of Republicans engage in it and why have rarely been studied scientifically. Analyzing congressional floor speeches, committee meetings, media reports, and electronic newsletters, we demonstrate that Democrat Party usage by Republican members of Congress is positively correlated with conservatism. We further show that congressional Republicans are likelier to use the term when in the minority in their chamber and when addressing an external audience. These findings are consistent with our theory that Democrat Party functions as a form of multivocal communication, invoked by conservative Republicans to subtly signal their ideology to likeminded constituents.",

    "abstract": "Political conversations are crucial for democracy. Yet, the mechanisms behind the selection of conversation partners remain unclear. We investigate the effect of observing similarities in apolitical characteristics—such as gender, age, personality, or lifestyle choices—on people’s decision to engage in political conversations, and whether ideological expectations or apolitical homophily drive this effect. To this end, we introduce the “dynamic parallel conjoint experiment” and field it in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, and Sweden. We find that observing apolitical similarities in others consistently increases the likelihood of engaging in political conversations. Political expectations engendered by these similarities do not play a relevant role. Rather, similarities motivate political conversations directly through homophily, providing evidence supporting the “incidental model” of political conversations (Minozzi et al., 2020). Our study contributes to debates on the dynamics underlying political conversation and introduces an innovative methodological approach for studying implicit mediation in political behavior.",

Across two studies on U.S. citizens, we examine whether news coverage of misinformation generates misperceptions and decreases levels of trust in information institutions (i.e., media, professors, and scientists) and whether its effects can be comparable to those of exposure to untrustworthy content. We rely on an online experiment using mock social media posts (Study 1, N = 1,670) and also on online behavioral tracking data paired with over-time survey self-reports (Study 2, N = 804). Study 1 finds that exposure to both actual misinformation and the coverage of misinformation affect misperceptions, but does not decrease trust. Study 2 presents evidence that behaviorally tracked visits to untrustworthy sites and exposure to news coverage of misinformation—although relatively rare—do not affect misperceptions, but both predict lower levels of trust in scientists, with less consistent effects for media and university professors. These results support concerns that not only misinformation but also its coverage contribute to epistemic uncertainty by eroding confidence in credible sources of knowledge, and warrant further inquiry into the potential harms of news media’s attention to misinformation.",

Specifically, we argue that third-person perception, a perception gap between presumed media influence on others and influence on oneself, reinforces the consideration of election pledges through the mechanisms of expectation confirmation or disconfirmation. The empirical results confirm that, first, voters who believe in pledge fulfillment are more likely to frequently take election pledges into account when making their voting decisions, and second, voters who believe that pledges are likely to be broken are less likely to do so, although this is the case only for those who do not have third-person perception. Finally, we observe that voters’ consideration of election pledges is reinforced by third-person perception, which to some extent ensures a link between voters’ policy preferences and governments’ policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "Labor union members are more likely to vote than their nonunionized counterparts, and when they do vote, are more likely to support the Democratic Party. However, a sizable minority of union members vote Republican. This is puzzling, given that the national Republican Party has long been hostile toward organized labor. Extant research has clearly demonstrated that union and nonunion members differ in their voting behavior, but we know little about such variation among union members. I explore this latter phenomenon here, arguing that the frequency of workplace political discussion plays an important role in shaping how labor union members vote. I test this with data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES). Overall, I find that workplace discussion of politics is positively and significantly associated with the probability that labor union members vote Democrat. This appears to occur via a “learning” mechanism, in which greater workplace discussion of politics leads union members to recognize which candidate is more “prolabor.” Overall, these findings help us better understand the consequences of the workplace, political discussion, and the politics of American labor unions.",

Does this translate into persuasiveness of arguments and opinion change? We here test the hypothesis that conservatives can be swayed by binding moral arguments, while everyone is susceptible to individualizing moral arguments. Using a classic experimental design (N = 375) where respondents are given moral arguments for a position in nine moral issues, we find support for this hypothesis. In line with motivational matching, the moral foundation support of respondents predicts the type of arguments to which they are susceptible. Along with previous studies on which type of moral argument supports which moral position in the public debate, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation for public opinion change, and in particular for the observation that moral values are becoming more liberal and progressive across the board. Although people tend to be resistant to belief revision, their opinions on politically polarized issues can change when arguments match their beliefs, reflected in their ideology.",

This article examines how the media coverage of members of parliament (MPs) prompts people to seek more information about MPs—an important element of voters’ political knowledge and democratic accountability. I use all available online content from four major Estonian newspapers during 2015–2023 ( ∼ 140,000 articles) and pre-trained transformer models to classify the sentiment and policy issues of news articles that mention MPs. I match media data with MPs’ Wikipedia pageviews on a daily basis over two legislative terms. First, the results show that media visibility of MPs is associated with more views of their Wikipedia page on the same day. Second, news articles with negative sentiment have a greater impact on information-seeking than those with a positive or neutral tone. Third, the impact of MPs' media appearances on information-seeking is dependent on the policy context as well as party affiliation.

    "abstract": "Data donation, a research approach in which users voluntarily contribute their personal digital data, offers a solution to the limitations of traditional self-reporting and digital trace methods by enabling the collection of comprehensive, ethically sourced usage information across multiple devices and digital interfaces. However, this promising method remains underutilized due to low participation rates. Therefore, this review pursued two integrated aims. First, to synthesize evidence on factors that influence three forms of participation: hypothetical willingness (stated intention in imagined scenarios), actual willingness (consent to donate when asked), and successful completion (following through with the full donation process). Second, to appraise existing workflows, frameworks, and methodological tools and integrate this appraisal with the factor synthesis to derive best practices for improving participation. We synthesized 35 articles, of which 14 examined factors influencing participation and 21 provide methodological guidance. Five key factors were identified: sensitivity of the data, privacy concerns, perceived autonomy and control over the donation process, complexity of the process, and participant characteristics. To overcome barriers related to these factors, we recommend maximizing participant privacy through robust data donation frameworks, enhancing transparency and user-friendliness, empowering participants by increasing autonomy and control over their data, and proactively addressing potential selection biases.",

    "abstract": "Graphical models have become an important method for studying the network structure of multivariate psychological data. Accurate recovery of the underlying network structure is paramount and requires that the models are appropriate for the data at hand. Traditionally, Gaussian graphical models for continuous data and Ising models for binary data have dominated the literature. However, psychological research often relies on ordinal data from Likert scale items, creating a model-data mismatch. This paper examines the effect of dichotomizing ordinal variables on network recovery, as opposed to analyzing the data at its original level of measurement, using a Bayesian analysis of the ordinal Markov random field model. This model is implemented in the R package . Our analysis shows that dichotomization results in a loss of information, which affects the accuracy of network recovery. This is particularly true when considering the interplay between the dichotomization cutoffs used and the distribution of the ordinal categories. In addition, we demonstrate a difference in accuracy when using dichotomized data, depending on whether edges are included or excluded in the true network, which highlights the effectiveness of the ordinal model in recovering conditional independence relationships. These findings underscore the importance of using models that deal directly with ordinal data to ensure more reliable and valid inferred network structures in psychological research.",

However, there is an ongoing debate on how to quantify a unit’s degree of importance or centrality, with previous quantifications using either subjective ratings or computational solutions with limited interpretability. Here we introduce a novel measure, which we term “informativeness”, to assess the significance of a word to the meaning of the sentence in which it appears. Our measure is based on the comparison of vectorial representations of the full sentence with a revised sentence without the target word, resulting in an easily interpretable and objective quantification. We show that our new measure correlates in expected ways with other psycholinguistic variables (e.g., frequency, length, predictability), and, importantly, uniquely predicts eye-movement reading behavior in large-scale datasets of first (L1) and second language (L2) readers (from the Multilingual Eye-tracking Corpus, MECO). We also show that the effects of informativeness generalize to diverse writing systems, and are stronger for poorer than better readers. Together, our work provides new avenues for investigating informativeness effects, towards a deeper understanding of the way it impacts reading behavior.",

    "authors": "Rajen A. Anderson, Daan Scheepers, Benjamin C. Ruisch",
    "abstract": "Slippery slope arguments (SSAs) contend that a small, innocuous change will lead to cascading negative consequences. Although SSAs are common in political discourse, they have received little empirical attention in this context. In 15 studies (including samples from four countries and a study of natural language usage on the social media site Reddit), we examine who may be most prone to slippery slope thinking and why people in general may engage in such thinking. We consider whether individuals of different political ideologies exhibit different degrees of support for SSAs. We test three competing hypotheses that it is (a) political extremists, (b) political liberals, or (c) political conservatives that more strongly endorse SSAs. We consistently find that conservatives endorse SSAs more due to ideological differences in intuitive thinking. We additionally find evidence of these ideological differences in social media behavior, and that slippery slope thinking has consequences for punitive attitudes.",

    "authors": "Federico Germani, Giovanni Spitale",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. Here, we examine inter- and intramodel agreement across four state-of-the-art LLMs tasked with evaluating 4800 narrative statements on 24 different topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of 192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified nationality affects evaluation outcomes. Different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intramodel agreement across topics, but this alignment breaks down when source framing is introduced. Attributing statements to Chinese individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models and, in particular, for DeepSeek Reasoner. Our findings show that LLMs’ own judgment of agreement with narrative statements exhibit systematic bias from framing effects, with substantial implications for the neutrality and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.",
