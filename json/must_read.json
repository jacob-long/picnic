    "abstract": "Purpose Most prior studies have primarily investigated AI adoption, with less attention given to AI assimilation in human resource management (HRM). Additionally, prior studies often lack empirical verification of the extent to which human–AI collaboration might alleviate challenges and promote AI assimilation in the HRM context. Thus, this study aims to explore AI assimilation in recruitment with a balanced view that identifies both enabling and inhibiting factors while examining the role of human–AI collaboration in mitigating the effects of inhibiting factors. Design/methodology/approach We used a mixed-method approach. Using an open-ended survey questionnaire approach and collecting data from 26 HR professionals, we identified five factors, namely, AI competency, recruitment agility, AI opacity, AI empathy and human–AI collaboration, potentially impacting AI assimilation. Thereafter, drawing from the enabler–inhibitor perspective, we theorize that AI competency and recruitment agility are the enablers, whereas AI opacity and AI empathy are the inhibitors of an organization’s efforts to assimilate AI in recruitment practices. We tested our proposed model by collecting data from 309 HR professionals. Findings The findings showed that both enablers, AI competency and recruitment agility, significantly influence AI assimilation; however, both inhibitors, AI opacity and AI empathy, are non-significant for AI assimilation. While looking into the reasons for these non-significant effects, we observed that the interaction term between AI empathy and human–AI-collaboration as well as between AI opacity and human–AI-collaboration both had significant effects on AI assimilation. These interaction effects suggest that human–AI collaboration mitigates the constraining impact of both inhibitors. Originality/value Drawing from the enabler–inhibitor perspective and by empirically testing our proposed model, this paper significantly contributes to the IS literature. Our study not only identifies factors that promote and inhibit AI assimilation in the context of HRM practices but also reveals how human–AI collaboration may mitigate the effects of inhibitors. Our findings suggest that organizations should have a collaborative recruitment environment where AI handles repetitive tasks, and humans focus on roles requiring emotional intelligence. This approach enhances the integration of AI-powered tools, addresses AI assimilation inhibitors and optimizes recruitment effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Purpose Prior papers have not fully examined the relationship between multidimensional (MD) ratings and review helpfulness, which may limit the potential of MD ratings in mitigating information asymmetry. Thus, leveraging signaling theory and cued recall, we analyzed the direct and indirect impacts of MD ratings on review helpfulness and subsequently derived corresponding design guidelines. Design/methodology/approach We adopted a multiple mediation model to examine the direct and indirect effects of MD ratings on review helpfulness. We conducted a series of econometric analyses to ensure the robustness of our conclusions. Additionally, Fisher’s permutation test was adopted to assess the potential heterogeneity in these impacts across various hotel types. Findings Leveraging the review data from TripAdvisor.com, we found that, beyond the positive direct impacts of MD ratings, there are significant indirect impacts positively mediated by review writing effort but negatively mediated by content polarity, accounting for 55% of the total impact. Moreover, we revealed that these impacts exhibit significant heterogeneity across different hotel types, online rank and rating valence. Finally, we incorporated both these identified impacts and their heterogeneity into the design of an MD ratings system, yielding guidelines regarding the quantity and category of dimensional ratings. Originality/value We extended the determinants of review helpfulness to the areas of MD ratings and highlighted the impact of the interaction of review functions on review helpfulness. Besides, we emphasized the importance of the signaling environment and illustrated how the effects of signals were shaped by cognitive processes, i.e. cued recall. Finally, we offered practical design rules regarding the quantity and category of dimensional ratings, aiming to maximize the power of MD ratings."

This model suggests that individuals’ behaviors are influenced by motivational factors, with online disinhibition moderating this process. Design/methodology/approach We observed how individuals expressed their attitudes by clicking “Like” when reading a fictional thread with multiple replies. In Study 1a, participants were shown two types of replies in a thread: inflammatory and normal posts. In Study 1b, we followed up with the participants from Study 1a by asking them how sensational and annoying they perceived each post. In Study 2, we examined whether participants clicked “Like” on a post that contained extreme language. Findings In Study 1a, the influence of online disinhibition on Like-clicking did not significantly differ across post types. In Study 1 b, when participants perceived posts as sensational or annoying, they were more likely to click “Like” if they experienced high levels of online disinhibition. For posts that were neither sensational nor annoying, online disinhibition did not affect the likelihood of clicking “Like.” In Study 2, although online disinhibition was significantly correlated with Like-clicking on the extreme post, this effect was not observed among participants who held a negative attitude toward the extreme post. Originality/value This study rigorously examined the causal relationships among motivational factors, online disinhibition and behaviors, challenging previously overgeneralized explanations of online disinhibition theory regarding online behaviors."

To this end, an online experiment was carried out separately in Korea and the United States, employing a 2 (news type: hard news vs. soft news) × 2 (fact-checker: AI vs. human experts) between-group factorial design. Findings suggest that AI’s fact-checking, with its perceived objectivity and lack of bias, is potentially more effective for straightforward hard news, while human-assisted fact-checking appears to be more suitable for addressing misinformation within soft news, which involves more subjective aspects of information. Additionally, the study proposes that AI’s verification of hard news and human experts’ examination of soft news might trigger divergent indirect mechanisms—systematic processing driven by cognition or heuristic processing influenced by emotion—to counteract misinformation."

This article analyzes the verified disinformation by fact-checkers during the 2024 European Parliament elections. From the lens of fact-checking, as a journalism practice to fight against disinformation, this research explores the European initiative Elections24Check, a collaborative fact-checking project associated with the European Fact-Checking Standards Network. The research aims: on the one hand, to demonstrate the prevalence of debunking over fact-checking; and on the other, to dissect the thematic nature, format, typology, and deceitful technique of the hoaxes verified during the last European elections. Using content analysis, the sample comprised 487 publications verified by 32 different fact-checkers across a total of 28 countries for one month related to the 2024 European elections. The results present implications regarding the collaborative fact-checking project that made a greater effort to verify other contextual disinformation issues rather than checking disinformation directly involved in the elections and EU politics. Also, this case study revealed the shift in the European fact-checking movement with the prevalence of debunking activity over scrutinizing public statements. Finally, the verified disinformation underscored the continued dominance of text as the primary format for spreading false information and the predominance of content decontextualization. The results of this study aim to deepen the understanding of fact-checking in the European media landscape."

    "abstract": "In recent years, reports have pointed at the influence of WhatsApp on a variety of outcomes, ranging from elections to collective violence. While academic research should examine the validity of these claims, obtaining WhatsApp data for research is notably challenging, contrasting with the relative abundance (at least until recently) of data from platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, in which the “information diet” of users has been extensively studied. This lack of data is particularly problematic because WhatsApp may be a powerful vehicle for misinformation and hate speech. To help make research on these questions, and more generally research on WhatsApp possible, this paper introduces Whatsapp Explorer , a tool designed to enable WhatsApp data collection on a large scale. We discuss protocols for data collection, including potential sampling approaches, and explain why our tool (and adjoining protocol) arguably allow researchers to collect WhatsApp data in an ethical and legal manner, at scale. Finally, we provide insights from our pilots in India and Brazil, including details on how much data we were able to collect, sampling challenges, and the path forward."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of smartphones has raised concerns about problematic usage behaviors, including excessive screentime and frequent phone checking, which can disrupt daily functioning. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted nudge-based intervention in reducing smartphone use through subtle changes to smartphone settings. The intervention incorporated adjustments such as disabling face/touch ID, setting longer passwords, switching to grayscale mode, and removing social media apps from the home screen. A randomized within-subject cross-over trial with counterbalancing was conducted over a two-week period using a daily diary approach paired with objective smartphone usage data to track the impact of these interventions on both smartphone screentime and checking behavior. Multilevel modeling on 163 young adults with 1508 observations indicated that the intervention significantly reduced both screentime and checking frequency compared to the control condition. However, participants reported higher levels of stress during the intervention, potentially due to the frustration of partial restrictions without full disengagement from their smartphones. These findings highlight not only the potential of multifaceted nudges to reduce smartphone use but also the importance of carefully selecting and combining strategies to avoid unintended stress. This study provides a practical, cost-free and scalable foundation for refining smartphone interventions, contributing to the growing body of research on nudge-based strategies to promote healthier phone habits."

However, recently, their role in the sphere of political communication has become a new topic of interest. In this article, we focus on how political influencer content is perceived by Finnish social media users and probe the interrelations between these perceptions and political participation. A moderated mediation model was developed and tested using data gathered from Finnish respondents ( n = 680) through an online survey and self-reported measures. The results imply that perceived exposure to political influencer content is associated with latent political participation (i.e., increased attention and awareness), which is further related to manifest political participation (e.g., boycotting and voting). The moderating effects of general political interest and engagement with influencers were also tested, but not found. The findings suggest that influencers’ political content has the potential to spark political participation, as it may ignite awareness towards political topics – possibly even among those who have not previously shown interest in politics. Suchawareness, in turn, may eventually manifest itself as political behaviour, such as voting or boycotting. The results provide an enhanced understanding of the potential impact of new social media arenas on increasing political participation while simultaneously contributing to the studies on political influencers, a research area that is growing in popularity."

It focuses on several standard explanations of anti-science and science-skeptical attitudes—the role of religiosity, the role of education and knowledge, and the role of political interest—and looks at how their importance has varied over time. Similarly, it examines the role of conservative political opinion on attitudes toward science. To do so, it uses a novel data set that includes eight waves of a survey that were fielded over a period of 49 years in France. While people are more educated, have access to more information, and are less religious, the importance of these factors appears to have diminished over time. At the same time, aggregate trends in anti-science and science-skeptical attitudes are not clear-cut. The article shows that anti-science and science-skeptical attitudes have become more difficult to explain over time."

Therefore, understanding the factors that shape bystander intervention is crucial. Despite frequent calls for more research, there is a need for greater understanding of how perceived political and digital media literacy are related to the frequency of various forms of online bystander intervention, such as counter-speech or reporting. Based on a national online survey of German citizens ( N = 2,691), we investigated how perceived political and digital media literacy of individuals with prior experience in addressing online incivilities ( n = 672) relates to (private and public) direct and indirect forms of intervention against online hate speech. The results indicate that a sense of empowerment regarding digital media content particularly increases direct, public interventions, such as uttering counter-speech."

We probe this database using Google’s Vision API and Keras with TensorFlow to test whether foreign influence operations can be identified based on the visual presentation of fake user profiles emphasizing gender, race, camera angle, sensuality, and emotion. Our results show that sensuality is a variable associated with operations that replicate the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency campaign, being particularly prevalent in influence operations that targeted communities in North and South America, but also in Indonesia, Turkey, and Pakistan. Our results also show that the visual identities of fake social media profiles are predictive of influence operations given their reliance on selfies, sensual young women, K-pop aesthetics, or alternatively nationalistic iconography overlaid with text to convey ideological positioning."

This study examines how Black conservative influencers express Black conservative thought within the broader conservative ecosystem, examining their topics of discussion and comparing these narratives to those of other conservatives within these networks. We employ BERTopic modeling to analyze 17,136 transcripts of YouTube videos produced by Black conservative influencers ( N = 70) between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2023, and 158,833 transcripts of videos algorithmically recommended from this content. In addition, we use a pre-trained encoder-only transformer model to estimate the ideology of these influencers compared to those of other conservative actors in their network. We find that Black conservative influencers conveyed a statistically uniform narrative when discussing race and discrimination, a topic that was not only the most prevalent among them but also received the highest engagement, particularly coinciding with the political rise of Donald Trump. In line with traditional Black conservative thought, these influencers incorporated color-blind narratives discounting anti-Black racism. However, reflecting modern shifts in conservativism, Black conservatives also adopted cultural conservatism, particularly discussing the existence of anti-White racism. We discuss our findings in consideration of micro-celebrity practices that present Black conservatives as “authentic” voices on race, and its implications for legitimizing racial animus and White identity politics."

While the emotional reactions among Israeli Arabs suggest an inclination toward integration and distancing from Palestinianization, for Jews, watching the atrocities invoked Holocaust memories alongside emotions of rage and a desire for revenge. The study demonstrates that media events can occur solely on social media, even in fragmented broadcasts. Without official narratives and traditional media, a ritual process of communitas and the experience of witnessing a historical moment can still emerge. The ceremonial mechanisms of media events and the resulting social cohesion may help explain the public legitimacy of large-scale military operations in Gaza."
