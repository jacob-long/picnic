    "abstract": "When assessing media effects, we seldom consider how they change over time. Especially with the prevalence of smartphone use as short-lived, fragmented media use, a systematic approach to temporal dimensions is crucial, particularly to understand mixed effects of smartphone use on situational well-being. We employ a multiverse approach to assess the influence of two central temporal dimensions in intensive longitudinal media effects research: Time frame and time lag. We combine mobile experience sampling (T1 = 2,859, T2 = 7,708) and log data (K1 = 71,807, K2 = 259,004) from N1 = 84 and N2 = 192 participants. Building on theorizing on time in media effects research, we propose four patterns of how short-term effects on situational well-being unfold: they may follow processes of ephemerality (fleeting effects), inertia (delayed onset), reversal (changing directions), or there are no changes over time. We discuss theoretical implications and give recommendations for future studies."

    "abstract": "News aggregators inherently constitute choice architectures in which placement and presentation of news articles in the user interface affect how people perceive and engage with them. Accordingly, deliberate changes of a news aggregators’ choice architecture may nudge engagement. Against this background, our study aims to test the effects of 2 nudges, namely a position and an accessibility nudge, on (a) the selection of, (b) the engagement with, and (c) learning from environmental news articles by means of a 7-day field experiment using a news aggregator app in the United Kingdom. Results suggest that prominent article positioning coupled with visual highlighting significantly increases the selection of environmental news, its reading time and recall of information. In contrast, automated rewriting of environmental articles for lower text complexity had no significant effects. Additional analyses indicate that neither nudge backfired by decreasing user satisfaction, thus suggesting the practical usability of our approach."

Our research advances understanding of how psychological processing influences perceptions and effects of AI-generated messages on message acceptance and credibility. Specifically, the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, anthropomorphism, and solipsistic introjection are employed to examine the effects of the degree of AI involvement in information delivery when seeking clarification on a politicized issue – ranging from none (e.g., news article), to partial (e.g., AI-generated summaries in Google search results), to full reliance on AI (e.g., responses from ChatGPT). Findings from our online experiment with N = 551 US adults indicate that moderate and highly AI-powered sources are deemed more credible than non-AI human-authored sources, however, this effect is weakened by diminished perceptions of anthropomorphizing of AI. Further, solipsistic introjection is negatively related to message acceptance, indicating this intrapsychic processing may decrease the persuasiveness of messages that combat mis/disinformation. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications."

    "abstract": "Abstract: Given the importance of the credibility and effectiveness of health messaging during politicized public health events, this study explores both message source and message recipient factors in predicting perceived credibility and intent to comply with a COVID-19 mitigation message. Born out of disease avoidance, greater individual disgust sensitivity should lead to greater perceived risk and uptake of mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, conservative partisanship in the US has been associated with less perceived risk and behavioral compliance related to COVID-19. However, greater disgust, sensitivity, and political conservatism enjoy a positive relationship. To test this paradox, we explore both partisanship and disgust sensitivity, along with authoritarianism, to see which ultimately better predicts perceived credibility and intent to comply with government-issued COVID-19 guidance. We further explore partisanship by exploring how messages from the same (or different) political party influence message processing and effects. An online experiment with a US-based sample ( N = 424) found no influence of individuals’ political partisanship, but did find small (yet significant) effects such that messages from Democratic governors elicited greater intent to comply than Republican ones. Results about disgust sensitivity were mixed: greater pathogen disgust sensitivity was associated with greater perceived credibility of messages, whereas greater socio-moral disgust sensitivity was associated with greater intent to comply. Implications are discussed."

This research provides a first look at such perceptions across a wide array of legacy and novel fact-check sources available today. An online survey of 993 participants and an experiment involving 1,002 participants were conducted to examine differences in credibility perceptions, usage, and sharing of fact-checks from professional fact-check organizations, mainstream news outlets, social media platforms, automated fact-check services, and crowdsourcing. Results show that legacy sources are considered most credible, fact-check receiver characteristics (political ideology, analytical thinking, and information literacy) influence perceptions of fact-checker credibility, and perceived credibility of fact-checkers is key to fact-check usage. Results also reveal that fact-checker source type and perceived credibility of fact-checkers are essential to fact-check sharing intention. Our findings advance the nascent concept of fact-checker credibility and contribute to theory, specifically the MAIN model and the stage framework model. They also offer novel data about new sources of fact-checking, including how AI and crowdsource-based fact-checkers are perceived by the public."

Using digital trace data, we analyze the news selections of roughly 25,000 SmartNews users over 6 months. We find evidence of trait-level differences in individuals’ negativity biases in news selection and consider the degree to which those trait-level differences in negativity biases are sustained through algorithmically personalized news feeds."

    "abstract": "Political orientation is related to many aspects of our lives. Here, we investigate how political orientation relates to how women from different parts of the world picture their ideal partner. Using data from the Ideal Partner Survey , we analyzed relationships between political orientation and long-term partner preferences in a sample of 13,257 heterosexual, single women from 144 countries. Replicating previous work, political orientation was related to a preference for political similarity, such that women holding more extreme political views showed the strongest preferences for political similarity. In addition, women leaning more to the right side of the political spectrum held higher preferences for ethnic and religious similarity. Partly consistent with the possibility that political orientation relates to women’s attraction towards men conforming to a masculine, male breadwinner stereotype, more right-leaning views were not only linked to preferring a financially secure and successful partner, but also to ascribing more importance to a partner´s height. No or only negligible relationships with political orientation were found for partner´s kindness-supportiveness and level of height. For all other preferences, results were less conclusive. In sum, results indicate that who women want as a romantic partner is partly related to their political orientation."

    "abstract": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have begun to influence almost all aspects of life, including romantic relationships. Despite many companies and other entities now utilizing AI technology to produce products and media that may influence romantic relationship engagement and behavior, few studies to date have attempted to document or describe the ways that individuals engage with multiple AI technologies for romantic or sexual purposes in large national samples. Using a large quota national sample taken from the United States of 2,969 adults, in this exploratory study we sought to examine engagement with AI technologies, specifically the use of image generation of men and women on social media, chat technologies meant to simulate romantic or sexual partners, and AI generated pornography. Results suggested that engagement with AI technologies is relatively high, especially among young adults in their 20’s, suggesting that these emerging technologies represent an element of modern sexual behavior and romantic relationships that warrant further attention. A sizable minority of young adults reported using AI technologies romantically or sexually, including almost one in four young adults engaging with AI chat technologies to replicate romantic interactions. Regression results suggested that various demographic factors predict engagement with AI technologies and that AI technology use was associated with negative individual well-being. These initial descriptive results suggest the need for further research on this emerging behavioral phenomenon as an important component of modern romantic and sexual interactions."

Drawing on a two-year panel survey conducted in Austria (April 2020 to March 2022), we use a mixed Markov chain model to analyze one of the most persistent and widely believed conspiracy narratives—the claim that COVID-19 was a deliberately engineered bioweapon. The results reveal two opposing types of belief trajectories: an upward trajectory of belief stability, reinforcement of accurate beliefs, and correction, driven by perceived health-related threats and exposure to high-quality media, such as public broadcasters and broadsheets; and a downward trajectory marked by heightened belief instability, reinforcement of misperceptions, and an erosion of belief accuracy, associated with perceived economic threats and the use of low-quality media—including tabloids, commercial TV, and social media. Overall, the findings highlight the value of the theoretical frameworks for a more nuanced understanding of belief dynamics in times of crisis and underline the vital role of high-quality media in fostering a well-informed democratic public."

Critical race theory (CRT) is an issue marked by widespread misinformation and controversy, leading to efforts in multiple states to ban CRT. In a three‐wave panel design with a nationally diverse U.S. sample, a correction of misinformation about CRT was tested. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a control condition; (2) a misinformation‐only treatment; or (3) a misinformation plus correction treatment. Those in the misinformation plus correction condition had significantly higher accuracy scores than those in the control and misinformation‐only conditions. Moreover, this increased accuracy in the misinformation with correction condition was stronger among those most predisposed to accept CRT misinformation, that is, participants who scored high on a measure of unawareness of institutional discrimination. In contrast, participants' attitudes toward CRT bans were unaffected by the treatments, suggesting that correction can improve accuracy but does not change related opinions."

Yet, they increasingly use negative rhetoric to attack the opposition rather than forge legislative compromise, contrary to theories of going public. Why? I argue presidents facing congressional obstruction eschew short-term policy persuasion. They speak as negative partisans to mobilize co-partisans and shape the longer-term balance of power in Congress, improving future policy-making prospects. I collect all presidential speeches delivered between 1933 and 2024 and use transformer methods to measure how often, and how negatively, presidents reference the out-party. They do so when the policy-making environment is unfavorable: when majorities are tenuous, government is divided, and as elections approach. I provide additional support with a case study of Democrats’ 2009 filibuster-proof Senate majority. Finally, this rhetoric has behavioral impact: presidential negative partisanship decreases co-partisan approval of the opposition. This research alters our understanding of going public and reinforces the partisan dimension of modern presidential representation."

The Theory of Informative Fictions (TIF) addresses this gap by presenting propositions that predict the conditions under which misinformation is tolerated and promoted. Building on the literature on TIF and deep learning, we uncover how property messages and character messages differ in veracity and explore the relationship between visual misinformation and user engagement. By constructing a short video dataset Tikcron ( N = 42,201) and a multimodal video analysis framework KILL, we classify TikTok videos as misinformation or not, and property messages or character messages. Our results indicate that character messages are more likely to convey misinformation than property messages, and character messages with misinformation are more likely to get tolerated and promoted by social media users than property messages with misinformation. This study extends the current methodological advancement of image-as-data to misinformation videos and proposes a multimodal video analysis framework to develop communication-centered theories. The broader practical implications of this study on the detection, countering, and governance of visual misinformation are also discussed."

    "abstract": "Statistical-mediation analysis is a widely used method in psychological research that helps understand the intermediate variables, known as mediators ( M ), by which an independent variable ( X ) causes an outcome variable ( Y ). A major contribution to statistical-mediation analysis has been the incorporation of causal methods because it allows a clear definition of the causal direct and mediated effects and the specification of the assumptions to interpret such effects as causal. Modern causal approaches to mediation analysis encourage routinely investigating the extent to which unobserved confounders may explain the observed mediated effects. The recommendation acknowledges that even when X represents random assignment, participants are not usually randomly assigned to levels of M ; hence, unobserved confounders may bias the M to Y relation ( b -path). In this article, we describe unobserved pretreatment confounding of the M to Y relation in experimental mediation studies and three sensitivity-analysis methods to assess unmeasured pretreatment confounding of the M to Y relation: the correlated-residuals method, the left-out-variables-error method, and the phantom-variable method. We report the results of a simulation study that compares the routine application of the three sensitivity-analysis methods. Results generally indicate that larger effect sizes of the population b -path are less susceptible to confounding bias for all sensitivity methods. Thus, an initial approach to investigating confounding bias in experimental mediation studies is to assess the effect size of the path relating M to Y , and more details can be obtained by applying one of the three sensitivity-analysis methods."

One widely recognized challenge is bridging the gap between the nonrepresentative study samples commonly used to evaluate interventions and the broader populations that policymakers aim to serve. To address this challenge, we introduce causal effect generalizability, an approach from causal inference and epidemiology, in the form of an accessible, nontechnical tutorial for psychological and behavioral scientists. We use publicly available data from a real-world psychology intervention study to illustrate why causal effects in a nonrepresentative study sample may systematically differ from those in a broader population. We provide a step-by-step guide with user-friendly R functions, enabling researchers to generalize causal effects from a study sample back to the full target population. This approach allows researchers to assess intervention effects in broader populations, offering valuable insights to guide evidence-based policy development. We hope this nontechnical introductory material will assist scholars in enhancing the policy relevance and real-world impact of psychological science."

An online experiment ( N = 574), conducted in the US, manipulated the number of congruent/incongruent comments and emojis on social media posts discussing abortion (i.e., pro-choice versus pro-life Facebook posts) to create three distinct opinion contexts (i.e., congruent, balanced, and incongruent). The results indicate that perceived bias gaps between pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal posts were reduced in the condition of incongruent context. Furthermore, the study found that the incongruent context mitigates discomfort toward out-party supporters and political participation intention through reducing the perceived bias, whereas the congruent context intensifies them. Implications for media bias perceptions and political polarization are discussed in terms of intergroup relations."

    "abstract": "Engagement with political news is vital for promoting civic participation and political knowledge but can negatively affect individuals’ mental health, including provoking anxiety. We examine how exposure to racial discrimination in news coverage (i.e., vicarious discrimination) may contribute to these negative effects among Latinos during the 2020 U.S. election. One hundred and eight Latinos completed daily measurements of political news engagement, vicarious discrimination, and anxiety-related symptoms for 14 days surrounding the election. Using disaggregated multilevel mediation models, we found that, on days when people engaged more with political news, they reported higher anxiety-related symptoms than on days when they engaged less (within-person relationship), but people who engaged more with political news on average did not report higher anxiety-related symptoms relative to those who engaged less with political news on average (between-person relationship). Additionally, the within-person relationship was mediated by experiences of vicarious discrimination, suggesting engaging with political news serves as an important source of exposure to racial discrimination experienced by others."
