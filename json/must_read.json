    "authors": "Zhaohua Deng, Yuyao Tang, Manli Wu, Richard Evans",
    "abstract": "Purpose Anthropomorphism presents a promising strategy for improving information presentation in online health communication. Although showing significant potential, its underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions remain underexplored and warrant further research. This study, therefore, aims to investigate how anthropomorphic cues in online health risk information influence information persuasiveness, specifically examining the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments (Experiment 1: N = 198; Experiment 2: N = 118; Experiment 3: N = 146) were conducted to examine the impact of anthropomorphism on information persuasiveness, explore pertinent psychological mechanisms and investigate the moderating role of narrative perspective. Findings Anthropomorphic cues were found to enhance the persuasiveness of online health risk information by increasing perceived severity and vulnerability, and by reducing psychological reactance. Furthermore, narrative perspective was shown to moderate the relationships between anthropomorphic cues and both perceived severity and vulnerability. Practical implications Guidance is provided to health information providers on the effective application of anthropomorphic strategies in disseminating online health risk information. In addition, the study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate narrative perspectives that align with the specific characteristics of different diseases in health persuasion. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of anthropomorphic health risk information in online settings by demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating psychological reactance. The findings show that narrative perspectives of injurants versus victims moderate the influence of anthropomorphic health risk information on individuals’ perceived severity and vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been used to aid in deception detection and to simulate human data in social scientific research. Thus, it is important to consider how well these tools can inform both enterprises. We report 12 studies, accessed through the Viewpoints.ai research platform, where AI (gemini-1.5-flash) made veracity judgments of humans. We systematically varied the nature and duration of the communication, modality, truth-lie base rate, and AI persona. AI performed best (57.7%) when detecting truths and lies involving feelings about friends, although it was notably truth-biased (71.7%). However, in assessing cheating interrogations, AI was lie-biased by judging more than three-quarters of interviewees as cheating liars. In assessing interviews where humans perform at rates over 70%, accuracy plummeted to 15.9% with an ecological base-rate. AI yielded results different from prior human studies and therefore, we caution using certain large language models for lie detection.",

Results of a pre-registered two-wave online experiment ( N 1 = 1,785, N 2 = 1,568) suggest that debunking consistently reduces misperceptions and behavioral intentions for at least 1 week, while prebunking was less effective. Expert corrections only outperform non-expert corrections in reducing misperceptions in wave 1. In general, AI cues do not significantly influence the effectiveness of a correction, offering both opportunities and challenges for organizations hoping to automate corrections.",

    "authors": "Bogdan Oprea, Paula Pașnicu, Alexandru-Ninel Niculae, Constantin-Cozmin Bonciu, Dragoș Tudorașcu-Dobre",
    "abstract": "Technology has reshaped political communication, allowing fake engagement to drive real influence in the democratic process. Hyperactive social media users, who are over-proportionally active in relation to the mean, are the new political activists, spreading partisan content at scale on social media platforms. Using The Authenticity Matrix tool, this study revealed Facebook accounts of hyperactive users exhibiting inauthentic behaviour that were used during the electoral campaign (May 10, 2024, to June 8, 2024) for the 2024 election of Romanian members of the European Parliament. The results indicate that, for some posts, up to 45% of shares were made by hyperactive users (four or more shares per post by the same account) and 33.9% by super-active users (10 or more times). This type of online behavior is considered by Meta as manipulation of “public opinion,” “political discussion,” and “public debate,” and Meta’s Community Standards is committed to preventing such behavior in the context of elections. Another key contribution of this research is the identification of dominant characteristics of hyperactive user accounts, using information publicly available on their social media profile, which provides insights into their specific features and helps users better identify them on social media. The article highlights that online social network platforms condemn these manipulative practices in theory, but they don’t take sufficient measures to effectively reduce them in order to limit their impact on our societies.",

    "abstract": "Far from being a concern of the past, media ownership concentration is a feature of hybrid media systems. This raises the issue of how to measure the concentration and allow for informed decisions to be made, especially for policymaking. Some of the most popular metrics are the concentration ratio (CR&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). However, the new hybrid context increasingly renders the usual economic concentration metrics obsolete to understand the power of communication players. This article provides a theoretical overview and methodological considerations on ways to interrogate ownership relations, advancing network analysis and visualization as useful tools to better grasp power relations alongside traditional economic metrics. We illustrate our proposal with an analysis of media ownership data from Denmark and Greece, as provided by the Euromedia Ownership Monitor in 2022. Our article goes beyond the approach of the monitor, as we incorporate additional components, such as the power of beneficial owners over the audience. This approach provides a broader analysis of media ownership concentration and can inspire scholarly work to explore more aspects of this topic.",

    "authors": "Sarah Lutz, Frank M. Schneider, Annabell Halfmann, Anna Freytag, Dorothée Hefner",
    "abstract": "In a digitally connected world, the perceived expectation to always stay available via mobile messenger services places unique demands on users. This paper addresses the question of how and when so-called availability pressure leads to variations in messenger users’ well-/ill-being. Drawing on the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences, it conceptualizes the satisfaction versus frustration of fundamental needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) as mediators and the health-promoting personality trait mindfulness as a moderator. This model was tested across a 7-day-long diary study ( N = 229) and a 2-factorial online experiment ( N = 166). Both pre-registered studies are in line with the model's assumption that availability pressure can lead to specific need experiences, which in turn predict different facets of well-/ill-being. Although we identified limited moderating effects, being mindful (Study 1) and cultivating mindfulness (Study 2) were positively related to need satisfaction and well-being and negatively related to need frustration and ill-being. This highlights the complex consequences of availability pressure and the importance of individual coping mechanisms. Future research should refine theoretical models like the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences and explore additional health-promoting personality traits to better understand digital well-being in the era of mobile connectivity.",

The way in which media coverage (re)produces genders may affect individual and collective thinking and the perceptions of women in society. We analyse the representation of female scientists in German news media coverage of eight science-related risk issues and compare male and female experts regarding their relative scientific reputation, the number of references and the content of their statements. Our findings show that female scientific experts are less visible in German media coverage than their male colleagues and that they are underrepresented compared to the respective proportions in the relevant research areas. At the same time, our data relativize the extent of the gender visibility gap – after controlling for hierarchical position and scientific reputation, the differences become rather small. We find no evidence of discrimination against female scientific experts through journalistic selection routines.",

For those who noticed the disclosure, both brief and fuller depictions of a study’s preprint status enhanced the credibility of the reporting and the scientists behind the research. However, perceiving the science to be uncertain negatively mediated the effects of preprint disclosure on credibility appraisals among Republicans.",

Empirically, we show that recent research, focused primarily on Americans but with some analogues in other regions, significantly undercuts common worries about citizen competence.

We show that the more senior the opposition members are, the more negative their sentiment. Additionally, we show that opposition members become more negative as the next election approaches.

Using a nationally representative panel survey from China, we find a robust negative association between depressive symptoms and political trust. This effect is amplified by perceptions of inequality, as individuals who see society as unfair are more likely to blame the government for their hardship. The effect is pronounced among potentially volatile groups like unemployed young males, whose tendency to externalize stress can translate distrust into social unrest. Crucially, the effect is also significant among groups traditionally considered better off such as public sector employees, who face intense pressures of ideological conformity in the workplace. This widespread “silent suffering” highlights a critical psychological pathway through which poor mental health, an increasingly pressing issue, can intensify social discontent and weaken regime stability.",

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on non-probability samples, including administrative data, big data, and surveys with selective non-response, has brought the issue of selection bias to the forefront of applied research and official statistics production. This study investigates selection bias in the context of flash estimates, focusing on their application in short-term economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product and the Consumer Price Index. Leveraging prominent theoretical frameworks for modeling selection bias, we develop and evaluate a series of estimators that incorporate information from a fully-observed lagged target variable, current auxiliary variables, or combined data sources. Through simulations and a case study using turnover (i.e., revenue) data from Statistics Netherlands, we assess these estimators across diverse scenarios, including variations in variable distribution, selectivity levels, and correlations between auxiliary and target variables. Results indicate that estimators combining lagged and current auxiliary information provide more consistent results than those relying on a single data source. Additionally, estimators based on combined data sources perform relatively well under high selectivity and non-normal target distributions. These findings provide practical and easily implementable tools to address selection bias in non-probability samples, enhancing the reliability and timeliness of official statistics.",

    "abstract": "The study of time-dependent within-person dynamics has gained popularity in recent years through the use of multilevel (latent) time-series models. However, due to the complexity of the models, model applications are usually limited with respect to the inclusion of time-varying moderating factors on the longitudinal within-person relations between variables. That is, in common applications of multilevel time-series models, the within-person dynamics of constructs over time are regarded as being insensitive to changes in other time-varying factors or changes in contexts. We illustrate an extension of multilevel latent time-series models that incorporate latent interaction effects at the dynamic within-person level. We build on previous work that incorporated time-varying observed or latent moderator variables for the dynamic parameters in vector autoregressive models and provide a tutorial for the application of the models, implemented and estimated using Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The models are illustrated by two empirical applications that investigate the temporal dynamics of negative affect, rumination, and mindful attention. The performance of different models with varying complexity is investigated via several simulation studies to provide recommendations regarding the models’ applicability for applied researchers. Required sample sizes range between at least 25 time points for around 50 persons in the simplest fixed-effects models and at least 100 time points for at least 100 persons in random-effects factor models, depending on the expected effect sizes of the dynamic parameters.",

One possibility is that the results indicate a “fleeing” behavior whereby respondents try to avoid association with DV.

Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted creators to matched nonadopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, a concentrated subset of AI-assisted creators contributes more novel artifacts in absolute terms through increased output—the productivity effect—although the average rate of contributing novel artifacts decreases because of a dilution effect. This reflects a shift toward high-volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI-assisted creators. We observe no evidence of a human-AI effect above and beyond the productivity effect. The release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a more diverse group, suggesting that text-to-image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by select “masterminds,” driven by increased volume, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from a “hive mind.”",
