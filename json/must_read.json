    "authors": "David Coppini",
    "abstract": "Mass media are often portrayed by populist politicians as biased, elitist, and antagonist of the people. This study uses a social identity theory framework to examine the relationship between four dimensions of populist attitudes and attitudes towards mass media. Findings from a two-wave panel survey of the Italian adult population (W1 = 1,107, W2 = 832) confirm that anti-elite attitudes have negative effects on media evaluations and media trust. Anti out-group attitudes have detrimental effects for evaluations of media quality, while they enhance trust in commercial news and trust in right-wing tabloids. People with strong attitudes related to homogeneity of the people evaluate the quality of news reporting positively and they tend to trust right-wing tabloids.",

    "authors": "Chris Skurka, Zicheng Cheng, Manuel Goyanes, Homero Gil de Zúñiga",
    "abstract": "Empirical research connects the News Finds Me perception (NFM) with undesirable democratic outcomes. Consequently, high-NFM individuals may be more vulnerable to political misinformation than low-NFM individuals. In this two-wave, preregistered news judgment study (N = 867 US adults), we explore the possibility that high-NFM individuals overestimate their ability to detect misinformation—a phenomenon grounded in the Dunning–Kruger effect, whereby individuals with limited competence fail to recognize their shortcomings. As hypothesized, high-NFM (vs. low-NFM) participants reported greater overconfidence in their false news discernment ability—an effect driven by their objectively lower discernment ability. We also find that the more overconfident high-NFM people were, the greater their intentions to engage with false and true news, although their overconfidence was especially likely to predict intentions to engage with false news. These findings suggest the NFM plays a dually negative role in promoting susceptibility to misinformation, highlighting the need for targeted intervention efforts.",

    "abstract": "Identity construction is a continuous process that permeates all social life. Drawing from intercultural communication scholarship and the Bakhtinian perspective on the construction of the self, we suggest that identity is constructed in talk through the interplay of socially constructed, ideologically imbued similarities and differences and propose the blocking and threading analysis (BTA) method to study this process. Blocking refers to constructing differences and social boundaries, whereas threading creates similarities, unity, and commonality. These practices are intertwined, and we argue that identity emerges from the constant shifts between the two. The four-step analytical process entails identifying positioning, recognizing connected utterances, interpreting blocking and threading, and examining their shifts. We illustrate the analytical force of BTA by an analysis of an extract from a focus group discussion among an interprofessional healthcare team. The method requires further application to different datasets, but it shows promise in terms of bringing new insights into research on identity construction.",

    "abstract": "Given that communicative phenomena are inherently processual, the scarcity of a longitudinal narrative perspective is an evident lacuna in communication research. This article argues that to explore communicative processes as a longitudinal experience, shaped by the constant tension between structure and agency, researchers can elicit and analyze stories that information producers and consumers construct in their own words across time. Consequently, the article explores the implementation of Longitudinal Qualitative Interviewing (LQI), the repeated interviewing of the same individuals at two (or more) time points, in the study of media. It considers the methodological and conceptual insights that could be drawn from such an application, and the ways in which the unique affordances of LQI enhance the validity of qualitative communication research. Our discussion of the implementation of LQI is anchored in an exploration of occupational life histories of 39 Israeli journalists over the span of a decade.",

Multilevel regression models indicated that accuracy nudges and veracity labels had no direct effects on the perceived accuracy of posts or willingness to share them, though the interaction of the “False” label and accuracy nudge significantly reduced the perceived accuracy of and intention to share false news across the samples. Post hoc analyses further uncovered contingent effects based on individual differences, including partisan identity in the United States and conspiratorial thinking in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.

    "abstract": "Search engines are both frequently used and widely trusted sources of current political information. While research has examined the different stages of information seeking via search, the question of how political preferences and sociodemographic factors impact political online search has received less attention. In particular, the way in which attitudinal factors, such as sentiment toward a politician or interest in their personal life motivate information seeking have not been widely studied. We present findings from a panel study that combines browser tracking data with survey results for 1863 German participants. Our results suggest that both sympathy and antipathy toward a selection of popular politicians is predictive of searching for them. Queries also vary in their composition, with searches for female politicians highlighting their personal lives and physical attributes somewhat more often than for males. We conclude that the role of “soft” factors in motivating information seeking on political actors remains underexplored.",

By considering modified sentences as carriers of collective knowledge and spaces in which epistemic power is negotiated, it reconstructs their revision sequences and examines how editorial, contextual, content, and temporal factors shape Wikipedia’s revision dynamics. A total of 140,593 revisions (by 48,643 editors) of 76,525 sentences in 537 Wikipedia articles related to climate change were analyzed using text mining, natural language processing, survival analysis, and meta-analysis. The findings expand our understanding of how epistemic power is negotiated through collective endeavors underlying bureaucratic rules and community moderation in Wikipedia.",

This study, conducted online with 470 US participants, investigated whether exposure to art attributed to AI may influence aesthetic appreciation, perceptions of AI mind, and evaluations of AI (acceptance of AI as an artist, evaluation of AI as an identity and realistic threat) and of art careers. Exposure to art introduced as generated by AI (vs a human artist) reduced appreciation. No significant impact was observed on the other dependent variables. For ostensibly AI-generated art, higher appreciation was associated with more acceptance toward AI as an artist and lower levels of AI realistic threat. This suggests that mere exposure to art attributed to AI may not be sufficient to induce a change in perceptions of AI mind, evaluations of AI and of art careers, but these effects might occur if AI-attributed art is appreciated aesthetically.",

Trust cues refer to dimensions of trust in science such as expertise, integrity, benevolence, transparency, and dialogue. Because digital media environments are expected to be heterogeneous in content, the sources of trust cues, characteristics of objects of trust in science (e.g. the gender of scientists), and their impact on public trust in science may vary. In our quantitative content analysis, we identified trust cues across several sources of scientific information ( n = 906) and examined their heterogeneity in digital media environments. Our results reveal journalism as the most important source for trust cues and that scientists are the most prevalent object of trust—with female scientists being underrepresented. Differences across (digital) media imply varying impacts on public trust in science.",

While in‐group bias is known to influence public responses to government abuses, the relative impact of different identity characteristics has not been directly tested. Building on social identity theory and moral typecasting theory, I use a conjoint survey experiment in the United States of 3,200 respondents to examine the causal effects of in‐group bias across multiple actor identities (perpetrator, target, and elite cue giver) and social and political divides (partisanship, race, religion, and citizenship). Party loyalty to the perpetrator dominates other group identities; simply changing the perpetrator's political identity can be an important determinant for whether respondents oppose violations. Surprisingly, the target's race, religion, and citizenship has mixed impact, and partisan cues have little effect. These findings highlight when group loyalty outweighs human rights concerns and where public demand for government accountability may be reduced.",

In many experimental or quasi-experimental studies, outcomes of interest are only observed for subjects who select (or are selected) to engage in the activity generating the outcome. Outcome data are thus endogenously missing for units who do not engage, and random or conditionally random treatment assignment before such choices is insufficient to identify treatment effects. Nonparametric partial identification bounds address endogenous missingness without having to make disputable parametric assumptions. Basic bounding approaches often yield bounds that are wide and minimally informative. Our approach can tighten such bounds while permitting agnosticism about the data-generating process and honest inference. A simulation study and replication exercise demonstrate the benefits.",

    "abstract": "Throughout his presidency, Trump employed exclusionary rhetoric and implemented policies that targeted Latinxs. Based on prior research on the political effects of co-ethnic group-based attacks, many expected Latinxs to close ranks and mobilize against Trump in 2020. Yet a larger percentage of Latinx voters supported Trump in 2020 than in 2016. Drawing on a representative survey of Latinxs, we examine the characteristics of the Latinx electorate that predicted support for Trump in 2020. Additionally, using a survey experiment fielded before the 2020 election, we find that neither Trump’s exclusionary rhetoric nor his COVID-19 policies harming Latinx communities caused Latinx Trump supporters to defect. Instead, only those already predisposed to support Democrats, but ambivalent about Biden, were moved to punish Trump when informed of his COVID-19 policies negatively affecting their co-ethnics. Our results suggest that the relationship between co-ethnic group-based attacks and Latinx political behavior may be weakening over time.",

This is especially evident in work on Christian nationalism where researchers often make the claim that worship attendance promotes more pro-social or liberal outcomes, while Christian nationalism promotes more conservative and less pro-social outcomes. We demonstrate that this finding—and others like it—represents a new version of an old problem: a particular structure of relationships between variables that can induce sign switches based on suppression effects (Lenz and Sahn in Political Analysis 29(3):356–369, 2021). While we do not encourage skipping controls, some commonly reported results warrant caution. Researchers should generally avoid unconditional claims about attendance encouraging liberalism. We point a way forward that prioritizes theories of religious communication and encourages the careful examination of relationships via interactions.",

Using the digital advertising platform on Facebook, we randomly assign ads to over 90,000 adult American users to estimate the effects of dignity appeals on their likelihood of engaging with content concerning people facing homelessness or incarceration. Consistent with preregistered hypotheses and specifications, we find that adding dignity appeals increases the likelihood of positive reactions to such ads, but only when the vulnerable are considered less “blameworthy” for their situation.",

Our findings contribute to the literature on mis/-disinformation by showcasing how LLMs can substantially lower the costs of detection even when the labeling requires complex, context-specific knowledge about a given case.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding literature in American foreign policy holds that the American public’s support for war significantly depends on the number of U.S. casualties in the conflict (their number, rate, trend, proximity, etc.). While a pandemic is clearly not a war, many observers and political leaders have characterized the U.S. public policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic using the metaphor of wartime. This raises the question of whether such characterizations are more than mere metaphor. Has the American public’s response to pandemic-related casualties—cases and deaths—followed similar patterns to those found in the literature on public opinion and war? In this study, we assess the public’s responsiveness to COVID-19 casualties at different stages in the pandemic. Utilizing two large, 50-state surveys conducted during the two largest COVID surges, in winter 2021 and winter 2022, we test several hypotheses from the public opinion and war literature, including that proximity—spatial and temporal—influences public responses and that the public becomes desensitized to casualties over time. We find that in many respects, the public’s response to the pandemic does indeed mirror the patterns found with respect to public opinion and war.",

Our article documents the important trade-offs that the content of an advertisement creates regarding cost and sample composition. We find that incentive-based advertisements can produce samples much closer to national population benchmarks; however, this also depends on the type of incentive. Thematic advertisements, which mention the political content of a survey, consistently return the cheapest samples, yet certain groups are overrepresented in these samples. Incentive-based advertisements also produce a generally higher response quality. We conclude our article by providing practical advice on which kind of advertisement to use, discussing the generalizability of our findings to other countries, and listing the main limitations of our study.",

Repetition significantly increased both statement truth and source credibility. Experiment 2 ( N = 65) tested if the increase in source credibility generalizes to new contexts. After rating the truth of repeated and unrepeated statements paired with different sources, participants judged novel statements from the same sources, showing increased credibility for sources previously associated with repeated statements. Experiment 3 ( N = 180) did not replicate the effect without initial truth ratings. However, Experiment 4 ( N = 435) resolved this inconsistency, showing a repetition-induced source credibility effect, regardless of participants’ task during source–statement pairings. We discuss the implications of these findings for illusory truth literature and persuasion and communication management.",

We point to another major use case: the extraction of structured information from unstructured text. Information Extraction (IE) is an established branch of Natural Language Processing, but leveraging the affordances of this paradigm has thus far required familiarity with specialized models. GenAI changes this by allowing researchers to define their own IE tasks and execute them via targeted prompts. This article explores the potential of open-source large language models for IE by extracting and encoding biographical information (e.g., age, occupation, origin) from a corpus of newspaper obituaries. As we proceed, we discuss how sociologists can develop and evaluate prompt architectures for such tasks, turning codebooks into “promptbooks.” We also evaluate models of different sizes and prompting techniques. Our analysis showcases the potential of GenAI as a flexible and accessible tool for IE while also underscoring risks like non-random error patterns that can bias downstream analyses.",

    "abstract": "Many worry that news on social media leaves people uninformed or even misinformed. Here we conducted a preregistered two-wave online field experiment in France and Germany ( N = 3,395) to estimate the effect of following the news on Instagram and WhatsApp. Participants were asked to follow two accounts for 2 weeks and activate the notifications. In the treatment condition, the accounts were those of news organizations, while in the control condition they covered cooking, cinema or art. The treatment enhanced current affairs knowledge, participants’ ability to discern true from false news stories and awareness of true news stories, as well as trust in the news. The treatment had no significant effects on feelings of being informed, political efficacy, affective polarization and interest in news or politics. These results suggest that, while some forms of social media use are harmful, others are beneficial and can be leveraged to foster a well-informed society.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization. These results suggest that efforts to bolster institutional trust should pay special attention to criticisms featuring integrity-based trust-undermining narratives.",
