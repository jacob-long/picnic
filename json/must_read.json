    "abstract": "This article examines how participatory publics persist in depopulated rural areas during periods of low visibility and mobilization. Drawing on pragmatism and mediatization theory, we analyse communicative figurations in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) using survey data ( N = 529) and develop a Participatory Public Connection Index. Regression models reveal that public connection is driven more by communicative and territorial factors – such as local radio use, civic motivations and municipality size – than by sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that local media help sustain symbolic bonds and latent publics, contributing to democratic engagement and territorial cohesion despite the absence of visible collective action. We conceptualize latency as the communicative and symbolic potential through which publics persist beyond visible mobilization; operationally, the Participatory Public Connection Index captures this latent connection sustained by everyday local media practices."

Design/methodology/approach By comparing salient explanations and norm-based explanations across different age groups, we analyzed how these explanatory strategies reduce learning costs and enhance cognitive trust in the algorithm. Findings The study finds that both salient and norm-based explanations can reduce learning costs and enhance users’ cognitive trust in algorithms; however, norm-based explanations are particularly effective for younger users. Additionally, the study finds no significant interaction between the two types of explanations. Importantly, effective explanations can enhance both cognitive trust in the algorithm and affective trust in the government. Originality/value This research suggests that “nudges” in explanations can enhance citizens’ trust in algorithmic public services, which is significant for increasing acceptance of these algorithms."

Yet, little is known about how firms should optimally allocate responsibilities between human staff and GAI across distinct response tasks, nor how such allocations shape consumer perceptions and downstream behavioral intentions. This study investigates how customers evaluate MRs produced by different agents including humans, GAI and multiple forms of human and GAI collaboration across specific response tasks. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a randomized online experiment. Main effects were examined using ANOVA with data from 879 participants, and the underlying mechanisms were further analyzed using the PROCESS macro with a parallel mediation model. Findings Our findings show that to improve customer satisfaction and increase booking intentions, negative reviews are most effectively addressed through an augmented human approach in which GAI creates an initial draft and experienced professional staff refine it. In contrast, positive reviews are best handled solely by experienced professional staff. Originality/value This study advances knowledge on how to combine GAI with human efforts in service operations, identifies key psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of different collaboration modes on consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions and offers actionable guidance for service operations managers. The results suggest that GAI should be deployed strategically to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence."

Drawing on dual-system theory, which posits that reflexive and reflective systems are pivotal in shaping user decisions and behaviors, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of the drivers of hedonic technology addiction. We conceptualize impulsive urge as the reflexive system and self-regulation as the reflective system, aiming to uncover the mediating roles of these two distinct systems in linking cognitive absorption to hedonic technology addiction. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal survey involving 410 online gamers was conducted, with data collected at two time points separated by a 6-week interval. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the proposed research model. Findings The results indicate that cognitive absorption elicits responses from both reflexive and reflective systems. Specifically, cognitive absorption enhances the reflexive system via impulsive urge, while inhibiting the reflective system through impaired self-regulation. The joint full mediation of impulsive urge and self-regulation in the relationship between cognitive absorption and hedonic technology addiction has been proved. Our results shed lights on the underlying reflexive and reflective systems by which cognitive absorption affects hedonic technology addiction. Originality/value This study leverages dual-system theory to elucidate the mediating mechanisms through which cognitive absorption influences hedonic technology addiction. By demonstrating how cognitive absorption triggers addictive behaviors through heightened impulsive urges and impaired self-regulation, this study advances the literature on hedonic technology addiction and offers actionable strategies for intervention.

Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence."

Yet, little is known about how it fluctuates over time or across different relationships. This longitudinal study examined 891 young, unmarried adults in romantic relationships over 5 years (11 assessment points), capturing 1507 total relationships. About 42% of participants reported being in more than one relationship during the study period. The study examined how cognitive jealousy varies within individuals, across different relationships, in relation to individual traits such as neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and gender, and in relation to experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (either self‐ or partner‐reported). Results showed that while 28.2% of the variance in cognitive jealousy was due to differences between individuals, the largest proportion (39.8%) was due to differences between relationships. Within a particular relationship, initial levels of cognitive jealousy remained relatively stable over time. Higher levels of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, and experiences of extradyadic sexual involvement (both self‐ and partner‐reported) were associated with greater cognitive jealousy. Men reported higher initial levels of cognitive jealousy than women. These findings suggest that relationship‐specific dynamics as well as individual differences play a crucial role in the experience of cognitive jealousy."

    "abstract": "It is often suggested that one way to reduce affective polarization is to remind citizens of a common in-group identity – such as the national one – to bridge partisan divides. Yet, to our knowledge, such a causal link has only been found in the United States, and even there, it has not been tested by exposure to the most common national symbol: the flag. Thus, we still do not know if such implicit yet ubiquitous reminders of national identity, rather than those that explicitly invoke national pride, are able to reduce affective polarization. In order to fill this research gap, we conducted a survey experiment in Sweden and Denmark in 2023/2024, two countries where national flags are omnipresent yet often ‘unwaved’. Using two versions of subtle flag treatments, our results show that in Sweden, subjects who were primed with a picture of the national flag showed lower levels of affective polarization measured as social distancing, but not in terms of trait stereotyping or party dislike. This effect was not mediated, however, by the strengthening of explicit national identity attitudes, such as national pride. These results suggest that flags need indeed not be explicitly waved in order to work their unifying magic."

Building on the updated PolDem dataset, which tracks media coverage of national election campaigns across fifteen European countries from 1972 to 2023, the symposium investigates how issue salience, party positioning, and voter behaviour interact under turbulent conditions. The introduction situates the contributions around three core themes: (1) measuring and comparing party communication across media and manifestos; (2) mapping cross-national and longitudinal variation in political conflict lines; and (3) identifying the drivers of politicization across economic, cultural, and political dimensions. Together, the articles offer an integrated, content-based perspective on campaign dynamics that links short-term issue emphasis to long-term party-system structuration. The collection advances our understanding of how crises reshape electoral competition and democratic representation in Europe."

This paper examines the extent and evolution of programmatic differentiation across four CEE countries, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Romania, between the 1990s and 2023. Relying on quantitative content analysis of newspaper coverage during parliamentary election campaigns, it investigates system-level trends in programmatic competition, issue salience, and politicization, as well as party-level patterns of issue salience and entrepreneurship. The results show that programmatic competition is substantial and relatively stable over time, but varies across countries depending on historical legacies and regime trajectories. Cultural conflicts have gained importance, particularly under democratic backsliding. While established parties exhibit routinized and distinct programmatic profiles, new parties expand the issue agenda by politicizing less emphasized conflicts. The findings underscore the continued relevance of cleavage theory for understanding party competition in post-communist Europe."

    "abstract": "In this note, we offer a cautionary tale on the dangers of drawing inferences from low-quality online survey datasets. We reanalyze and replicate a survey experiment studying the effect of acquiescence bias on estimates of conspiratorial beliefs and political misinformation. Correcting a minor data coding error yields a puzzling result: respondents with a postgraduate education appear to be the most prone to acquiescence bias. We conduct two preregistered replication studies to better understand this finding. In our first replication, conducted using the same survey platform as the original study, we find a nearly identical set of results. But in our second replication, conducted with a larger and higher-quality survey panel, this apparent effect disappears. We conclude that the observed relationship was an artifact of inattentive and fraudulent responses in the original survey panel, and that attention checks alone do not fully resolve the problem. This demonstrates how “survey trolls” and inattentive respondents on low-quality survey platforms can generate spurious and theoretically confusing results."

Paradoxically, others argue that members of the public lack meaningful policy preferences and exhibit low constraint across issues. These conclusions are typically drawn from binary policy questions or scales with ambiguous values, both of which are ill-suited for measuring extremism, polarization, or constraint. In this paper, I reassess these claims by analyzing policy questions that allow respondents to express their preferences on a well-defined continuum. Across a wide range of issues, most Americans appear to have moderate preferences over policy. As expected, Democrats tend to be more liberal than Republicans, but there is significant overlap on every issue, and the average extent of disagreement is modest. Lastly, positions across issues appear more constrained than standard tests suggest."

We address this well-known inefficiency problem by presenting an informative Bayesian approach that combines indirect measures with prior information. Specifying informed priors amounts to a principled combination of information that increases the efficiency of model estimates. This framework generalizes a range of different modeling approaches for list experiments, such as the inclusion of direct items, auxiliary information, the double list experiment, and the combination of list experiments with other indirect questioning techniques. As we demonstrate in real-world examples from political science, the informative Bayesian approach not only improves the utility but also changes the substantive implications drawn from list experiments."

Employing various panel data estimators, including difference-in-differences, we evaluate how partisan gaps evolve across changes to the political and health contexts, including the national vaccine rollout, individual vaccination status, and within-state policy variation. We find partisan divides are substantial even in (ostensibly) apolitical domains, although they are tempered by higher net personal costs to actions, lower public symbolism, and elite policy choices that counter national party cues."

Moving beyond pairwise frame comparisons, we adopt a policy learning approach that identifies the most effective frame using cross-validated sample splitting, thereby avoiding selective inference. We find that the economic efficiency frame consistently yields the largest gains in policy support, outperforming both the control condition and all alternative frames, on average. While the effects of covariate conditional frame assignment were modest and not significantly different from assigning the best overall frame, we find consistent positive effects of the efficiency frame across partisan subgroups. Our findings offer methodological and substantive contributions: we highlight how policy-learning methods can be applied in experimental framing studies, and we offer specific evidence on the relative efficacy of alternative framing messages on support for several climate policies."

This study examines how generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shapes political participation by focusing on Kenyan Gen Z activists who used ChatGPT to create custom models: Finance_Bill_GPT, Corrupt_Politicians_GPT, and MPs_Contribution_GPT (collectively called Protest_GPT_KE). These tools simplified complex laws, exposed corruption, and mobilized young people online, allowing them to bypass traditional sources such as media and elites. However, using GAI for activism raises ethical and political concerns, including surveillance, data rights, and state repression. The study surveyed 374 Kenyan Gen Z participants, primarily in Nairobi, and used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the connections among AI use, tool appropriation, and political participation. Results show that ChatGPT use alone did not directly increase offline activism; its effect appeared when combined with Protest_GPT_KE and online participation. This study is one of the first to document how youth in the Global South are creatively using GAI for grassroots mobilization, demonstrating that GAI’s political influence depends on user innovation and context."

Such online surveys are threatened by bots that shift survey outcomes and exploit incentives. In this proof-of-concept study, we advance the identification of bots driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) through the prediction of LLM-generated text in open narrative responses. We conducted an online survey on same-gender partnerships, including three open narrative questions, and recruited 1512 participants through Facebook. In addition, we utilized two LLM-driven bots, each of which responded to the open narrative questions 400 times. Open narrative responses synthesized by our bots were labeled as containing LLM-generated text (“yes”). Facebook responses were assigned a proxy label (“unclear”) as they may contain bots themselves. Using this binary label as ground truth, we fine-tuned prediction models relying on the “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers” (BERT) model, resulting in an impressive prediction performance: The models accurately identified between 97% and 100% of bot responses. However, prediction performance decreases if the models make predictions about questions they were not fine-tuned with. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on bots and extends the methodological toolkit for protecting the quality and integrity of online survey data."

However, the large quantity of data needed to train a recognition algorithm is not always available, and differences between the training set and one’s own research data in factors such as recording conditions and participant characteristics may hinder transferability. To address these issues, we propose training and testing recognition algorithms on virtual agents, a tool that has not yet been used for this purpose in multimodal communication research. We provide an example use case with step-by-step instructions, using mocap data to animate a virtual agent and create customised lighting conditions, backgrounds, and camera angles, creating a virtual agent-only dataset to train and test a gesture recognition algorithm. This approach also allows us to assess the impact of particular features, such as background and lighting. Our best-performing model in optimal background and lighting conditions achieved accuracy of 85.9%. When introducing background clutter and reduced lighting, the accuracy dropped to 71.6%. When testing the virtual agent-trained model on images of humans, the accuracy of target handshape classification ranged from 72% to 95%. The results suggest that training an algorithm on artificial data (1) is a resourceful, convenient, and effective way to customise algorithms, (2) potentially addresses issues of data sparsity, and (3) can be used to assess the impact of many contextual and environmental factors that would not be feasible to systematically assess using human data"

    "abstract": "We present the HR-ACT (Human–Robot Action) Database, a comprehensive collection of 80 standardized videos featuring matched communicative and noncommunicative actions performed by both a humanoid robot (Pepper) and a human actor. We describe the creation of 40 action exemplars per agent, with actions executed in a similar manner, timing, and number of repetitions. The database includes detailed normative data collected from 438 participants, providing metrics on action identification, confidence ratings, communicativeness ratings, meaning clusters, and H values (an entropy-based measure reflecting response homogeneity). We provide researchers with controlled yet naturalistic stimuli in multiple formats: videos, image frames, and raw animation files (.qanim). These materials support diverse research applications in human–robot interaction, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. The database enables systematic investigation of action perception across human and robotic agents, while the inclusion of raw animation files allows researchers using Pepper robots to implement these actions for real-time experiments. The full set of stimuli, along with comprehensive normative data and documentation, is publicly available at https://osf.io/8vsxq/ ."

    "abstract": "Questions of temporality are at the heart of climate change discourse: Does one think of climate change primarily as an event happening in the present, or as something that will take place in the future? By when must we take action to prevent its worst consequences? This article presents the first large-scale assessment of the structure and evolution of temporalities expressed in U.S. media discussions on climate change (2000 to 2021). To do so, we developed a novel computational framework for detecting and interpreting temporal expressions in textual data. Our analyses yield three main findings: First, temporal horizons for climate change have continuously shrunk since 2000, stably targeting, on average, the year 2060. However, second, while anticipated effects are getting closer, horizons for the coordination of climate action have remained highly stable, averaging around 16 years into the future at any given time. Third, contrasting the stability of explicitly stated horizons, we find a sharply expanding discourse of urgency patterned by outbursts of urgency: sudden surges in calls for immediate action or warnings against climate change’s devastating consequences during events like the 2020 California wildfires. By uncovering this disjuncture of different forms of temporality, we illuminate a crucial aspect of the climate change debate, contribute to the sociological theory of events, and identify some of the conditions underlying climate inaction."

    "abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, prosociality across group boundaries becomes ever more important. Yet, a common premise in the behavioral and social sciences is that people are prosocial mainly toward their ingroup and not outgroups. So far, evidence for this premise comes mostly from studies in which people must choose between ingroup and outgroup prosociality, thereby precluding positive associations between the two types of prosociality. We study situations in which people make separate decisions regarding the ingroup and outgroup, allowing us to examine how ingroup and outgroup prosociality are related. Across six large-scale and cross-societal datasets spanning 743,402 individuals in 121 societies, we find a robust positive relationship between ingroup and outgroup prosociality. This relationship holds across societies, different group categorizations, and a diverse range of prosociality measures, including prisoner’s dilemmas, public good dilemmas, dictator games, and survey items on trust and tolerance. Although people are slightly more prosocial toward their ingroup than the outgroup, those who are prosocial toward the ingroup also tend to be prosocial toward the outgroup. The results offer an optimistic message for prosociality across group boundaries. When people are not made to choose between the ingroup and outgroup, they are generally prosocial toward both."

    "abstract": "Previous research has documented racial disparities in gun violence news coverage in limited and small-scale contexts. This study curates and analyzes a large-scale dataset of news articles linked to specific incidents of gun violence to test for systematic race-related differences in representation across the US news media. Using computational techniques, we quantify how much media attention an incident gets, the topics and linguistic style of articles, and how participants in the incidents are framed. We find significant generalized disparities in media coverage and portrayal of incidents depending on whether they occur in neighborhoods that are majority white or majority people of color (POC), including increased media attention on police shootings if they occur in majority POC neighborhoods, greater focus on the people involved in incidents in majority white neighborhoods, and increased racialization and framing related to crime in majority POC neighborhoods."

    "abstract": "People around the world seek climate risk information to guide their decisions. For instance, projections about future flood risk inform where households choose to live, how lenders manage credit risks, and which communities receive federal funding. Yet data limitations and fundamental validation challenges raise important concerns about the reliability of such projections. The principles of transparency and reusability help address these concerns by enabling scrutiny of assumptions and methods, development of foundational data and tools, and consistent application of evaluation standards. While there is ongoing debate about how much transparency commercial climate risk services should provide, many expect noncommercial actors to lead the way on operationalizing transparency and reusability to fulfill their knowledge-building role in the climate risk ecosystem. However, despite prominent success stories, we find a substantial gap between principles and practice: Only four percent of the most-cited peer-reviewed climate risk studies in recent years fully share their data and code although this is a widely accepted minimum standard for transparency. We highlight low-cost measures that noncommercial researchers can take now to improve transparency and reusability. We also emphasize that transformative progress requires substantial investment, cross-sector collaboration, and careful consideration of tradeoffs, data rights, and multiple perspectives on equity. We hope this perspective accelerates both immediate actions and longer-term conversations to improve the ability of science to effectively support timely, evidence-based, and sound climate risk management."
