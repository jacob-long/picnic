    "authors": "Luna T Frauhammer, Jana H Dreston",
    "abstract": "Social media technologies have been criticized as ineffective sources of information because users seem to increase their subjective but not their objective knowledge. While different factors such as multitasking have been brought up as explanations, direct and fair comparisons of learning outcomes between social and traditional news media are missing. This two-wave field experiment (N1 = 902, N2 = 663) shows that whereas participants receiving information on social media did learn less than participants receiving the same information through an email newsletter, this difference disappeared when cognitive elaboration on social media was triggered through elaboration questions. Correlational analyses further suggest that multitasking is one factor which hinders successful knowledge acquisition on social media. Our findings suggest that learning through social media is possible if social media contents invite cognitively elaborate processing.",

    "abstract": "Unintended encounters with news on social media can foster a reliance on incidental news exposure and the perception that “news finds me.” Because the “news-finds-me” (NFM) perception has negative consequences for informed and engaged citizenship, explaining it has become a priority in recent years. This two-wave survey of adults in the USA incorporates scholarship on social media habits and social media mindsets for an expanded view of the antecedent psychological conditions of the “news-finds-me” perception. Path analyses indicate habitual use of social media to have direct effects and core beliefs about social media and algorithmic control to have indirect effects through habitual use. These patterns hold for two of the three sub-dimensions of the NFM perception, indicating habit and mindset to be fruitful theoretical directions for future research.",

    "authors": "Alexandra R Stankus, Archana Krishnan",
    "abstract": "Online lurking is a common behavior but defining it and understanding its motivations is complex. Various definitions and measurements for online lurking have been employed but have often suggested “lurking” to be conflated with other behaviors. This study developed and tested a scale to measure consistent online lurking (COOL), addressing the need for a clear conceptualization and measurement of this behavior. Exploratory factor analysis explicated two dimensions of online lurking – online invisibility and preference for content consumption, and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure. The resulting scale demonstrated good reliability across two samples. The study differentiates consistent lurking from information-seeking and contextual factors, focusing on individuals who tend to lurk across platforms. This conceptualization provides a theoretical contribution by illuminating a subset of online users who are often underrepresented in research but are integral to online communities despite their invisibility.",

    "abstract": "Social media are key arenas for public opinion formation, but are susceptible to coordinated social media manipulation (CSMM), that is, the orchestrated activity of multiple accounts to increase content visibility and deceive audiences. Despite advances in detecting and characterizing CSMM, the attribution problem—identifying the principals behind CSMM campaigns—has received little scholarly attention. In this article, we address this gap by synthesizing existing research and developing a theoretical model for understanding CSMM. We propose a consolidated definition of CSMM, identify its key observable and hidden characteristics, and present a rational choice model for inferring principals’ strategic decisions from campaign features. In addition, we present a typology of CSMM campaigns, linking variations in scale, elaborateness, and disguise to principals’ resources, stakes, and influence strategies. Our contribution provides researchers with conceptual and heuristic tools for attribution and invites interdisciplinary and comparative research on CSMM campaigns.",

    "authors": "Yunfei Xing, Justin Zuopeng Zhang",
    "abstract": "Human trafficking, a grave human rights violation with far-reaching global consequences, serves as a compelling case study for analyzing multifaceted polarization dynamics in online discourse and the influence of social media on public perceptions and responses. Drawing on social identity theory and self-categorization theory, this article aims to elucidate both group polarization and opinion polarization surrounding human trafficking on social media. Through an integrated approach that combines clustering, social network analysis, text mining, and topic modeling, this study provides a comprehensive examination of community formation, influential actor identification, topic classification, and semantic analysis. The similarity between user-generated content from clustered groups and the topics identified is calculated to quantify the degree of multifaceted polarization. The findings reveal a robust community structure within the network and uncover divisions and structural characteristics across each subgroup. Utilizing the BERTopic model, thematic clusters such as vulnerable groups, persecution experiences, incident areas, law and politics, public awareness, contraband, and case events are identified, reflecting the primary public concerns regarding human trafficking. This research enhances our understanding of multifaceted polarization shaped by social identity in digital conversations about critical social issues and holds significant implications for policymakers, advocacy groups, and practitioners navigating public opinion regarding human trafficking in the digital realm.",

    "abstract": "Launched in December 2019, the European Green Deal (EGD) represents the European Union’s (EU) ambitious policy framework to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This study employs a sentiment analysis of 582,156 tweets from the beginning of 2020 to April 2024 to understand the evolution of public sentiment toward the EGD. Grounded in Social Representations Theory and Framing Theory, we analyze sentiment trends, topic distributions, and the impact of key policy and external events (e.g. COVID-19 spread) on public sentiment. The results reveal predominantly neutral sentiment (61.68%), with more positive (28.26%) than negative (10.06%) sentiment overall and a substantially stable trend over time. EU-affiliated accounts showed higher positive sentiment compared to non-EU-affiliated accounts. Sentiment trends were correlated with key policy announcements and global events, demonstrating the intricate relationship between policy communication and the formation of public opinion. The study identified key themes and specific initiatives driving positive sentiment, including those linked to the first EU climate law and climate targets, Farm to Fork, and New European Bauhaus. Conversely, economic concerns, challenges in policy implementation challenges, ecosystem conservation status, and food system, and energy security issues appeared as associated with negative sentiment. The findings highlight the importance of targeted communication strategies, transparent response to skepticism, communication of policy processes, and stakeholder feedback collection tool enhancement to leverage public sentiment in support of the EU green transition, paving the way for future research to explore regional nuances and sentiment monitoring.",

    "authors": "Anna Wickenkamp, Frederic R. Hopp, Michael Hameleers, Linda Bos",
    "abstract": "Social media have transformed political campaigning by enabling direct interaction between politicians and voters, becoming a key tool for shaping public opinion. Moral language is pivotal in this dynamic as it captures attention in an overly information-saturated social media environment and wields significant influence over political opinions. Populists thrive on social media by fostering distrust in elites, using emotional language, and reducing complex issues to simple “us vs. them” binaries. We argue these factors are rooted in moral underpinnings, which may play a significant role in the appeal of populist parties and have thus far received limited scholarly attention. Consequently, this paper addresses the research question: To what extent, and in what ways, do populist parties exhibit a distinct moral-rhetorical profile on social media that sets them apart from mainstream politicians? Using Moral Foundations Theory, natural language processing, and a computational semantic network approach, we analyzed 11,205 social media posts from Dutch political parties and leaders during the 2023 Dutch election campaign across X, Facebook, and Instagram. Our findings reveal that populist parties emphasize Care and Authority over other moral foundations, while mainstream parties exhibit a different moral foundation distribution. These results align with the part of populist communication logic that frames populist actors as defenders against corrupt elites and external threats, as well as representatives of the people’s demand for sovereignty. Moreover, we found populist parties exhibit less internal consistency in their moral rhetoric across platforms than mainstream parties, suggesting a potentially higher adeptness at tailoring messages to different platforms and their affordances.",

    "abstract": "Radical right behavior and support for radical right parties have increased across many countries in recent decades. A growing body of research has argued that, similar to the spread of other extremist behaviors, this is due to an erosion of political norms. This suggests that re-stigmatizing radical right parties might be an effective way of countering their growth. We use a survey experiment in Spain that compares the effectiveness of three theory-driven interventions aimed at increasing political stigma against a radical right party. Contrary to expectations, we fail to validate the efficacy of vignette-based attempts at stigmatization, instead identifying some backlash effects. Methodologically, our findings underscore the importance of validating treatments, as we show that simple attempts at re-stigmatization can produce null or opposing effects to their intended purpose. Theoretically, our results support the idea that normalization is a “one-way street,” in that re-stigmatizing parties is difficult after a party has become normalized.",

    "abstract": "To understand the evolution of party-based populism, reliable and valid measurement is essential. This article presents the second wave of the Populism and Political Parties Expert Survey, capturing populism with a continuous, five-item multidimensional latent construct in 312 political parties across 31 European countries in 2023. We validate the approach through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Item Response Theory (IRT). The IRT findings confirm the discriminatory power of the five items, while CFA results establish strict measurement invariance from 2018 to 2023, allowing for cross-temporal comparisons. Substantively, we show that radical right parties remain the most populist, followed by the radical left, with both nativism and left-wing economic stances as robust predictors of populism. Overall, average populism levels declined from 2018 to 2023, largely due to decreases among parties with weaker nativist and authoritarian tendencies.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting of armed conflicts is a critical area of research with the potential to save lives and mitigate suffering. While existing forecasting models offer valuable point predictions, they often lack individual-level uncertainty estimates, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. Several approaches exist to estimate uncertainty, such as parametric and Bayesian prediction intervals, bootstrapping, quantile regression, but these methods often rely on restrictive assumptions, struggle to provide well-calibrated intervals across the full range of outcomes, or are computationally intensive. Conformal prediction offers a model-agnostic alternative that guarantees a user-specified level of coverage but typically provides only marginal coverage, potentially resulting in non-uniform coverage across different regions of the outcome space. In this article, we introduce a novel extension called bin-conditional conformal prediction (BCCP), which enhances standard conformal prediction (SCP) by ensuring consistent coverage rates across user-defined subsets (bins) of the outcome variable. We apply BCCP to simulated data as well as the forecasting of fatalities from armed conflicts, and demonstrate that it provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across various ranges of the outcome. Compared to SCP, BCCP offers improved local coverage, though this comes at the cost of slightly wider prediction intervals.",

This letter describes a workflow process for structured text extraction using free models and software. I discuss the type of data best suited to this method, its usefulness within political science, and the steps required to convert the text into a usable dataset. Finally, I demonstrate the method by extracting agenda items from city council meeting minutes. I find the method can accurately extract subsections of text from a document and requires only a few hand labeled documents to adequately train.",

    "authors": "Bryan McLaughlin, Nathaniel Geiger, Pedro H. P. Rocha",
    "abstract": "Americans are increasingly unwilling to talk about politics with out-partisans. One potential barrier to such cross-cutting partisan conversations may be partisans’ tendency to stereotype out-partisans as lacking the deliberative traits necessary to have a productive conversation (i.e., partisan deliberative bias ). Here, three studies examine the presence of partisan deliberative bias, its relationship to cross-cutting political talk, and potential pathways to reducing partisan deliberative bias. Study 1 (two-wave panel; Wave-2 N = 695) provides evidence that partisans perceive out-partisans possess less deliberative traits than in-partisans and these perceptions are related to reduced cross-cutting political talk (at Time 2). Study 2 (experimental; N = 417) provides evidence that exposing individuals to more examples of out-partisans who display deliberative traits (vs. anti-deliberative traits) leads to increased perceptions that out-partisans possess deliberative traits, which is associated with greater willingness to engage in a political conversation. Study 3 (experimental; N = 825) provides evidence that a deliberative bias-correcting intervention can reduce stereotypes about out-party members’ deliberative traits. Further, findings from an alternative model that includes in-group favoritism suggest that perceptions of deliberative traits are significantly related to cross-cutting political talk even when accounting for affective polarization. Findings across all three studies are similar for Republican and Democratic participants. Taken holistically, these results highlight the prevalence of partisan deliberative bias, suggest that such bias reduces cross-cutting conversations, and provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to address this bias.",

How each side chooses to respond has important implications for democratic stability. Winners may attempt to develop post-election narratives in such a way as to claim a mandate and consolidate power. But losers are even more likely to be motivated to search for an explanation—a narrative that not only explains the loss in a self-esteem preserving way but also provides guidance for how to engage (or not) in the future to avoid subsequent losses. Building on extant research on the winner-loser gap in political attitudes, we theorize that electoral losers will be more conspiratorial (as assessed by a general measure of conspiracism) after the election than before the election. We report the results of five nationally representative pre/post-election panel surveys spanning three election years in the U.S. (2016, 2018, 2020) that provide strong and consistent support for the “losers’ conspiracism” hypothesis and discuss the implications of our findings.",

    "abstract": "Current political developments worldwide illustrate that research on democratic backsliding is as important as ever. A recent exchange in Political Science &amp; Politics (February 2024) highlighted again that the measurement of democracy remains a challenge. With many democracy indicators consisting of subjective assessments rather than factual observations, trends in democracy over time could be due to human biases in the coding of these indicators rather than empirical facts. This article leverages two cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for the coding of democracy indicators from the V-Dem project. With access to huge amounts of information, these models may be able to rate the many “soft” characteristics of regimes at substantially lower costs. Whereas LLM-generated codings largely align with expert coders for many countries, we show that when these models deviate from human assessments, they do so in different but consistent ways. Some LLMs are too pessimistic and others consistently overestimate the democratic quality of these countries. Although the combination of the two LLM codings can alleviate this concern, we conclude that it is difficult to replace human coders with LLMs because the extent and direction of these attitudes is not known a priori.",

    "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, it has been argued that the pandemic has negative aspects related not only to public health but also to democracy. While various crises have been shown to undermine citizens’ attitudes toward democracy, the pandemic, characterized by viral risk, likely showed distinct patterns in democratic attitudes compared to previous crises. In this study, I argue that the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative aspects for democracy were not evident in citizens’ satisfaction with democracy but were more significantly evident in their attitudes toward democratic norms and principles. Data collected in South Korea between 2020 and 2024 show that, while citizens’ perceptions of viral risk are not significantly associated with their satisfaction with democracy, positive evaluations of the government’s capacity in handling COVID-19 are tied to an increase in satisfaction. However, higher perceived viral risk levels and greater government capacity evaluations are associated with stronger support for stringent policy measures that violate democratic norms and principles. Finally, the reduction in perceived viral risk does not correlate with changes in attitudes toward stringent policy measures. Therefore, the pandemic’s negative implications for attitudes toward democratic norms and principles have the potential to linger long-term in post-pandemic politics.",

While prior studies on hashtag activism predominantly focus on single and widely known cases, less is understood about why some incidents draw massive public attention while others do not. Addressing this gap, our study investigates the factors influencing the likelihood and size of public attention on Twitter (now X) following extrajudicial police killings. We analyzed 1.5 million tweets in response to 795 police killings between January 1, 2015, and December 8, 2016, in the United States. By examining cases on all scales, from unnoticed to prominent, we provide large-scale empirical evidence on disparities in public attention to police killings and their victims. Results indicate two distinct processes in the emergence of focusing events: While victims’ attributes such as race, age, and gender increased likelihood of receiving any attention (thresholding), variables of context and social construction were related to overall wave size (focusing).",

    "abstract": "Does exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ increasing use of deepfakes further increase polarization among partisans, and how does this impact vary among different evaluations of political coalitions, parties, and leaders? What role does approval for candidates’ usage of AI play as a moderator in this relationship? This paper examines these questions using data from a survey experiment ( N = 1627), in which each respondent exposed to a news story that varied in their coverage of the growing deployment of AI-powered deepfakes during the 2024 India’s national election campaigns. The findings indicate that exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ use of deepfakes did not polarize attitudes towards coalitions, parties, and leaders. In contrast, approval for candidates’ use of AI was negatively associated with polarization towards coalitions, parties, and leaders, but this did not moderate the experimental effects: respondents who approved of candidates’ AI usage and saw a news article about out-party use of deepfakes were not more polarized toward either coalitions, parties or leaders. This study not only extends the understanding of AI’s role in campaigns by examining its complex effects on affective polarization, but it also broadens empirical research into the impact of deepfakes by focusing on the non-Western context of India, thereby offering new theoretical insights into how technological advancements intersect with political behaviors and attitudes.",

    "abstract": "In studies using the increasingly popular experience-sampling method (ESM), design decisions are often guided by theoretical or practical considerations. Yet limited empirical evidence exists on how these choices affect data quantity (e.g., response probabilities), data quality (e.g., response latency), and potential biases in study outcomes (e.g., characteristics of study variables). In a preregistered, 4-week study ( N = 395), we experimentally manipulated two key ESM protocol characteristics for sending ESM surveys: timing (fixed vs. varying times) and contingency (directly vs. indirectly after unlocking the smartphone). We evaluated the ESM protocols resulting from the combination of these two characteristics regarding different criteria: As hypothesized for contingency, indirect protocols resulted in higher response probabilities (increased data quantity). But they also led to higher response latencies (reduced data quality). Contrary to our expectations, the combined effect of contingency and timing did not significantly influence response probability. We also did not observe other effects of timing or contingency on data quality. In exploratory follow-up analyses, we discovered that timing significantly affected response probability and smartphone-usage behaviors, as measured by screen logs; however, these effects were likely attributable to time-of-day effects. Self-reported states showed no differences based on the chosen ESM protocol, and similar trends were found when correlating primary outcomes with external criteria, such as trait affect and well-being. Based on the study’s findings, we discuss the trade-offs that researchers should consider when choosing their ESM protocols to optimize data quantity, data quality, and biases in study outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Eye tracking is widely used to study where spatial attention is allocated across stimuli. However, determining a sufficient and efficient number of participants for such studies remains a challenge. While clear guidelines have been established for many classical statistical tests, no straightforward participant sample size guidelines exist for the comparison of gaze distribution maps and area-of-interest analyses – two of the most prominent analyses in scene viewing studies. Just how many participants should be included for reliable and reproducible gaze estimations? We here utilized gaze data to a single static image, viewed by 1248 individuals (dataset 1), and gaze data to 200+ images, viewed by 84 participants each (dataset 2). Researchers can assess which of these datasets and analysis types most resemble their setup and determine their sample size accordingly. Although we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all sample size recommendation, we show progressively diminishing returns for a range of sample sizes and for two typical study types. For example, when using Normalized Saliency Score as a metric of distribution map similarity, a 5% relative increase requires increases in sample size from 13 $$\\rightarrow $$ → 20 $$\\rightarrow $$ → 34 participants (based on dataset 1) or from 10 $$\\rightarrow $$ → 16 $$\\rightarrow $$ → 32 participants (based on dataset 2). Alternatively, when analyzing the number of visits to certain areas of interest, a 25% decrease in outcome variance requires increases in sample size from 13 $$\\rightarrow $$ → 24 $$\\rightarrow $$ → 44. We provide easy-to-use guidelines and reference tables to determine scene viewing participant sample size for academics and industry professionals alike.",

    "authors": "Chao Li, Jianning Dang, Li Liu",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) brings immediate benefits but also raises potential risks. Despite much discussion on AI threat, how subtle linguistic cues, such as first-person pronouns, influence its perception remains unclear. Proposing a scope-expansion perspective, we examine whether “we” versus “I” pronoun use increases perceived AI threat by broadening regulatory scope, particularly when AI threat is psychologically distant. Analyses of two large AI-related text corpora (Studies 1A and 1B) and four experiments ( N = 1,451) revealed that using “we” versus “I” pronouns positively predicted and heightened perceived AI threat among English (Studies 1–4) and Chinese (Studies 3 and 5) speakers. This effect, explained by a broader regulatory scope (Studies 3 and 5), was stronger for psychologically distant (vs. close) AI threat (Studies 4 and 5) and among English (vs. Chinese) speakers (Study 3). These findings expand the role of first-person pronouns and enhance our understanding of public perceptions of AI threat.",

    "authors": "Andrei Boutyline, Alina Arseniev-Koehler",
    "abstract": "Word embeddings are language models that represent words as positions in an abstract many-dimensional meaning space. Despite a growing range of applications demonstrating their utility for sociology, there is little conceptual clarity regarding what exactly embeddings measure and whether this matches what we need them to measure. Here, we fill this theoretical gap by clarifying how cultural meaning can be understood in spatial terms. We argue that embeddings operationalize context spaces, where words’ positions can reflect any regularity in usage. We then examine sociologists' embeddings-based measurements to argue that most sociologists are instead implicitly interested in capturing concept spaces, where positions strictly indicate meaningful conceptual features (e.g., femininity or status). Because meaningful features yield regularities in usage, context spaces can proxy for concept spaces. However, context spaces also reflect surface regularities in language—e.g., syntax, morphology, dialect, and phraseology—which are irrelevant to most sociological investigations and can bias cultural measurement. We draw on our framework to propose best practices for measuring meaning with embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Altruism underlies cooperative behaviours that facilitate social complexity. In late 2022 and early 2023, we tested whether particular large language models—then in widespread use—generated completions that simulated altruism when prompted with text inputs similar to those used in ‘dictator game’ experiments measuring human altruism. Here we report that one model in our initial study set—OpenAI’s text-davinci-003—consistently generated completions that simulated payoff maximization in a non-social decision task yet simulated altruism in dictator games. Comparable completions appeared when we replicated our experiments, altered prompt phrasing, varied model parameters, altered currencies described in the prompt and studied a subsequent model, GPT-4. Furthermore, application of explainable artificial intelligence techniques showed that results changed little when instructing the system to ignore past research on the dictator or ultimatum games but changed noticeably when instructing the system to focus on the needs of particular participants in a simulated social encounter.",

    "authors": "Gaurav Kamath, Michelle Yang, Siva Reddy, Morgan Sonderegger, Dallas Card",
    "abstract": "A central question in the study of language change is whether or not such change is generational. If a language changes over time generation-by-generation, the process looks as follows: New generations of speakers introduce innovations, while older speakers conserve their usage patterns, and the language changes as new generations replace older ones. At the opposite extreme, language change could be a zeitgeist phenomenon, in which changes are universally adopted by speakers simultaneously, regardless of age or generational cohort. This paper asks this question in the context of word meaning change. We analyze meaning change in over 100 words across more than 7.9 million U.S. congressional speeches, to observe whether, when a word sense rises or falls in prominence, adult speakers from different generations uniformly adopt it, or those from older generations conserve their prior usage. Using language model-based word sense induction methods, we identify different senses of each word, and then model the prevalence of each of these word senses as a function of time and speaker age. We find that most words show a small but statistically significant effect of speaker age; across almost 140 y of Congress, older speakers typically take longer than younger speakers to follow changes in word usage, but nevertheless do so within a few years. Our findings indicate that despite minor age-based differences, word meaning change among mature speakers is likely not a generational process, but rather a zeitgeist process, in which older adult speakers can readily adopt new word usage patterns.",

    "abstract": "Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.",
