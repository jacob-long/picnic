    "authors": "Yotam Ophir, Dror Walter, Ayse Lokmanoglu, Nathan Walter",
    "abstract": "We use a large-scale mixed-method analysis to examine changes in misinformation research over three decades, with a particular attention to the role of media research. We examine a corpus of more than 7,000 academic studies, published between 1993 and 2022, analyzing changes in volume, topics, and methods used. Employing computational text and network analyses, we show how the meteoric rise in misinformation research in the 2010s was driven by a paradigm shift brought about by technological innovations and changes in the media and political landscape. We discuss the growing role communication scholars played in misinformation research, and offer recommendations for areas of strength in which communication research could further extend our understanding of the prevalence, nature, and effects of misinformation moving forward.",

    "authors": "Susanne E Baumgartner",
    "abstract": "Public concerns about media effects are oftentimes fueled by anecdotal evidence and popular press reports pointing towards strong media effects. Interestingly, however, these public concerns are in contrast to findings from empirical studies that point towards minimal media effects. In the past decades, scholars have proposed several explanations for these minimal effects. This article adds to this, by proposing that one reason is that media effects stabilize after repeated exposure. If media effects stabilize, media effects occur only during effect-sensitive periods and might therefore only be empirically observable during these periods. This article delineates how well-established psychological theories as well as communication science theories are crucial in understanding the effects of repeated media exposure and how the conceptualization of media effects as stabilizing after repeated exposure has strong consequences for our empirical endeavors. The article discusses how to move the field forward, both empirically as well as theoretically.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis reviews the findings from 49 studies (N = 23,336) examining the association between interparental conflict and children feeling caught between parents (also referred to as parent–child triangulation). The cumulative evidence indicates a moderate, meaningful relationship between interparental conflict and children feeling caught (r = .402, 95% confidence interval: .366, .437). On average, the positive association was stronger when researchers used: (a) samples that included both intact and post-divorce family members as opposed to only intact or post-divorce families; (b) samples that included young adult children as opposed to adolescent children; (c) cross-sectional as opposed to longitudinal research designs; (d) children’s reports of interparental conflict as opposed to parents’ reports or observational ratings; and (e) individuals as the unit of analysis as opposed to triads. Implications for developing a communication theory of feeling caught are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A new era of message processing research will emerge from the convergence of powerful machine learning algorithms with dynamic data from everyday devices equipped with biological sensors. Our study takes critical steps into this era by integrating theory-guided artificial neural networks with eye movements to understand how people learn science concepts from dynamic multimedia. Essential to our theory-guided machine learning approach is a cognitive conceptualization of time as the dynamic interdependence between past and new information that guides how multimedia is attended to and understood. We tracked the eye movements of 197 children as they watched an educational video. We trained two neural network architectures differing in theory guidance to predict learning outcomes using eye movements. The theory-guided architecture, which considered the temporal interdependence of information, yielded more accurate out-of-sample predictions. Our work advances the use of theory-guided machine learning and the development of systems that monitor real-time learning.",

    "authors": "Kelly Morrison, Steven A. McCornack",
    "abstract": "The last many years have given us clear and startling insights into human cognition and the process of human speech production. Yet much of current deception research eschews such revelations. Specifically, many deception scholars continue to presume a top-down, sequential-stepwise, selection-based speech production model that begins with a singular intent-to-deceive and ends with selection between binary discourse options—truth versus lie—that then are instantiated as communicative behavior. Unfortunately, such a model lacks goodness-of-fit with theory and research in speech production, cognitive psychology, and neurolinguistics. What's more, the presumptive truth/lie binary that dominates both experimental designs and research rationales bears little resemblance to the actual discourse patterns observed when people are allowed to freely generate responses to truth-problematic contexts. In this essay, we do three things. First, we review classic and current work in speech production. Second, we revisit the intentional states propositions of a recent theory of deceptive message production—Information Manipulation Theory 2—along with illustrative discourse examples from our own data. Finally, we entreat deception scholars to move our field forward in the future to a more fruitful place.",

Drawing on a comprehensive dataset, the research analyzes campaign materials from all EU member states, focusing on the thematic and visual strategies employed by political parties on Facebook. The findings reveal that digital visibility, measured by the volume of posts, is a stronger predictor of electoral success than thematic coherence or ideological messaging. The study integrates theories of hybrid media systems, symbolic politics, and cultural performance to argue that Facebook functions not merely as a communication tool but as a symbolic arena where legitimacy is performed and contested. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of how social media platforms are reshaping the dynamics of European electoral politics.",

    "abstract": "Incivility in online comment sections is pervasive and has significant societal implications, including impacting mental well-being and increasing polarisation. This study investigates the relationship between speed of commenting and incivility, using a dataset of 38 million comments from The Guardian Online. We hypothesise that quicker responses are more likely to be uncivil and that incivility propagates through a contagion effect. Our analysis reveals that blocked comments, used as a proxy for incivility, are posted significantly faster than visible comments, for both parent and child comments. In addition, we find that the presence of blocked comments increases the likelihood of subsequent blocked comments, with decreasing time intervals between them. These findings suggest that incivility is associated with impulsive, fast thinking, while civil discourse will sometimes require slower, more deliberate practices. Our results have implications for designing online platforms to foster healthier and more productive discussions by encouraging deliberative time before readers post.",

    "abstract": "This research examines how attachment‐related insecurity relates to the motives underlying deceptive behavior. In Study 1 ( n = 926), we developed the Motives for Romantic Deception Scale (MRDS), identifying seven distinct motives: malicious intent, attention seeking, conflict avoidance, emotional appeasement, mistake concealment, privacy protection, and sexual avoidance. A follow‐up validation study ( n = 740) provided strong evidence of the scale's convergent and discriminant validity. In Study 2 ( n = 549), we explored the associations between these motives and attachment anxiety and avoidance. As hypothesized, avoidant attachment was positively associated with motives implying emotional distance and autonomy, while anxious attachment was positively related to motives reflecting insecurity and a need for reassurance—patterns that reflect theoretical interpretations rather than direct measures of closeness or autonomy. Unexpectedly, anxious attachment was also positively associated with conflict avoidance and malicious intent. These findings are discussed in the ways attachment dynamics underlie deceptive behavior, and our results suggest that even seemingly prosocial motives may reflect self‐protective strategies.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal design in educational videos is a complex task, requiring the effective integration of various semiotic modalities to promote understanding among recipients. While superficially meeting proposed multimedia design principles, educational videos vary significantly in effectiveness. To explore this variation, the authors conducted a 2 × 2 experimental study with 45 students, examining the impact of instructor presence and dynamic vs static slide designs on eye gaze behaviour and learning outcome. Instructor presence was found to attract about 25 percent of visual attention away from presentation slides irrespective of their static or dynamic design, but learning gain was highest for dynamic videos with a visible instructor. This suggests that gaze behaviour and learning outcome do not correlate with the simple presence or absence of design features and a finer-grained approach is needed. The authors consequently applied a framework for multimodal cohesion analysis to relate individual design elements to a video’s discourse structure more tightly, finding that quantitative differences in cohesion predict differences in gaze behaviour between dynamic and static slide presentations, but irrespective of instructor presence. Future research will therefore need to formulate corresponding finer-grained pre-post knowledge tests to further correlate between discourse structures, gaze behaviour and learning outcome.",

    "authors": "Jan Hensellek",
    "abstract": "Contemporary television news programmes are often complex examples of hybrid communication (see Bucher, ‘Multimodal understanding or reception as interaction’, 2011). Television news presents related as well as unrelated information in both a linear and non-linear fashion by combining the news read with a variety of visual elements. Studies utilizing eye-tracking have found the visual attention received by the various types of elements to vary considerably (see Josephson and Holmes, ‘Clutter or content? How on-screen enhancements affect how TV viewers scan and what they learn’, 2006; Pjesivac et al., ‘Television infographics as orienting response’, 2021; Rodrigues et al., ‘A television news graphics layout analysis method using eye tracking, 2012; and ‘Analysis of the layout on TV news reception, 2014). ‘The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (see Lang, ‘The limited capacity model of mediated message processing’, 2000) also suggests those elements can both positively and negatively impact viewers’ ability to effectively process information. The present study relates eye-tracking data with a multiple-choice information recall test by building generalized linear regression models to gain deeper insight into the effects of the diverse multimodality of modern digital screen layouts on visual attention and message processing. Six common visual elements of television news are presented in two experimental conditions of varying visual complexity. The study found a large difference in fixations received by and information recalled from different elements of the news screens. While the more complex condition’s effect on information recall was found to be not significant, it did significantly affect the distribution of fixations and gaze duration across screen elements. Biographical factors such as general news interest and time spent watching television were also found to significantly impact gaze behaviour.",

In this research note, we report three experiments on one central obstacle in lab-to-field messaging applications: getting people’s attention. We first analyze a large-scale direct mail campaign run by an established non-profit that promotes conservative solutions to climate change. In this experiment, postcards with messages based on extant survey-experimental research did not cause changes in key climate attitudes. In a follow-up survey experiment, identical postcards induced attitude change— Re but only when participants were required to pay attention to them. A final field experiment highlights the difficulty of inducing attention; in another real-world campaign, postcards with eye-catching scratch-off panels performed no better than standard postcards. These findings illustrate the crucial role of attention and the complexity of translating messages developed in survey experiments into effective real-world campaigns.",

Using population-based survey experiments leveraging real-world interviews with extreme right activists on Sky News UK and Australia, we test whether media exposure leads to higher agreement with extreme right statements. We also test whether exposure affects perceptions of how many others agree with these statements. Our findings are consistent across both countries: exposure to uncritical interviews increases agreement with extreme statements and perceptions of broader support in the population. Testing the media strategy in the UK, we find that critical interviewing tarnishes the activist’s image and reduces effects, but still heightens perceived support for extreme statements. This study identifies a mechanism through which extreme political ideas spread and offers insights into media strategies to counteract persuasion and normalisation effects.",

Drawing on experimental evidence, we find that statements by mainstream politicians lead to more norm erosion than similar statements by radical-right politicians. Subsample analyses suggest that this is because statements by mainstream-right politicians erode norm perceptions of right-wing individuals, while those by radical-right politicians induce backlash among left-wing individuals, who hold closer to the norm in place. The latter effect (backlash by the left) disappears when similar statements are made by mainstream right politicians. We argue that this difference occurs because mainstream politicians represent the views of a larger part of the population or have a higher status. Our results highlight the pivotal role of mainstream politicians in enforcing or eroding democratic norms, and that similar political statements can have different effects depending on their sender.",

    "abstract": "In small area estimation, different data sources are integrated in order to produce reliable estimates of target parameters (e.g., a mean or a proportion) for a collection of small subsets (areas) of a finite population. Regression models such as the linear mixed effects model or M-quantile regression are often used to improve the precision of survey sample estimates by leveraging auxiliary information for which means or totals are known at the area level. In many applications, the unit-level linkage of records from different sources is probabilistic and potentially error-prone. In this article, we present adjustments of the small area predictors that are based on either the linear mixed effects model or M-quantile regression to account for the presence of linkage error. These adjustments are developed from a two-component mixture model that hinges on the assumption of independence of the target and auxiliary variable given incorrect linkage. Estimation and inference is based on composite likelihoods and machinery revolving around the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm. For each of the two regression methods, we propose modified small area predictors and approximations for their mean squared errors. The empirical performance of the proposed approaches is studied in both design-based and model-based simulations that include comparisons to a variety of baselines.",

While previous research has examined differences between open-ended and closed-ended survey responses, our understanding remains fragmented, especially considering the growing interest in open-ended questions spurred by advances in automated text analysis. We explore how computational text analysis methods––particularly large language models––can efficiently analyze open-ended responses with promising sentiment and actor identification results, though topic classification remains more challenging. Then, we systematically compare open-ended and closed-ended responses on trust in the Austrian coalition government to assess how different formats shape the expression of political trust. We find significant discrepancies between the trust levels indicated in closed-ended questions and the trust described in open-ended responses, with paired t-tests also revealing statistically significant differences. These findings highlight that question format affects how respondents express their views, raising important considerations about the usefulness and validity of trust measures. They highlight the unique value of open-ended questions in capturing nuanced perspectives often missed by closed-ended formats. This has broader implications for survey design: including open-ended questions could enrich data quality and provide deeper insights into public opinion.",

    "abstract": "Disability measures often collect information on functional limitations but may not fully capture disability status in the working-age population, and seldom collect the type of disability people have. The present research used a multimethodological approach to assess new disability measures for a federal survey. The questions were designed to capture whether respondents have disabilities that impact the kind or amount of paid work they can do, as well as a novel question that collected type of disability. We used multiple methodologies, including cognitive interviews, card-sort/categorization tasks, and web probing. During cognitive interviews, we used retrospective probes to assess the response process and question sensitivity, and a card-sort task, where participants sorted a list of health conditions into similar groups. Additional participants completed a web-probing study, which used a mix of open- and closed-ended probes and were compared to the cognitive interview results. We used thematic coding to compare findings from all three methods, including unique findings that would have been missed if only one method had been used. Each method supported allowing respondents to select multiple types of disabilities, simplification of response categories, and including examples of health conditions that help distinguish categories from one another and vary in level of severity. The cognitive interviews helped refine response category names, while the card-sort and categorization tasks helped develop appropriate category examples. The web-probing study revealed additional question sensitivity not observed in the other methods. We discuss the advantages of a multimethodological approach to survey research.",

    "authors": "Melissa G. Wolf, Elliott Ihm, Andrew Maul, Ann Taves",
    "abstract": "Pretesting survey items for interpretability and relevance is a commonly recommended practice in the social sciences. The goal is to construct items that are understood as intended by the population of interest and test if participants use the expected cognitive processes when responding to a survey item. Such evidence forms the basis for a critical source of validity evidence known as the “response process,” which is often neglected in favor of quantitative methods. This may be because existing methods of investigating item comprehension, such as cognitive interviewing and web probing, lack clear guidelines for retesting revised items and documenting improvements and can be difficult to implement in large samples. To remedy this, we introduce the response-process-evaluation (RPE) method, a standardized framework for pretesting multiple versions of a survey. This iterative, evidence-based approach to item development relies on feedback from the population of interest to quantify and qualify improvements in item interpretability across a large sample. The result is a set of item-validation reports that detail the intended interpretation and use of each item, the population it was validated on, the percentage of participants that interpreted the item as intended, examples of participant interpretations, and any common misinterpretations to be cautious of. We also include an empirical study that compares the RPE method with cognitive interviewing in terms of the quality of data gathered and the resources expended. Researchers may find that they have more confidence in the inferences drawn from survey data after engaging in rigorous item pretesting.",

This study put Fabla to its first empirical test using a repeated-measures experimental design in which participants ( n = 87) completed a 1-week voice daily diary via the Fabla app, and an identical 1-week text-entry daily diary administered via Qualtrics, with diary method order counterbalanced and randomized. A preregistered analysis plan investigated (1) adherence, usability, and acceptability of Fabla, (2) concurrent validity of voice diaries (vs. text-entry diaries) by comparing linguistic features obtained via each diary method, and (3) differences in the strength of the association between linguistic features and their known psychological correlates when assessed by voice versus text-entry diary. Voice diaries yielded more than double the mean daily language volume (word count) compared to text-entry diaries and received high usability and acceptability ratings. Linguistic markers consistently associated with depression in prior research were significantly associated with depression symptoms when assessed via voice but not text-entry diaries, and the difference in correlation magnitude was significant. Word-count-adjusted linguistic patterns were highly correlated between diary methods, with statistically significant mean differences observed for some linguistic dimensions in the presence of these associations. Fabla is a promising tool for collecting high-quality speech data from participants’ naturalistic environments, overcoming multiple limitations of text-entry responding.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have recently begun to be used for fitting and comparing cognitive models, yet they have mainly focused on methods for dealing with models that lack tractable likelihoods. Evaluating how these approaches compare to traditional likelihood-based methods is critical to understanding the utility of machine learning for modeling and determining what role it might play in the development of new models and theories. In this paper, we systematically benchmark neural network approaches against likelihood-based approaches to model fitting and comparison, focusing on intertemporal choice modeling as an illustrative application. By applying each approach to intertemporal choice data from participants with substance use problems, we show that there is convergence between neural network and Bayesian methods when it comes to making inferences about latent processes and related substance use outcomes. For model comparison, however, classification networks significantly outperformed likelihood-based metrics. Next, we explored two extensions of this approach, using recurrent layers to allow them to fit data with variable stimuli and numbers of trials, and using dropout layers to allow for posterior sampling. We ultimately suggest that neural networks are better suited to fast parameter estimation and posterior sampling, applications to large data sets, and model comparison, while Bayesian MCMC methods should be preferred for flexible applications to smaller data sets featuring many conditions or experimental designs.",

    "authors": "Ömer Emre Can Alagöz, Thorsten Meiser, Lale Khorramdel",
    "abstract": "The accuracy of our inferences from rating-scale items can be improved with IRTree models, which consider heuristic response strategies like response styles (RS). IRTree models break down ordinal responses into pseudo-items (nodes), each representing a distinct decision-making process. These nodes are then modeled using an item response model. In the case of four-point items, a response is split into two nodes: 1) response direction, where the trait influences the overall agreement with items, and 2) response extremity, where both the trait and extreme RS (ERS) impact the choice of relative (dis)agreement categories. However, traditional models, despite addressing RS effects, assume that all respondents follow an identical response strategy, where the selection of relative (dis)agreement categories is influenced by the trait and ERS to the same degree for all respondents. Given that respondents may vary in the extent to which they adopt heuristic-driven strategies (e.g., fatigue, motivation, expertise), this assumption of homogeneous response processes is unlikely to be satisfied, potentially leading to inaccurate inferences. To accommodate different response strategies, we introduce the mixture IRTree model (MixTree). In MixTree, participants are assigned to different latent classes, each associated with distinct response processes. Based on their class memberships, varying weights are assigned to individuals’ trait and ERS scores. Additionally, MixTree simultaneously examines extraneous variables to explore sources of heterogeneity. A simulation study validates the MixTree’s performance in recovering classes and model parameters. Empirical data analysis identifies two latent classes, one linked to a trait-driven and the other to RS-driven mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Impersonal prosociality is considered a cornerstone of thriving civic societies and well-functioning institutions. Previous research has documented cross-societal variation in prosociality using monetary allocation tasks such as dictator games. Here we examined whether different societies may rely on distinct mechanisms—guilt and internalized norms versus shame and external reputation—to promote prosociality. We conducted a preregistered experiment with 7,978 participants across 20 culturally diverse countries. In dictator games, we manipulated guilt by varying information about the consequences of participants’ decisions, and shame by varying observability. We also used individual- and country-level measures of the importance of guilt over shame. We found robust evidence for guilt-driven prosociality and wilful ignorance across countries. Prosociality was higher when individuals received information than when they could avoid it. Furthermore, more guilt-prone individuals (but not countries) were more responsive to information. In contrast, observability by strangers had negligible effects on prosociality. Our findings highlight the importance of providing information about the negative consequences of individuals’ choices to encourage prosocial behaviour across cultural contexts.",
