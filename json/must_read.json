    "abstract": "Faced with offline discrimination, LGBTQIA+ users frequently turn to social media to find role models, build social networks and test out new forms of self-expression. Each platform has its own affordances and governance processes which can, in turn, facilitate or impede self-expression and community growth. Through a survey of 120 LGBTQIA+ participants, this paper considers which social media affordances facilitate the creation and development of LGBTQIA+ identities, support online and offline community formation and peer-to-peer learning, whilst limiting opportunities for online abuse. While previous research has so far largely focused on younger LGBTQIA+ users' experiences on SM, we found that broadening our sample to include older participants can lead to novel reflections on platforms' potential and/or challenges towards expressing one’s queerness online. For example, while users young and old found the visibility of other LGBTQIA+ accounts inspiring, entertaining and reassuring, particularly within previously stigmatised expressions of bisexuality, we found that older participants preferred to be selective about their outness, or sometimes to not be out at all, not simply for fear of harassment or context collapse, but also because of historical factors around family and friend relationships or because their identity experimentation had already happened offline. We also identified contrasting views about outness and the use and visibility of pronouns, reminding us that the online LGBTQIA+ community is not a monolith in its beliefs and practices, particularly when different life stages are considered."

    "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to develop a conceptual model for GET products that participate in brands’ online communities, based on social cognitive theory (SCT), with environmental factors, personal factors and behavioral factors being used to explore whether users of GET products participate in brand online communities as well as to determine whether participation in a community forum causes users to stick with GET products. In addition, expectancy confirmation is also considered in the research model. Design/methodology/approach This research examines whether environmental and personal factors have a positive effect on the behavioral factors of Gogoro users, and then further effects on green energy technology (GET) product stickiness for users in online communities. A website was used to distribute links to two Facebook club sites: Gogoro Series 2 Fan Club and the Gogoro Fan Club. The respondents’ qualification criteria were restricted to people who had used Gogoro products and participated in a Gogoro online community. A total of 581 valid responses were collected for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, and expectancy confirmation was found to be moderate from a hierarchical regression. Findings The results of SEM show that virtual interactivity has a positive effect on product-related content, and social norms were found to have significant effects on creating product-related content. Brand community identification, perceived relative advantage and brand knowledge self-efficacy are found to be related to both creating and contributing product-related content. Also, creating product-related content and contributing user participation behaviors influence ET product stickiness. Practical implications Online community managers can boost user participation by increasing interaction, and community identification by enhancing users’ perceptions of benefiting from participating in their communities. Companies can also encourage users to create product-related content to increase users’ stickiness to GET products. Further, GET companies can try to enhance users’ intrinsic connection with other community users to increase their brand community identification if they want to increase users’ willingness to participate. Originality/value This study adopted SCT to measure the GET product stickiness formation process in an attempt to determine what factors boost user participation based on triadic reciprocality. Also, expectancy confirmation plays an important role in the relationship between community users’ participation behaviors and GET product stickiness. The results indicated that it was appropriate to add virtual interactivity to environmental factors and perceived relative advantage to personal factors to measure users’ participation in an online social community. Actual product users’ online community participation behavior could be a very influential indicator of actual product stickiness formation."

    "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to enhance the understanding of team virtuality by exploring its impact on individual counterproductive knowledge behaviors, particularly knowledge hiding. It examines the mediating roles of cognitive and affective trust and the moderating influence of learning goal orientation, addressing a significant gap in understanding how virtual interactions affect knowledge management processes at the individual level. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a three-wave online survey with a matched sample of 274 employees who have virtual work experience in China. We performed a series of structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses using Mplus 8.3 to test our proposed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate a significantly positive association between perceived team virtuality and individual knowledge hiding, mediated by both cognition- and affect-based trust, with the latter showing a stronger mediation effect. Additionally, individual learning goal orientation negatively moderates the indirect relationship between perceived team virtuality and knowledge hiding via cognitive (affective) trust. Practical implications By understanding the mechanisms through which virtuality influences individual knowledge behaviors within teams, organizations can provide emotional and instructional support for virtual interactions to mitigate knowledge hiding and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge management. Originality/value This study offers a differentiated analysis by exploring the mediating roles of cognitive and affective trust and the moderating role of learning goal orientation within virtual environments. Previous research has not concurrently examined these variables within the framework of team virtuality and knowledge hiding, making this research pivotal in enhancing the theoretical and practical understanding of individual knowledge behaviors in virtual settings."

Based on the analysis of news in English, French, Italian, and Romanian, the study finds that much of the coverage across national and cultural boundaries translated marginalization, already exacerbated by the health crisis, through familiar lenses of blame and backwardness. Whereas anti-ethnic discrimination was primarily recognized in news reliant on official, governmental sources, news in French and Italian chiefly circulated representations of otherness. Romanian news revealed both systemic racism and community solutions, also filtered through a discriminatory lens. Translating justice- or equity-oriented content—directly or ideologically—appeared incomplete, infrequent, and often filtered through bias. The tool of local and regional translation emerged as central to the circulation of ideas across the continent."

    "abstract": "The practice of initiating conversations with “guess what” questions is common across various social settings. This study examines whether askers and guessers share similar desires for correct guesses during these interactions, a question previously unexplored in behavioral sciences. Across five studies, our research uncovered a significant discrepancy: Askers generally exhibited a lower desire for correct guesses compared to guessers. This pattern holds true across diverse social contexts. Moreover, the results of guesses impact the outcomes of conversations, with askers experiencing more enjoyment and being more willing to continue the conversation when guesses are incorrect, whereas guessers have the opposite experience. Further, while individuals may recognize this disparity, adopting a perspective-taking approach does not alter the guesser's desire to guess correctly; however, guessers do decrease that desire when reminded to protect the asker's emotions."

    "abstract": "This research investigates the crucial role of fact-checking organisations in promoting media and information literacy (MIL) amid the challenges of widespread misinformation. By educating and empowering individuals, these organisations and their educational branches are identified as emerging components within MIL ecosystems, particularly focusing on engaging youth. Using qualitative research methods, our study analyses the activities of seven prominent fact-checking organisations and two university-affiliated projects across Spain, Catalonia, Poland, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Argentina, and Brazil. Thus, our study aims to understand why fact-checking organisations have become involved in MIL education and training for youth and what types of MIL, approaches, and subjects fact-checking organisations employ in their MIL education and training initiatives for this audience. Our findings reveal a shift in these organisations toward actively promoting MIL education through dedicated divisions and teams driven by mission-oriented action and peer collaboration. Various institutions and political and educational policies support or hinder this transformation. A significant issue observed is the limited availability of open-access materials and general opacity regarding their pedagogical approaches. Although these organisations have integrated educational components into their models, achieving financial sustainability remains challenging."

We reveal how the studies included in this thematic issue of &lt;em&gt;Media and Communication &lt;/em&gt;contribute to this existing knowledge by providing an up-to-date account of how DDC in general, and political microtargeting in specific, have been employed in election campaigns between 2021 and 2023, in a range of countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the US. As a collection, these studies highlight the variance that exists in the degree to which DDC is practiced, the range of DDC tools used, and attitudes toward DDC. In recent election campaigns, DDC takes many forms, and disapproval of DDC varies depending on how it is implemented."

    "abstract": "Although modern data-driven campaigning (DDC) is not entirely new, scholars have typically relied on reports and interviews of practitioners to understand its use. However, the advent of public ad libraries from Meta and Google provides an opportunity to measure the scope and variation in DDC practice in advertising across different types of sponsors and within sponsors across platforms. Using textual and audiovisual processing, we create a database of ads from the 2022 US elections. These data allow us to create an index that quantifies the extent of DDC at the level of the sponsor and platform. This index takes into account both the number of unique creatives placed and the similarity across those creatives. In addition, we explore the impact of sponsor resources, the office being sought, and the competitiveness of the race on the measure of DDC sophistication. Ultimately, our research establishes a measurement strategy for DDC that can be applied across ad sponsors, campaigns, parties, and even countries. Understanding the extent of DDC is vital for policy discussions surrounding the regulation of microtargeting and data privacy."

    "abstract": "Much of the research on political microtargeting has focused on growing public concerns about its use in elections, fuelling calls for greater regulation or even a ban on the practice. We contend that a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes toward microtargeting is required before further regulation is considered. Drawing on advertising psychology research and the results of academic analyses into microtargeting, we argue that individual concern, and by corollary, acceptance of microtargeting will vary based on socio-demographic characteristics and political orientations, and the type of personal data used. We hypothesise that microtargeting that relies on observable or publicly accessible personal information will be more accepted by voters than that which uses unobserved and inferred traits. We test these expectations and the expected variance of public acceptance by individual characteristics using comparative survey data from the US, Germany, and the Netherlands. We find that across countries and socio-demographic groups, not all microtargeting is considered equally problematic. For example, whereas the use of age and gender is generally deemed acceptable, the use of sexual orientation is not, and right-leaning individuals are more accepting than those who lean left. Additionally, overall, the US is more accepting of microtargeting than Germany or the Netherlands. Thus, we find that not all microtargeting is considered equally problematic across countries and socio-demographic groups. We conclude by calling for a more contextualised debate about the benefits and costs of political microtargeting and its use of “sensitive” data before the expansion of current regulation."

However, there is a lack of evidence explaining how parties and supporters use data-driven campaigning techniques to organise their social media campaigning. Do user engagement metrics influence the choice of campaign themes by encouraging political parties to concentrate their communication on issues that are most liked, commented on, and shared? Our study focuses on the use of Facebook by French political parties and their supporters during the 2022 presidential election campaign. We conducted a supervised content analysis based on machine learning to examine their Facebook posts (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 17,060). Our results show that the issues prioritized by parties on Facebook may be different from those that are most prominent in their broader communications. In most cases, however, these themes are not chosen based on user engagement, even for parties that claim to have developed their base through digital channels. Instead, the choice of themes seems influenced by more traditional campaign strategies, such as the desire to capture the electorate of their closest rival. In our conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for the adoption of data-driven campaigning in digital election communication across Europe."

We explore the extent of data-driven practices adopted in Swedish political campaigns, and parties’ motivations to adopt them. Since this is a comparison of domestic parties, we test the importance of four party-level factors—resources, structure, attitudes toward data use, and ideology—using extensive interviews with key campaign managers in Sweden during the 2022 election year. Our results show that the differences among the eight parties studied are rather small, and that systemic factors are more important than party variables to explain the adoption of data-driven approaches. Zooming in on these finer differences we distinguish between top DDC adopters (Social Democrats, Center, and Conservatives) and a lower tier with lower levels of DDC implementation. To explain the differences between the two tiers, we find that economic resources are important, with richer parties being more advanced in DDC use. Party structure, attitudes to data, and ideology do not affect the likelihood of a Swedish party using data analytics in their strategic decision-making. Instead, we suggest party type (catch-all vs. niche) is a potentially more useful party-level factor in explaining variation."

In the US context, successful data-driven campaigning (DDC) has often been covered by the press and analyzed by US scholars as an innovative campaign creating new tools and new tactics (and earning more media coverage for them). This research investigates the oft-ignored role of party organizations in DDC in the US, and in doing so, highlights the invisible work of data maintenance that is their purview. Methodologically, it brings together interviews with staffers from both party organizations and campaigns with thematic analysis of news coverage to answer questions about how the data-driven practices of parties versus campaigns differ, how parties’ data work is (and is not) covered, and what, in staffers’ views, contributes to such coverage. Ultimately, this research highlights how a lack of attention to party organizations’ work has gone hand in hand with a lack of attention to maintenance work in both academic and public discussions of DDC."

Specifically, ADO underscores how social media platform affordances (e.g., algorithmic curation, shared group identity and culture, connectivity) shape movement visibility, resonance, and legitimacy, all of which can mobilize activism efforts. We further situate our discussion in the cross-platform context to explore both differences and interconnections between different platforms in facilitating digital activism. By analyzing 20,363,128 English posts related to the #MeToo movement from 2017 to 2020 on Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit using supervised machine learning and time series analysis, we reveal platform variations in affording discursive opportunities for visibility, resonance, and legitimacy, which shape activism efforts differently across platforms. We also find a unidirectional relationship from activism on Twitter and Reddit to activism on Facebook."

Privacy concerns tend to impede online political expression, but this relationship is still poorly understood. Based on the theory of reasoned action, this study focuses on the role of social influence and institutional privacy concerns in political expression on Facebook. We draw on research on the privacy calculus to examine how observing the behavior of Facebook friends moderates the relationship between privacy concerns and online political expression. We use survey data gathered in 2023 from Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States ( n = 5,936). Across all five countries, we find that observing Facebook friends posting political content bolsters political expression on Facebook, as per our preregistered analysis. In all countries except Germany, privacy concerns impede political expression on Facebook. Also, the importance of institutional privacy concerns for political expression depends on the observed posting behavior of Facebook friends. This moderated effect is only observed in three of the five examined countries, however. Our findings offer new insights into the factors that encourage and discourse political expression, particularly on Facebook which is a platform that has been widely criticized for failing to protect its users’ privacy."

However, its effectiveness on social media has not been fully verified. In this study, drawing on construal level theory, we use temporal distance—the time interval between a rumor-combating post being released and receiving responses from social media users—to measure the effectiveness of rumor-combating. We also adopt elaboration likelihood model to explore the factors that could enhance this effectiveness. The empirical results show that perceptible (central route) factors, including the author’s authoritative combating methods, media richness, and positive emotions, are negatively related to temporal distance and are more effective for enhancing rumor-combating effectiveness than imperceptible (peripheral route) factors, such as the author’s influence and activeness. In addition, media richness exerts positive moderating effects on the relationship between perceptible route factors and rumor-combating effectiveness, implying that with the help of images or videos, rumor-combating effectiveness improves. This study addresses the need to enhance the effectiveness of rumor-combating and has practical implications for combating rumors in the social media."

They may think that this is because their electronic devices are eavesdropping (i.e., e-eavesdropping). To gain insights into the scope and characteristics of conversation-related advertising and e-eavesdropping beliefs, we conducted a survey in the United States ( n = 300), the Netherlands ( n = 293), and Poland ( n = 293). These countries were chosen based on their differences in privacy regulations and history with state surveillance. We find that belief in conversation-related advertising is a widespread cross-country phenomenon, which is higher in the United States compared with European countries. In addition, between half and two-thirds of respondents believe e-eavesdropping is a likely explanation for it. We find that social media is a main contributing factor through which people hear about and most often see conversation-related advertising. Moreover, in response to such advertising, respondents experience more negative than positive affect. The results show that this is a prevalent and timely phenomenon that warrants more research. This carries implications for the (social) media industry and regulators, as it highlights the importance of transparency and (insufficient) individual understanding of data collection and processing."

Previous research suggests that privacy perceptions and practices vary across sociocultural contexts. This study examines public and institutional discourses on conversational AI privacy in the United States and China. Semantic network and discourse analyses of privacy-related discussions on Twitter and Weibo reveal divergent patterns. On Twitter, public discourse emphasizes privacy risks and concerns and advocates for systemic changes, while institutional discourse promotes individualistic approaches to privacy protection. Conversely, on Weibo, public discourse is less focused on privacy risks and more on the positive impacts of AI, aligning closely with institutional narratives. These variations are intertwined with the cultural, political, economic, and regulatory contexts of the two countries. Our study underscores the importance of multi-level analysis in comparative privacy research to provide a holistic view of privacy in various contexts."

Using computational and qualitative analysis techniques, 60 months of public Facebook posts and Google search data were analyzed to explore the scope, reach, and engagement with messages that reference Sanger and examine how injustice frames utilizing Sanger’s historical ties to eugenics are being used today to misinform and disinform on abortion and other issues. Injustice frames featuring Sanger were deployed to portray abortion as a method for Black genocide; vilify feminism as racist, anti-woman, and anti-motherhood; and depict the Black Lives Matter social justice movement and cancel culture as hypocritical. This analysis also captured a moment in time when Sanger’s legacy was being reconsidered by Planned Parenthood, the organization she founded, indicating that a long-sought-after reckoning with the racist roots of the early birth control movement in the United States may be underway—with both predictable and unpredictable rippling effects in disinformative spaces."

By adopting a phenomenological approach, the article demonstrates that migrants’ relationship with (dis)information is shaped by their conviction that each person has unique life experiences and a profoundly religious view of life and destiny. The article thus advocates for a deeper exploration of migrants’ sociocultural beliefs rather than focusing solely on issues such as information accuracy, accessibility, flows, and platforms when accounting for disinformation. In addition to valuable lessons for (dis)information studies, this approach could enrich communication interventions tailored to migrant communities in vulnerable conditions."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on a new trend in journalism, which we conceptualize as transnational citizen journalism. We argue that the diasporic and transnational production and consumption of alternative and counter-hegemonic information by nonprofessional individuals have sparked fresh imaginations and opened up new spaces for journalism, particularly in authoritarian contexts. We specifically examine several prominent transnational citizen journalism projects that played a significant role in the large-scale protests against China’s stringent Covid-zero policy in late 2022. Through a content analysis of the multimodal content posted on these projects’ Instagram accounts, and semistructured interviews with account creators, we argue that these transnational citizen journalism projects have built a solidarity infrastructure, connecting individuals and communities who share the value of challenging authoritarianism but come from different localities and backgrounds. Its foundation rests on the passion of diasporic creators for their native country, the engagement of a largely youthful audience with public affairs, and a global platform enabling transnational information flow. This network also extends to international communities opposing oppression in nations such as Iran and Russia."

    "abstract": "Research on fact-checking journalism has predominantly centered on Western countries, often overlooking how distinct political media systems in non-Western countries might influence its practices and effectiveness. This article addresses this gap by focusing on government-led fact-checking in China, referred to as “rumor-debunking,” and we argue that compared to the Western mode of fact-checking, rumor debunking differs significantly with its unique motives, targets, and outcomes within the context of an authoritarian regime. Employing content analysis (Study 1) and a conjoint experiment (Study 2), we empirically examined the characteristics and credibility perceptions of rumor-debunking messages on Chinese social media Weibo during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of Study 1 reveal that rumor-debunking efforts in China were primarily driven by government-affiliated accounts and mainly targeting ordinary citizens. Study 2 shows that message specificity mattered in that detailing the rumors being debunked, providing evidence for the debunking, and including punitive actions against rumormongers significantly enhanced perceived credibility among the Chinese public. Additionally, we found messages that received higher social endorsement—reflected by a greater number of reposts, comments, and likes—boosted credibility. However, the presence of “recommended comments,” which indicate that the account holders curated the user comments under their debunking messages, did not affect credibility. The social and political implications of rumor-debunking in authoritarian regimes were also discussed."

    "abstract": "Has the “big lie”—the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump—shaped citizens’ views of the legitimacy of other US elections? We argue that it has. Those who believe Trump’s claim, whom we call election skeptics, lack confidence in elections for two interrelated reasons. First, because they think 2020 was inaccurately and unfairly conducted, they think that other elections will suffer a similar fate, and hence think these elections are illegitimate even before any votes are cast. Second, while most voters think elections are less legitimate when their preferred candidate loses, this effect will be especially large for election skeptics, because voter fraud gives them a mechanism to explain their candidate’s loss. Using an original panel dataset spanning the 2020 and 2022 elections, we show strong support for these hypotheses. This has important implications for our elections, and their legitimacy, moving forward."

    "abstract": "Conjoint experiments offer a flexible way to elicit population preferences on complex decision tasks. We investigate whether we can improve respondents’ survey experience and, ultimately, choice quality by departing from the current recommendation of completely randomized conjoint attribute ordering. Such random ordering guarantees that potential bias from attribute order cancels out on average. However, in situations with many attributes, this may unnecessarily increase cognitive burden, as attributes belonging together conceptually are presented scattered across the choice table. Hence, we study experimentally whether purposeful ordering (“theoretically important” attributes first) or block randomized ordering (attributes belonging to the same theoretical concept displayed in randomized bundles) affects survey experience, response time, and choice itself, as compared to completely randomized ordering. Drawing on a complex preregistered choice design with nine attributes (N = 6,617), we find that ordering type affects neither self-reported survey experience, choice task timing, nor attribute weighting. Potentially, block randomization reduces cognitive burden for some subgroups. To our knowledge, we thereby provide the first systematic empirical evidence that ordering effects are likely of low relevance in conjoint choice experiments and that the trade-off between cognitive burden and ordering effects is minimal from the perspective of respondents, at least for our substantive application."
