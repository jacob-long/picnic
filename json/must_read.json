    "abstract": "Purpose Hedonic technology addiction is a prevalent unintended consequence that stems from the obsessive and compulsive pattern of hedonic technology use, yet its etiology remains unclear. Guided by dual-system theory, we developed a tripartite model that characterizes the behavioral impulsion system (BIS), behavioral habituation system (BHS), and behavioral regulation system (BRS) as the main drivers of hedonic technology addiction. Design/methodology/approach We validated the proposed tripartite model with two multiwave surveys involving two different samples and using two different hedonic technologies. The first study comprises 627 users of online games, whereas the second study includes 359 users of social networking sites. Findings The comparable results showed that the BIS, BHS, and BRS simultaneously determine hedonic technology addiction, yet do so in different ways. Additionally, the BRS significantly weakens the effects of the BIS and BHS on hedonic technology addiction. Practical implications Our empirical findings are potentially helpful for designing measures to help prevent hedonic technology addiction and protect users from the dark side of technology use. Specifically, online game stakeholders should employ information-enhancing policies to intervene in the formation of addicts’ impulsive urge and automatic habit through the reflexive system and capability-enhancing policies to enhance users’ self-regulation capability in the reflective system. Originality/value We believe that our tripartite model sheds light on how the three behavioral systems jointly affect hedonic technology addiction and uncovers the psychological etiology of the dark side of technology use."

    "abstract": "This contribution aims to better understand the level of and reasons for the trust U.S. television viewers place in the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) amidst what is often perceived as a general decline in trust in U.S. media and public institutions. Based on a nationwide survey of 1533 self-declared PBS viewers and rooted in theories of the conceptualization of organizational trust, our findings suggest that PBS viewers trust PBS along three vectors: institution-based trust (value for public dollars); characteristics-based trust (news and children’s programming); and process-based trust (nostalgia). This trust, notably for news and political programming, is shared by viewers across the political spectrum. We argue this unique multi-faceted foundation of trust, media, and politics can be the basis for a rehabilitated sense of trust in U.S. public institutions and can also be marshaled to justify the political sustainability and, even, amplification of U.S. public media."

This study, grounded in protection motivation theory, explored how scam prevention communication and victimization influence their information-seeking behaviors. Analyzing survey data from 521 migrant workers in China, findings showed that scam prevention communication increases perceived severity, encouraging information seeking, but has limited effects on other cognitive factors. Victimization reinforces victim-blaming beliefs and social stigma while lowering self-efficacy and discouraging proactive behaviors. Victimization also indirectly drives information seeking by increasing perceptions of information insufficiency. These findings emphasized the importance of anti-fraud campaigns that not only raise awareness but also address psychological barriers among vulnerable groups."

Yet, research lacks a comprehensive validated scale to reliably assess such attainability perceptions. Addressing this research gap, we developed the Perceptions of Media Role Models’ Attainability (PoMRA) scale and two short-form versions of this measure, which we tested and validated in three independent studies among youth ( N Total = 1,043, 16–25 years). We demonstrated a five-factor structure for the scale and established measurement invariance across gender and role model types."

    "abstract": "The introduction of the Digital Services Act (DSA) by the EU marks a fundamental step in the governance of social media platforms, by outlining content-moderation guidelines aimed at preventing disinformation and the systemic risks related to the “business of polarization” for the digital public sphere (Geese, 2023). According to others (Husovec, 2023b), DSA is an ambitious legal framework that must be tamed in consideration of the priorities of different stakeholders: platforms, legislators at the European and national level, journalists responding to the challenges of fact-checking, and citizens entitled to participate in a safe and non-discriminatory public sphere. Thanks to a critical approach (Van Dijck, 2021; Zuboff, 2019), the article discusses how platforms manage controversial political influencers: the ideological entrepreneurs. From the point of view of the empirical analysis, the essay identifies ambiguities in the DSA text that neither clarify the role of ideological entrepreneurs nor explicitly outline the concept of disinformation. Furthermore, a longitudinal analysis (18 months) of the content moderation measures implemented in compliance with the DSA and accessible thanks to the DSA Transparency Database, shows that social media platforms tend to privilege temporary measures such as accounts suspension, rather than more effective actions such as deplatforming (Van Dijck et al., 2023). This reflects ongoing tensions in the regulation of digital services, especially when balancing innovation in governance with the protection of the democratic information environment. As a result, the article highlights a double-standard policy adopted by platforms towards the influencers: On one side they actively contribute to feeding the flow of disinformation and fake news, but on the other hand, they enable platforms to generate visibility and traffic, thus reinforcing the “business of polarization” typical of surveillance capitalism."

    "abstract": "Current research on AI has extensively examined drivers that predict individuals’ attitudes and behavioral intentions toward AI use. Despite this, there is limited research that explores factors that influence consumers’ acceptance of AI integration into businesses. As more businesses have integrated AI systems into different aspects of their operations, consumers have experienced increasing interactions with AI systems adopted by businesses. Thus, it is critical to understand not only whether individuals trust and accept the use of AI in their everyday lives, but also whether they trust and accept the use of AI by businesses they interact with. As such, this study tests a theoretical framework developed on the basis of current research on AI and technology acceptance. This study used a survey dataset collected from a nationally representative sample of 420 Australian consumers in 2024. The findings revealed that the interplay between faith in general technology, trust and distrust in businesses' AI use, and perceived AI benefits shaped attitudes and behavioral intentions toward businesses using AI. These dynamics also contributed to the approval of businesses’ use of AI. The findings offer theoretical and practical insights on how to manage these dynamics to foster positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward businesses that use AI."

Consistent with prior, mostly US-focused research, we find that European tech-workers hold a liberal worldview, which values openness to change, individualism, and universalism and devalues conservatism. However, our findings challenge the notion of tech-workers as being a completely distinct or a homogeneous group in terms of their values. While developers appear to be substantively different from other occupations and non-developers working in tech, non-developers hold values similar to those of other occupational elites, such as professionals and managers. The study offers takeaways for research, policy, and education."

Through manual labeling and BERT (a pretrained large language model), we analyzed a cleaned dataset of 4,942 original fact-checking Weibo posts from 18 November 2010 to 31 May 2022, created or shared by Weibo Piyao. Results indicate that government posts or those with visual cues received fewer “likes” but garnered more supportive comments, while awareness prompts and legal warnings received more supportive comments across three misinformation types. This research provides valuable insights into the practice of fact-checking on social media, highlighting how different strategies may vary in their impact depending on the nature of the misinformation being addressed."

These individuals have repeatedly been labeled as opinion leaders, but often without in-depth theoretical reflection. We fill this gap by introducing a novel typology that allows for greater scrutiny in the identification of different types of opinion leaders in the modern media environment. Using this typology, we adequately capture—for the first time—opinion leadership as practiced by actors like SMIs, describing them as Proximal Mass Opinion Leaders (short: ProMOLs). We highlight that—despite their reach—ProMOLs exert a seemingly interpersonal and horizontal influence by engaging in personalized communication with opinion followers in self-built networks. Furthermore, we theoretically model the various flows of communication between ProMOLs, their communities, and other actors in the public sphere, thereby illustrating the multiple layers of ProMOLs’ impact. Finally, we discuss the model’s implications and suggest directions for future research."

A four-wave longitudinal survey was collected at 6-month intervals from Finnish adults ( N = 1530). Fixed-effects regression analyses were based on all available data across the four waves ( n = 4827 observations). Semi-structured interviews ( N = 18) included recovering problem gamblers. Quantitative analyses showed different forms of online gambling, participation in gambling communities online, and instant loans associated with increased problem gambling. Qualitative analyses revealed that gamblers were drawn to gambling sites through an online ecosystem including complex social and monetary incentive structures and sought instant loans through dedicated websites to continue gambling. Together, the results show that gamblers’ problems have deepened and become more multifaceted due to online environments. The online realm enables gambling through ubiquitous opportunity, targeted marketing, social influence, and access to gambling credit, although it also offers information and peer support groups to help gamblers abstain."

    "abstract": "Social media communication of government agencies should ideally be truthful and impartial to sustain public trust in government and support democratic goals. However, the politicization of agencies may harm the benefits that impartial and engaged communication brings. In this study, we provide a linguistic framework for analyzing how agency politicization is reflected in the language of government social media communication by asking: How does the agency (1) use speech acts (e.g., commands, requests), (2) talk about itself and others, (3) refer to statistical and scientific information, and (4) express positive and negative sentiment? We demonstrate the application of the framework by conducting a case study of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s messaging on Twitter across administrations with distinct ideological alignments between the agency and its top administrator. The analysis shows that (1) requests and statistical information were used substantially more under the administrator more aligned with the agency mission; (2) expressive speech acts were used more often during the administration less aligned with the agency mission; and (3) posts were generally positive but more so under the administration less aligned with the agency mission, possibly to counteract increased public criticism. We discuss the results in relation to theories of politicization and government communication, and the implications for citizens and public sector communicators using social media sites."

    "abstract": "Politicians on social media curate the flow of information their followers are exposed to, and they share news as a way to do so. Previous research has shown that they are strategic in their selection of news stories—they select specific news items and outlets to appeal to their online audiences. The reach of politicians’ news-sharing posts and their possible effects, are, however, influenced by the extent to which individual social media users engage with them. Combining comparative survey data ( N = 22,145) with Facebook posts ( N = 21,113) by 2,021 MPs in 15 European countries, this article zooms in on user engagement with politicians’ online news-sharing posts. Results show that, in general, news content and message cues can drive user engagement, and that news outlet characteristics do not. Nevertheless, the ideological closeness between a politician and the news outlet, which was found to predict politicians’ online news-sharing behavior, does positively influence reactions in media systems with high levels of political parallelism. These findings shed a new light on partisan selective exposure following politicians’ news recommendations in the digital information environment."

Some studies therefore use subsets of parties to create brief affective polarization measures. However, it is unclear how this affects the construct and predictive validity of these brief measures, potentially causing problematic inferences. Across 39 countries (), we demonstrate that brief measures that include ratings of only three to five parties can maintain acceptable validity, as illustrated by strong correlations with full measures and consistent associations with political correlates. The construct and predictive validity of brief measures are best when selecting a set of large, ideologically diverse parties. We provide specific recommendations for the effective measurement of affective polarization in different multiparty systems."

    "abstract": "Most theories of democracy assume that voters punish politicians who pursue unpopular policies. However, empirical evidence supporting this claim remains elusive, partly because politicians strategically avoid adopting unpopular stances. The 2020 US presidential election offers a unique opportunity to investigate this phenomenon. Incumbent President Donald Trump publicly embraced unpopular positions on Covid-19, arguably the campaign’s most critical issue. Using panel survey data, we find many Trump supporters disagreed with his Covid-19 stances and preferred more aggressive government action, yet most remained unaware that his policies conflicted with their views even by the campaign’s end. Among those who recognized this contradiction, few defected; instead, many followed Trump, adjusting their own views to match his positions. Although our statistical power to detect voter defections is limited—precisely because learning about his stance was uncommon—Trump’s unpopular positions may still have been decisive given the narrow election margin. Broadly, voters’ failure to perceive or acknowledge conflicts between their policy views and those of favored candidates constrains their ability to hold politicians accountable, highlighting a critical challenge for democratic accountability."

However, little is known about the interplay between such spontaneous normative influence processes within social networks and more formalized top‐down norms communicated by institutions (e.g., schools). To test this impact, we conducted a longitudinal four‐wave field experiment employing social network analysis among real groups. Students enrolled in Dutch and international psychology bachelor programs at a Dutch university were assigned to mentoring groups ( N = 288 across 50 groups in the last wave). As institutional interventions, they watched an online diversity training video (vs. not, between mentoring groups) at the beginning of data collection (T1) and attended a diversity and inclusion session (within‐participants) before T2. At each timepoint, participants reported attitudes toward outgroup members and friendships with students enrolled in the same program. We examined how peer norms (i.e., friends' intergroup attitudes) and institutional interventions shaped intergroup attitudes, finding that the video‐ and workshop‐based interventions improved intergroup attitudes. However, network analyses showed limited influence of friends' intergroup attitudes on individuals' own attitudes as well as limited interactive effects of the institutional interventions and network dynamics in affecting intergroup attitudes."

This study uses a MultiTrait MultiError approach to assess the data quality of issue questions by separating four sources of variation: trait, acquiescence, method, and random error. The questions generally achieved moderate data quality, with 76% on average representing valid variance. Random error made up the largest proportion of error (23%). Error due to method and acquiescence was small. We found that 5-point scales are generally better than 11-point scales, while answers by respondents with lower political sophistication achieved lower data quality. The findings indicate a need to focus on decreasing random error when studying issue positions."

    "abstract": "The emergence of smart devices, in particular mobile devices, has widened the potential types of data that can be collected in the social sciences. Given the fact that traditional surveys require more and more effort, new data sources collected via smart devices can potentially improve measurement of variables of interest and representation of the target population. New data sources also bring new challenges. New data sources, such as smartphone sensor data offer less control and coherence than traditional data such as administrative and survey data do, and are therefore often integrated either during, or after data collection. Respondents remain in control and help to resolve inconsistencies, missing data, or provide context. We discuss the consequences of hybrid data collection and methodology needed to reduce errors in smart surveys. Since quantification of the various types of errors is costly and time-consuming, we present a number of practical criteria. These criteria help evaluate whether hybrid data collection may have a positive business case and justify further investments in systems for data collection, data processing, and integration. We apply the criteria to three case studies: the measurement of mobility, consumption, and physical activities. Large-scale field experiments have been conducted for each of the case studies that allow us to evaluate the criteria."

    "abstract": "Systematic content analysis of messaging has been a staple method in the study of communication. While computer-assisted content analysis has been used in the field for three decades, advances in machine learning and crowd-based annotation combined with the ease of collecting volumes of text-based communication via social media have made the opportunities for classification of messages easier and faster. The greatest advancement yet might be in the form of general intelligence large language models (LLMs), which are ostensibly able to accurately and reliably classify messages by leveraging context to disambiguate meaning. It is unclear, however, how effective LLMs are in deploying the method of content analysis. In this study, we compare the classification of political candidate social media messages between trained annotators, crowd annotators, and large language models from Open AI accessed through the free Web (ChatGPT) and the paid API (GPT API) on five different categories of political communication commonly used in the literature. We find that crowd annotation generally had higher F1 scores than ChatGPT and an earlier version of the GPT API, although the newest version, GPT-4 API, demonstrated good performance as compared with the crowd and with ground truth data derived from trained student annotators. This study suggests the application of any LLM to an annotation task requires validation, and that freely available and older LLM models may not be effective for studying human communication."

    "abstract": "Information disorder (IDO) presents a persistent challenge to society, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding its dynamics beyond just merely detecting it. This study introduces a theory-driven framework that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning, utilizing the target-based emotion–stance analysis (TESA) approach to analyze emotion and stance dynamics within IDO content. Complementing TESA, interactive graph generation (IGG) is applied for scalable and interpretable qualitative analyses. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study leverages TESA for target-centric emotion and stance analysis, evaluating target-based classifiers on both human-annotated and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the study explores synthetic data generation using generative AI to enrich the analysis, applying IGG to map complex data interactions. The study also found that integrating synthetic data developed from human annotations enhanced model performance, particularly for emotion classification tasks. Results demonstrate that IDO narratives significantly differ from non-IDO narratives, frequently leveraging negative emotions such as anger and disgust to manipulate public perception. TESA proved effective in capturing these nuanced variations, while IGG facilitated the triangulation of such findings via the scalable interpretation of emotional narratives, revealing that IDO content often amplifies polarizing and antagonistic perspectives. By combining TESA and IGG, this research emphasizes the importance of using NLP to extract and examine the emotional and stance nuances toward targets of interest within IDO context. This approach not only deepens theoretical insights into IDO’s persuasive mechanisms but also supports the development of practical tools for analyzing and managing the influence of IDO on public discourse."

    "abstract": "Despite its importance to society and many decades of research, key questions about the social and psychological processes of political persuasion remain unanswered, often due to data limitations. We propose that AI tools, specifically generative large language models (LLMs), can be used to address these limitations, offering important advantages in the study of political persuasion. In two preregistered online survey experiments, we demonstrate the potential of generative AI as a tool to study persuasion and provide important insights about the psychological and communicative processes that lead to increased persuasion. Specifically, we test the effects of four AI-generated counterattitudinal persuasive strategies, designed to test the effectiveness of messages that include customization (writing messages based on a receiver’s personal traits and beliefs), and elaboration (increased psychological engagement with the argument through interaction). We find that all four types of persuasive AI produce significant attitude change relative to the control and shift vote support for candidates espousing views consistent with the treatments. However, we do not find evidence that message customization via microtargeting or cognitive elaboration through interaction with the AI have much more persuasive effect than a single generic message. These findings have implications for different theories of persuasion, which we discuss. Finally, we find that although persuasive messages are able to moderate some people’s attitudes, they have inconsistent and weaker effects on the democratic reciprocity people grant to their political opponents. This suggests that attitude moderation (ideological depolarization) does not necessarily lead to increased democratic tolerance or decreased affective polarization."
