    "abstract": "The study investigates which democracy dimensions impact the share of (foreign) media followers of European governments’ Twitter social media accounts. To achieve this target, a network analysis and a data-linking strategy are relied upon to conduct three multilevel regression models. The first model reveals that while overall government media attention is positively associated with gross domestic product and internet penetration, it is negatively associated with higher levels of deliberative democracy. The second model, which focuses specifically on the share of foreign media followers, finds that individual-level factors are the primary predictors of foreign media attention. The third model explores the country context of media followers and indicates that government accounts benefit from followers in countries with higher democratic standards and greater media freedom, though there are negative associations with certain democratic dimensions such as liberal and participative democracy. Additionally, ministers and ministries consistently have a higher proportion of foreign media followers compared to heads of state. These findings are discussed in light of the literature on Twitter's role in media attention and gatekeeping theory."

    "abstract": "This essay reports three projects that integrate linguistic features of speaking turns into the identification of conversational motifs, which are multiturn segments of dialog within interpersonal interactions. Study 1 focused on support for bereavement, used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count data to augment characterizations of speaking turns based on speech act, and identified seven 5-turn conversational motifs. Study 2 examined serial argument conversations, used ratings of features and word count to differentiate speaking turns, and identified four conversational motifs within 1-minute segments of interaction. Study 3 analyzed conversations about public health campaign messages, considered functional and structural features of speaking turns, and identified four 4-turn conversational motifs. By elaborating the library of linguistic elements considered when operationalizing speaking turn types and showcasing alternative strategies for identifying conversation motifs, this essay extends recent advancements in a dynamic dyadic systems perspective on interpersonal communication."

    "abstract": "Detecting deception in interpersonal communication is a pivotal issue in social psychology, with significant implications for court and criminal proceedings. In this study, four experiments were designed to compare the performance of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and human judges in detecting deception from linguistic cues in a dataset of 62 transcriptions of video-taped interviews (32 genuine and 30 deceptive). The results showed that machine-learning algorithms significantly outperform naïve (accuracy = 54.7%) and expert judges (accuracy = 59.4%) when trained on features from the reality monitoring (RM) and cognitive load frameworks (accuracy = 69.4%) or on features automatically extracted through NLP techniques (accuracy = 77.3%) but not when trained on the RM criteria alone. This evidence suggests that NLP algorithms, due to their ability to handle complex patterns of linguistic data, might be useful for better disentangling truthful from deceptive narratives, outperforming traditional theoretical models."

    "abstract": "Abstract: While substantial studies focus on risk and negative factors for problematic video gaming, the present study paid attention to protective and positive factors that lead to healthy gaming practice. Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), the present study investigated whether psychological needs satisfaction may facilitate players’ adherence to protective gaming beliefs and behaviors. With a survey among 737 video game players, Study 1 observed a positive association between psychological needs satisfaction and protective gaming beliefs and behaviors. Study 2 used the positive writing technique to promote players’ psychological needs satisfaction, and the players with enhanced autonomy and competence need satisfaction showed a higher adherence to protective gaming beliefs and behaviors. The findings imply that players’ autonomous motivation and self-perceived competence can play a role in healthy gaming practice. SDT-based healthy gaming strategies may help to develop practical and sustainable programs for containing problematic gaming and promoting players’ health and well-being."

    "abstract": "Abstract: Trust in news media (TNM) has continued declining in some countries (e.g., US) while remaining stable or even increasing in others (e.g., China). Scholars are interested in understanding what factors contribute to these differences. A reliable and equivalent measurement is essential for cross-national comparisons of TNM. However, there is currently no instrument available to measure generalized TNM in China. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Generalized Trust in News Media Scale (GTNMS) in China. The study sample comprised 578 participants, including 347 females (60.0%) and 231 males (40.0%). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), bifactor-CFA, and bifactor Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling (bifactor-ESEM) were adopted to examine the construct validity of the Chinese version of GTNMS. Measurement invariance (MI) and predictive validity of the Chinese version of GTNMS were also examined. The results revealed that the Chinese adaptation of GTNMS demonstrated optimal representation through a bifactor-ESEM, comprising a global factor (G-factor) and four specific factors (S-factors). Both the G-factor and S-factors showed acceptable internal consistency reliability. However, the S-factors retained a lower level of specificity after controlling for the G-factor, which indicated that the GTNMS was essentially unidimensional. The results from the Structural Equation Modelling analysis also revealed that only the G-factor could predict individuals’ news avoidance. In addition, MI of the GTNMS was established across participants using official and commercial media. Overall, the GTNMS is a reliable tool for measuring generalized TNM in China."

This is a centrally important construct in relationship science, with a robust literature indicating that individuals who perceive higher levels of responsiveness from their partner experiencing better relationship outcomes. Despite the large role that this construct plays in relationship science and our understanding of healthy relationship functioning, there is no measure adapted to Spanish language and culture. This study presents the 16-item and 8-item versions of the recently developed and psychometrically improved Perceived Responsiveness and Insensitivity Scale (PRIS; Crasta et al., 2021) that has been adapted to Spanish. Using a sample of 493 Spanish individuals, results demonstrate that this adapted scale exhibits adequate reliability, maintains the same internal structure as the original English version, demonstrates gender invariance, and presents adequate validity evidence when is associated to other variables. Adding the Spanish Adaptation of the PRIS (PRIS-SA) to the methodological toolkit of relationship scientists will allow this important construct to be examined in a cross-cultural fashion and among a diverse array of couples."

    "abstract": "Interracial relationships have been on the rise and face unique relational challenges but are underrepresented in relationship science which has relied heavily on studies of same-race White couples. Existing research has shown that individuals in interracial relationships experience greater jealousy than those in same-race relationships, but these studies were underpowered or relied on binary measures of jealousy. In a large sample of individuals in interracial ( N = 196) and same-race relationships ( N = 198) from the United States and Canada, we found that individuals in interracial relationships reported experiencing jealousy more frequently and intensely (general jealousy), had greater worries about potential romantic rivals (rival-directed cognitive jealousy), and felt more distrust and anger toward rivals (rival-directed emotional jealousy). However, there were no differences in the extent to which they derogated the rival and displayed their relationship in front of the rival (rival-directed behavioral jealousy), and the findings for general and cognitive jealousy became nonsignificant when controlling for attachment anxiety. Finally, having a stronger couple identity attenuated the negative effects of having higher general jealousy and cognitive jealousy on relationship satisfaction for individuals in interracial (but not same-race) relationships. Future research should explore the development of attachment anxiety in interracial relationships and explore strategies in addition to having a stronger couple identity that can help interracial couples navigate third-party threats more effectively."

Further, friends’ perceptions of whether someone is ready might constrain the opportunities afforded to individuals, and these perceptions may be shaped by how people navigate a romantic relationship, namely, attachment orientation. Hence, we examined the overlap of self and other perceptions of commitment readiness and whether those perceived as insecurely attached were also perceived as not ready for commitment. Persons in groups ( N = 193) consisting of four friends each ( N = 772) rated themselves and their friends on commitment readiness and attachment orientations. Using a bivariate social relations model, we found strong self-other agreement on commitment readiness. We also found that people perceived as higher in attachment avoidance and anxiety were seen as not as ready for commitment. Finally, people’s judgments of their own commitment readiness were associated with how they judged their friends’ commitment readiness (i.e., assumed similarity). Implications about the consequences of interpersonal judgments among friends are discussed."

    "abstract": "The legitimacy of journalism as a truth-teller has become contested during the era of digitalisation and newly emerging platforms. Recently, the epistemic authority of legacy journalism has been challenged by right-wing podcasting. This article explores metajournalistic discussions on the identity of legacy journalism as a truth-oriented practice and institution in six Finnish podcasts published independently outside legacy media on YouTube. This metajournalistic discourse of truth is identified through topic modelling in 229 podcast episodes, of which 119 are scrutinised using qualitative discourse analysis. The discursive articulations in the YouTube podcast episodes are assessed in the light of realist and antirealist philosophies as well as epistemic theories of journalistic truth structured by critical realist and pragmatist philosophies. The results show that the epistemic authority of legacy journalism is challenged through three interconnected themes through which legacy journalism is articulated as an antirealist practice and institution. By contrast, YouTube podcasting is framed as a platform for a balanced, authentic, and uncut talk that realises the epistemic ideals of journalism. The challenges to the epistemic authority of legacy journalism presented by the Finnish YouTube podcasts are also similar to those identified in previous research on right-wing podcasting and online counter-media. The findings point to the need for legacy journalists and podcasting practitioners to adopt more nuanced and context-bound understandings of journalistic knowledge and truth structured by critical realist and pragmatist philosophies."

However, despite this reputation, data on actual consumption patterns remains scarce, enabling Netflix to shape the narrative about how content is consumed on its platform and what this implies about content quality and viewer attentiveness. This article provides unique empirical insights into Netflix viewing patterns in the Netherlands, based on a pilot study involving data donated by 126 subscribers. It introduces a definition of binge-watching tailored for computational analysis and offers an empirical understanding of its prevalence and manifestations. The findings suggest that binge-watching is a diverse and complex activity. While it is seemingly popular, in that it is practiced by many subscribers, the data suggest it occurs less frequently and is less extreme than would be expected from the hype."

    "abstract": "Given the number of identified risks associated with influencer sharenting, momfluencers are increasingly adopting a more mindful approach to sharing information about their children online. Prior qualitative research suggests that followers respond positively towards these mindful sharenting practices, especially when motives are communicated. However, there is a lack of experimental exploration into this finding and its potential explanations. Therefore, drawing upon theoretical insights regarding self-disclosure and self-determination theory, this experimental study with 176 mothers seeks to investigate the impact of momfluencers providing an explanation regarding mindful sharenting practices, proposing the need for relatedness and empathy as mediators. The findings reveal that when momfluencers disclose their motives, this significantly enhances follower engagement, admiration, and evaluation of the momfluencer. This effect is fully explained by empathy, and partly by the need for relatedness. This study emphasizes the importance of transparency and provides momfluencers strategies to balance privacy protection and the benefits of influencer sharenting."

EA has mostly been studied in adult populations; variations in EA in children/adolescents could be explained by age, developmental changes during childhood, and environmental factors. A systematic review was conducted to synthesize the existing literature on EA in childhood, adolescence, and during parent–child interactions. Following PRISMA guidelines, five electronic databases were searched, yielding 24 references. Most studies were conducted in samples of adolescents. Additionally, the operationalization of EA varied across studies. Although studies showed minor variations of EA with age, there is no clear association of age with EA during childhood. Children and adolescents also achieve similar scores as adults. Additionally, children's and parents' EAs are linked to parents' and children's behaviors during interactions. EA is also associated with gender beliefs: parents and children hold beliefs that girls and mothers should have higher empathy than boys and fathers. It is not possible to determine age variation in EA during childhood. This systematic review highlights a lack of transparent methodologies and specific assessments of EA in children and adolescents in the current literature."

Study 1 (1) compared demographically matched premaritally pregnant and nonpregnant couples on partners' recalled courtship trajectories of commitment to marriage and milestone occurrence (e.g., first sex, feeling love) and marital outcomes (satisfaction and disillusionment); (2) examined how partners' commitment‐trajectory similarity was linked to their milestone attainment and marital outcomes; and (3) investigated how familism relates to premarital pregnancy and relationship progression. Using a predominantly Hispanic local sample, we compared 47 premaritally pregnant and 47 demographically matched nonpregnant newlywed couples on mean levels of key variables and on correlations among them. Pregnant and nonpregnant couples exhibited similar timing and correlates of milestone attainment. Partners' commitment‐trajectory similarity was more important for reaching milestones than was premarital pregnancy. Study 2 addressed Study 1's potential selection bias for highly stable couples (because all eventually married) by including only cohabiting couples from a national dataset. Findings likewise showed little difference in relationship quality between cohabiters with and without young children. Hence, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should consider premaritally pregnant couples' full context of their romantic relationship rather than the pregnancy alone."

    "abstract": "The discourse on scientists’ involvement in climate advocacy has intensified, with a growing number participating in civil disobedience. This trend has sparked criticism within the academic community. We conducted 47 interviews with climate scientists about the fundamental concerns that underpin their arguments. Scientists worry that advocacy may compromise scientific impartiality and invite allegations of biased science and abuse of authority. Despite this, some scientists view informing and warning the public as their duty and as an act of defending science’s credibility. Concerns about independence and the role of scientists in society exist at both ends of the debate, underscoring the challenging landscape scientists currently navigate. While this article does not comment on the acceptability of advocacy, we propose that scientists engage in discussions about their duties and delineate the types of values deemed acceptable for incorporation in science communication about climate change."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to advance health care, industrial productivity, and environmental sustainability but also presents risks such as job loss and uncontrolled superintelligent machines. Understanding public opinion about AI is key for anticipating its governance. This study examines how media framing affects U.S. beliefs about AI and support for its development. A survey experiment involved respondents reading articles highlighting either AI’s benefits or risks, revealing how such information can influence opinion on AI’s societal impacts. The findings emphasize the crucial role of framing in shaping public views on AI, with implications for policymakers and stakeholders."

    "abstract": "In the era of ubiquitous mobile internet, Chinese youth are engaging in dual pursuits of knowledge and employment through various social media platforms, showcasing unique social media practices. Via semi-structured interviews with 14 platform-swinging youth and NVivo12-assisted three-tier qualitative analysis, this study reveals the psychological mechanisms behind their “wandering” behavior. Spontaneous engagement, fulfillment of needs, resonance with peers, preservation of meaning, self-management, and intermittent swinging characterize youth’s complex wandering online activities. It further explores new dimensions of youths’ media practices, emphasizing subjective expression, identity reconstruction, boundary clarification, and visibility control. Moreover, wandering youth also encounter challenges like context collapse, losing their true selves, and self-pulling, which raises a critical question: Where will they wander?"
