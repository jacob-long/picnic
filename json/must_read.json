    "abstract": "Research on screen usage frequently relies on broad measures of “screen time,” which fail to differentiate between various types of activities and their effects. To clarify how digital behavior is defined, we conducted a rapid review and methodological mapping of 36 screen use measurement tools. Three independent coders applied a piloted framework to classify measurement constructs, data collection modality (objective logs, self-, or proxy-report), temporal specificity, framing valence, opportunity cost, dyadic/social context, developmental focus, and evidence of reliability and validity. Interrater agreement was high (Fleiss’ Kappa; Gwet’s AC1). Most instruments used negatively framed item content, emphasizing impairment, dysregulation, or loss of control, focused on adolescents and young adults, and lacked precision in temporal anchoring. Very few assessed opportunity costs, dyadic use, or included validation against device-logged data. No measure emphasized positive or beneficial aspects of screen engagement. These gaps suggest a need for more conceptually balanced tools that integrate objective tracking with context-sensitive self-report items across the lifespan. We propose a blueprint for future development: improve temporal anchoring (e.g., within-day, weekday vs. weekend), broaden age inclusion, assess social and functional context, and report both reliability and validation against behavioral data. Strengthening measurement will advance efforts to identify when, how, and for whom digital behavior supports or undermines well-being."

    "abstract": "Scholars have worried that messages about racial equity can produce backlash from White respondents. Drawing upon psychological reactance theory, we compared cognitive and affective responses to a message emphasizing how a redistributive policy would benefit everyone (universalist message) to a message that also emphasized how the policy would especially benefit minoritized racial groups (targeted universalist message) among a sample of 871 White Americans. Participants in the targeted universalist condition experienced more anger, endorsed more harmful stereotypes about racial outgroups, and saw the government as less responsible for addressing poverty than participants in the universalist condition. Mediation analyses suggest that anger, stereotyping, and perceived government responsibility have a negative, indirect effect on policy support. Our findings underscore the need for future work to identify strategies for communicating about racial equity that avoid activating harmful stereotypes."

Using dynamic structural equation modeling with random effects, we found that for the typical partner: (a) on days when they ruminated more about their relationship than usual, they experienced greater than usual relational turbulence; and (b) when partners experienced more than typical turbulence on a day, the next day they ruminated more than usual. We found that partners who had higher (c) month-long averages in rumination, (d) ruminative inertia, and (e) ruminative volatility had higher averages in month-long relational turbulence. We also found that individual differences in partners’ relationship uncertainty predicted person-specific daily rumination (means, volatility) and relational turbulence (means, inertia, volatility), but only relational turbulence averages, in turn, predicted future collaborative planning."

Inspired by the marketing concept of the choice set, we conducted two experiments in the US (N1 = 731; N2 = 396) to examine how choice set size (number of articles presented at a time) and composition (ratio of supportive “pro” to opposing “anti” articles) affect news exposure, attitudes, and intentions. Smaller choice sets with fewer articles led individuals to select fewer articles overall and fewer cross-cutting articles that challenged preexisting attitudes. Choice set composition did not affect whether individuals engaged with articles or their overall news exposure, but it shaped which articles they chose: the selection and browsing of cross-cutting news differed notably between homogeneous (all pro or all anti) and mixed sets. Neither choice set size nor composition systematically affected attitudes or behavioral intentions in the short term."

Drawing on Hallin’s sphere model and Egelhofer et al.’s coding categories, it uses manual content analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling to identify rhetorical functions and patterns. Findings show that the term “fake news” functions mainly as a weaponized label to delegitimize opponents rather than describe misinformation. The results show how alternative media redraw boundaries between consensus, controversy, and deviance, underscoring their role in intensifying partisan discourse and redefining political communication."

This article reflects on human communication research which has leveraged the screenshot feature. In doing so, I focus on bystanders , or non-consenting participants whose data are implicated by researchers’ use of the screenshot feature. Considering relevant US law, internationally recognized ethics frameworks, and user expectations across digital platforms from which screenshots are collected, this article offers guidelines for researchers and policymakers about usage of and building formal restrictions around the screenshot feature, respectively. I argue usage of the screenshot feature in human communication research must (1) obscure sensitive and extraneous participant data, (2) recognize platform-specific user expectations, and (3) protect bystander privacy."

US participants ( N = 262) assigned to avatars displaying a stranger’s face, rather than their own, showed greater acceptance of outgroup virtual humans. Perceived identifiability mediated the influence of avatar face on self-other overlap. Social dominance orientation moderated this effect, as mediation was strongest among individuals with average and high scores. Positive contact enhanced self-other overlap with virtual humans, whereas negative contact unexpectedly increased empathy for outgroup members. Ingroup negative contact boosted positive ingroup feelings among participants using avatars that mirrored their own face. Consistent with positive ingroup biases, individuals reported greater positive feelings and empathy toward ingroup members following ingroup (vs outgroup) interactions. The results provided evidence regarding the theoretical mechanisms through which VR contact reduces and boosts prejudice."

This study addresses these gaps by conducting a systematic content analysis of far-right content on VK (VKontakte), the most widely used Russian social network, to examine the content’s characteristics that facilitate the mainstreaming of the far right. Findings indicate that far-right actors leverage agenda-setting mechanisms and adopt news-like formats to embed xenophobic and exclusionary narratives within the broader mainstream Russian discourse. This study contributes to research on far-right content-related strategies and the interplay between non-Western contexts, digital affordances, and far-right communication in less regulated online spaces."

Against this background, we rely on a pre-registered experimental study in the United States ( N = 982) in which we exposed participants to various modes of textual and visual disinformation on two different issues: The disappearance of flight MH370 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Findings show that, for MH370, there was no difference in credibility between textual, AI-generated, or video-based disinformation. Yet, for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, video-based disinformation was perceived as more credible than textual or image-based disinformation. Our findings indicate that the consequences of visual disinformation are context-bound: Especially in the case of polarizing issues, the out-of-context placement of videos can serve as a plausible form of deceptive evidence."

An online questionnaire was administered to 595 Italian and Dutch PNAs users to detect their PNAs community-related use, frequency of face-to-face encounters with other users, local social capital, active involvement, and SoC. A multiple mediation model was run using structural equation modeling. PNAs use associates to face-to-face encounters among local community members and community social capital, but not to community involvement. Through social capital, PNAs use indirectly enhances SoC. These results show that PNAs community-related use may enhance local community experiences through prompting face-to-face encounters among community fellows and making users feel more embedded into local social networks. This confirms PNAs community-related use potential to improve users’ neighborhood social and community experiences."

In order to fill this gap, we present in this article a case study of the 250 most active commenters on RT German’s Facebook page in a 6-month period at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Using a mixed-methods approach combining large-scale data scraping with quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we find that the majority of these highly active commenters constituted an anti-democratic counterpublic. However, we also observed a smaller collective of commenters, whom we theorize as “disruptive public” as they vigorously sought to challenge the activities of the anti-democratic counterpublic. We discuss the benefits and risks of various strategies of disrupting anti-democratic counterpublics and consequences for democratic debate."

Through quantitative analysis of over 200,000 Tumblr posts and qualitative coding of about 2350 Tumblr posts, we did not find evidence of an explicit radicalization. We found that problematic Tradwife posts found in the literature may be confined to Tradwife-only spaces, while content in the Cottagecore tag generally did not warrant extra moderation. However, we did find evidence of a mainstreaming effect in the overlap between the Tradwife and Cottagecore communities. In our qualitative analysis, there was more interaction between queer and Tradwife identities than expected based on the literature, and some Tradwives even explicitly included queer people and disavowed racism in the Tradwife community on Tumblr. This could be genuine, but we propose that this is an example of mainstreaming, where white supremacists re-brand their content and follow platform norms to spread ideologies that would otherwise be rejected. In addition, through temporal analysis, we observed a change in the central tags used by Tradwives in the Cottagecore tag pre- and post-2021. Initially, these posts focused on aesthetics and hobbies like baking and gardening, but post-2021, the central tags focused more on religion, traditional gender roles, and homemaking—all of which align with white supremacist rhetoric about womanhood."

Mukerjee et al. examined this phenomenon empirically by estimating the extent to which media outlets respond to audience engagement signals on Facebook in deciding what news to publish on the platform. However, the extent to which their findings can be generalized to other social media platforms remains unknown. We replicate their study on Twitter using the same methodological pipeline ( N ≈ 4 . 55 million posts, twenty-eight media outlets, between 2015 and 2019). Our results indicate that media responsiveness to audience engagement on Twitter aligns with the core patterns identified in the Facebook study. Specifically, topics receiving higher audience engagement generally experience significantly increased coverage shortly thereafter, and the responsiveness is not conditioned on the nature of topics. However, we observe three differences in dynamics on Twitter compared to Facebook: first, the maximum response window on Twitter is shorter; second, conservative outlets on Twitter are not more likely to respond to engagement signals; third, platform-specific metrics (e.g., retweets) show different patterns of responsiveness. Our replication thus highlights the generalizability of the original study while underscoring the importance of platform-specific characteristics in shaping media production on social media."

Previous studies have highlighted the strong zero-shot classification performance of large language models (LLMs), offering a potential tool to efficiently identify harmful content. Yet for complex and ambivalent tasks like hate speech detection, pre-trained LLMs can be insufficient and carry systemic biases. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for the given task and empirical context could help address these issues, but, as we demonstrate, the quality of data used for fine-tuning decisively matters. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini using a unique corpus of online comments annotated by diverse groups of coders with varying annotation quality: research assistants, activists, two kinds of crowd workers, and citizen scientists. We find that only annotations from those groups of annotators that are better than zero-shot GPT-4o-mini in recognizing hate speech improve the classification performance of the fine-tuned LLM. Specifically, fine-tuning using the highest-quality annotator group – trained research assistants – boosts classification performance by increasing the model’s precision without notably sacrificing the good recall of zero-shot GPT-4o-mini. In contrast, lower-quality annotations do not improve and may even decrease the ability to identify hate speech. By examining tasks reliant on human judgment and context, we offer insights that go beyond hate speech detection."

We base our study on large‐n representative survey data from Denmark ( N = 1048) and the United States ( N = 1046), including the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) battery of questions. We observe strong cross‐country similarities that adjusting positively correlates with trust, while concealing negatively correlates with trust. We furthermore show that affective style contributes novel explanatory power beyond personality traits. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the role of emotions in politics, providing salient insights into individual ways of processing and responding to emotions and how that impacts politically salient outcome variables like trust."

In recent years, scholars have begun using such terms in dynamic regression models with time series data. However, the lack of guidance on adding multiplicative interactions to these workhorse models exposes problems with the consistency of the estimator, model restrictions, and interpretation. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidance to address these problems. First, we define the conditions under which scholars can ensure consistent estimates when estimating relationships conditioned by a moderating variable in dynamic models. Second, we introduce a general model that makes no theoretical assumptions about precisely how conditional relationships unfold over time. Third, we develop a flexible approach for interpreting such models. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework with simulation evidence and an empirical application."

In-person deep canvassing is the gold standard for durably changing attitudes on polarizing topics. However, door-to-door canvassing is costly, and many populations may not be feasibly reached in this manner. Campaigns are already conducting outreach using digital tools, including text messages and social media. If appropriately trained agents messaging over social media can achieve a fraction of the effect of in-person canvassing, canvassing may be scaled up to achieve large overall impacts at lower costs. Scripts used in this application are based on those used by transgender allies in the original study. To personalize messaging, the conversational agent uses natural language processing to detect conversational topics, and shares relevant pre-scripted messages of information and third-person experiences, encouraging respondents to engage in perspective-taking with respect to an outgroup. This study demonstrates the potential of automated social media messaging for deep canvassing, with possible applications by governments, public health agencies, and political organizations. Estimated effects are positive and significant under covariate adjustment and reweighting; due to important differential attrition, partial-identification bounds are also reported and include zero."

    "abstract": "How widespread is sexual liberalism in tolerant societies? Theoretical and descriptive evidence suggests an overall liberalization in societal views on topics such as women’s rights and homosexuality. Yet, relying on sexual norms theory, this study unveils persistent sexual prejudice. We differentiate between “normalized” sexual issues, like same-gender marriage, which have gained mainstream acceptance, and “nonnormalized” issues, such as nontraditional sexual practices and relationships, which remain stigmatized. Through a conjoint experiment in Catalonia, Spain, we investigate public attitudes toward adoptive parents with varying sexual orientations, relationship types, and age differences, confirming that discriminatory preferences are prevalent in contexts with low social desirability. By highlighting the continued prejudice against both normative and nonnormative sexual issues, this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of sexual attitudes and the challenges facing LGBTQ+ politics and rights."

    "abstract": "The planning of sample size for research studies often focuses on obtaining a significant result given a specified level of power, significance, and an anticipated effect size. This planning requires prior knowledge of the study design and a statistical analysis to calculate the proposed sample size. However, there may not be one specific testable analysis from which to derive power (Silberzahn et al., Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science , 1 (3), 337356, 2018) or a hypothesis to test for the project (e.g., creation of a stimuli database). Modern power and sample size planning suggestions include accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE, Kelley, Behavior Research Methods , 39 (4), 755–766, 2007; Maxell et al., Annual Review of Psychology , 59 , 537–563, 2008) and simulation of proposed analyses (Chalmers &amp; Adkins, The Quantitative Methods for Psychology , 16 (4), 248–280, 2020). These toolkits offer flexibility in traditional power analyses that focus on the if-this, then-that approach. However, both AIPE and simulation require either a specific parameter (e.g., mean, effect size, etc.) or a statistical test for planning sample size. In this tutorial, we explore how AIPE and simulation approaches can be combined to accommodate studies that may not have a specific hypothesis test or wish to account for the potential of a multiverse of analyses. Specifically, we focus on studies that use multiple items and suggest that sample sizes can be planned to measure those items adequately and precisely, regardless of the statistical test. This tutorial also provides multiple code vignettes and package functionality that researchers can adapt and apply to their own measures."

    "abstract": "Following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election of Donald Trump, prejudice toward groups targeted during his campaign (e.g., Asian Americans, Mexicans) become more acceptable. By contrast, both Trump and Clinton voters reported less prejudice of their own. We conducted a 2024 conceptual replication, measuring perceived norms of prejudice and own-prejudice toward 128 groups, both before ( N = 362) and after ( N = 261) the U.S. election. We separately measured the negativity of Trump’s campaign rhetoric toward these groups ( N = 188). Levels of prejudice and perceived norms of prejudice acceptability were mostly stable pre-/post-election, but Trump’s negative rhetoric predicted an increase in perceived acceptability of prejudice among targeted groups (replicating the 2016 results), and a rise in self-reported prejudice in the same groups post-election (reversing the 2016 results). Despite changes in the sociopolitical context between elections, the election of a leading politician who campaigned on prejudice was again associated with increases in the acceptability of prejudice."

    "abstract": "AI is expected to reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Large-scale survey data ( N = 37,079; 38 European countries) indicate that the public tends to view AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for technology-related, political, and sociodemographic factors, these data further show that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Two preregistered, nationally representative experiments ( N = 1,202, United Kingdom; replication study N = 1,200, United States) provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democracy and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may decrease democratic legitimacy and public engagement in shaping the future of AI."

    "abstract": "In light of continued foreign interference in the US presidential elections, where undisclosed digital voter suppression advertising has been deployed, this study addresses the questions of who is exposed to these ads and whether and how such exposure influences voter turnout. Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey responses to identify voter suppression content and its targeting patterns. By further matching individual-level exposure to voter suppression ads with the same individual’s verified voter turnout records, the study estimates the effects of voter suppression on actual turnout. The study findings from the 2016 US Presidential Election reveal clear geo-racial targeting patterns in voter suppression: non-Whites residing in the racial minority counties of battleground states were exposed to substantially more voter suppression ads than their counterparts. Moreover, exposure to voter suppression ads was associated with decreases in voter turnout at the population level, albeit small. The sharpest declines were observed among non-Whites residing in minority counties of battleground states, suggesting that the intensified turnout suppression among the targeted segments of the electorate may have played a role in shaping turnout."
