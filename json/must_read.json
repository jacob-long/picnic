    "authors": "Muniba Saleem, Ismaharif Ismail",
    "abstract": "Guided by social identity gratification theory, this study examines the reciprocal relationship between media consumption and social identity among 220 ethnically and linguistically diverse Muslim American adolescents over three years. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found stronger evidence for media-to-identity influence, particularly in predicting within-person changes over time. Media consumption was significantly associated with identity centrality and private esteem but not public esteem, highlighting the multidimensionality of social identity. The impact of media also varied by genre and language: native-language entertainment media positively influenced identity centrality and private esteem, whereas English-language media showed distinct effects at the between- and within-subject levels. Additionally, increased time on social networking sites was linked to a decline in Muslim private esteem over time. These findings highlight the complex ways media consumption shapes the social identity development of marginalized youth in the United States.",

Using a Latent Profile Analysis, we identified approaches to media parenting and examined associations between media parenting profiles and adolescent well-being in four world regions. Data for this study were drawn from parents (N = 1,232) of adolescents and adolescent-parent dyads (adolescent ages 13–17; N = 266 dyads) living in Australia/New Zealand, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Analyses found five profiles of media parenting: Hands-off &amp; Low Confidence, Permissive, Value-Neutral &amp; Moderately Engaged, Engaged but Low Conversation, and Proactive &amp; Engaged. We found some evidence for differences in media parenting profiles by country of residence, as well as limited evidence of differences in adolescent well-being by media parenting profiles, country of residence, or an interaction between profiles and country of residence.",

    "authors": "Camille J Saucier, Nathan Walter",
    "abstract": "Although research on misinformation and conspiracy theories has grown exponentially in recent years, false and misleading content remains difficult to combat. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind conspiracy theory engagement may provide unique insight. Drawing upon distinct literatures around self-affirmation and motivation theories, this study aims to: (a) determine if conspiracy theories serve to bolster self-worth among those predisposed to believe them and (b) examine whether a priori affirmation reduces the desire to engage with these theories. To test these predictions, two experiments assessed participants’ likelihood of engaging with a conspiracy theory. Results were mixed, suggesting conspiracy theories serve a self-affirming function, yet also illustrating the complex nature of conspiracy beliefs and the diverse means to test them. Together, these findings speak to the continued importance of research into conspiracy theory engagement with an eye toward identifying boundary conditions and elucidating underlying mechanisms.",

    "authors": "Qiu Jiangnan, Qian Wang, Xinwei Wang, Yan Li, Min Zuo, Jingxian Wang",
    "abstract": "Purpose An online knowledge community (OKC) is an important platform for people to produce and share knowledge. Many factors affecting the knowledge quality of OKC have been explored, but the feedback effect of knowledge quality has been ignored while feedback is a potentially powerful tool to enhance organizational effectiveness. This paper explores the cyclical causal feedback relationship among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality. Design/methodology/approach We drew on the Input-Mediator-Output-Input model (IMOI) to explore the cyclical causal feedback among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality, then used panel data with the editing history of 117 articles extracted from Wikipedia to test the causality among these variables via the two-step system GMM estimation method. Findings There is a positive feedback loop among knowledge heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality. Experience heterogeneity had no significant impact on interactive processes and knowledge quality, while knowledge quality in the previous stage had a significant negative feedback effect on experience heterogeneity in the next stage. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted in the context of Wikipedia. We expect that the results will generalize to other OKC platforms. Practical implications The findings could assist OKC managers in understanding the dynamic evolution of knowledge quality. Enriching members’ knowledge heterogeneity and promoting interaction are the keys to continuously improving knowledge quality. Originality/value This study extends the IMOI framework to an OKC context and finds the cyclical causal feedback relationship among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality.",

    "abstract": "This essay forward the theory of memorable messages (ToMM), a framework useful for examining the messages that individuals remember for long periods of time (i.e., memorable messages) and their influence on identities, beliefs, and behaviors. The ToMM empowers researchers to ask how messages deemed unhelpful, harmful, or incomplete (e.g., absent) can be disrupted, or meaningfully transformed, to make room for new messages and meanings. To this aim, we first overview 40 years of atheoretical memorable messages scholarship, before detailing recent advancements in the ToMM. Next, we offer warrants for five propositions of the ToMM, aligning with metatheoretical assumptions for an interpretive approach to memorable messages scholarship. Lastly, we discuss future directions for ToMM scholarship, including opportunities to advance qualitative approaches to communication research and approach the ToMM from alternative metatheoretical perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Positive mediated intergroup contact improves intergroup relations. By examining such effects in the foreign-language film context with varying verbal delivery methods, the study explores outgroup characters’ language accommodation to viewers as a critical mechanism. This experiment ( N = 204) investigated how different verbal delivery methods in a foreign language movie featuring Asian Americans (titled Minari ) influenced attitudes toward Asian Americans. Among native English speakers in America, watching the film with a native speaker's English dubbing (vs. foreign-accented English dubbing vs. foreign language with subtitles) led to more positive attitudes toward Asian Americans, mediated by two theory-driven mechanisms: perceived similarities and processing fluency with the target Asian American character. Results indicated that exposure to the target Asian American character in the native speaker's English dubbed (vs. subtitled) condition resulted in more perceived similarities with the character and fluent processing of the character's speech. Subsequently, these factors translated into positive evaluations of the character and Asian Americans as a group. With an emphasis on the role of language accommodation to viewers, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

    "authors": "Diana Camila Garzón-Velandia, James W. Pennebaker",
    "abstract": "Three studies developed and validated a linguistic dictionary to measure negative affective polarization in English and Spanish political texts. It captures three dimensions: negative affect, delegitimization, and political context. In the first study, two independent judges evaluated the candidate words, and reliability indicators were calculated, showing acceptable values for short texts (.572 in English, .541 in Spanish) and higher values for larger corpora (.964 in English, .957 in Spanish). The second study tested discriminant validity by comparing negative affective polarization scores in social media comments on politics and entertainment. Results showed significantly higher polarization scores in political content, confirming the dictionary's validity. The third study compared the dictionary to an existing online polarization measure, finding greater coverage and alignment with the construct. Additionally, it was observed that polarization scores were higher in texts containing hate speech compared to those where it was absent. The findings suggest that the dictionary in both languages have strong psychometric properties, making it a valuable tool for analyzing online content, particularly social media comments. It can be used as an independent measure or as input for machine and deep learning models.",

Drawing on gatekeeping theory and the concept of rationalisation, it describes and explains the use and effects of the technology in the news. Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in all parts of the gatekeeping process to drive efficiency gains, optimise processes and bring about greater effectiveness, with these effects being real but task-dependent and hard to quantify. Overall, AI reshapes and retools the production and distribution of news by providing publishers with new means in the service of achieving existing ends, rationalising the work of news organisations in the process, and pushing it more strongly towards logics of efficiency, predictability and calculability. I discuss these findings with respect to their impact on the public arena and the reconfiguration of power and control within the information ecosystem.",

This research investigates what homeopathy users believe about (a) whether and how homeopathy should be used to treat serious conditions like cancer, and (b) science and the relevance of scientific evidence regarding homeopathy. Using latent profile analysis (N = 225), we identify subgroups of homeopathy users that differ in their normative beliefs about the use of homeopathy in serious conditions: supporters of standalone use of homeopathy in serious conditions (~9%), those who are open toward standalone use (~43%), supporters of supplementary use (~35%), and supporters of both supplementary use and nonuse in serious conditions (~13%). Subgroups that supported or were open toward the standalone use of homeopathy in serious conditions held the most negative attitudes toward science. These findings are relevant for interventions aiming to prevent the risks associated with homeopathy use.",

To address this gap, we construct new measures of candidate ideology based on campaign contributions and roll‐call votes, and we use them to offer the first systematic study of the relationship between candidate ideology and electoral outcomes in primary and general elections in state legislatures, 2000–2022. We find that the set of people running for state legislature has polarized substantially in recent decades. More‐moderate candidates enjoy a meaningful advantage in contested general elections, but that advantage has declined somewhat in recent years. At the same time, more‐extreme candidates are favored in contested primary elections. These new measures and data will allow researchers to build on these basic findings to understand how elections function in lower information, lower salience environments like American state legislatures.",

    "abstract": "Measurement is the weak link between theory and empirical test. Complex concepts such as ideology, identity, and legitimacy are difficult to measure; yet, without measurement that matches theoretical constructs, careful empirical studies may not be testing that which they had intended. Item response theory (IRT) models offer promise by producing transparent and improvable measures of latent factors thought to underlie behavior. Unfortunately, those factors have no intrinsic substantive interpretations. Prior solutions to the substantive interpretation problem require exogenous information about the units, such as legislators or survey respondents, which make up the data; limit analysis to one latent factor; and/or are difficult to generalize. We propose and validate a solution, IRT-M, that produces multiple, potentially correlated, generalizable, latent dimensions, each with substantive meaning that the analyst specifies before analysis to match theoretical concepts. We offer an R package and step-by-step instructions in its use, via an application to survey data.",

However, no research to date has established exactly what types of valence matter and how they interact with parties’ policy platforms. This study therefore conducted a conjoint experiment in Japan and found that voters care more about party valence attributes with respect to presence, power, and legislative productivity, as well as the prevalence of scandals, compared to the level of continuity and experience. This pattern persists regardless of electoral system and partisanship. The results also imply that valence is not a substitute for policy and that the effects of valence and policy behave additively. These findings paint a picture of electoral competition centered on both a party’s policy offerings and its ability to meaningfully engage in the legislature rather than its continuing existence or the prevalence of incumbent members.",

However, they typically lack information about the foreign partners with whom these firms trade. Linking import data from one NSO to corresponding export data from a partner NSO could significantly enhance statistics on firms’ international operations. While technically feasible, such linkage is legally constrained by strict privacy laws. Private set intersection (PSI) protocols may help address privacy concerns but require unique identifiers to avoid linkage errors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a PSI protocol with three innovations. First, we estimate the rates of linkage error by modeling the number of links from a given record. Second, we adjust an estimated population mean according to the estimated linkage accuracy. Lastly, our adjustment explicitly accounts for this accuracy without assuming a particular relationship among the target variables.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of smart devices, in particular mobile devices, has widened the potential types of data that can be collected in the social sciences. Given the fact that traditional surveys require more and more effort, new data sources collected via smart devices can potentially improve measurement of variables of interest and representation of the target population. New data sources also bring new challenges. New data sources, such as smartphone sensor data offer less control and coherence than traditional data such as administrative and survey data do, and are therefore often integrated either during, or after data collection. Respondents remain in control and help to resolve inconsistencies, missing data, or provide context. We discuss the consequences of hybrid data collection and methodology needed to reduce errors in smart surveys. Since quantification of the various types of errors is costly and time-consuming, we present a number of practical criteria. These criteria help evaluate whether hybrid data collection may have a positive business case and justify further investments in systems for data collection, data processing, and integration. We apply the criteria to three case studies: the measurement of mobility, consumption, and physical activities. Large-scale field experiments have been conducted for each of the case studies that allow us to evaluate the criteria.",

Do liberals/Democrats and conservatives/Republicans have different views of workplace injury causation? Extensive research on ideology and behavior suggests that there should be a clear ideological difference in workplace injury causal attribution, with liberals embracing systemic explanations and conservatives embracing individual-based explanations. This study challenges the prevailing theory of ideology and causal attribution and argues that ideology is moderated by class in the context of workplace issues. I present the first-ever empirical test of the extent to which ideology shapes beliefs of workplace injury causation with an original survey of the American public. While attribution of workplace injury is affected by ideology and partisanship, with liberals/Democrats overall holding more pro-worker views and rejecting individual-based explanations for workplace injuries, income has a strong moderating effect among conservatives/Republicans, such that low-income Republicans are just as likely to express pro-worker sentiment as high-income Democrats. The results highlight the importance of class and the workplace and the limits of ideologically driven perceptions about how and why workers are injured.",

    "abstract": "Eye movements during reading experiments involve careful cleaning of raw data into a processed format that can then be analyzed. Through the process of cleaning and analyzing these datasets, there are many decisions that researchers make. As a result, there is a wide range of possible approaches that can be taken when analyzing datasets from reading and eye movement experiments. At present, little is known regarding the consequences of these decisions and in a worst-case scenario, specific approaches to cleaning and analyzing these datasets could “create” effects that would otherwise not be present in the datasets. Here, we addressed these issues by conducting a multiverse analysis of a range of reasonable and defensible analyses that researchers in this field might conduct. We examined a total of 1,890 different data cleaning and analytic pipelines to explore how different decisions researchers make when cleaning and analyzing their data influence perhaps the most well-known effect in eye movements and reading research: the word frequency effect. More specifically, the impact on the size of the word frequency effect during sentence reading (Lee et al. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition , 2025) was explored. The frequency effect was found to be extremely robust and present in almost all cases, but the magnitude varied substantially, with 36% of the size of the effect being due to specific choices made during data cleaning and analysis. Recommendations for further work and greater transparency in the field are set out based on our findings.",

Participants explained race differences in trust in the police (Experiment 1), success or failure in a drug rehabilitation program (Experiment 2), charitable donation rates (Experiment 3), or the benefits of a new medication (Experiments 4 and 5). Every experiment counterbalanced which group had the numerically higher or lower result and the more expected or unexpected data pattern. Participants’ explanations focused significantly more on Black Americans and on the group with the more unexpected results in four experiments. Explanatory focus was not related to perceptions of the mutability of groups’ behavior or which data pattern was numerically larger. Studies 1–4 used mostly White samples, but Experiment 5 found that Black and White participants both focused explanations on Blacks. The tendency to take Black Americans as the EBE is large when they show the less expected data pattern (Cohen’s d = 0.86), and medium ( d = 0.33) even when White Americans show the less expected data pattern. These data show why diversifying samples and research teams are necessary but not sufficient steps to undo the impact of structural inequalities on the representation of diverse people in psychology.",

However, limited research has examined the long-term associations of this link or the effects of partner similarity in exchange orientation. The present research addressed this gap by employing a set of rigorous analyses on longitudinal data spanning 13 years from a national sample of romantic couples in Germany ( N = 7,293 couples). Latent curve models with structured residuals (LCM-SR) revealed that romantic partners, on average, experienced a general decline in exchange orientation over the course of their relationship. Partners who showed slower declines in exchange orientation experienced steeper declines in relationship satisfaction. Within-person increases in exchange orientation predicted future decreases in relationship satisfaction. Dyadic response surface analyses (DRSA) indicated no evidence of similarity effects. Overall, these findings corroborate the adverse effects of exchange orientation on intimate relationships.",

In an original survey of research participants recruited from a popular online platform for sourcing social science research subjects, 34 percent reported using LLMs to help them answer open-ended survey questions. Simulations comparing human-written responses from three pre-ChatGPT studies with LLM-generated text reveal that LLM responses are more homogeneous and positive, particularly when they describe social groups in sensitive questions. These homogenization patterns may mask important underlying social variation in attitudes and beliefs among human subjects, raising concerns about data validity. Our findings shed light on the scope and potential consequences of participants’ LLM use in online research.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about the relationship between social media use and adolescent mental health are growing, yet few studies focus on adolescents with clinical-level mental health symptoms. This limits our understanding of how social media use varies across mental health profiles. In this Registered Report, we analyse nationally representative UK data ( N = 3,340, aged 11–19 years) including diagnostic assessments by clinical raters alongside quantitative and qualitative social media measures. As hypothesized, adolescents with mental health conditions reported spending more time on social media and were less happy about the number of online friends than adolescents without conditions. We also found hypothesized differences in social media use by condition type: adolescents with internalizing conditions reported spending more time on social media, engaging in more social comparison and experiencing greater impact of feedback on mood, alongside lower happiness about the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure. In contrast, those with externalizing conditions only reported higher time spent. These findings emphasize the need to consider diverse adolescent mental health profiles in policy and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where they interact with humans and other agents. We propose to use behavioural game theory to study LLMs’ cooperation and coordination behaviour. Here we let different LLMs play finitely repeated 2 × 2 games with each other, with human-like strategies, and actual human players. Our results show that LLMs perform particularly well at self-interested games such as the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma family. However, they behave suboptimally in games that require coordination, such as the Battle of the Sexes. We verify that these behavioural signatures are stable across robustness checks. We also show how GPT-4’s behaviour can be modulated by providing additional information about its opponent and by using a ‘social chain-of-thought’ strategy. This also leads to better scores and more successful coordination when interacting with human players. These results enrich our understanding of LLMs’ social behaviour and pave the way for a behavioural game theory for machines.",

    "authors": "Alexandra de Lagarde, Catherine Pelachaud, Louise P. Kirsch, Malika Auvray",
    "abstract": "Social touch is crucial for human well-being, as a lack of tactile interactions increases anxiety, loneliness, and need for social support. To address the detrimental effects of social isolation, we build on cutting-edge research on social touch and movement sonification to investigate whether social tactile gestures could be recognized through sounds, a sensory channel giving access to remote information. Four online experiments investigated participants’ perception of auditory stimuli that were recorded with our “audio-touch” sonification technique, which captures the sounds of touch. In the first experiment, participants correctly categorized sonified skin-on-skin tactile gestures (i.e., stroking, rubbing, tapping, hitting). In the second experiment, the audio-touch sample consisted of the sonification of six socio-emotional intentions conveyed through touch (i.e., anger, attention, fear, joy, love, sympathy). Participants categorized above chance the socio-emotional intentions of skin-on-skin touches converted into sounds and coherently rated their valence. In two additional experiments, the surface involved in the touches (either skin or plastic) was shown to influence participants’ recognition of sonified gestures and socio-emotional intentions. Thus, our research unveils that specific information about social touch (i.e., gesture, emotions, and surface) can be recognized through sounds, when they are obtained with our specific sonifying methodology. This shows significant promise for providing remote access, through the auditory channel, to meaningful social touch interactions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid proliferation of AI tools, we know little about how people who use them are perceived by others. Drawing on theories of attribution and impression management, we propose that people believe they will be evaluated negatively by others for using AI tools and that this belief is justified. We examine these predictions in four preregistered experiments (N = 4,439) and find that people who use AI at work anticipate and receive negative evaluations regarding their competence and motivation. Further, we find evidence that these social evaluations affect assessments of job candidates. Our findings reveal a dilemma for people considering adopting AI tools: Although AI can enhance productivity, its use carries social costs.",
