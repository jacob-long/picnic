Participants were presented with a recorded video of a political conversation where we manipulated the presence and absence of elaboration questions in political conversations surrounding homelessness (Study 1) and abortion (Study 2). Results indicate the presence of elaboration questions increased perceptions of being heard and intentions to engage in discussion in the future. We also found significant indirect results where the relationship between elaboration questions and intentions to engage in future discussions was mediated by feeling heard. These findings were never moderated by whether participants agreed with the political stance taken in the conversation."

    "abstract": "Scholars have made advancements in how to interpret, with detailed measures, the different characteristics and levels of distinct listening practices used by individuals when they are deliberating (Scudder, 2020, 2022). However, listening is not only a practice that occurs directly, but also a broader phenomenon that occurs across the public sphere (Bächtiger &amp;amp; Parkinson, 2019; Ercan et al., 2019). Public discourse occurs across hybrid media systems (Chadwick, 2017) in complex discursive exchanges (Maia et al., 2023) as networks of publics interact (Bruns, 2023). Such complexity imposes challenges for research to properly understand listening at a macro level. In this article, I present how to map and measure listening at this broader level. I reconstruct the discussion on listening as a normative foundation for political communication, from which we derive three key listening elements: attentiveness, openness, and responsiveness. I outline how listening is measured in direct interactions, to then explain how it can be assessed in public communication and mediated interactions, from the perspective of who listens, who is (or is not) listened to, and the actual listening acts."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how people employ different news consumption strategies in the personalized but overloaded information environment. Specifically, we examine the psychological mechanisms of news curation and news avoidance through fear of missing out (FoMO) and news overload. An autoregressive analysis of two-wave panel data ( N = 834) shows that news use indirectly affects both news consumption strategies first through FoMO and then through news overload on Facebook. More importantly, the indirect effect occurs only for those who engage in cross-cutting discussion at high and middle but not low levels. This finding addresses a classic dilemma: despite growing concern over increased news consumption, social media users are able to strike a balance between staying informed through news curation and protecting themselves from being overloaded by news avoidance. However, these strategies can be biased because users tend to personalize their information intake after encountering disagreeing viewpoints."

We examine Twitter discourse before and after Elon Musk’s acquisition and the immediate dismantling of content moderation efforts to identify changes in aversiveness in conversations about LGBTQIA+ people and users’ engagement with such content. Time-series intervention analyses of 6 months of Twitter data ( n = 323,440) show that tweets with toxicity, insults, and threats increased in the 3 months after Musk’s takeover, although the differences were small. The volatility of aversive content also grew over time. Post-Musk, tweets with severe toxicity and insults received more engagement than before. This research provides insight into Twitter as one representation of the shared reality of today’s cultural moment, with implications for minoritized groups and the free flow of information on social media platforms."

In this context, this study investigates how political affiliation influences perceptions of GBTFVA among young Canadian men. To explore this, we draw on a survey of 1297 young Canadian men who align themselves with ideological affiliations across the political spectrum. Overall, our results show that political ideologies matter when understanding who enacts and sustains GBTFVA, as they significantly shape attitudes toward gender-based violence in digital spaces. Moreover, while we note that conservative participants displayed higher acceptance of GBTFVA myths than their liberal counterparts (such as She wanted it and She asked for it ), findings show that these harmful narratives are endorsed in different yet meaningful ways throughout all ideological affiliations. Furthermore, we found that one myth— It wasn’t really gender-based online abuse —is similarly endorsed across all political affiliations, thus highlighting the scope of these narratives that diminish the experience of targets across political discourses. By illuminating these intersections, this study provides valuable insights into the cultural and ideological underpinnings of GBTFVA, offering leverage points for societal change and prevention efforts."

This study uses data from a two-wave panel survey administered during the 2022 Korean presidential election (Wave 1: N = 1175, Wave 2: N = 948) to examine the role of fact-checking news in reducing political misperceptions in the sociopolitical context of South Korea. Based on the Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response model, we propose a reasoning process following fact-checking news use that involves cognitive elaboration and political discussion and examine the mediating effects of these processes in the relationship between the use of fact-checking news and individuals’ misperceptions. The findings suggest that cognitive elaboration and political discussion play significant roles in influencing the development of citizens’ political knowledge. Fact-checking reduces political misperceptions indirectly through elaboration, political discussion, and political knowledge. Implications of the findings for the effectiveness of fact-checking news are discussed."

    "abstract": "The “Al-Jazeera Effect” posits that Al-Jazeera has reshaped global news flows while challenging the hegemony of Western news outlets. However, few studies to date have measured this “Effect” or offered a method for doing so. This study addressed this gap by conceptualizing news outlets’ online following as Clout and assessing Al-Jazeera’s ability to attract high-quality digital diplomacy followers on Twitter including Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) and UN Missions. Such an analysis is important as the Clout of international news outlets arises in part from their ability to impact foreign policy makers. Using a sample of 56 MFAs, and 132 UN Missions, the study analyzed Al-Jazeera’s digital diplomacy following on Twitter and compared it to that of CNN, BBC World and Reuters. Quality of digital diplomacy followers was assessed using an innovative model consisting of fifteen variables, including offline variables, online variables, and networked variables. Statistical analyses and network analyses demonstrate that Al-Jazeera attracts high-quality digital diplomacy followers, be it UN Missions of affluent states and world powers, or MFAs that are central to diplomatic networks on Twitter. The study also assessed diplomatic institutions’ engagement with Al-Jazeera Tweets, which was found to be quite low. By developing a unique model for assessing the quality of digital diplomacy followers, this study offers a method for measuring the impact of news outlets in the age of social media."

In particular, Instrumental Variable techniques require monotonicity and the exclusion restriction while principal score methods rest on some form of the principal ignorability assumption. This paper provides new results showing that an estimator within the class of principal score methods allows conservative inference about the LATE without invoking such assumptions. I term this estimator the Compliance Probability Weighting estimator and show that, under very mild assumptions, it provides an asymptotically conservative estimator for the LATE. I apply this estimator to a recent survey experiment and provide evidence of a stronger effect for the subset of compliers than the original authors had uncovered."

    "abstract": "In experimental social science, precise treatment effect estimation is of utmost importance, and researchers can make design choices to increase precision. Specifically, block-randomized and pre-post designs are promoted as effective means to increase precision. However, implementing these designs requires pre-treatment covariates, and collecting this information may decrease sample sizes, which in and of itself harms precision. Therefore, despite the literature’s recommendation to use block-randomized and pre-post designs, it remains unclear when to expect these designs to increase precision in applied settings. We use real-world data to demonstrate a counterintuitive result: precision gains from block-randomized or pre-post designs can withstand significant sample loss that may arise during implementation. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating researchers’ practical concerns into existing experimental design advice."

This study experimentally examines the effects of different app-based surveys, some of which use a modular design, on perceived burden, breakoffs, and indicators of satisficing behaviors. Participants (n = 664) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) a browser-based web survey (control group), (2) an app-based survey, (3) a modular app dividing the survey into seven parts, and (4) a sequential modular app releasing modules at 48-hour intervals. Our findings indicate that administering surveys via apps can reduce the perceived burden of the survey task and improve response quality. Additionally, we find weak evidence that releasing modules individually over time can further enhance response quality, although this approach results in increased breakoffs between modules. The implications of these findings for the use of research apps and modular surveys are discussed."

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning has propagated into different aspects of psychological research, and supervised machine-learning methods have increasingly been used as a tool for predicting human behavior or psychological characteristics when there is a large number of possible predictors. However, researchers often face practical challenges when using machine-learning methods on psychological data. In this article, we identify and discuss four key challenges that often arise when applying machine learning to data collected for psychological research. The four challenge areas cover (a) limited sample size, (b) measurement error, (c) nonindependent data, and (d) missing data. Such challenges are extensively discussed in the “traditional” statistical literature but are often not explicitly addressed, or at least not to the same extent, in the applied-machine-learning community. We present how each of these challenges is dealt with first from a traditional-statistics perspective and then from a machine-learning perspective and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions by comparing the approaches. We argue that the boundary between traditional statistics and machine learning is fluid and emphasize the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration to better tackle these core challenges and improve replicability."

In the first section, we briefly review the development of transformer-based LLMs and discuss their advances in natural language processing. In the second section, we describe the experimental design process, including techniques for language data collection, audio processing and transcription, text preprocessing, and model selection, and analytic matters, such as model output, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, model visualization, and topic modeling. At each stage, we describe options, important decisions, and resources for further in-depth learning and provide examples from different areas of psychology. In the final section, we discuss important broader ethical and implementation issues and future directions for researchers using this methodology. The reader will develop an understanding of essential ideas and an ability to navigate the process of using LLMs for psychological assessment."

In violent intergroup conflicts, such perceptions can be especially dangerous, as they may justify indiscriminate violence against the outgroup. The current research aims to address Jewish Israelis’ perceptions of Palestinians’ variability following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. We simultaneously conducted two intervention tournaments in which we examined the effectiveness of different interventions in increasing the perceived heterogeneity of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip ( N = 1,564) and of Palestinian citizens of Israel ( N = 1,628). Several interventions (Outgroup empathy expression, Opinion variance, Internal criticism, Leadership-people distinction, and Moral exemplars) were found effective, suggesting that outgroup perceptions can be altered, even amid extreme violence. Implications for psychological interventions targeting outgroup variability and their implementation in the field are discussed."

In Experiment 1, children considered scenarios that might elicit information avoidance: protecting against negative emotions, maintaining perceptions of likeability and competence, preserving beliefs and preferences, and acting in self-interest. When a motivation for avoidance was present, children were more likely to avoid learning information, particularly with age. Experiment 2 presented the self-interest scenario (a moral “wiggle room” task) involving real payoffs. Although children could reveal their partner’s payoff without cost, older children capitalized on moral “wiggle room” by avoiding this information and choosing the self-interested payoff. In Experiment 3, we considered conditions under which even young children might avoid information, finding that they too avoided information when explicitly encouraged to protect their emotions. Additional qualitative findings probed children’s open-ended responses about why people seek and avoid information. Together, these experiments document the origins of information avoidance."

    "abstract": "Online political debate is frequently lamented for being toxic, partisan, and counterproductive. However, we know little about how core elements of political debate (justification, tone, willingness to compromise, and partisanship) affect its quality. Using text-based treatments experimentally manipulated with a large language model, we test how these elements causally affect the quality of open-text responses about issues important to the US and UK public. We find substantial evidence that differences in justification, tone, and willingness to compromise, but not partisanship, affect the quality of subsequent discourse. Combined, these elements increase the probability of high-quality responses by roughly 1.6 to 2 times and substantially increase openness to alternative viewpoints. Despite the ability to bring about substantial changes in discourse quality, we find no evidence of changes in political attitudes themselves. Our findings demonstrate how adapting approaches to online debate can foster healthy democratic interactions but have less influence on changing minds."
