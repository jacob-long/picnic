    "abstract": "This study synthesized research from 4 theoretical frameworks that explicitly conceptualize media and communication as dynamic processes over time, emphasizing reciprocal and self-causing effects. A meta-analysis of 223 effect sizes from 103 studies supported the presence of both reciprocal and self-causing relationships, suggesting their robustness as communication phenomena. Time lag moderated self-causing effects, such that longer intervals weakened these effects. Longer lags attenuating the influence of media/communication on subsequent outcomes approached but did not reach statistical significance, and did not significantly alter the reverse pathway. Exploratory moderation analyses showed that effect sizes varied by audience age, analytic methods, topic areas, and media types. Findings highlight the importance of time lag specification in studying dynamic media effects."

    "abstract": "For those with marginalized identities, social media may offer opportunities for identity exploration and affirmation but may also pose challenges of context collapse, wherein the presence of multiple audiences makes identity-related posting awkward or dangerous. To probe short-term longitudinal patterns, 337 LGBTQ+ 15- to 22-year-olds completed six weekly surveys during Pride Month. As hypothesized, identity exploration was associated with self-reported frequency, positivity, and authenticity of youths’ LGBTQ+ self-presentations online, primarily among those who, on average, rated their online audiences as less heterogeneous (i.e., perceived less context collapse). Consistent with the self-effects model, positivity of self-presentations predicted increases in self-acceptance and self-esteem, with the latter association stronger for those who, on average, received more supportive feedback. In contrast, frequency and authenticity of self-presentations did not predict self-acceptance and self-esteem."

    "abstract": "Mobile and social media are often identified as a means of enhancing social connection for those who wish to connect. In line with research on relational maintenance and the communicate bond belong theory, a need for connection can drive individuals to reach out to relational partners through mobile and social media, which might boost overall well-being. Using 3 longitudinal datasets that differ by time period (i.e., 6 years, 1 year, 1 month) and context (i.e., older adults’ pandemic-era communication, college student communication with friends, daily diary study of social media use), we test whether change in sociality moderates the association between frequency of mobile and social media use and well-being. In contrast to our hypothesis, when experiencing declines in sociality, the use of mobile and social media was either unrelated to well-being or associated with a decline in well-being. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about relational maintenance through media."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of social media platforms has profoundly reshaped news reporting, particularly concerning sensitive events like suicide. This study investigates how Chinese news media framed the suicides of two high-profile female celebrities, Sulli and Coco Lee, on the influential social media platform Weibo. It examines the dominant reporting frames and explores how Weibo’s unique interactive environment influenced the framing process. Computational thematic analysis was employed to investigate dominant themes from Weibo posts published by verified news media accounts, and three primary frames were identified: mental health, gossip, and nationalism. While the mental health frame marked a shift from traditional Chinese reporting, it often remained superficial and was intertwined with sensational elements. The gossip frame, which centres on personal scandals and conflicts, aligns with the problematic sensationalism often observed in suicide reporting. The nationalism frame positioned the suicides within contexts of cultural comparison and national pride. Findings indicate that social media affordance significantly shaped these frames, resulting in more sensational and dynamically evolving narratives. This has shifted traditional gatekeeping and agenda-setting power, and potentially diminishes the quality and responsibility of reporting. This research highlights the complex interplay between journalistic norms, platform dynamics, and audience interaction in the digital news era, underscoring the need for updated approaches to responsible reporting on social media."

Our investigation concerns the “Barbarian Right” subculture on X (formerly Twitter), where reactionary content is often intertwined with wellness messaging. Using social network analysis of 42 accounts identified through digital ethnography, we mapped the structure of this community and identified key influencers. Subsequent semiotic discourse analysis revealed ideological practices and their relationship to platform affordances. Our findings reveal a small number of prominent accounts, supported by alternative media outlets that dominate this space. These accounts primarily deliver health advice strategically interspersed with white nationalist messaging. This research offers empirical insights into the growing alignment between far-right and wellness communities, shedding light on potential radicalization pathways and recruitment strategies of the dissident right."

    "abstract": "This article explores the role played by legacy media in the pervasive situation where far-right activists highly politicize migrant crimes on social media. Focusing on particular crimes they consider indicative of a state’s failure to secure borders and protect its citizens, they utilize social media platforms to mobilize and garner political and media attention. However, little is known about the dynamics of influence between far-right activism on social media and legacy media in the process of politicizing migrant crimes. To overcome the analytical and methodological limitations of current research, we have developed a computational method to capture the public discussion that took place in France around a single event – the murder of a young teenager in Paris in October 2022. Applying an event identification algorithm to a vast corpus of Twitter data has enabled us to analyze the dynamics of public discussion held in various arenas, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This article’s main argument is that legacy media act as a “moral compass” vis-à-vis far-right mobilizations that politicize migrant crimes on social media. While they were unable to influence the volume of attention that social media users pay to this murder, the French legacy media have contributed to setting limits to the form and spread of politicization by the far right on social media. More specifically, they were able to influence the attention paid to the facts that serve as the basis for discussion on social media and to steer that discussion toward questioning the relevance of politicizing the crime."

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, close to 140 countries worldwide – including 18 in Latin America – have enacted access to information (ATI) laws. Recent increases in populism, authoritarianism, and harassment of the press, however, have been accompanied by rollbacks in public transparency and ATI, raising questions about the factors shaping journalists’ use and perceptions of ATI laws and government transparency more generally. In one of the largest cross-national ATI surveys to date, we draw on responses from 678 journalists across Latin America to examine the influence of macro-level factors – including populist leadership, press freedom, and characteristics of ATI laws – on journalists’ experiences with information access. Our findings show that populist leadership has significantly negative effects on ATI use and experience, in line with other evaluations. However, our findings reveal several unexpected results, including the null effect of the age and legal strength of ATI laws on usage and the statistically significant relationship between negative press freedom and increased ATI use. Overall, our results show that two-thirds of our sample make use of information access laws. And despite negative experiences, journalists continue to file information requests, and the more requests they file, the more positive their assessment of government transparency. Our study thus suggests that ATI laws provide substantially positive returns to both journalists and governments."

To answer this fundamental question, we examine how well federal lawmaking reflects the preferences of 520,000 Black, Latino, Asian American, and white citizens from 2006 to 2022. Average racial gaps in responsiveness are small regardless of issue area. However, white voters are significantly advantaged when Republicans control the government. Respondents’ class, age, and ideology cannot explain this disparity. Respondents’ partisanship explains some, but not all, of it. To further investigate, we analyze roll call votes in Congress, focusing on the Senate—the pivotal lawmaking institution. Similar patterns emerge: Republican Senators better represent white (versus Black or Latino) constituents. Moreover, Black-white disparities are larger in states where Black Americans comprise more of the population. This suggests a role for white racial attitudes, and, indeed, we find that state-level white racial resentment predicts Black-white representational disparities."

This study investigates the impact of political scandals in multilevel political systems and explores three possibilities: contagion , where trust erodes across all political levels; containment , where evaluations are limited to the specific institutions involved; and contrast , where actors at other levels appear more trustworthy in comparison. We present the first experimental test of vertical contagion, containment, and contrast effects following real-world scandals in UK and Scottish politics: Partygate and Campervangate. We find weak evidence of contagion in the Scottish-level ‘Campervangate’ scandal, although trust reductions were small and often not significant. However, the ‘Partygate’ scandal reveals a distinct contrast effect: trust decreased in UK political actors but increased at the Scottish level. These results suggest that scandals in multilevel polities can influence evaluations of ‘innocent’ political actors, with troubling consequences for democratic accountability mechanisms."

Analyzing congressional floor speeches, committee meetings, media reports, and electronic newsletters, we demonstrate that Democrat Party usage by Republican members of Congress is positively correlated with conservatism. We further show that congressional Republicans are likelier to use the term when in the minority in their chamber and when addressing an external audience. These findings are consistent with our theory that Democrat Party functions as a form of multivocal communication, invoked by conservative Republicans to subtly signal their ideology to likeminded constituents."

We investigate the effect of observing similarities in apolitical characteristics—such as gender, age, personality, or lifestyle choices—on people’s decision to engage in political conversations, and whether ideological expectations or apolitical homophily drive this effect. To this end, we introduce the “dynamic parallel conjoint experiment” and field it in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, and Sweden. We find that observing apolitical similarities in others consistently increases the likelihood of engaging in political conversations. Political expectations engendered by these similarities do not play a relevant role. Rather, similarities motivate political conversations directly through homophily, providing evidence supporting the “incidental model” of political conversations (Minozzi et al., 2020). Our study contributes to debates on the dynamics underlying political conversation and introduces an innovative methodological approach for studying implicit mediation in political behavior."

Across two studies on U.S. citizens, we examine whether news coverage of misinformation generates misperceptions and decreases levels of trust in information institutions (i.e., media, professors, and scientists) and whether its effects can be comparable to those of exposure to untrustworthy content. We rely on an online experiment using mock social media posts (Study 1, N = 1,670) and also on online behavioral tracking data paired with over-time survey self-reports (Study 2, N = 804). Study 1 finds that exposure to both actual misinformation and the coverage of misinformation affect misperceptions, but does not decrease trust. Study 2 presents evidence that behaviorally tracked visits to untrustworthy sites and exposure to news coverage of misinformation—although relatively rare—do not affect misperceptions, but both predict lower levels of trust in scientists, with less consistent effects for media and university professors. These results support concerns that not only misinformation but also its coverage contribute to epistemic uncertainty by eroding confidence in credible sources of knowledge, and warrant further inquiry into the potential harms of news media’s attention to misinformation."

We theorize a micro-level link between democratic backsliding events, elite opinion formation, and voter polarization to explain how incumbent efforts to subvert democracy increase negative feelings among citizens towards opposing partisans, thereby boosting polarization. Using survey experiments, survey data from electoral democracies, and expert-coded global macro-data, we find support for our argument. Regardless of how polarized society is prior, we demonstrate that incumbent actions that degrade democracy worsen polarization, an effect that is amplified when party elites endorse (rather than condemn) the leader’s behavior. The central message to emerge is that polarization is endogenous to democratic backsliding."

Specifically, we argue that third-person perception, a perception gap between presumed media influence on others and influence on oneself, reinforces the consideration of election pledges through the mechanisms of expectation confirmation or disconfirmation. The empirical results confirm that, first, voters who believe in pledge fulfillment are more likely to frequently take election pledges into account when making their voting decisions, and second, voters who believe that pledges are likely to be broken are less likely to do so, although this is the case only for those who do not have third-person perception. Finally, we observe that voters’ consideration of election pledges is reinforced by third-person perception, which to some extent ensures a link between voters’ policy preferences and governments’ policy decisions."

However, a sizable minority of union members vote Republican. This is puzzling, given that the national Republican Party has long been hostile toward organized labor. Extant research has clearly demonstrated that union and nonunion members differ in their voting behavior, but we know little about such variation among union members. I explore this latter phenomenon here, arguing that the frequency of workplace political discussion plays an important role in shaping how labor union members vote. I test this with data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES). Overall, I find that workplace discussion of politics is positively and significantly associated with the probability that labor union members vote Democrat. This appears to occur via a “learning” mechanism, in which greater workplace discussion of politics leads union members to recognize which candidate is more “prolabor.” Overall, these findings help us better understand the consequences of the workplace, political discussion, and the politics of American labor unions."

Does this translate into persuasiveness of arguments and opinion change? We here test the hypothesis that conservatives can be swayed by binding moral arguments, while everyone is susceptible to individualizing moral arguments. Using a classic experimental design (N = 375) where respondents are given moral arguments for a position in nine moral issues, we find support for this hypothesis. In line with motivational matching, the moral foundation support of respondents predicts the type of arguments to which they are susceptible. Along with previous studies on which type of moral argument supports which moral position in the public debate, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation for public opinion change, and in particular for the observation that moral values are becoming more liberal and progressive across the board. Although people tend to be resistant to belief revision, their opinions on politically polarized issues can change when arguments match their beliefs, reflected in their ideology."

I use all available online content from four major Estonian newspapers during 2015–2023 ( ∼ 140,000 articles) and pre-trained transformer models to classify the sentiment and policy issues of news articles that mention MPs. I match media data with MPs’ Wikipedia pageviews on a daily basis over two legislative terms. First, the results show that media visibility of MPs is associated with more views of their Wikipedia page on the same day. Second, news articles with negative sentiment have a greater impact on information-seeking than those with a positive or neutral tone. Third, the impact of MPs' media appearances on information-seeking is dependent on the policy context as well as party affiliation. The findings have implications for understanding the consequences of political communication and democratic representation in the digital age."

Accurate recovery of the underlying network structure is paramount and requires that the models are appropriate for the data at hand. Traditionally, Gaussian graphical models for continuous data and Ising models for binary data have dominated the literature. However, psychological research often relies on ordinal data from Likert scale items, creating a model-data mismatch. This paper examines the effect of dichotomizing ordinal variables on network recovery, as opposed to analyzing the data at its original level of measurement, using a Bayesian analysis of the ordinal Markov random field model. This model is implemented in the R package . Our analysis shows that dichotomization results in a loss of information, which affects the accuracy of network recovery. This is particularly true when considering the interplay between the dichotomization cutoffs used and the distribution of the ordinal categories. In addition, we demonstrate a difference in accuracy when using dichotomized data, depending on whether edges are included or excluded in the true network, which highlights the effectiveness of the ordinal model in recovering conditional independence relationships. These findings underscore the importance of using models that deal directly with ordinal data to ensure more reliable and valid inferred network structures in psychological research."

The method’s performance was assessed for four different regression models with varying levels of non-normality and heteroskedasticity of errors, and for five different sample sizes ranging from 25 to 500 cases. For each scenario, 10,000 samples of observations were generated. Type I error and coverage rates, power, and standard error bias were examined to assess the methods’ performance. No method considered here performed satisfactorily on all accounts. Using HC3 or HC4 standard errors, or a wild bootstrap procedure with percentile confidence intervals, could yield reliable results in many, but not all, scenarios. We suppose that, in the case of assumption violations, researchers might refer to a method that performed best in a scenario most similar to their data situation. To aid the selection of an appropriate method, we provide tables comparing relative performances in all considered scenarios."

    "abstract": "Recent perspectives have challenged the view that left-wingers are less likely to derogate out-group members. Building on research demonstrating heightened out-group derogation by Progressive (vs. Traditional Liberal) left-wingers, we examined whether Progressives and Traditional Liberals differentially tolerate in-group dissenters on the issue of gender identity. Using reverse correlation, Study 1 found that the Progressive-generated face of J.K. Rowling (a prominent gender critical left-winger) was evaluated negatively, while the Traditional Liberal–generated face was evaluated positively. Study 2 found that in both abstract (general description) and concrete (public figure) presentations, faces of left-wing in-group members expressing gender critical views were judged more negatively than self-identification faces, with Progressive-generated gender critical faces evaluated more negatively than Traditional Liberals–generated faces. Replicating Study 1, the Rowling face generated by Traditional Liberals was evaluated positively. These findings suggest an ideological asymmetry of derogation within left-wing kinds, offering evidence of opposing representations of a dissenting in-group target."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. Here, we examine inter- and intramodel agreement across four state-of-the-art LLMs tasked with evaluating 4800 narrative statements on 24 different topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of 192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified nationality affects evaluation outcomes. Different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intramodel agreement across topics, but this alignment breaks down when source framing is introduced. Attributing statements to Chinese individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models and, in particular, for DeepSeek Reasoner. Our findings show that LLMs’ own judgment of agreement with narrative statements exhibit systematic bias from framing effects, with substantial implications for the neutrality and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems."

    "abstract": "Mass shootings occur with horrifying frequency in the United States. Many point to electoral politics as a potential path to change this. Here, we test whether mass shootings increase electoral participation using the most granular dataset to date. We draw information on mass shootings from the Gun Violence Archive and estimate national block group-level turnout using four snapshots of the national voter file. Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we find that mass shootings mobilize local voters (especially in heavily Democratic areas) but do not shift presidential vote choices. Furthermore, we show that pre-election mass shootings were associated with increased support for a 2016 Californian gun reform ballot initiative. Our results show the (geographically bounded) salience of mass shootings for local political engagement and ballot reform efforts."

    "abstract": "How nationalism spreads and is reinforced has long been debated. This study examines how nationalistic messages and sentiments propagate on Chinese social media, focusing on interactions between celebrities and fans. We analyzed more than 8 million Weibo microblogs and comments, classified their content using machine-learning techniques, and examined the dynamics between celebrities and fans. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings reveal that fans exert a stronger influence on celebrities than vice versa in spreading nationalism. Fans often shape the nationalist narratives that celebrities amplify, with those aligned with specific political leanings (e.g., within the state-conformist camp) having a greater influence. These results highlight the critical role of grassroots online communities in shaping nationalism in nondemocratic contexts, offering insights into the dynamic interactions between the masses and influential figures in reinforcing nationalist ideologies and sentiments."
