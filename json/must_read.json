    "abstract": "While the spread of toxicity on social media has received ample attention, studies offer conflicting expectations and mixed evidence about its contagious nature. This study advances understanding of how toxicity becomes contagious by distinguishing between exposure to toxicity by ingroup versus outgroup members and separating toxicity into impolite style and intolerant substance. We focus on Israel during 2023, a period marked by intense political polarization. Using Twitter panel data from original and replication datasets, we analyze ∼1M tweets from 12,481 users and ∼6M tweets from the 713,231 accounts they follow. We find that exposure to toxic behavior by ingroup members is the primary driver of contagious toxicity, compared to smaller, less consistent associations with outgroup toxicity. Moreover, seemingly less harmful forms of toxicity (impoliteness) by the ingroup are not only associated with increased users’ impoliteness but also with increased intolerance toward political groups—which may carry troubling implications for democracies."

    "abstract": "Public sentiment toward government communicators plays a critical role during crises, influencing societal resilience and potentially contributing to broader trust in government. Such sentiment is shaped not only by what is said, but also by who says it. While existing literature on political crisis communication has largely focused on the content of governmental messages, it has overlooked the importance of the messenger. This study addresses that gap by shifting attention from what is communicated to who is communicating. This research explores how the personal characteristics of government communicators relate to public sentiment toward them during crises. To do so, this study matches data on communicators present at government-held press conferences with social media discourse, examining how these communicators are referenced online. Social media platforms serve as vital spaces where citizens communicate about their government’s crisis response and thus play an important role in building or undermining public responses. Given their role in shaping public perceptions of government performance, these digital platforms offer an ideal setting to observe sentiment toward communicators during crises. The study analyzes 744,000 posts on Twitter (now X) from six European countries during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic using advanced transformer-based classification models. Expressions of positive sentiment are identified through sentiment analysis, capturing affective reactions in user-generated content. The findings indicate that political actors are generally associated with less positive sentiment than experts, who tend to elicit more positive responses. Gender also emerges as a significant factor: During peak crisis periods, women communicators are more likely to be referenced positively on social media. This pattern aligns with prior research on a potential “trust advantage” for women in crisis communication, which has been linked to relational communication traits that are particularly valued in high-stress contexts."

    "abstract": "Online advertising is an important component of political campaigning. With microtargeting techniques, voter groups who have shared concerns about specific issues can be identified and, subsequently, targeted with posts addressing those issues. This paper aims to provide an initial investigation into the dynamics and effects of targeted issue ads. We study whether these targeted persuasion efforts influence which issues matter to voters and, vice versa, if voters are more likely to receive ads about issues that they deem important. We take a comparative approach by collecting data in the run-up to the 2021 Dutch general election ( N = 103) and during the 2022 United States midterm election ( N = 31). To test the effects of ads that individual voters were exposed to during these times, we use a novel combination of methods, namely, mobile experience sampling, screenshot data donations, and content analysis. In both countries, we find that exposure to online ads increases the salience of issues among voters. We did not find evidence for successful targeting on issue preferences in the United States or the Netherlands. We discuss possible explanations and implications of these findings."

This study evaluates whether sustained, classroom-based education against misinformation can equip schoolchildren to become more discerning consumers of information. Partnering with a state government agency in Bihar, India, we conducted a field experiment in 583 villages with 13,500 students, using a 4-month curriculum designed to build skills, shift norms, and enhance knowledge about health misinformation. Intent-to-treat estimates demonstrate that treated respondents were significantly better at discerning true from false information, altered their health preferences, relied more on science, and reduced their dependence on unreliable news sources. We resurveyed participants 4 months post-intervention and found that effects persisted, as well as extended to political misinformation. Finally, we observe within-household treatment diffusion, with parents of treated students becoming more adept at discerning information. As many countries seek long-term solutions to combat misinformation, these findings highlight the promise of sustained classroom-based education."

    "abstract": "This study explores whether ideological polarization increases political engagement and trust, both of which are central elements of civic culture. Polarization can clarify political positions and thereby simplify the formation of opinions, increase the stakes of elections, and offer more options to citizens. To estimate the impact of polarization from a causal perspective, we exploit variation within individuals over time using individual-level data from the Swiss Household Panel spanning from 1999 – 2023, amounting to 178,251 observations from 28,187 persons. Ideological polarization at the individual level is measured by a process of increasing extremity of the self-position on the left-right scale. In addition, we test how polarization of cohabiting household members has spillover effects on political engagement and trust. For political engagement, we adopt a comprehensive approach, focusing on interest in politics, participation in popular votes, party identification, and frequency of political discussions as dependent variables. Political trust is measured as confidence in the federal council. To analyze the data, we primarily use fixed effects models, complemented by a pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, and cross-lagged models to address reverse causality. Results show that ideological polarization does promote engagement but has a weak negative impact on political trust. This effect remains significant when controlling for affective polarization. Additionally, there is an overall increase in political engagement and a decrease in political trust if partners living in the same household become more extreme in their ideological preferences."

Using original survey experiment data, this paper shows that gamers become more interested in foreign trade policy when presented in the context of video games. This finding indicates that even seemingly apolitical identities matter in framing political behavior. Aspects of hobbyist identities seep into political attitudes, even if preferences in the strictest meaning of the word may take longer to form."

    "abstract": "Are Americans more strongly attached to their political parties than ever before? Despite partisanship’s stronger associations across politics, inter-election panel surveys show that the durability of partisan attachments has slightly weakened. After bringing attention to this fact, I propose that this discrepancy exists because comparisons across time are mostly a product of greater consistency in mass partisan behavior, not the strengthening of mass partisan attachments. Model estimates confirm that thermometer- and vote-based indicators of partisanship have mostly become more consistent markers of partisanship instead of representing stronger modern-day partisan orientations. These estimates find that American partisan attachments have strengthened since the 1970s but remain similar to the 1950s and 1960s. American partisanship is clearly a more relevant and consistent conduit for mass political opinion and behavior in recent years, but American partisan attachments are not much stronger; they are just as movable now as they were in the past."

We take advantage of the geographical proximity of the locations of the three major US news networks, ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News, all headquartered in New York City, and granular variations in local daily temperatures. We use more than 10 years of daily hand-coded data on the tonality of evening weekday news broadcasts by each news network to estimate the effect of hot weather on negative media bias in reporting the news affiliated with the Republican and Democratic parties, controlling for time and network-month fixed effects. In line with theoretical expectations regarding human behavior, our results suggest an increase in negative media bias: a 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) increment in daily maximum temperature on a hot day (&gt; 25 °C or &gt; 77 °F) leads to about a 10% increase in the negative bias measured as the difference in the share of negative news about the Republicans and the Democrats. This effect is mainly driven by an increase of the share of negative news about the Republicans. This bias in political reporting exists only for maximum temperatures, as opposed to minimum or average temperatures. The results are robust to an array of placebo tests using past or future temperatures. Examining a similar effect for positive coverage bias, we detect precisely null effects, suggesting that high temperatures are associated only with biased negativity in reporting."

    "abstract": "The Brazilian National Statistical Office (IBGE) uses its main household survey, PNADC, to produce annual estimates of the extreme poverty rate at the country level, as well as for each of its 27 Federative Units (26 states and the Federal District). Although poverty monitoring could benefit from more frequent and spatially disaggregated estimates, those obtained via direct estimation from the PNADC are considered too unreliable for informing public policy due to their large uncertainty. In this article, we illustrate the use of transformed Fay-Herriot models to combine PNADC data with covariate information obtained from an administrative register of beneficiaries of social programs in Brazil (CadUnico). Our results show that, while the CadUnico alone cannot be a substitute for official estimates of extreme poverty, it can be used as a covariate source to produce more frequent and disaggregated estimates of extreme poverty. More precisely, we use CadUnico data to produce quarterly model-based estimates for each of the Geographic Strata, an IBGE geography that partitions Brazil into 146 domains. Use of small area estimation leads to model-based estimates that are more precise, as quantified by the estimated MSEs, than their direct counterparts. Due to their increased frequency, the model-based estimates also provide a more detailed description of the evolution of extreme poverty rates. The article focuses on those elements that ensure an appropriate implementation of Fay-Herriot models, including the choice of transformations, use of administrative data, and variance smoothing. The article contributes by proposing improvements to the estimation strategy used by IBGE to derive spatially disaggregated and timely small area estimates."

    "abstract": "How does repression reshape the way online activists engage with target audiences? While prior research has primarily examined changes in overall online participation, it has paid less attention to how activists adjust their strategies in response to repression. Addressing this gap, this article argues that repression incentivizes online activists to broaden their support base by promoting inter-group engagement and signaling inclusivity. Focusing on the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the study analyzes Twitter interactions using network measures of assortativity and cross-group tie proportions. It applies permutation tests and ARIMA-based Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to compare network patterns across key phases, delineated by the Brooklyn Bridge mass arrests on October 1 and the eviction threat of Zuccotti Park on October 13. The results show that repression triggers a significant decrease in assortativity, indicating increased inter-group engagement, while cross-group tie proportions remain stable, suggesting structural rather than isolated behavioral changes."

    "abstract": "Invalid responses pose a significant risk of distorting survey data, compromising statistical inferences, and introducing errors in conclusions drawn from surveys. Given the pivotal role of surveys in research, development, and decision-making, it is imperative to identify careless survey respondents. The existing literature on this subject comprises two primary categories of approaches: methods that rely on survey items and methods involving post hoc analyses. The latter, which does not demand preemptive preparation, predominantly incorporates statistical techniques or metadata analysis aimed at identifying distinct response patterns that are associated with careless responses. However, several inherent limitations limit the precise identification of careless respondents. One notable challenge is the lack of consensus concerning the thresholds to use for the various measures. Furthermore, each method is designed to detect a specific response pattern associated with carelessness, leading to conflicting outcomes. In this article, we seek to assess the efficacy of the existing methods using a novel survey methodology encompassing responses to both meaningful and meaningless gibberish scales in which the latter compels respondents to answer without considering item content. Using this approach, we propose the application of machine learning to identify careless survey respondents. Our findings underscore the efficacy of a methodology using supervised machine learning combined with unique gibberish data as a potent method for the identification of careless respondents, aligning with and outperforming other approaches in terms of effectiveness and versatility."

In contrast to other process-tracing methods, which mostly focus on information acquisition, movement tracking focuses on the processes of information integration and preference formation. In this article, we present a tutorial on movement tracking of psychological processes with the mousetrap R package. We address all steps of the research process, from design to interpretation, with a particular focus on data processing and analysis and featuring both established and novel approaches. Using a representative working example, we demonstrate how the various steps of movement-tracking analysis can be implemented with mousetrap and provide thorough explanations of their theoretical background and interpretation.

    "abstract": "Correlation coefficients play a central role in scientific research to quantify the (linear) association between certain key variables of interest. Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p  values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product–moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Partial correlations can be tested by controlling for certain covariates. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm, which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the research community."

This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7,8,9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality."

    "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings is based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more-robust results. Our study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for the results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that the results are flawed but, rather, suggesting caution in interpreting individual edges."

We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe."

    "abstract": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,075 regions in 117 LMICs from 2015 through 2025, a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally representative household survey data from 33 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs. These disparities imply that as of 2025, women are 19% less likely to use the internet and 8% less likely to own a mobile phone in LMICs, corresponding to over 190 million fewer women owning a mobile phone and over 320 million fewer women using the internet."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings—NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check—and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability—a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes."
