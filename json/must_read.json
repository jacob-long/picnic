    "abstract": "This study conducts a conceptual replication and extension of prior research on overconfidence in discerning political misinformation, shifting focus to health. Using data from a national survey of American adults linked to web-browsing records (N=593), we investigated the prevalence and correlates of overconfidence in this domain. Consistent with earlier findings, overconfidence was most pronounced among low-performing individuals, replicating the “Dunning–Kruger Effect.” However, decomposition analyses revealed that the associations between overconfidence and behavioral correlates—exposure to low-credibility health websites and belief in cancer-related misinformation—are primarily accounted for by deficits in actual discernment ability rather than a lack of metacognitive insight. This replication highlights the robustness of the link between poor discernment and behavioral outcomes across domains. These results highlight the need for interventions that improve evaluation skills or address underlying dispositional factors, such as distrust in science and conspiracist worldviews."

    "abstract": "This article analyzes how streaming users in Latin America experience time in relation to platforms. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that employed daily reports of platform usage, focus groups, and “rich picture” analysis, we examine the cases of two countries with some of the highest digital media usage statistics in Latin America: Brazil and Costa Rica. We conceptualize platform users in these countries as “temporal publics,” defined by their varied experiences of time and the complexity of their “time work” practices. The article discusses how individuals engage in recalibration practices to navigate the temporal ambivalences of everyday life and what they perceive as the power of streaming platforms to control their time. By doing so, we demonstrate how users simultaneously reproduce and subvert specific temporal orders through their everyday interactions with streaming services, reflecting a sustained and intentional ambivalence toward the platforms’ power."

    "abstract": "Trends are a common feature in the contemporary media and cultural environment as well as media and communication research. Yet trends remain undertheorized. This article seeks to address this gap. Rather than just a synonym for shift or change, I define trend as a temporally bounded, dynamic pattern of observable change and argue that such a concept deserves greater prominence within the study of media and communication. In addition to this definition, I theorize trends by characterizing the trend’s key features, exploring its relationship to media, and mapping its connection to questions that animate media and communication research. The case of “brat summer” of 2024 is offered as an exemplary case from which trend’s core features may be discerned. The article’s primary contribution is to advance the trend as a central concept through which communication and media studies researchers may think more comprehensively and critically about change."

    "abstract": "The rapid dissemination of misinformation has raised concerns about its persistence despite corrective efforts, as the influence of fact-checking often diminishes quickly. This study explores “time” as a central theoretical and methodological construct in understanding the effects of fact-checking interventions. Across two large-scale, pre-registered panel experiments (N = 6,983), we examine the temporal dynamics of both the persuasive and unintended consequences of factual corrections. Results show that while fact-checks yield immediate belief updating, their effects largely fade within two weeks and do not produce durable belief echoes. In Study 2, we introduce a novel design treating time lag as an experimental treatment and show that simple interventions aimed at increasing the temporal accessibility of corrections—termed “accuracy reminders”—significantly extend the durability of their effects. These findings reconceptualize correction effects as inherently temporal processes, advancing communication theory and offering scalable, time-sensitive strategies for sustaining the influence of fact-checking in dynamic information environments."

Specifically, our study examines how differences in two perceived affordances—persistence and visibility—affect how women viewers evaluate the authenticity of men who post allyship messages on Instagram. Additionally, we examine how viewer perceptions of comment deletion and comment restriction impact source evaluations. Results indicate that greater perceived persistence and visibility led women viewers to rate ostensible allies as more authentic and less self-interested. Moreover, comment deletion and restriction were found to partially affect how viewers evaluated ally authenticity and motive, providing additional support to warranting theory. Implications for promoting prosocial messaging and digital allyship online are discussed."

We found that esports podcasts introductions borrow elements of traditional sports journalism and talk radio, as well as “talkier” styles and elements of “podcastness” from newer media. At the same time, esports podcasters seem to move away from professional radio broadcast styles as their shows mature, signaling the development of unique professional norms in the podcast space."

Results show that while perceived national security threats predicted ban support only in the national security condition, concerns about free speech violations consistently decreased support across all conditions. An analysis of open-ended responses further demonstrated that participants adopted the framing language consistent with their experimental condition. Findings suggest that personal value framing in the media, especially those related to free speech values, plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on social media regulation policies. We thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how media framing influences policy preferences for emerging digital governance issues such as social media regulations. Other implications were also discussed."

Yet we know little about how the growing professionalization of platform governance shapes content moderation practices. Using the schema of content abuse from the Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association, we analyzed the Community Guidelines of 12 diverse livestreaming platforms. Our findings reveal significant alignment between professional guidelines and industry practices, which is especially pronounced for Twitch and YouTube. However, industry standards only partially address the policies of adult camming platforms and AfreecaTV, a Korean-based livestreaming service, revealing notable absences in how Trust and Safety imagines the boundaries of the industry. We reflect on the priorities and exclusions of emerging industry standards and conclude with a call for academics and practitioners to broaden the conversation around content moderation."

Using secondary data consisting of comments shared over a 3-week period to an online news community, we identified three sequences that reflect collective incivility practices. Whereas the persistent incivility sequence included a large proportion of uncivil comments, incivility occurred infrequently in the sporadic incivility sequence and not at all in the no incivility sequence. Once the persistent incivility or sporadic incivility sequences appeared, discussions were more likely to return to these sequences than the no incivility sequence. Contrary to our predictions, sequences containing incivility shaped discussion processes by depressing explicit expressions of agreement and disagreement. The results of this study demonstrate how the collective behavior of online community members contributes to the production and effects of incivility."

Platform owners invest heavily in research and development to both identify and elicit feelings and emotions. However, the research conducted by these companies on this topic remains understudied. In this study, we present a systematic and critical analysis of the scientific literature published by the research teams of Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google (YouTube) regarding the analysis and processing of their users’ emotions. We first demonstrate that this literature relies on schematic definitions of emotions, thereby simplifying the complexity of affective phenomena for facilitating their automated detection. We then highlight the objectives pursued by these research efforts, the majority of which aim to promote users’ well-being through the instrumentalization of what affects them. Finally, we examine the various methods employed to identify emotions, which primarily serve to feed these platforms’ machine learning algorithms with data labeled as emotional. Beyond their scientific contributions, we consider these studies as narratives targeted at the scientific community and investors, serving to legitimize and support the development of specific innovations. Analyzing these works enables us to examine how the techniques, methods, and applications developed by these two companies commodify emotions and actively shape users’ online behaviors."

While efforts to memorialize past violence typically aim to promote tolerance and reconciliation, remembering could exacerbate divisions in recovering societies where the past is deeply contested. We examine a transitional justice museum exhibit in Northern Ireland. We combine evidence from nearly 1,400 participants across focus groups, a field experiment at the Troubles and Beyond exhibit in the Ulster Museum, and a survey that randomly exposed respondents to exhibit materials. Our findings indicate that although individuals experience strong emotional responses to the exhibit materials, these emotions do not correspond to shifts in perceptions of past violent conflict or preferences for addressing it. These results may reflect the balanced curation of the museum exhibit, which avoids imposing a singular narrative. While this approach prevents further polarization, it also limits the potential for fostering social cohesion."

We explore three explanations for why voter preferences do not translate into policy. First, politicians only consider acting when their initial misperceptions are particularly large. Second, elite capture prevents politicians from implementing environmental protection. Third, voters prioritize progress in other domains. Our results underscore the multiplicity of challenges facing climate action."

Firms exchange data traffic to achieve fast, stable, and affordable access to digital infrastructure, driving digital interdependence. While international security shapes economic interdependence, the mechanisms linking the two – sanctions, tariffs, boycotts, and contracts – create little risk for Internet interconnection, which is commonly exempted from sanction and tariff regimes, not directly consumed by the public, and not enabled through traditional contracts. I theorize that international conflict generates cybersecurity externalities as state and non-state actors directly weaponize digital interdependence. Firms and their networks sit directly in the path of future conflicts. Leveraging network topographical measurements from computer engineering, I test whether conflict expectations increase states’ mutual reliance to move data. I find robust evidence that power politics shapes digital interdependence and use additional analyses to argue that externalities, rather than state preferences, drive this process."

One tool to improve majority-minority relations is Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs), which document historical injustices. We collect data before and after the release of the Norwegian TRC report on the treatment of the Sámi and other national minorities, which allows us to investigate its effects on reconciliatory attitudes. We further leverage the unrelated outbreak of demonstrations against current injustices, allowing us to examine responses to both past and current injustices. We find greater support for some aspects of reconciliation, but mainly in areas with a small presence of national minorities. Our results show the limits of TRCs when current conflicts shape the interpretation of historical injustice."

Such mechanisms allow civil society actors to make governments’ human rights violations known to international organizations. International organizations can respond by ‘naming and shaming’ states. We expect that complaint-based shaming increases repression against civil society organizations (CSOs). In particular, governments exploit the specific and personalized information contained in complaint-based shaming to repress challengers and deter future complaints. We test our theory with three studies – (i) a cross-national analysis, (ii) a CSO-level analysis with original survey data, and (iii) a media-based analysis – using multiple identification strategies, including instrumental variables. Our evidence shows that shaming in response to complaints has detrimental effects for CSOs in both democracies and autocracies. Our findings highlight that personalized shaming creates the risk of targeted reprisals and call for reforms that take this risk more seriously."

We assess the quality of an answer based on how easily and accurately it can be recognized among a random set of candidate answers given the question’s text. This measure reflects the answer’s relevance and depth of engagement with the question. Drawing a parallel with semantic search, we can implement this approach by training a language model on the corpus of observed questions and answers without additional human-labeled data. We showcase and validate our methodology within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our analysis reveals that while some answers only have a weak semantic connection to questions, suggesting some evasion or obfuscation, they are generally at least moderately relevant, far exceeding what we would expect from random replies. We also find meaningful correlations between the quality of answers and the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions."

    "abstract": "Political professionals and scholars maintain that raising money early in the election season is critical to a successful campaign, having downstream consequences on a candidate’s future fundraising potential, the stiffness of competition she will face, and her likelihood of electoral victory. In spite of early money’s perceived importance, there is no common operationalization for money as “early.” Moreover, existing measures often fail to reflect definitional aspects of early money. In this paper, we first lay out a theoretical framework regarding the utility of early campaign fundraising for candidates. We argue that early fundraising can be expressed as two conceptually distinct quantities of interest centered on either a candidate’s own fundraising performance (candidate-centered) or her fundraising performance relative to her electoral competitors (election-centered). We next lay out steps for operationalizing candidate- and election-centered measures of early fundraising. Lastly, we demonstrate that both our proposed measures for early campaign fundraising are predictive of a candidate’s future fundraising and electoral success. By putting forward a set of best practices for early money measurement and, additionally, producing off-the-shelf measures for early fundraising in U.S. House elections, we fill an important gap in scholarly research on the measurement of money in politics."

We track a representative sample of Spanish citizens before, during, and after the pandemic, with eight survey waves from January 2020 to January 2024. We compare democratic attitudes before and after the pandemic with individual fixed effects models. We identify a sharp increase in preferences for technical rather than ideological policy-making at the very onset of the pandemic, as well as significant changes in voters’ preferences for competent rather than honest politicians. These changes are sudden and persistent over 4 years. Using a set of repeated survey experiments, we also document a widespread willingness to sacrifice rights and freedoms to deal with the pandemic as compared to other global threats, such as international terrorism and climate change. But this effect quickly faded over time. Overall, we identify significant changes in democratic attitudes during the pandemic and a durable shift in technocratic preferences that outlived the pandemic, setting the conditions for the long-term legacies of COVID-19 on democracy."

Does exposure to such protests influence people’s support for violence, whether from the state or protesters? To address this question, we analyze data from a multi-year panel study conducted in Chile (2016–2022) to examine how the massive demonstrations of 2019 shaped attitudes toward violence. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that exposure to protests decreases support for state repression, but only for a short time. However, such exposure does not significantly influence support for the violence perpetrated by protesters. This nuanced understanding of attitudes toward violence provides new evidence to explain the support for different forms of violent actions during social movements."

We examined gender bias in a large corpus of scripts from 98 children’s television programs from the United States spanning the years 1960 to 2018 (6,600 episodes, ~2.7 million sentences, ~16 million words). We focused on agency and communion, the fundamental psychological dimensions underlying gender stereotypes. At the syntactic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) appear more often in the agent (vs. patient) role. This syntactic bias remained stable between 1960 and 2018. At the semantic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) co-occurred more often with words denoting agency. Words denoting communion showed both stereotypical and counterstereotypical associations. Some semantic gender biases have remained unchanged or have weakened over time; others have grown. These findings suggest that gender stereotypes are built into the core of children’s stories. Whether we are closer today to gender equality in children’s media depends on where one looks."

In Study 1 ( N = 292), North American STEM professionals endorsing a biologically essentialized (vs. sociocultural) explanation for gender differences in occupational interests provided women (men) with more empathizing (systemizing) learning affordances in a mock management task. Study 2 replicated these gendered affordances by experimentally manipulating essentialized explanations ( N = 379; participants were North American men with management experience in male-dominated fields). In Study 3, North American undergraduate women ( N = 300) who received gendered learning affordances reported greater interest in, and possible alignment with, empathizing work assignments, whereas those who received countergendered affordances reported greater interest in, and possible alignment with, systemizing assignments. These results reveal that gender-essentialist beliefs can foster self-fulfilling gender gaps in occupational interests."

    "abstract": "Theoretical models have been developed to understand how social class influences individual thoughts, feelings and behaviours. However, the validity of these models is threatened by the prevailing use of small, non-diverse samples and flexible measurement practices. We preregistered replications of 35 key hypotheses from 17 correlational and 5 experimental studies, and collected large, quota-based or probability samples from the USA, France, Switzerland and India ( N total = 33,536). Our analysis yielded three central findings: (1) ~50% of the effects were successfully replicated; (2) conclusions were consistent across different operationalizations of social class, although objective indicators yielded smaller estimates (for example, income and education); and (3) half of the effects were moderated—mostly strengthened—by social class identification, system-justification beliefs or local income inequality. Overall, hypotheses based on differences between social class contexts in terms of constraints, uncertainty and status were well supported. However, hypotheses based on models positing social class differences in psychological orientations towards ‘the self’ versus ‘others and the environment’ received less support. We conclude that these models need to be reassessed as individuals from higher social classes seem more oriented towards both themselves and others.
