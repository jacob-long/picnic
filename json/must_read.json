    "authors": "Diego F M Oliveira, Qian Huang",
    "abstract": "This article examines gender disparities in academic communication research, focusing on authorship, collaboration, citation impact, faculty representation, and compensation in leading U.S. public universities. An analysis of 62,359 papers from 121 journals (2004–2023) shows women constitute 50.4% of authors and nearly half of sole-authored works, yet receive fewer citations, even in higher-impact journals. Women-only teams perform strongly in journal impact factors, particularly in smaller groups, suggesting parity in some contexts. Persistent biases remain: women in larger mixed-gender teams are cited less, and women Assistant Professors earn 5.61% less than men, though women Associates slightly out-earn men. These findings highlight the need for institutional reforms to promote equitable pay, recognition, and representation in communication research.",

    "authors": "Jana H Dreston, Andreas Nanz",
    "abstract": "As political campaigns increasingly use social media to reach voters, scholars debate whether users actually acquire election-related knowledge or merely perceive themselves as more knowledgeable. It remains unclear whether social media enhances voting that aligns with users’ political attitudes (“correct voting”). Previous studies suggest social media effects vary substantially based on whether exposure is intentional or incidental. In a between-subject online experiment (N = 1,460), participants scrolled through a social media feed exposing them to policy statements either intentionally, incidentally, or not at all before voting in a mock election. We found that both intentional and incidental exposure increased objective knowledge, whereas only intentional exposure enhanced subjective knowledge. Yet, participants did not translate the acquired knowledge into aligned voting. However, those who intentionally sought election information felt more confident in their voting decision. Our findings suggest social media may mobilize voters more effectively than it enables them to make “good” decisions.",

    "abstract": "The present study provides an Italian-adapted version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) 2.0, namely Italian version of the MFD (it-MFD), for use in the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count software. The MFD 2.0 was translated and adapted from English into Italian following a multistep process. Subsequently, the reviewers compared the output with the original text to identify semantic discrepancies. Independent judges then evaluated the relevance of each word to the five moral foundations, and only the words assessed as both relevant and with a high level of agreement between the judges were included in the final version. The resulting it-MFD comprises 2,881 words. To evaluate the tool's effectiveness, we applied it to a sample of salient texts originally written in Italian and for which official English translations were available. The results are presented and discussed.",

Using a mixed-method approach, we examine researchers’ justifications to scale up content analysis and assess the methodological adjustments—or lack thereof—when employing supervised machine learning for 38 large-scale content analyses. Almost all of the included studies displayed deficiencies in study design, primarily related to the uncritical use of frequentist statistics on datasets containing the entire statistical population, or employing supervised machine learning without methodological adjustments to account for misclassifications. Our findings question the need for large datasets and automated coding in the first place.",

    "authors": "Florian Muhle, Indra Bock",
    "abstract": "The article demonstrates intermedia dynamics in the hybrid media system and reveals the susceptibility of traditional media to attempts to influence their agenda and public opinion formation. Specifically, it deals with the thematization of a faux pas by the conservative chancellor candidate Armin Laschet during the German federal election campaign in 2021. To analyze the intermedia dynamics in this case, the first step is a content analysis of journalistic reporting of the faux pas, which illustrates the responsiveness of traditional media to social media trends and activities. The research shows that journalistic media addressed the faux pas only after it was problematized on social media and became visible through the trending hashtag #LaschetLacht on Twitter. Building on this, the next step involves network and content analyses of Twitter users and their posts about the faux pas, which shed light on how the hashtag trend emerged and gained momentum. Key actors who were particularly relevant to the emergence and dissemination of the hashtag are identified, as well as their strategies to reinforce the trend and draw the attention of journalistic media to it. As the analysis reveals, highly active accounts played a significant role by attempting to artificially amplify the emerging Twitter trend, aiming to exploit the attention logics in the hybrid media system.",

I investigate how scientists integrate themselves into policy disputes. Through a survey, I identify four groups of scientists with specific self-images regarding their roles in policy disputes: Moderate Mainstreamers, Issue Advisors, Issue Advocates, and Honest Brokers . Furthermore, the findings reveal differences in how these groups of scientists perceive the importance of science in policy-making: Particularly U.S.-based Issue Advocates wish for science to direct policy-making. In addition, I find that pandemic researchers overwhelmingly do not support political causes by selectively communicating political advice. I present empirically evidence that pandemic researchers sought to clarify the relevance of research during the pandemic, but did not attempt to distort policy disputes dishonestly.",

We rely on an online survey fielded in 17 European countries on more than 28,000 individuals. Our findings indicate that being embedded in healthier discussions on social media is more of an important predictor of online participation for those respondents reporting higher political discussion fatigue and less so for those perceiving online discussions as fun.

This study aims to extend previous research by comparing the widely used general NFM measure with topic-specific perceptions of entertainment, sports, politics, COVID-19, and climate change news. We assess the strength, predictors, and outcomes of NFM perceptions across those different thematic domains. Our findings show that NFM perceptions are stronger for soft news (entertainment and sports) compared to hard news (politics, COVID-19, climate change). In addition, interest in a news topic is associated with lower NFM perceptions for hard news and higher perceptions for soft news. While the traditional NFM measure reflects “News Finds Me” perceptions in politics and COVID-19 well, it is not as effective in capturing perceptions of climate change and soft news. Our results emphasize the need to explore different news genres to better understand news consumption beliefs and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Negative campaigns can have different effects on voting behavior and political attitudes. While recent work has differentiated between contexts and campaigns, few have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of negative campaigns. We argue that negative campaigning may affect whether citizens understand voting as supporting one candidate or party (positive meanings of voting), as opposing another (negative meanings of voting), or even as something useless, unpleasant or undesirable (anti-voting meanings). Using preregistered cross-sectional analyses in the 2022 Hungarian and US elections, we confirm that negative and anti-voting meanings are pervasive, and related to political parties’ use of negative and “dirty” campaigns. Two preregistered survey experiments, however, only confirm the effects of the most outrageous campaign messages. We conclude that meanings of voting are important democratic attitudes that are related to parties’ campaigning behavior. However, they are relatively stable attitudes that are only affected by relatively extreme stimuli.",

We argue that only high-intensity attacks, whose motives and targets mirror PRRPs’ nativist agenda, are likely to generate a media backlash that dampens electoral support for PRRPs. We test this argument by combining high-frequency survey and social media data with a natural and survey experimental design. We find that right-wing terror reduced support for the radical right party Alternative für Deutschland after one of the most intense nativist attacks in recent German history. An analysis of all ninety-eight fatal right-wing attacks in Germany between 1990 and 2020 supports our argument. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how political violence triggers partisan detachment and have important implications for media responsibility in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.",

    "abstract": "Who do we blame when bad things happen? Has division in American society made us less sympathetic to victims of tragedies? In previous trying times (e.g., 9/11 and Columbine), Americans rallied together to support victims and seek government solutions. In a highly polarized era, however, we have witnessed further division rather than unity. In this paper, I leverage original, pre-registered survey experiments to examine how much Americans blame and sympathize with someone who has tragically died from COVID-19. The studies find consistent evidence that partisans blame victims who hold an anti-vaccine perspective, regardless of partisanship. Less consistent evidence suggests that Democrats also blame victims who were Republican, but less than they do victims who held anti-vaccination views. Further, partisans are less sympathetic when the victim was anti-vaccine, but Democrats and Republicans are also less sympathetic when the person who died was an outpartisan. These results indicate that animosity towards outpartisans persists even through tragedy, but demonstrates limits to affective partisan polarization paired with evidence of rational blame and sympathy responses.",

An influential line of research suggests they are rooted in disagreement about the nature of morality. While the left uses principles of care and fairness in moral judgment, the right considers loyalty, authority, and sanctity to be additional morally relevant values. This creates a “moral empathy gap” that makes it difficult for people to understand the perspective of their political opponents and fosters intolerance and gridlock. Evidence for moral disagreement between the left and right rests largely on a survey measure with significant limitations—the moral foundations questionnaire. We review the methodological issues associated with this measure and use two alternative strategies to examine moral disagreement in American politics. Across six distinct empirical tests with U.S. adults, we find that moral differences between the left and right are smaller than what is measured with the moral foundations questionnaire.",

Using a moderated mediation model based on a weighted quota sample in Germany (N = 1,007), I showed that the degree to which being exposed to scientific information influences trust in science is mediated by people's credibility perceptions and moderated by their predispositions toward science.

    "abstract": "This study employs an agent-based model (ABM) simulation grounded in polarization theory to explore how social and media influences shape affective polarization, social diversity, and media diversity within a hostile partisan information environment. We examine four scenarios: minimal, strong, social-dominated effect, and media-dominated effect, by iterating 16 combinations of parameters, including influence strength, homogeneous discussion, and selective exposure rates. Calibrated with a real-world U.S. population dataset, results show that while social and media influences accelerate sorting, selectivity structure is the primary driver of affective polarization. Notably, low homogeneous discussion and low selective exposure produce the highest polarization levels across four scenarios due to a probabilistic backfire effect that reflects identity-protective cognition. Strong, locally concentrated social influence sharply reduces social diversity, whereas media influence alone cannot produce convergence without social reinforcement. Media diversity proves more resilient due to global exposure, though it declines under high selective exposure and strong media influence. Despite initial partisan gaps, final-stage outcomes reveal minimal differences between Democrats and Republicans across all conditions.",

    "authors": "Artur Pokropek, Tomasz Żółtak, Eldad Davidov, Bart Meuleman, Peter Schmidt",
    "abstract": "Multilevel modelling (MM) is widely utilized in the social sciences, with over 20% of articles in leading sociological journals employing this technique. Despite its prevalence, few studies address whether the variables used in MM are invariant across groups or allow to construct reliable indicators. This study investigates the effects of both measurement noninvariance and random measurement error on MM using Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal significant biases in MM results when random measurement errors are overlooked. Attaining high reliability in the indicators – above 0.94 – can mitigate these biases. While measurement noninvariance introduces bias in MM, its impact is smaller compared to that of the bias caused by unaddressed measurement error. Multilevel structural equation modelling (SEM), which controls for random measurement errors, performs effectively in complete measurement invariance (MI) scenarios. However, the absence of MI can create significant challenges. While multilevel SEM is a powerful analytical tool, it is not immune to the effects of MI assumption violations.",

    "authors": "George Leckie, Andrew Bell, Juan Merlo, SV Subramanian, Clare Evans",
    "abstract": "Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) is a multilevel regression approach grounded in intersectionality theory. It examines inequalities across intersections of social identities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, class) and is argued to provide more accurate predictions of intersectional means than conventional methods that estimate group means directly or via regressions with all interactions. This study evaluates that claim using analytic expressions and an empirical illustration to compare simple and MAIHDA-predicted means against population values. Predictive accuracy is assessed via variance, correlation, bias, and mean squared error. Results show that MAIHDA estimates generally outperform simple means, particularly when decomposing intersectional means into additive and non-additive identity effects. The magnitude of the advantage depends on inequality patterns and group sample sizes. MAIHDA is especially valuable when inequalities are subtle or data for marginalized intersections are sparse—conditions common in practice. These findings highlight MAIHDA's practical relevance for quantitative intersectionality research.",

    "authors": "Diana C. Mutz",
    "abstract": "Although studies of Americans’ general discussant networks have been repeated over time, research that assesses change in the nature of Americans’ political discussion networks has yet to be conducted in nationally representative probability surveys. In this study I answer two questions about the quality of the American public sphere that have generated widespread speculation, but little evidence to date. First, how have Americans’ political discussion networks changed over the past 25 y? Second, are the consequences of these changes what one would expect based on previous theory linking Americans’ interpersonal information environments to political tolerance and political participation? I resolve competing claims suggesting that people feel less free to discuss politics, with claims suggesting instead that political discussion now permeates everyday life to a greater extent than in the past. Findings suggest widespread increases in political discussion, changes driven almost entirely by increases in like-minded political discussion partners. Surprisingly, Americans are no more or less likely to engage in conversations across lines of political difference. The predicted consequences of these fluctuations confirm an intrinsic tension between characteristics valued in democratic citizens. Political tolerance has declined significantly, along with decreased awareness of rationales for others’ relative to one’s own views. Political participation is significantly higher on average than 25 y ago. Few people reported engaging with online political discussants, despite efforts to make sure they were included in network measures.",
