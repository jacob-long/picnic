    "abstract": "The field of self-relevant communication lacks clearly defined boundaries, largely due to its fragmented nature. This study addresses this gap by proposing a definition of the field, offering a preliminary overview of its current state, and tracing its evolution through a historical review. We conducted a computational content analysis of over 1,700 self-related articles from 137 communication journals listed in the ComAbstracts database from 1951 to 2020. Guided by Thomas Kuhn’s theory of scientific evolution and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory, our findings reveal that self-relevant communication research has progressed through 7 distinct cycles across 4 evolutionary periods: the initial period (1951–1972), the initial growth period (1973–1982), the transitional period (1983–2003), and the rapid growth period (2004–2020). While interpersonal communication was initially a focal point, it has become increasingly implicit in self-relevant research. The advent of social media has significantly accelerated the expansion of self-relevant research and it would seem likely to continue impacting its growth.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a state-of-the-art review on health and risk information acquisition, focusing on current approaches to conceptualizing, theorizing, and measuring information acquisition. We argue the current focus on seeking and scanning limits our understanding of the complex phenomenon of information acquisition and that scholars should consider examining a broader range of behaviors. In addition to reviewing current theorizing on information seeking, we argue for more macro theories of information acquisition behavior that better consider the current information environment and situations under which individuals acquire information, as well as theories that better delineate the process and effects of seeking. We also discuss new methods for capturing and measuring information acquisition behavior and present a roadmap for future research.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the interplay between political trust and affective polarization during the 2023 Dutch parliamentary elections and how this interplay is moderated by (social) media use. We hypothesize a reciprocal relationship, where trust influences affective polarization and vice versa. This interaction may intensify in election campaigns. Using a cross-lagged panel model on a panel wave survey conducted during the 2023 Dutch parliamentary election campaign, we analyze trust and polarization dynamics across five distinct media user types, including quality media users, social media users, and news minimalists. Findings indicate that higher political trust leads to lower affective polarization; however, polarization does not significantly impact trust. Importantly, quality media users show no connection between trust and polarization. In contrast, social media users exhibit less stable levels of political trust, highlighting the potential volatility of trust among this group during campaigns. Our findings emphasize media's moderating role in shaping political attitudes.",

    "abstract": "Media are frequently used for coping with everyday stressors, but little is known about what content individuals choose under such adversity. Building on mood management theory’s propositions about semantic affinity of content, we test how adversity in specific life domains is reflected in choice of entertaining media content surrounding the same life domain. In combining diary data from n = 122 Netflix users and data donations of their viewing histories with n = 2,122 titles, our study provides a novel methodological approach. Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that daily media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres. These results emphasize (a) a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding semantic affinity in real-life media use and (b) the importance of situational approaches in media coping research.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms form information ecosystems distinct from the Web and reconfigure power relationships, especially the distribution of visibilities, among news media. We developed a theoretical framework based on structuration theory to explain the differences between the Web and social media, and investigated four prominent factors: institutional legacy, information reliability, ideological differences, and news inequalities. This study collected social media data from three platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube; N = 8.4 million posts), web traffic data, and an information reliability index for 766 media outlets in the USA. We investigated how four factors explained differences between the platforms and the Web: media outlets that were digital-born (compared to newspapers), partisan, and mass-oriented gained greater visibilities on platforms relative to their web traffic. Meanwhile, the three platforms displayed differences. For example, only Twitter showed significantly increased visibilities of unreliable sources. Our multiplatform research design demonstrates the impact of platformization on journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Social media content is often dominated by minority views espousing opinionated and politicized content, leading to a skewed representation of public discourse. This raises concerns about its impact on public engagement, as individuals may be discouraged from expressing their own beliefs in such an environment. We investigate this issue by exploring how Republican supporters of childhood vaccines (i.e., those who are in the majority) react when exposed to an online environment dominated by anti-vaccine Republicans (i.e., those who are in the minority). In a survey experiment ( N = 355), we find causal evidence that the majority view holders anticipate social conflict when exposed to a minority view-dominant information environment. Anticipated social conflict is then associated with reduced participation in online discussions. Notably, we find that anticipated social conflict, rather than one’s perception of public opinion, is a primary driver of self-silencing behavior, providing a roadmap for future research on interventions aimed at building people’s resilience to hostile information environments.",

Our research advances understanding of how psychological processing influences perceptions and effects of AI-generated messages on message acceptance and credibility. Specifically, the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, anthropomorphism, and solipsistic introjection are employed to examine the effects of the degree of AI involvement in information delivery when seeking clarification on a politicized issue – ranging from none (e.g., news article), to partial (e.g., AI-generated summaries in Google search results), to full reliance on AI (e.g., responses from ChatGPT). Findings from our online experiment with N = 551 US adults indicate that moderate and highly AI-powered sources are deemed more credible than non-AI human-authored sources, however, this effect is weakened by diminished perceptions of anthropomorphizing of AI. Further, solipsistic introjection is negatively related to message acceptance, indicating this intrapsychic processing may decrease the persuasiveness of messages that combat mis/disinformation. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications.",

This research examines the role of brokers, the key network actors straddling between misleading and true/regular information groups. Content-wise, morality expressions are examined, which signal social media users’ expressions toward what is right and wrong. This research provides insights into the understudied relationship between network brokerage and moral expressions and identifies connections between moral foundation and network brokerage theories. Findings suggest that binding morality (i.e., authority and loyalty) is dominant among network brokers. Practical strategies are suggested toward potentially harnessing the power of brokers and moral framing to help combat the spread of misleading information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: In an era where digital misinformation poses significant challenges to societal well-being, this study explores a novel approach to preserving information integrity by addressing the motivational underpinnings of conspiracy theory engagement. As conspiracy theories proliferate online, traditional fact-checking and debunking strategies often prove ineffective due to the self-reinforcing nature of conspiracy theories. This research investigates whether a priori self-affirmation interventions can reduce individuals’ propensity to engage with conspiracy theories by preemptively fulfilling the ego-protective function these theories often serve. Using a randomized experiment ( N = 451), this study finds that participants who completed a self-affirmation task were less likely to read politicized conspiracy theories, and those who chose to read a conspiracy theory reported greater feelings of affirmation than those who did not. Thus, bolstering individuals’ self-integrity may offer an opportunity to mitigate the appeal of politicized conspiracy theories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Fact-checking provides an important tool in the fight against misinformation, yet fact-checks may only be effective to the extent that they are perceived as credible. This research provides a first look at such perceptions across a wide array of legacy and novel fact-check sources available today. An online survey of 993 participants and an experiment involving 1,002 participants were conducted to examine differences in credibility perceptions, usage, and sharing of fact-checks from professional fact-check organizations, mainstream news outlets, social media platforms, automated fact-check services, and crowdsourcing. Results show that legacy sources are considered most credible, fact-check receiver characteristics (political ideology, analytical thinking, and information literacy) influence perceptions of fact-checker credibility, and perceived credibility of fact-checkers is key to fact-check usage. Results also reveal that fact-checker source type and perceived credibility of fact-checkers are essential to fact-check sharing intention. Our findings advance the nascent concept of fact-checker credibility and contribute to theory, specifically the MAIN model and the stage framework model. They also offer novel data about new sources of fact-checking, including how AI and crowdsource-based fact-checkers are perceived by the public.",

    "abstract": "Far from being a concern of the past, media ownership concentration is a feature of hybrid media systems. This raises the issue of how to measure the concentration and allow for informed decisions to be made, especially for policymaking. Some of the most popular metrics are the concentration ratio (CR&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). However, the new hybrid context increasingly renders the usual economic concentration metrics obsolete to understand the power of communication players. This article provides a theoretical overview and methodological considerations on ways to interrogate ownership relations, advancing network analysis and visualization as useful tools to better grasp power relations alongside traditional economic metrics. We illustrate our proposal with an analysis of media ownership data from Denmark and Greece, as provided by the Euromedia Ownership Monitor in 2022. Our article goes beyond the approach of the monitor, as we incorporate additional components, such as the power of beneficial owners over the audience. This approach provides a broader analysis of media ownership concentration and can inspire scholarly work to explore more aspects of this topic.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of smartphones has led to their prominence as a dominant source of news for a vast majority of people. In this context, the impact of mobile technology’s affordances, including access, applications, and mobile alerts, on news engagement has been the subject of numerous studies. At the same time, recent research has found an increase in those who either have very low news usage or intentionally or unintentionally avoid news. Within a deliberative public sphere perspective, habitual news avoidance presents many problems, including lack of civic engagement and lack of critical information for partaking in public life. Drawing on framing theory and results from two experimental studies, this research sought to examine the intersection of the promise of mobile news alerts for enhancing news engagement intentions and curiosity among high-level news avoiders. Study 1 shows that positive frames in mobile alerts are associated with higher engagement intentions in high news avoiders, and this effect is mediated by curiosity. In study 2, the results show that positive framing with three facts is associated with higher levels of engagement intentions, and this is mediated by curiosity. Further, the results show that for moderate news avoiders, two facts, which are negatively framed, should be used.",

Drawing on Social Distance Theory of Power and Social Exchange Theory, we employed a mixed-methods approach, including non-participant observation, sociometric analysis, and semi-structured interviews across 12 Chinese online groups. Findings indicate that misinformation is often disseminated by socially distant yet structurally central members, while correction efforts come from more socially embedded but less influential participants. Group discussions reinforced trust in misinformation through interpersonal validation and repeated exposure. Correction was constrained by relational risks, making it a socially sensitive act. These insights highlight how group dynamics shape misinformation engagement and suggest the need for socially aware intervention strategies in these digital spaces.",

We found that the topics discussed in the young supporters’ video posts varied significantly between the two parties, as did the audience’s reactions to these posts. Young supporters often employ the platform to reinforce in-group solidarity and target ideological opponents, and their political messaging closely aligns with their respective parties’ ideologies. They leverage the platform’s socio-technical features to engage with their audiences in “politainment” by means of humor, sarcasm, and cultural references.",

We then fine-tune a transformer language model for contextualized supervised classification at the word level. Applied to unlabeled texts, our approach enables researchers to automatically detect and extract word spans that contain group mentions. We illustrate our approach in two applications, generating new empirical insights into how British parties use social groups in their rhetoric. Our method allows for detecting and extracting mentions of social groups from various sources of texts, creating new possibilities for empirical research in political science.",

Existing work demonstrates that incumbent and opposition supporters consistently diverge in their evaluation of government performance regarding the national economy, security, and highly polarized policy issues. We argue that in a polarized environment, partisan bias applies not only to citizens’ evaluations of macro-policy outcomes but also to citizens’ evaluations of mundane tangible public services, such as education, health, policing, and transportation. We provide rigorous empirical evidence for this hypothesis using the case of Israel during the two dramatic, hyper-polarized government changes in 2021 and 2022. The data include two repeated cross-sectional survey datasets: A large seven-wave survey study and an administrative survey dataset by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.

Our findings indicate that the influence of partisanship is on par with conventional criteria like physical appearance, yet tolerance for opposing views plays an even stronger role. We also find imporant partisan asymmetries: both groups favour co-partisans, but Labour supporters are twice as likely to do so.

    "abstract": "Do electoral outcomes influence public support for the winning candidate's policy agenda? While voters are often assumed to evaluate candidates based on policy alignment, research suggests that partisan identity frequently overrides rational assessment. However, the extent to which the identity of the electoral winner legitimizes policy positions—particularly in the domain of foreign policy—remains underexplored. This research note leverages the 2024 U.S. presidential election as a natural experiment, using a preregistered two-wave panel survey to assess whether electoral victory influences public perceptions of the winning candidate's platform. Results reveal a moderate “winner effect”: Democratic voters exhibited an increase in support for Trump's foreign policy positions postelection, while support for Harris declined, even among her base. Nevertheless, winner effects produced shifts in foreign policy preferences commensurate with those on a highly salient domestic issue, challenging assumptions about greater volatility in foreign policy. Furthermore, preelection candidate support conditioned postelection stability, with winning-party supporters maintaining greater consistency. While electoral victories enhance the perceived legitimacy of the winner's platform, partisan identity remains the primary constraint, limiting large-scale ideological realignment.",

    "authors": "Thomas Ledermann, Myriam Rudaz, Matthew S. Fritz",
    "abstract": "Theoretical models involving one or multiple intervening variables often posit whether a cause influences an outcome both directly and indirectly or only indirectly. In testing mediation, this distinction of partial and full mediation has become a subject of debate because of statistical issues. We extend the critique on this notion and provide insights into what a statistically significant direct effect between a cause and an outcome in a mediation model can mean. We also evaluate different effect size measures for direct and indirect effects and offer practical recommendations for assessing mediation mechanisms, which we illustrate using different examples. The broader relevance of these recommendations beyond mediation analysis is discussed.",

    "title": "Monitoring Attitudes Over Time: Real Change or the Result of Repeated Interviewing?",
    "authors": "Fabienne Kraemer, Peter Lugtig, Bella Struminskaya, Henning Silber, Bernd Weiß, Michael Bosnjak",
    "abstract": "Panel data are often used to study change and stability in social patterns. However, repeated interviewing may affect respondents’ attitudes in a panel study by triggering reflection processes on the surveyed topics (cognitive stimulus hypothesis) . Using data from a survey experiment within a probability-based and a nonprobability panel in Germany, we investigate change—and the mechanisms underlying change—in respondents’ abortion attitudes over six panel waves. The experiment manipulated the frequency of receiving identical attitude questions. We estimate multiple-group and longitudinal structural equation models to differentiate change in the measurement of abortion attitudes from “real” attitude change. Results show that repeatedly administering the same abortion questions increases the reliability of respondents’ reported attitudes and the stability of their latent attitudes toward abortion. However, we find no evidence of an increase in attitude certainty and knowledgeability on abortion and only tentative evidence of improved response behavior (increased attitude reliability) due to general survey experience.",

    "authors": "John M. Carey, Brian Fogarty, Marília Gehrke, Brendan Nyhan, Jason Reifler",
    "abstract": "We investigate how to counter misinformation about voter and election fraud using data from the US and Brazil. Our study first compares two types of messages countering claims of widespread fraud: (i) retrospective corrections from credible sources speaking against interest and (ii) prebunking messages that prospectively warn of false claims about future elections and provide information about election security practices. In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects. In Brazil, prebunking had positive immediate effects across measured outcomes, whereas those of the credible source corrections were less consistent. We then conducted an experiment in the US randomizing exposure to a persuasion forewarning before election security information is provided. Prebunking again increased confidence and decreased fraud beliefs but only when the forewarning was omitted, suggesting that novel factual information is responsible for the observed effects of the prebunking treatment.",
