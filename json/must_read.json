A pre-registered experiment ( N = 326) was conducted to examine the associations between eudaimonic music consumption, emotions, prosocial motivations, and donation willingness. Findings showed that participants viewing the eudaimonic music videos reported significantly higher eudaimonic emotions and corresponding physical reactions compared to those who viewed hedonic music videos. Path analysis results revealed the associations between music video consumption and prosocial orientation and willingness to donate to a worthy cause."

    "abstract": "Online advertising is an important component of political campaigning. With microtargeting techniques, voter groups who have shared concerns about specific issues can be identified and, subsequently, targeted with posts addressing those issues. This paper aims to provide an initial investigation into the dynamics and effects of targeted issue ads. We study whether these targeted persuasion efforts influence which issues matter to voters and, vice versa, if voters are more likely to receive ads about issues that they deem important. We take a comparative approach by collecting data in the run-up to the 2021 Dutch general election ( N = 103) and during the 2022 United States midterm election ( N = 31). To test the effects of ads that individual voters were exposed to during these times, we use a novel combination of methods, namely, mobile experience sampling, screenshot data donations, and content analysis. In both countries, we find that exposure to online ads increases the salience of issues among voters. We did not find evidence for successful targeting on issue preferences in the United States or the Netherlands. We discuss possible explanations and implications of these findings."

This study evaluates whether sustained, classroom-based education against misinformation can equip schoolchildren to become more discerning consumers of information. Partnering with a state government agency in Bihar, India, we conducted a field experiment in 583 villages with 13,500 students, using a 4-month curriculum designed to build skills, shift norms, and enhance knowledge about health misinformation. Intent-to-treat estimates demonstrate that treated respondents were significantly better at discerning true from false information, altered their health preferences, relied more on science, and reduced their dependence on unreliable news sources. We resurveyed participants 4 months post-intervention and found that effects persisted, as well as extended to political misinformation. Finally, we observe within-household treatment diffusion, with parents of treated students becoming more adept at discerning information. As many countries seek long-term solutions to combat misinformation, these findings highlight the promise of sustained classroom-based education."

In this research note, we extend this literature by demonstrating striking gender disparities in the post-transition persistence of these effects. We study the case of authoritarian indoctrination in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) using a regression kink design for causal identification. First, we draw on a unique survey fielded right before reunification to show that education under authoritarianism substantially reduced support for democratic capitalism and reunification with the West. In the second step, we triangulate multiple contemporary data sources to trace the persistence of these effects over time. More than two decades after the fall of the GDR, the attitudinal effects of authoritarian socialization persist only among men, but not women. Our results highlight considerable heterogeneity in the persistence of authoritarian legacies, raising critical questions about post-authoritarian ‘re-socialization’ and gendered adaptability."

    "abstract": "This study explores whether ideological polarization increases political engagement and trust, both of which are central elements of civic culture. Polarization can clarify political positions and thereby simplify the formation of opinions, increase the stakes of elections, and offer more options to citizens. To estimate the impact of polarization from a causal perspective, we exploit variation within individuals over time using individual-level data from the Swiss Household Panel spanning from 1999 – 2023, amounting to 178,251 observations from 28,187 persons. Ideological polarization at the individual level is measured by a process of increasing extremity of the self-position on the left-right scale. In addition, we test how polarization of cohabiting household members has spillover effects on political engagement and trust. For political engagement, we adopt a comprehensive approach, focusing on interest in politics, participation in popular votes, party identification, and frequency of political discussions as dependent variables. Political trust is measured as confidence in the federal council. To analyze the data, we primarily use fixed effects models, complemented by a pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, and cross-lagged models to address reverse causality. Results show that ideological polarization does promote engagement but has a weak negative impact on political trust. This effect remains significant when controlling for affective polarization. Additionally, there is an overall increase in political engagement and a decrease in political trust if partners living in the same household become more extreme in their ideological preferences."

    "abstract": "Who do we blame when bad things happen? Has division in American society made us less sympathetic to victims of tragedies? In previous trying times (e.g., 9/11 and Columbine), Americans rallied together to support victims and seek government solutions. In a highly polarized era, however, we have witnessed further division rather than unity. In this paper, I leverage original, pre-registered survey experiments to examine how much Americans blame and sympathize with someone who has tragically died from COVID-19. The studies find consistent evidence that partisans blame victims who hold an anti-vaccine perspective, regardless of partisanship. Less consistent evidence suggests that Democrats also blame victims who were Republican, but less than they do victims who held anti-vaccination views. Further, partisans are less sympathetic when the victim was anti-vaccine, but Democrats and Republicans are also less sympathetic when the person who died was an outpartisan. These results indicate that animosity towards outpartisans persists even through tragedy, but demonstrates limits to affective partisan polarization paired with evidence of rational blame and sympathy responses."

    "abstract": "Americans increasingly confront policy messages not from high-profile political figures but from everyday citizens. Much is known about the effects of racial source cues from well-known political figures with salient racial identities. Less is known about how subtle racial cues from non-recognizable sources affect Americans’ support for policies that are race-targeted and those that are not. In this paper, I conduct a randomized experiment that varies a cue of the source’s racial identity and the type of policy for which the source advocates. I uncover little evidence for the hypothesis that subtle racial source cues activate racial attitudes that lead Americans to racialize policies that are (at least explicitly) race-neutral. I find instead that subtle cues of a Black vs. White source decrease support only for race-targeted policies. I reason that two mechanisms possibly driving this effect are: (1) subtle racial source cues become salient for only race-targeted policies, thereby activating racial stereotypes for these policies but not others, and (2) Black sources are perceived as less objective policy messengers when the policy explicitly aims to rectify injustices against Black Americans. More generally, the paper’s overall findings suggest that subtle racial cues of who advocates for race-targeted policies matter for whether such policies can garner the public support they presumably need to come to fruition."

    "abstract": "Are Americans more strongly attached to their political parties than ever before? Despite partisanship’s stronger associations across politics, inter-election panel surveys show that the durability of partisan attachments has slightly weakened. After bringing attention to this fact, I propose that this discrepancy exists because comparisons across time are mostly a product of greater consistency in mass partisan behavior, not the strengthening of mass partisan attachments. Model estimates confirm that thermometer- and vote-based indicators of partisanship have mostly become more consistent markers of partisanship instead of representing stronger modern-day partisan orientations. These estimates find that American partisan attachments have strengthened since the 1970s but remain similar to the 1950s and 1960s. American partisanship is clearly a more relevant and consistent conduit for mass political opinion and behavior in recent years, but American partisan attachments are not much stronger; they are just as movable now as they were in the past."

We take advantage of the geographical proximity of the locations of the three major US news networks, ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News, all headquartered in New York City, and granular variations in local daily temperatures. We use more than 10 years of daily hand-coded data on the tonality of evening weekday news broadcasts by each news network to estimate the effect of hot weather on negative media bias in reporting the news affiliated with the Republican and Democratic parties, controlling for time and network-month fixed effects. In line with theoretical expectations regarding human behavior, our results suggest an increase in negative media bias: a 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) increment in daily maximum temperature on a hot day (&gt; 25 °C or &gt; 77 °F) leads to about a 10% increase in the negative bias measured as the difference in the share of negative news about the Republicans and the Democrats. This effect is mainly driven by an increase of the share of negative news about the Republicans. This bias in political reporting exists only for maximum temperatures, as opposed to minimum or average temperatures. The results are robust to an array of placebo tests using past or future temperatures. Examining a similar effect for positive coverage bias, we detect precisely null effects, suggesting that high temperatures are associated only with biased negativity in reporting."

Using a moderated mediation model based on a weighted quota sample in Germany (N = 1,007), I showed that the degree to which being exposed to scientific information influences trust in science is mediated by people's credibility perceptions and moderated by their predispositions toward science. Implications for research and practice are discussed."

Most of them rely on distribution moments or focus on a few selected percentiles at the tails of the distribution. Recently, a so-called quantile ratio index has been introduced. It considers the entire distribution and measures the distance between the (economic) equi-distribution scenario and the average ratio of quantiles below the median to their symmetric counterparts above it. We present a finite population framework for estimating this index and its standard error under some complex sampling designs. Our estimator demonstrates high accuracy and precision, even with relatively small samples. Being solely based on quantiles, this index exhibits remarkable robustness, having limited sensitivity to anomalous values and highly skewed distributions. This is also shown by an analysis of its influence function."

While prior research has primarily examined changes in overall online participation, it has paid less attention to how activists adjust their strategies in response to repression. Addressing this gap, this article argues that repression incentivizes online activists to broaden their support base by promoting inter-group engagement and signaling inclusivity. Focusing on the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the study analyzes Twitter interactions using network measures of assortativity and cross-group tie proportions. It applies permutation tests and ARIMA-based Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to compare network patterns across key phases, delineated by the Brooklyn Bridge mass arrests on October 1 and the eviction threat of Zuccotti Park on October 13. The results show that repression triggers a significant decrease in assortativity, indicating increased inter-group engagement, while cross-group tie proportions remain stable, suggesting structural rather than isolated behavioral changes."

    "abstract": "Invalid responses pose a significant risk of distorting survey data, compromising statistical inferences, and introducing errors in conclusions drawn from surveys. Given the pivotal role of surveys in research, development, and decision-making, it is imperative to identify careless survey respondents. The existing literature on this subject comprises two primary categories of approaches: methods that rely on survey items and methods involving post hoc analyses. The latter, which does not demand preemptive preparation, predominantly incorporates statistical techniques or metadata analysis aimed at identifying distinct response patterns that are associated with careless responses. However, several inherent limitations limit the precise identification of careless respondents. One notable challenge is the lack of consensus concerning the thresholds to use for the various measures. Furthermore, each method is designed to detect a specific response pattern associated with carelessness, leading to conflicting outcomes. In this article, we seek to assess the efficacy of the existing methods using a novel survey methodology encompassing responses to both meaningful and meaningless gibberish scales in which the latter compels respondents to answer without considering item content. Using this approach, we propose the application of machine learning to identify careless survey respondents. Our findings underscore the efficacy of a methodology using supervised machine learning combined with unique gibberish data as a potent method for the identification of careless respondents, aligning with and outperforming other approaches in terms of effectiveness and versatility."

    "abstract": "Correlation coefficients play a central role in scientific research to quantify the (linear) association between certain key variables of interest. Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p  values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product–moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Partial correlations can be tested by controlling for certain covariates. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm, which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the research community."

How do they decide what is quality work? What values do they apply in evaluating which science merits publication and which does not? How do they respond to dissensus and uncertainty? Who has the greatest influence over the final outcome? This study combines close reading with large language models to analyze 80,000 reviews of 28,000 accepted and rejected manuscripts in engineering and the life sciences. By following reviewers’ value judgments and editorial decisions, we come to a different view of how epistemic cultures are practiced in journal science. Instead of a consensual dialogue revealing salient norms, we find reviewers differently weigh (“commensurate”) their judgments to attribute value to works. Their pluralistic viewpoints elevate uncertainty about the work, and editors respond by aligning with the most negative of reviewers. Surprisingly, we observe engineers and life scientists find the same epistemic criteria are salient, valued, and influential, with novelty and accuracy being primary. These results underscore how contingency and uncertainty are structural features of STEM peer review and essential to its effectiveness and legitimacy."

    "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings is based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more-robust results. Our study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for the results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that the results are flawed but, rather, suggesting caution in interpreting individual edges."

    "abstract": "Smartphones are essential tools in daily life yet concerns persist about their potential effects on mental health and well-being. Research on these relationships often relies on subjective measures of smartphone use, which can lack validity. These studies are also often limited by small, homogenous samples and the inability to differentiate between types of smartphone activities (e.g., social media vs. other applications). In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings—NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check—and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability—a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes."

    "abstract": "Public trust in democratic institutions has dropped to historic lows, prompting electorates in major democracies to turn to “amateur” politicians with the expectation that these political outsiders will cut through stalemates to deliver policy results. Amateurs are often seen as pragmatic “doers,” but also uncompromising, a combination at odds with governing systems where legislative progress depends on cross-party coalitions. Using the US Congress as a critical case, we evaluate these competing expectations by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million bill (co)sponsorship records. We find that electing amateurs intensifies partisan divisions: Districts that send amateurs to Congress yield representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their bills and less often support other-party legislation. Our results suggest that amateurs are unlikely to deliver on their promise for pragmatic governance, as they resist or undervalue the compromises essential to lawmaking."
