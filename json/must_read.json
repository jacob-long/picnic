    "abstract": "This study proposes and tests five temporally explicit models of message evaluation derived from work on supportive communication. Although most empirical work in this area is based on a limited number of time-scales (temporal isolation of messages or temporal aggregation of conversations), theories that direct that work have the potential to make much more sophisticated predictions of how supportive messages, and the conversations within which they occur, are evaluated. Using data produced by pairs of friends who engaged in 5-min supportive conversations, we articulated a series of theoretically informed models that examined how type, accumulation, and timing of conversational moves impacted how disclosers evaluated the supportiveness of the statements made throughout the conversation (evaluated by the discloser using video-assisted recall) and how they felt after the conversation. Results confirmed that (a) evaluations made throughout a conversation are related to post-conversation reports of supportiveness and emotional improvement, (b) different types of speaking acts are generally not differentially supportive, and (c) timing of some speaking acts matters—altogether suggesting we pay more attention to how we conceptualize and measure time in studies of enacted support."

    "abstract": "This article examines the growing susceptibility of young Romanians to authoritarian leadership models in the aftermath of the 2024 European elections. While youth are often seen as champions of democratic renewal, recent data point to a significant erosion of democratic commitment, shaped by institutional distrust and emotionally charged media environments. This concern is heightened by Romania’s political developments in 2024, which saw the doubling of extremist representation in the European Parliament and the annulment of the first round of presidential elections due to alleged irregularities and social media interference. Drawing on a media‐centered theoretical framework and original survey data, the study finds that 74% of respondents support the idea of a strong leader unconcerned with parliamentary procedures. Socio‐demographic factors, such as gender, education, income, and urban–rural residence, significantly influence these attitudes, with lower education and income levels correlating with stronger authoritarian support. Media consumption patterns also emerge as critical determinants: reliance on social media and traditional media (TV and radio) is associated with heightened authoritarian inclinations, while online press consumption fosters greater democratic resilience. Platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp appear to amplify affective and symbolic political expression, even among those who primarily rely on traditional media sources. Furthermore, institutional trust proves to be domain‐specific; lower trust in security, religious, and educational institutions predicts higher support for authoritarian leadership. Rather than reflecting mere apathy, youth disengagement reveals complex interactions between media ecosystems, emotional political communication, and institutional skepticism. This study contributes to existing research by focusing on an understudied demographic (Romanian youth) during a volatile electoral moment. It combines nationally representative survey data with a media‐centered analytical lens to examine how platform‐specific information environments shape authoritarian attitudes."

Mobile phones have become a driving force of dynamic news habits, especially among younger audiences. This study aims to bridge the gap between static perceptions of news consumption and the dynamic realities of daily mobile usage. To investigate this, we tracked news usage on the mobile phones of 384 young adults in Switzerland over three weeks in 2021, in a period surrounding a national referendum. These data were combined with two surveys at the beginning and end of the tracking period to examine how a political referendum, daily schedules, and browsing habits are related to the amount of mobile news consumption. Using a Bayesian time-lagged model, we found an increase in news consumption on the day of the referendum, and a slight decrease on weekends and during working hours. We also found that participants read more news when they first opened their phones than as a browsing session continued, and that higher news consumption was substantially associated with the use of X/Twitter and Instagram, but only slightly with TikTok."

Although scholars have identified different approaches to digital PD, comparative research is lacking. This study addresses this gap by examining whether United States (US) embassies vary in their reliance on various PD instruments. Furthermore, it explores whether such variation aligns with contextual target audience variables, specifically different facets of political and cultural proximity. Based on a dataset that includes all Twitter accounts operated by US embassies over a year-long period ( n = 176,372 posts), the results suggest that embassies vary in their use of PD instruments. Moreover, the prevalence of PD instruments and advocacy topics covary with some of the analyzed facets of political and cultural proximity. Consequentially, the study suggests that US embassies partially tailor their messages to the interests of target audiences."

Based on representative surveys in Denmark ( n = 1,958), Norway ( n = 2,009), and Sweden ( n = 1,991), we examine what characterises right-wing alternative media users in terms of political attitudes and political, media, and social trust. The analysis reveals that right-wing alternative media users in Scandinavia tend to affiliate with far-right parties, support far-right ideas, and express lower levels of trust in political institutions, traditional media, and unknown others. Among these, support for far-right ideas and a lack of trust in traditional media are the most important characteristics. While support for far-right ideas characterises right-wing alternative media users in all three countries, low trust in traditional media is a more important characteristic in Norway and Sweden than in Denmark. The study advances knowledge of the role of ideology vis-à-vis various forms of (dis)trust among right-wing alternative media users, showing that while alternative media use across the Scandinavian countries displays a set of similarities, such use is also formed by national context."

This article proposes one such mechanism in deference towards authority. Through Structural Equation Model on Eurobarometer 2021 data, I investigate if favoring expert guidance over public participation in decision-making on science-related issues mediates the relationship between people’s socio-economic status and engagement with science. Results show that higher socio-economic status is associated with greater engagement but also with favor toward experts’ deliberation. Preferring experts over public involvement in decision-making is also associated with more informative engagement and less general engagement. Nevertheless, this mediating role is rather weak. Moreover, the study examines how other perceptions of science relate to socio-economic status and engagement, emphasizing the broader social and structural factors that shape opportunities for participation."

    "abstract": "China is a major trading partner of the European Union (EU), and the debate over China’s economic influence has gained prominence on both the political and media agendas in EU countries. Through time-series analysis, this study investigates reciprocal relationships between the European Parliament’s (EP) political agenda and the national media agenda regarding EU–China trade relations (2001–2020). The analysis is based on a sample of 538 speeches from the EP Plenary Debates and a total of 867 newspaper articles from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK). Combined with a manual quantitative content analysis, this study also examines the salience of sub-issues in EU–China trade relations. Monthly-level vector autoregressive analyses yielded four major findings. First, a positive reciprocal relationship was observed between the EP’s political agenda and the national media agenda on EU–China trade relations, with mutual influences showing similar effect sizes. Second, it was especially the speeches by Far-Right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from the Netherlands and the UK that elicited more national media attention, and vice versa. Third, we found positive mutual influences not only between the national media agenda and the political agenda set by MEPs but also between the national media agenda and the political agenda set by EU representatives. Fourth, the geographical and social proximity of sub-issues in EU–China trade relations appears to moderate the politics-media dynamics. The findings contribute to existing scholarship by examining the function of multilevel structures (i.e., supranational vs. national) in agenda-setting research."

Prior research asserted a growing left–right divide in immigration attitudes and voting behavior due to educational realignment. In contrast, I argue that leftist voters are more conservative on immigrant crime than leftist parties, which can drive highly educated progressives (so‐called “cosmopolitans”) to right‐wing parties. I demonstrate this voter–party mismatch using survey data from 14 Western European countries linked with expert ratings of party positions. A panel survey from Germany further shows that concern about immigrant crime increases vote intention for the center right among voters of the Greens—the party of leftist cosmopolitans. A conjoint experiment among German voters replicates this defection effect and shows that it persists even if the center right stigmatizes immigrants or adopts conservative sociocultural issue positions. Repercussions of immigration can in fact drive leftist cosmopolitans to the right."

Most forms—across public and private sectors—still lack a “MENA” category option. What are the political consequences of institutional invisibility? Across two survey experiments and in-depth interviews, I find that exclusion from official identity categories triggers the experience of categorization threat, a psychological response rarely linked to political behavior. When MENA Americans experience categorization threat, they respond by expressing opinions on politics in ways that attempt to signal and assert their MENA identity and, to a lesser extent, Person of Color (POC) identity. Such identity assertion demonstrates that bureaucratic categorization influences expressions of public opinion on politics, not simply how people self-categorize. Researching the effects of category exclusion on public opinions creates opportunities for more accurate and democratic scholarship."

Here we use individual ballots from the 2020 general elections covering over 50 million voters to study the relationship between individual national partisanship and voting in over 5,700 contested down-ballot contests, including nonpartisan races and ballot measures. Voting in partisan contests can be explained by voter’s national partisanship, consistent with existing literature. However, we find that voting for local nonpartisan offices and ballot measures is much less partisan. National partisanship explains more than 80% of the within-contest variation in voting for partisan state and local offices but less than 10% for local nonpartisan contests and local ballot measures. The degree of partisanship in local spending measures varies by the type of service—for example, education, roads, public safety, housing. Finally, we find evidence of structure in the pattern of votes on local spending measures."

Advocates of increased transparency suggest cameras empower voters, producing more moderate behavior among legislators, whereas opponents suggest cameras encourage partisanship and dysfunction. Previous research offers mixed conclusions, in part, because of a focus on national legislatures where the introduction of cameras occurs only once. Using an original dataset of the adoption of gavel-to-gavel coverage in state legislative chambers, we examine whether cameras are associated with a range of chamber- and individual-level outcomes. The findings suggest that there are no systematic impacts from the introduction of gavel-to-gavel coverage. Normative concerns about cameras in legislatures may be overstated, an important finding given their proliferation in public proceedings since the COVID-19 pandemic."

Such group appeals are a tool that parties and candidates use to strengthen the association between voters’ social group membership and their electoral support. However, what we know about the effects of such appeals on voters is mostly limited to class appeals. Using two survey experimental studies among British voters ( N =1,500; N =3,200), we shed light on the generalizability of the effects of symbolic group appeals for other types of social groups. We show that group appeals based on class, place, education, age, gender, and ethnicity all shape candidate support. We also theorize that effects are conditioned by respondents’ strength of identity and their deservingness perceptions and show that the latter are key to explaining voters’ reactions to group appeals. These findings clarify the scope and conditions of group appeals’ effects and advance our understanding of group politics."

Previous research shows that mainstream parties contribute to the electoral success of far-right parties through coalitions or policy alliances. However, a long-term perspective on the influence of far-right actors, including parties, civil society organisations, and social movements, on mainstream parties’ communication is lacking. This article investigates how far-right actors and issues have influenced mainstream parties’ communication in Germany since the 1990s. Using automated text analysis, we analyse 520,408 articles from six newspapers. First, we semi-automatically collect far-right actors and mainstream parties and implement a structural topic model to analyse their issue agendas. Second, we use time-series analysis to examine agenda-setting effects and their drivers. The results show that far-right influence on mainstream parties’ communication has increased, particularly among opposition parties and around issues of Islam and migration. Notably, the agenda-setting effect cuts across party ideologies, indicating mainstream parties’ impact on the rise of the far right in democracies."

Visual characteristics affect people’s preferences, but it is difficult to measure the extent of this effect precisely and concisely in surveys. We present a new adaptive design that measures the impact of visual characteristics on people’s preferences: The plot staircase. We apply it to graphs of time series data, identifying the effect of the slope of a sequence on evaluations of the sequence. The plot staircase replicates the existing finding that people have a strong preference for increasing trends. Using fewer survey questions than past approaches, it measures at the individual level how much overall welfare a survey respondent is willing to sacrifice for an increasing trend. We demonstrate the flexibility of the plot staircase across domains (economic growth, jobs creation, and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout) and across sequence characteristics. Survey measurement is more difficult for concepts that cannot be represented textually or numerically; our method enables researchers to measure preferences for graphical properties not reducible to the individual pieces of information."

I test this theory in two preregistered vignette experiments on a sample of American Christians. Results show that elite cues significantly affect identification: negative cues notably decrease identification, especially among individuals without strong pre-existing beliefs. These findings demonstrate that elite discourse plays a powerful and enduring role in shaping public support for Christian Nationalism."

This reflects a long-standing interest in intergroup relations within public opinion studies and calls for a broad theoretical framework that considers many ingroup/outgroup categorizations as potential disruptors of public sphere processes. By implementing a comprehensive and systematic review of peer-reviewed research on affective polarization (N = 458), we find that nearly one-third of publications extend the concept beyond political parties to encompass divides such as opinion-based, ideological, racial, territorial, and religious identities. After identifying key points of convergence and divergence between interparty and beyond-party research, we conducted a metatheoretical analysis of works that go beyond parties (N = 142) to classify the social groups potentially subject to affective polarization, the factors influencing the public salience of such identities, and the predominant observation methods and measurements. The results support a more dynamic understanding of identity salience in the public sphere and highlight challenges related to terminology and methodological compatibility across different approaches. Overall, the study reveals a growing interest in various forms of intergroup hostility that connects to broader contemporary concerns about democratic values."

    "abstract": "Pollsters and journalists in the United States often make generalized statements about the state of the country, in particular, its “mood” or “sentiment.” The claims often rely on responses to survey questions asking about the state of the country. Little is known about the ebb and flow of this sentiment, however. This paper develops a measure of public sentiment, pooling results of thousands of polls between 2000 and 2021. It then develops an analogous measure of media sentiment based on a content analysis of millions of network television news transcripts. Analyses explore differences across data sources (i.e., polling houses and television networks) and consider the relationship between public and media sentiment. Results suggest that the measures are correlated concurrently, and there is some evidence that public sentiment responds to earlier media coverage. However, connections between the measures wax and wane over time, highlighting the potential importance of accounting for time-varying parameters in the study of public opinion and media effects."

    "abstract": "This study investigates individuals’ lay definitions—naïve mental representations—of artificial intelligence (AI). Two national surveys in the United States explored lay definitions of AI in the workplace (Study 1) and in everyday life (Study 2) using both open- and closed-ended questions. Open-ended responses were analyzed with natural language processing, and quantitative survey data identified factors associated with these definitions. Results show that conceptions of AI differed by context: workers emphasized efficiency and automation in the workplace, while the general public linked AI to diverse everyday technologies. Across both groups, conceptions remained nuanced yet limited. Sociodemographic factors and personality traits were related to sentiments expressed in definitions, and greater trust in AI predicted more positive sentiments. These findings underscore the need for targeted training and education to foster a more comprehensive public understanding of what AI is and what it can do across different contexts."

    "abstract": "Process tracing and process modeling are the two primary behavioral approaches for uncovering human decision-making processes. However, both approaches face significant limitations: process tracing offers a large and oftentimes confusing number of measures, while process modeling relies on a minimal number of comparable trials for reliable model fitting. In our study, we explore how we can combine mouse cursor tracking and the drift diffusion model (DDM) in order to both reduce the number of cursor measures and circumvent the minimal trial amount requirements of DDM fitting. One hundred three participants completed 90 trials in a random dot kinematogram (RDK). A total of 18 cursor measures were taken from the mouse cursor tracking literature and used to predict drift rate, threshold separation, and non-decision time of the DDM via partial least squares regression. Four cursor measures contributed significantly to the prediction of the DDM parameters. When reducing the available trials, these cursor measures, in combination with response time and accuracy, performed better and remained more stable in the prediction of DDM parameters than model fitting. Our results lower the barrier for applying mouse cursor tracking for novice researchers by highlighting important cursor measures and their mapping to psychological constructs of decision-making, while also offering an approach for behavioral scientists to investigate DDM components in experimental setups with a restricted number of trials."
