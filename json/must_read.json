    "abstract": "Following the widely noticed launch of ChatGPT 3.5 in November 2022, an unprecedented number of users have started to experiment with generative AI for communication purposes. Prior studies have shown how users are commodified by platforms, and the unprecedented development of generative AI raises hence once again questions of platform dynamics vs user agency. In this study, we argue that platformized generative AI (GenAI) actively ‘talks back’ to their users, prompting them to act accordingly. Theoretically, we develop the concept of data reflectivity as a critical lens, showing that users exhibit reflective practices. These allow them to reflect upon their own role in relation to platformized GenAI and thus alter their patterns of action. The empirical case study, carried out in Spring 2023, draws on a survey with 60 early adopters and 14 subsequent semi-structured interviews, collected in an NGO operating in Southeast Asia. The thematic analysis shows that users relate to platformized GenAI in three distinct but related ways: (1) as a happy helper to organize and systematize knowledge and information; (2) as a creative tool to generate ideas; and (3) as a conversation partner for personal and life-related matters. In conclusion, we discuss the findings critically in relation to overall platform dynamics and the notion of systems ‘speaking back’ and further suggest that future research should aim to bring the two research fields of datafication and user studies even closer together."

    "abstract": "Popular social media platforms in China, such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu (REDnote), use machine learning algorithms to curate personalized feeds and enforce content moderation. But the opacity of such algorithms introduces socially consequential and often problematic mechanisms of classification. Given the playful resistance of queer individuals against a normative social environment, the interaction between algorithms and content creators warrants close examination. This study investigates how LGBTQ+ content creators navigate these algorithm-driven platforms, focusing on their negotiation of digital normativity to share non-heterosexual content and foster queer sociality in China. Avoiding the oversimplification of viewing algorithms and those implementing them as monolithic entities, I explore how content creators creatively manage to produce and distribute their work within the constraints of these platforms, and even by playing with these constraints. I collected data from an ethnography on algorithms, interviews, and an open-source investigation into recommendation algorithms, through a scavenge approach. I argue that LGBTQ+ content creators engage with algorithms in ways that are simultaneously non-conforming and non-confrontational. They imagine algorithmic effects, appropriate outcomes, and play with the opacity of machine learning to navigate three aspects of digital normativity in China: heteronormativity, Internet civilization, and commercialization. Empirically, I identified three strategies used to create and expand queer sociality within these constraints: camouflaging, filtering, and verticalizing. Theoretically, I introduce ‘workarounds’ as a framework that transcends the binary perspectives of conformity and resistance in discussions of authoritarian governance, algorithmic control, and user-platform interaction."

This includes the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms, which has the potential to undermine democracy. Against this background, the paper argues that the role of PSM should be expanded beyond the core tasks of high-quality, diverse and impartial reporting. PSM should increasingly also act as institutions that monitor social media, evaluate, and validate external information. In addition, they should engage in enhancing media literacy and developing genuine PSM platforms. The paper discusses the opportunities and limitations of each approach and addresses prerequisites for PSM, such as political independence and societal trust. It thus contributes to the understanding how PSM can continue to fulfil their democratic role under new conditions."

    "abstract": "Previous theorizing suggests that the first stage of self-disclosure is the pursuit of an interpersonal goal. However, among individuals disclosing a concealable stigmatized identity, little is known about how their goals impact downstream processes such as language use and post-disclosure affect. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), we examined the extent to which primed self-image or compassionate goals influence the linguistic content and style of disclosure, as well as dyad members’ affective states. Self-image disclosures were high in negative self-focused attention, whereas compassionate disclosures were more inclusive and positive in valence. Moreover, among disclosers, negative emotion words predicted their own negative affect. Among confidants, first-person singular and second-person pronouns predicted negative affect, however, this outcome was inversely related to disclosers’ use of social words. Compassionate goals that seek mutually beneficial outcomes may help disclosers communicate information about their stigma more effectively, and attenuate dyad members’ feelings of emotional distress."

We selected 10 countries with the highest Human Development Index (HDI) and 10 countries with the lowest. The sentiment analysis provided scores indicating the degree of positivity in the descriptions of these countries provided by ChatGPT. The results revealed that ChatGPT generally expressed positive sentiments about all countries. However, strong evidence emerged showing that countries with high HDI received more positive sentiments compared to those with low HDI. These findings highlight the bias of the model in describing developed versus developing countries. Ultimately, the study highlights the importance of adjusting large language models to ensure fairer representations of countries."

The use of polysystem theory offers a new theoretical perspective to media research and explains the findings."

First, because Ethiopia is ruled by an authoritarian government, which restricts the information environment, and second, because the conflict in northern Ethiopia that erupted in November 2020 has made disinformation more rampant, and its implications deadly. But fact-checking in Ethiopia is the product not only of the work of Ethiopian organizations: local fact-checkers international allies and funders also play important roles. This article explores the practice of fact-checking by local organizations and the challenges they encounter in this work in an authoritarian, conflict-affected context. It also serves as a case study shedding light on the interplay between Ethiopian fact-checking organizations and their allies in the international development sector. Local and international organizations have distinct positions within the fact-checking ecosystem and funder (grantee relationships, and funders, at times, compound local organizations’ challenges). This research reflects information gathered through semi-structured interviews with local fact-checkers and their international allies, as well as a qualitative content analysis of publicly available materials and social media channels. Its findings imply that local fact-checking organizations, their funders, and allied international organizations interact in complex ways in challenging environments."

    "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in studying the appeal of digital games. However, there is still a call for further research, especially on the theoretical and methodological advancements. Hence, a novel approach and a concept of the Digital Gaming Relationship (DGR) is presented. The DGR model is adapted from earlier work on physical activity and with the central concept as “meaning,” it provides an alternative perspective to motivation-oriented literature for the field of game studies. With this approach, the fundamental view is that each person has a varying relationship with digital games and gaming over their life span. The relationship builds on the individual’s encounters with the social world of digital gaming and its cultural meanings. In the long term, accruing digital gaming-related knowledge, experiences, and emotional connections contributes to a rich tapestry of meaning, thus creating a deep and meaningful relationship capable of shaping one’s actions, behaviors, and even identity. The framework theorizes the mechanisms of an individual’s socialization process to the digital gaming world and illustrates that the relationship with digital games includes much more than just playing them. In this article, the theoretical roots and key concepts of the DGR are introduced, and the practical applicability of the approach is discussed."

This manuscript shares the results of a mixed methods survey of individuals (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 751) recruited via online forums who recalled their experiences playing as female game characters. We analyzed qualitative response data using a traditional, top-down approach to identify themes. We focus our analysis and discussion on the results of a human-derived analysis, which indicated both positive and negative dimensions of experiences that participants found meaningful. Participants reported that taking on the role of a female character was often very important to them, but the reason for this significance varied across players. Often, these reasons involved their own gender identities and the context in which the gameplay occurred (e.g., online multiplayer). We consider findings as evidence of eudaimonic media effects."

An online survey was conducted among 1337 Belgian respondents, of which 78.4% were female ( M age = 21.64 years, SD = 3.57 years). Structural equation modeling showed that positive attitude and injunctive norms, higher descriptive norms, and greater perceived behavioral control regarding active bystander behaviors in the context of NCFS were related to youth’s intention to engage in such active bystander behaviors, which in turn was related to actual active bystander behavior. Differences were found based on youth’s empathy levels, though no sex differences were found. The findings provide a critical foundation for highly needed intervention approaches and educational curricula seeking to diminish the occurrence of NCFS in youth."

    "abstract": "Changes in global journalism are reflected in myriad cross-national professionalization efforts, including the development and exportation of models for journalism practice. Literature on peace journalism, for instance, suggests that its adaptation across contexts is shaped by forces on several levels, including the influence of individual media practitioners. However, little research examines those likely to practice peace journalism nor the implications of these social profiles on the diffusion of the model more broadly. Drawing on field theory and 20 in-depth interviews with East African journalists conducted between 2020 and 2021, this study explores such questions by identifying shared dimensions of position and habitus across those who attend peace journalism trainings. Findings suggest that these individuals tend to be well educated, share common experiences with conflict, and hold similar interventionist role conceptions. Such findings illuminate the types of social transformations peace journalism may undergo as it is adapted across contexts, with implications for journalism theory and practice."

As the study of this phenomenon has so far largely focused on traces of such campaigns on social media itself, we know relatively little about the people and networks implementing them. Furthermore, existing literature offers limited analytical handles to delineate and analyze different forms of influence operations. To address these challenges, we employ interviews with fifty-two members of the “cyber troops” implementing such operations in Indonesia. On the basis of this material, we propose that three key features—being secretly funded, highly coordinated, and involving mostly anonymous accounts—distinguish cyber troops from other types of domestic influence operations. In Indonesia cyber troops involve transient, project-based collaborations among freelancing individuals, not coincidentally mirroring the character of the country’s election campaigns. This rapidly growing industry is cementing the already oligarchic character of Indonesia’s democracy."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic heightened burdens on caregivers, but also the visibility of caregiving inequalities. These grievances may activate a feminist identity which in turn leads to greater civic and political participation. During a pandemic, online forms of participation are particularly attractive as they require less effort than offline forms of participation and pose less health risks compared to collective forms of offline activism. Using survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom) collected in 2019 (prior to the pandemic), 2021 (during the pandemic), and 2023 (post-pandemic), we examine the relationship between self-identifying as a feminist and signing online petitions ( n = 18,362). Our multivariate analyses show that having a feminist identity is positively related to signing online petitions. We consider the differential effects of this identity on participation for men, women, non-binary people; caregivers versus non-caregivers; and respondents in different countries with varying levels of restrictions due to the pandemic. A feminist identity is more important for mobilizing caregivers than non-caregivers, whether or not the caregiver is a man or a woman. While grievance theory suggests differential effects by country and time period, we find a consistent role of feminist identity in predicting the signing of online petitions across time and across countries. These findings offer insights into how different groups in varying contexts are mobilized to participate."

The study explores the impact of online interactions on opinion dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a hybrid content and network analysis approach, the research identifies distinct subcommunities within the TCM debate and analyzes the influence of opinion leaders and user participation. The study finds a high level of cyberbalkanization, with users forming segregated communities based on their views towards TCM. However, contrary to expectations, the overall polarization levels do not increase monotonically over time, despite fluctuations during peak discussion periods. Further analysis reveals that the influx of moderate views from low-engagement users during heated debates counterbalances the extreme rhetoric of high-engagement partisan users. The longitudinal patterns suggest a potential convergence of views between the entrenched and peripheral users over time. These findings highlight the nuanced interplay between cyberbalkanization and polarization within online communities, challenging assumptions of an inevitable polarizing effect. The study underscores the importance of considering user heterogeneity and temporal dynamics when examining opinion polarization in digital spaces, offering insights into the complex forces shaping public discourse in the contemporary media environment."

The decades-old contact hypothesis suggests that cross-partisan interactions might reduce intolerance if individuals interact with equal social status. Here we test this idea by implementing collaborative contact between 1,227 pairs of citizens (2,454 individuals) with opposing partisan sympathies in Mexico, using the online medium to credibly randomize participants’ relative social status within the interaction. Interacting under both equal and unequal status enhanced tolerant behaviour immediately after contact; however, 3 weeks later, only the salutary effects of equal contact endured. These results demonstrate that a simple, scalable intervention that puts people on equal footing can reduce partisan polarization and make online contact into a prosocial force."

The platform company’s strategic traffic allocation acted as an accelerator, enhancing the sympathetic responses of individuals, but it did not drive the entire surge in food orders. Protests resulting in severe injuries and those linked to demands for defunding the police diminished the positive sympathetic responses, highlighting a potential risk associated with protests. Our study provides large-scale, micro-level evidence that social movements and increased sympathy can foster collective actions to support marginalized communities."

    "abstract": "Nearly five billion people use and receive news through social media and there is widespread concern about the negative consequences of misinformation on social media (e.g., election interference, vaccine hesitancy). Despite a burgeoning body of research on misinformation, it remains largely unclear who is susceptible to misinformation and why. To address this, we conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 US-based participants across 31 experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from response bias, that is, the tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). Across all studies, participants were well above-chance accurate for both true (68.51%) and false (67.24%) news headlines. We find that older age, higher analytical thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Additionally, older age and higher analytical thinking skills are associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency (alignment of participants’ ideology with news), motivated reflection (higher analytical thinking skills being associated with a greater congruency effect), and self-reported familiarity with news are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety). We also find that experiments on MTurk show higher discrimination ability than those on Lucid. Displaying sources alongside news headlines is associated with improved discrimination ability, with Republicans benefiting more from source display. Our results provide critical insights that can help inform the design of targeted interventions."

    "abstract": "We develop a game-theoretic model of strategic interdependence and tipping in public policy choices and show that the model can be estimated by probit and logit estimators. We test its validity and applicability by using daily data on state-level COVID-19 responses in the United States. Social distancing via shelter-in-place (SIP) strategies and wearing masks emerged as the most effective nonpharmaceutical ways of combatting COVID-19. In the United States, choices about these policies are made by individual states. We develop a game-theoretic model of such choices and test it econometrically, confirming strong interdependence in the implementation of these policies. If enough states engage in social distancing or mask wearing, others will be tipped to follow suit. Policy choices are influenced mainly by the choices of other states, especially those of similar political orientation and to a lesser degree by the number of new COVID-19 cases. The choice of mask-wearing policies is more sensitive to peer choices than the choice of SIP policies, and Republican states are much less likely than Democratic to introduce mask-wearing policies. The choices of policies are influenced more by political than public health considerations. These findings emphasize strategic interdependence in policy choice and offer an analytical framework for these complex dynamics."
