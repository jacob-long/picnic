In an experiment, participants imagined breaking up with an abusive romantic partner, breaking up with a nonabusive partner, or not breaking up. Then they indicated their likelihood of using various channels (i.e., face-to-face conversation, texting, social media, voice call, and video call) to communicate with their partner, responded to perceived social affordances measures for each channel, and provided insights in an open-ended prompt. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed. Results reveal that face-to-face communication is often preferred for dyadic relational dissolution processes, as bandwidth, social presence, and a lack of accessibility can convey a sense of seriousness and respect for the non-initiator while preventing miscommunication. However, mediated channels offer protection from emotional manipulation (for abusive relationships), physical violence (for abusive relationships), and awkward situations (for nonabusive relationships) thanks to their unique combinations of affordances."

Migrants subjected to the dual border-and-boundary work of Western host countries and their non-Western home countries make for complicated self–other boundary narratives. This study explores the everyday boundary work of migrants originating from Hong Kong, a former British colony, who have chosen to relocate to the UK through the British National (Overseas) (BN[O]) visa scheme. The scheme was catalysed by the 2019 political upheaval in Chinese Hong Kong and the UK–Hong Kong colonial affiliation. Through the lens of dis/connection assemblage, we conceptualise digital dis/connections as a form of boundary work and conduct in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of 14 BN(O)s. We demonstrate that digital disconnection can be seen as a socio-political practice related to identity regulation by situating BN(O)s’ digital media practices within the political projects of belonging in the UK, Hong Kong, and China. Through a matrix of disconnected approaches, BN(O)s shape boundaries around identity politics in terms of social positions, a sense of belonging, and social relations. The political meaning of digital disconnection is highlighted through its fracture of connected space-time and resilient management of social relationships&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;"

    "abstract": "This study investigates how prior experiences (personal or a close other’s) influence individuals’ engagement with virtual reality (VR) stories designed to promote understanding and foster prosocial behavior. Integrating self-determination theory and self–other overlap, we conducted an experimental mixed-method study with 35 participants who experienced three VR stories focused on inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA): living with Alzheimer’s, blindness, and in a refugee camp. Findings indicate that while participants felt some autonomy with the VR headset, they experienced a lack of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the storytelling. Participants engaged in perspective-taking but often thought about those close to them who had similar experiences rather than themselves. Thus, a close other’s experience affected whether people engaged in perspective-taking. However, prior experience with IDEA topics did not predict cognitive effort, indicating that individuals with such experience do not exert more cognitive effort than those without it. Additionally, cognitive effort did not predict prosocial attitudes or behaviors. This study highlights the complexities of how previous experiences affect engagement with IDEA-centered VR, perspective-taking, and cognitive effort and suggests directions for future research."

Using a case study approach and selecting nine cases across five countries (Russia, Brazil, India, China, and Singapore), we identify the most common distinguishable attributes and tactics associated with this ambiguous collection of actors. In addition to identifying how fringe fact-checkers weaponize fact-checking practices and exploit or mimic the social standing of accredited fact-checkers, we critique examples where state-supported fact-checkers associated with authoritarian governance structures fact-check for national interests. We propose a spectrum of fact-checkers including those where public or general interest fact-checkers follow journalistic ideals and align with accredited communities of practice or non-accredited peer recognition, and a collection of fringe fact-checkers ranging from “special interest” actors promoting specific political agendas to hostile actors with disruptive, destructive, and openly propagandistic interests and aims to destabilize the global public sphere. The article contributes to current research and debates about the institutionalization of fact-checking and the understudied area of fact-checking impersonation, a problematic activity associated with misinformation and propaganda on platforms and the internet."

There are two main motivations and two main contributions. The first motivation is that analyses of social media features have not included treatment of features for interpersonal disconnectivity; the second is that analyses of interpersonal disconnectivity have not included reference to the features that enable it. The two main contributions are the disambiguation of a confusing terminological field, thus making it possible to analytically distinguish between types of feature, and an intervention in the question of whether the features described in the article concern filtering &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt; or avoiding &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;. Data were collected from 37 social media platforms and other services that enable digitally-mediated communication. Features for interpersonal disconnectivity were documented and then the features were grouped based on five questions about their use, where A is the person using the feature, and B is the target of A’s use of the feature: (a) Does it affect A’s feed?; (b) does it affect B’s feed?; (c) is A still connected to B?; (d) is B still connected to A?; (e) can A and B see each other’s profile?"

    "abstract": "The move from political fact-checking to a “public health” or debunking model of fact-checking, sustained by policies and funding from platforms, highlights important tensions in the case of Covid-19. Building on findings from studies focused on journalistic role performance, we investigated how professional fact-checkers in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa conceived of and performed their professional roles when addressing Covid-19 vaccination topics. Interviews with fact-checkers from six well-established, Meta-affiliated, International Fact-Checking Network-accredited organizations operating in these regions indicated that fact-checkers recognized the diversification of tasks and new roles associated with addressing problematic content from social media users. However, fact-checkers expressed unanimous commitment to prioritizing political and media watchdog activities in response to problematic Covid-19 vaccine information spreading from elite sources. To compare these role conceptions with role performance, we conducted a content analysis of Covid-19 vaccine content posted in 2021 to these fact-checkers’ Facebook accounts. We found that content was mostly associated with explainers or debunking content (addressing hoaxes or rumors about Covid-19 vaccines from non-elite social media users). In particular, the abundance of explainers, compared with other genres of fact-checking content, aligns fact-checkers with professional roles as civic service providers, educators, and “interpreters” of health information. Only a small proportion of the Covid-19 vaccine-related posts from each fact-checker contained verifications of claims from authoritative (elite “top-down”) sources (i.e., politicians, media, and health/science professionals). This study offers insights into a particularly tumultuous time of political activity in these regions and considers implications for practice innovation."

It examines how this change affects social media herding behavior—the tendency of users to align with the majority opinion. We adopted a mixed-method approach, incorporating an online experiment that simulates the YouTube interface and an Interrupted Time Series analysis of real-world user reactions, to assess how the policy affects user engagement. Specifically, we looked at how the absence of one-sided digital cues, combined with content characteristics and individual user predispositions, influences user behavior. Our findings suggest that YouTube’s initiative to boost platform positivity had limited success: user responses were more influenced by their ideological leanings than by visible digital cues; Hiding dislikes reduced commenting frequencies and inadvertently increased negative expression. These results highlight the stronger role of ideological beliefs over social cues in shaping engagement, challenging the presumed impact of audience conformity and the negativity bias on social media dynamics."

Inspired by the social contagion theory, we introduce the concept of narrative contagion—where a story shared by a person or organization prompts others to share their stories—and investigate its process and outcome in online cancer communities. Utilizing a large dataset of 849 Facebook posts, 47,291 comments, and 14,466 replies, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational analysis provides evidence for narrative contagion among individual users in organization-hosted cancer communities on Facebook. It also reveals different organizational message characteristics, such as emotional arousal, post topic, and request for storytelling, that affect user storytelling and emotional support in comments and replies. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of digital storytelling and its collective dynamics in online communities."

While previous research has recognized the existence of gender stereotypes and discrimination in online spaces, little attention has been given to how technological affordances impact—or are perceived to impact—incidents of CSH. By employing a theoretical framework of technological affordances, this study reveals that users often perceive affordances differently from how they utilize them, indicating a misalignment between perception and behavior. Our analysis of interviews with 30 remote knowledge workers extends affordances theory by showing that affordances are not always applied in the ways they are perceived, and that power dynamics and structural inequalities outweigh technological affordances in shaping reporting behaviors. Addressing this perception–reality gap is crucial for developing interventions and policies that accurately reflect the realities of CSH experiences and promote a safe online work environment."

    "abstract": "Dating apps have changed the way people establish contact with potential romantic partners. However, more and more dating apps use algorithms to keep their users’ engagement high. Studies suggest that trust in algorithms can shape offline dating experiences. We theorize that excessive swiping, driven by fear of missing out, predicts trust. We also explore the role of decision fatigue. Findings from a two-wave panel study with N Time2 = 521 young dating app users suggest that the fear of missing out on potential romantic partners was positively related to decision fatigue on dating apps. Moreover, excessive swiping and decision fatigue were positively related to trust in algorithms. No reciprocal effects of trust in algorithms on excessive swiping or decision fatigue were observed. It seems that trust in algorithms might present some kind of relief strategy for compulsive behaviors such as excessively swiping, or for negative feelings such as decision fatigue."

This will more readily happen if their experiences are safe, secure, and positive. We analyze data from a nationally representative sample of 5005, 13- to 17-year-olds in the United States to measure their experiences of 12 specific harms on VR platforms, and which protective strategies they employed to prevent or respond to them. Girls were more likely to be sexually harassed and to experience grooming/predatory behavior, and were more likely to have been targeted specifically because of their gender. Finally, girls were more likely to engage in some specific protective measures online, but overall both boys and girls use platform safety mechanisms infrequently. We discuss enhancements in policy, content moderation, and feature sets that can serve to better safeguard youth in the metaverse."

Adopting a conditional effects approach, this research shows that transience-themed posts and motivation-themed posts on social media—which are both considered eudaimonic—are appreciated by different groups of people. Study 1 found a moderating influence of impermanence acceptance: People who had greater impermanence acceptance were more likely to have eudaimonic responses after viewing transience-themed posts than after viewing motivation-themed posts. The Japanese concept of mono no aware, or beauty in pathos, was used to motivate study 2. Study 2 found that people who viewed transience-themed posts experienced greater impermanence appreciation than people who viewed motivation-themed posts, but media theme did not influence impermanence awareness or impermanence acceptance."

We found that only about two in five people were able to define preprints in ways that align with scholarly conceptualizations of the term, although participants provided a wide array of “other” definitions of preprints that suggest at least a partial understanding of the term. Providing participants with a definition of preprints in a news article helped improve preprint understanding for the student sample, but not for the general population. Our findings shed light on misperceptions that the public has about preprints, underscoring the importance of better education about the nature of preprint research."

The distribution of concerns and governance preferences across these classes was investigated. This added to previous research by indicating the degree to which extant concerns (e.g. corporate profiteering, discrimination by insurers) are held by different segments of the community. Based on the governance mechanisms that had widespread support across segments, the following recommendations are made to develop a trusted Australian genomic repository: the repository cannot be solely profit-driven; can utilise an access committee; protections (e.g. ensuring confidentiality of donors) may not require new legislation; data users cannot retain data for future research; the public should remain informed about the intended and/or actual benefits of research."

    "abstract": "Multinomial processing tree (MPT) models are prominent and frequently used tools to model and measure cognitive processes underlying responses in many experimental paradigms. Although MPT models typically refer to cognitive processes within single individuals, they have often been applied to group data aggregated across individuals. We investigate the conditions under which MPT analyses of aggregate data make sense. After introducing the notions of structural and empirical aggregation invariance of MPT models, we show that any MPT model that holds at the level of single individuals must also hold at the aggregate level when it is both structurally and empirically aggregation invariant. Moreover, group-level parameters of aggregation-invariant MPT models are equivalent to the expected values (i.e., means) of the corresponding individual parameters. To investigate the robustness of MPT results for aggregate data when one or both invariance conditions are violated, we additionally performed a series of simulation studies, systematically manipulating (1) the sample sizes in different trees of the model, (2) model parameterization, (3) means and variances of crucial model parameters, and (4) their correlations with other parameters of the respective MPT model. Overall, our results show that MPT parameter estimates based on aggregate data are trustworthy under rather general conditions, provided that a few preconditions are met."
