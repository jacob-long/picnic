    "abstract": "This study conducts a conceptual replication and extension of prior research on overconfidence in discerning political misinformation, shifting focus to health. Using data from a national survey of American adults linked to web-browsing records (N=593), we investigated the prevalence and correlates of overconfidence in this domain. Consistent with earlier findings, overconfidence was most pronounced among low-performing individuals, replicating the “Dunning–Kruger Effect.” However, decomposition analyses revealed that the associations between overconfidence and behavioral correlates—exposure to low-credibility health websites and belief in cancer-related misinformation—are primarily accounted for by deficits in actual discernment ability rather than a lack of metacognitive insight. This replication highlights the robustness of the link between poor discernment and behavioral outcomes across domains. These results highlight the need for interventions that improve evaluation skills or address underlying dispositional factors, such as distrust in science and conspiracist worldviews."

    "abstract": "Despite a rise in identity-centric communication scholarship, there is a lack of theory and evidence regarding how media use relates to the on-going alignment between political and social identities (i.e., identity alignment). We offer a framework for theorizing this dynamic and apply it to examine the relationship between Americans’ media diets and on-going psychological alignment between political and social identities in the United States (i.e., partisan social sorting). We use data from 33,690 American respondents from three national surveys: one longitudinal (1972–2020) and two fielded in 2020. There is evidence that identity alignment (i.e., sorting) has grown over time, but only among those who are most interested and attentive to politics and media. In 2020 surveys, we find no evidence that the frequency of media use was a significant predictor of social sorting. Instead, the composition of individuals’ media diets predicted the alignment between their social and political identities."

    "abstract": "Trends are a common feature in the contemporary media and cultural environment as well as media and communication research. Yet trends remain undertheorized. This article seeks to address this gap. Rather than just a synonym for shift or change, I define trend as a temporally bounded, dynamic pattern of observable change and argue that such a concept deserves greater prominence within the study of media and communication. In addition to this definition, I theorize trends by characterizing the trend’s key features, exploring its relationship to media, and mapping its connection to questions that animate media and communication research. The case of “brat summer” of 2024 is offered as an exemplary case from which trend’s core features may be discerned. The article’s primary contribution is to advance the trend as a central concept through which communication and media studies researchers may think more comprehensively and critically about change."

    "abstract": "The rapid dissemination of misinformation has raised concerns about its persistence despite corrective efforts, as the influence of fact-checking often diminishes quickly. This study explores “time” as a central theoretical and methodological construct in understanding the effects of fact-checking interventions. Across two large-scale, pre-registered panel experiments (N = 6,983), we examine the temporal dynamics of both the persuasive and unintended consequences of factual corrections. Results show that while fact-checks yield immediate belief updating, their effects largely fade within two weeks and do not produce durable belief echoes. In Study 2, we introduce a novel design treating time lag as an experimental treatment and show that simple interventions aimed at increasing the temporal accessibility of corrections—termed “accuracy reminders”—significantly extend the durability of their effects. These findings reconceptualize correction effects as inherently temporal processes, advancing communication theory and offering scalable, time-sensitive strategies for sustaining the influence of fact-checking in dynamic information environments."

Specifically, our study examines how differences in two perceived affordances—persistence and visibility—affect how women viewers evaluate the authenticity of men who post allyship messages on Instagram. Additionally, we examine how viewer perceptions of comment deletion and comment restriction impact source evaluations. Results indicate that greater perceived persistence and visibility led women viewers to rate ostensible allies as more authentic and less self-interested. Moreover, comment deletion and restriction were found to partially affect how viewers evaluated ally authenticity and motive, providing additional support to warranting theory. Implications for promoting prosocial messaging and digital allyship online are discussed."

In a preregistered between-subjects survey experiment on U.K. WhatsApp users ( N = 2,580), we showed participants WhatsApp messages containing true or false news attributed to either British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News or no source. Attribution to BBC News significantly increased message credibility. Importantly, however, participants’ responses to false messages attributed to BBC News were statistically indistinguishable from their responses to true messages. On personal messaging, source credibility can boost the spread of accurate news but can also be used deceptively to propagate falsehoods."

Results show that while perceived national security threats predicted ban support only in the national security condition, concerns about free speech violations consistently decreased support across all conditions. An analysis of open-ended responses further demonstrated that participants adopted the framing language consistent with their experimental condition. Findings suggest that personal value framing in the media, especially those related to free speech values, plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on social media regulation policies. We thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how media framing influences policy preferences for emerging digital governance issues such as social media regulations. Other implications were also discussed."

However, these systems are subject to concerns regarding inherent biases, as their training on vast text corpora may encode and amplify societal biases. This study investigates overestimation bias in LLM-generated climate assessments, wherein the impacts of climate change are exaggerated relative to expert consensus. Through non-parametric statistical methods, the study compares expert ratings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report with responses from GPT-family LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs systematically overestimate climate change impacts, and that this bias is more pronounced when the models are prompted in the role of a climate scientist. These findings underscore the critical need to align LLM-generated climate assessments with expert consensus to prevent misperception and foster informed public discourse."

    "abstract": "Democratic citizenship is continuously evolving, shaped by changing political, social, and media contexts. Digital natives—those who have come of age in environments where digital technologies are embedded in everyday life—have experienced citizenship in markedly different ways than previous generations. While the internet has broadened the repertoire of participatory behaviors, existing research has struggled to capture the complexity of contemporary citizenship. Drawing on deliberative systems theory and a triadic framework of citizenship—examining normative expectations, behaviors, and attitudes—this study develops a nuanced exploration of citizenship orientations. Using an innovative questionnaire and latent profile analysis of survey data from Norwegian digital natives (aged 18–40), we identify seven distinct citizenship types that reveal the multidimensional nature of contemporary citizenship. Our research moves beyond binary distinctions between active and passive citizenship, emphasizing the importance of both expressive and receptive behaviors across online and offline contexts. By highlighting the diverse roles citizens play in sustaining democratic processes, we offer new insights into citizenship in the digital age, demonstrating how different citizens contribute to the democratic system through varied and interdependent forms of engagement."

Using secondary data consisting of comments shared over a 3-week period to an online news community, we identified three sequences that reflect collective incivility practices. Whereas the persistent incivility sequence included a large proportion of uncivil comments, incivility occurred infrequently in the sporadic incivility sequence and not at all in the no incivility sequence. Once the persistent incivility or sporadic incivility sequences appeared, discussions were more likely to return to these sequences than the no incivility sequence. Contrary to our predictions, sequences containing incivility shaped discussion processes by depressing explicit expressions of agreement and disagreement. The results of this study demonstrate how the collective behavior of online community members contributes to the production and effects of incivility."

Platform owners invest heavily in research and development to both identify and elicit feelings and emotions. However, the research conducted by these companies on this topic remains understudied. In this study, we present a systematic and critical analysis of the scientific literature published by the research teams of Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google (YouTube) regarding the analysis and processing of their users’ emotions. We first demonstrate that this literature relies on schematic definitions of emotions, thereby simplifying the complexity of affective phenomena for facilitating their automated detection. We then highlight the objectives pursued by these research efforts, the majority of which aim to promote users’ well-being through the instrumentalization of what affects them. Finally, we examine the various methods employed to identify emotions, which primarily serve to feed these platforms’ machine learning algorithms with data labeled as emotional. Beyond their scientific contributions, we consider these studies as narratives targeted at the scientific community and investors, serving to legitimize and support the development of specific innovations. Analyzing these works enables us to examine how the techniques, methods, and applications developed by these two companies commodify emotions and actively shape users’ online behaviors."

Our results underscore the multiplicity of challenges facing climate action."

One tool to improve majority-minority relations is Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs), which document historical injustices. We collect data before and after the release of the Norwegian TRC report on the treatment of the Sámi and other national minorities, which allows us to investigate its effects on reconciliatory attitudes. We further leverage the unrelated outbreak of demonstrations against current injustices, allowing us to examine responses to both past and current injustices. We find greater support for some aspects of reconciliation, but mainly in areas with a small presence of national minorities. Our results show the limits of TRCs when current conflicts shape the interpretation of historical injustice."

    "abstract": "What are the repressive consequences of civil society participation in international human rights complaints mechanisms? Such mechanisms allow civil society actors to make governments’ human rights violations known to international organizations. International organizations can respond by ‘naming and shaming’ states. We expect that complaint-based shaming increases repression against civil society organizations (CSOs). In particular, governments exploit the specific and personalized information contained in complaint-based shaming to repress challengers and deter future complaints. We test our theory with three studies – (i) a cross-national analysis, (ii) a CSO-level analysis with original survey data, and (iii) a media-based analysis – using multiple identification strategies, including instrumental variables. Our evidence shows that shaming in response to complaints has detrimental effects for CSOs in both democracies and autocracies. Our findings highlight that personalized shaming creates the risk of targeted reprisals and call for reforms that take this risk more seriously."

We assess the quality of an answer based on how easily and accurately it can be recognized among a random set of candidate answers given the question’s text. This measure reflects the answer’s relevance and depth of engagement with the question. Drawing a parallel with semantic search, we can implement this approach by training a language model on the corpus of observed questions and answers without additional human-labeled data. We showcase and validate our methodology within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our analysis reveals that while some answers only have a weak semantic connection to questions, suggesting some evasion or obfuscation, they are generally at least moderately relevant, far exceeding what we would expect from random replies. We also find meaningful correlations between the quality of answers and the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions."

We track a representative sample of Spanish citizens before, during, and after the pandemic, with eight survey waves from January 2020 to January 2024. We compare democratic attitudes before and after the pandemic with individual fixed effects models. We identify a sharp increase in preferences for technical rather than ideological policy-making at the very onset of the pandemic, as well as significant changes in voters’ preferences for competent rather than honest politicians. These changes are sudden and persistent over 4 years. Using a set of repeated survey experiments, we also document a widespread willingness to sacrifice rights and freedoms to deal with the pandemic as compared to other global threats, such as international terrorism and climate change. But this effect quickly faded over time. Overall, we identify significant changes in democratic attitudes during the pandemic and a durable shift in technocratic preferences that outlived the pandemic, setting the conditions for the long-term legacies of COVID-19 on democracy."

Does exposure to such protests influence people’s support for violence, whether from the state or protesters? To address this question, we analyze data from a multi-year panel study conducted in Chile (2016–2022) to examine how the massive demonstrations of 2019 shaped attitudes toward violence. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that exposure to protests decreases support for state repression, but only for a short time. However, such exposure does not significantly influence support for the violence perpetrated by protesters. This nuanced understanding of attitudes toward violence provides new evidence to explain the support for different forms of violent actions during social movements."

Existing experimental studies, however, have found relatively little support for that conjecture. In this note, we extend this line of research by exploring whether language impacts perceptions about unauthorized immigrants, such as their association with criminal behavior. Our study uses a conjoint design with experimentally manipulated instructions: respondents are randomly asked to identify profiles that belong to “illegal” or “undocumented” immigrants. We find that language used in the conjoint instructions does not impact perceptions about unauthorized population. At the same time, our observational results show that respondents’ preferences for terms “illegal” and “undocumented” are related to attitudes toward immigration. We discuss the implication of these results for the debate regarding the role of labels in political conflict over immigration."

Despite the increasing use of virtual reality (VR) for cognitive assessments, its efficacy for RT assessments remains uncertain. We aimed to develop and validate a novel RT test in VR, and to explore the potential contributions of VR technology to RT assessment. Forty-eight participants completed a computerized RT test (COM-RT) and a novel RT test in VR (VR-RT). The latter replicated the COM-RT test, assessing simple and choice RTs. Additionally, it introduced more complex conditions: reaching to touch static stimuli in known or unknown locations or moving stimuli. Correlations and differences between the tests and tasks were examined. Moderate-to-strong linear correlations were found between the tests for the simple ( r ≥ 0.642) and choice ( r ≥ 0.736) tasks, and the difference between them ( r ≥ 0.677) ( p &lt; 0.001). However, RTs were significantly longer in the VR-RT test compared with the COM-RT test ( p &lt; 0.001). Significant differences were found among the RT-VR tasks ( p &lt; 0.001): reaching to touch stimuli involved longer RTs compared with pressing a button, and RT was even longer when stimuli appeared in unexpected locations. Moving stimuli were associated with shorter RT. Additionally, movement velocity was significantly higher when reaching for dynamic versus static stimuli in known or unknown locations ( p &lt; 0.001). VR is valid for RT measurement, yet its outcomes should be interpreted within its framework rather than in comparison to computer assessments. Furthermore, VR offers additional possibilities, such as using lifelike stimuli and measuring kinematics."

The objective of this project was to develop the Your COVID-19 Risk tool in response to the global spread of COVID-19, aiming to promote health behaviour change. We developed an online resource based on key behavioural evidence-based risk factors related to contracting and spreading COVID-19. This tool allows for assessing risk and provides instant support to protect individuals from infection. The Risk Estimation Questions assessed users’ location, age, gender, work environment, day-to-day behaviours currently performed, and conditions under which these behaviours would change. Users were also asked to estimate how often they keep their distance from others in public and regularly wash their hands, and the procedures they follow to do so. A multidisciplinary research team of more than 150 international experts developed the tool. Over 60,000 users in more than 150 countries have assessed their risk and provided data. The majority of respondents reported that they almost always keep their distance from others in public places, and most participants reported washing their hands after touching public or shared surfaces or when entering buildings. The tool, data, and results were openly shared to support government and health agencies developing behaviour change interventions. This tool creates a blueprint for similar digital infrastructure that can be replicated and used in future pandemics."

    "abstract": "With more opportunities for diverse interactions, little is known about how social interactions involving people of different socioeconomic status (SES) may unfold. We investigated social-attunement patterns in dyadic interactions involving SES. Unacquainted adults recruited from a community in the United States interacted with similar-or-different-SES partners in the lab ( N = 130 dyads). Attunement was assessed throughout the interaction by examining physiological linkage —how much a person’s physiological change is predicted by another’s physiological change over time. Overall, low-SES participants showed stronger physiological linkage—indicating greater attunement—to partners across SES. Participants also appeared more comfortable when interacting with low-SES partners. There were no SES differences in dominance during the conversation. After the interaction, participants reported liking similar-SES partners more than different-SES partners. These patterns suggest that during interactions, lower-SES individuals are more other-focused than high-SES individuals, and in-group preference prevails. We note limitations in the racial representation of our sample."

    "abstract": "Biased media content shapes children’s social concepts and identities. We examined gender bias in a large corpus of scripts from 98 children’s television programs from the United States spanning the years 1960 to 2018 (6,600 episodes, ~2.7 million sentences, ~16 million words). We focused on agency and communion, the fundamental psychological dimensions underlying gender stereotypes. At the syntactic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) appear more often in the agent (vs. patient) role. This syntactic bias remained stable between 1960 and 2018. At the semantic level, words referring to men or boys (vs. women or girls) co-occurred more often with words denoting agency. Words denoting communion showed both stereotypical and counterstereotypical associations. Some semantic gender biases have remained unchanged or have weakened over time; others have grown. These findings suggest that gender stereotypes are built into the core of children’s stories. Whether we are closer today to gender equality in children’s media depends on where one looks."

    "abstract": "Explanations of socioeconomic inequalities in college enrollment focus on college readiness, financial constraints, and information deficits. We provide a cultural explanation of educational inequalities, arguing that disadvantaged students are deterred from applying to high-status colleges because of the shared cultural narratives employed by those colleges—a mechanism that we label “institutional exclusion.” Computational text analyses of college mission statements show that community colleges, for-profit colleges, and four-year colleges draw upon distinctively different cultural narratives. To gauge the causal effect of these narratives on student responses, we designed a survey experiment for a sample of high-school seniors. We find that the career-focused narratives of for-profit colleges are most appealing to disadvantaged students, whereas advantaged students prefer the post-materialist rhetoric of four-year colleges. We conclude that institutional exclusion should be included in sociological discussions of college inequalities and the promotion of diversity in organizations."

    "abstract": "Theoretical models have been developed to understand how social class influences individual thoughts, feelings and behaviours. However, the validity of these models is threatened by the prevailing use of small, non-diverse samples and flexible measurement practices. We preregistered replications of 35 key hypotheses from 17 correlational and 5 experimental studies, and collected large, quota-based or probability samples from the USA, France, Switzerland and India ( N total = 33,536). Our analysis yielded three central findings: (1) ~50% of the effects were successfully replicated; (2) conclusions were consistent across different operationalizations of social class, although objective indicators yielded smaller estimates (for example, income and education); and (3) half of the effects were moderated—mostly strengthened—by social class identification, system-justification beliefs or local income inequality. Overall, hypotheses based on differences between social class contexts in terms of constraints, uncertainty and status were well supported. However, hypotheses based on models positing social class differences in psychological orientations towards ‘the self’ versus ‘others and the environment’ received less support. We conclude that these models need to be reassessed as individuals from higher social classes seem more oriented towards both themselves and others.

    "abstract": "Stress changes social behavior, yet its effects remain contradictory. Traditionally, stress was thought to trigger an antagonistic fight-or-flight response aimed at eliminating the stressor. However, recent studies have revealed the opposite response, tend-and-befriend, where individuals prosocially invest in their social network in exchange for support and mutual protection. We hypothesize that stress does not promote one response over the other; instead, it stimulates both behaviors, dissociable on the neuropharmacological level and moderated by social context. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind psychopharmacological study, we administered hydrocortisone and yohimbine—alone or in combination—to manipulate the actions of the main stress hormone cortisol and the arousal transmitter noradrenaline. Participants then made decisions in an intergroup conflict task. They teamed up with others to form an in-group and played against multiple out-groups. Notably, out-group members initiated financial harm to in-group participants before these responded. Participants then chose either to 1) maximize their own payoff, 2) cooperatively increase the payoff of their in-group, or 3) increase the in-group’s payoff while competitively decreasing that of the out-group. Consistent with our hypotheses, glucocorticoid activation increased generosity toward the in-group, whereas noradrenergic activation increased parochial competition, i.e., prosocial in-group support combined with hostility toward the out-group. These findings challenge the dichotomy between fight-or-flight and tend-and-befriend, suggesting stress-related behavior is neither static nor one-directional, but shaped by the relative dominance of cortisol versus noradrenaline in the neurohormonal stress response and by intergroup dynamics. We highlight broader societal implications, offering a potential biological mechanism underlying the self-perpetuating cycle of intergroup conflict."
