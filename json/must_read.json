    "abstract": "Modern election campaigning is often described as “data-driven,” but there are signs that data may not always inform decision-making. This article focuses on the decision-making component of campaigns and provides a new theorisation of this previously neglected component of data-driven campaigns. Arguing that decision-making is affected by a range of contextual, agential and organizational factors, I call for qualitative analysis of campaign practice that is needed to understand how decisions are made. Applying this theoretical account, I consider the likely future of election campaigning, reflecting particularly on the potential for automation. Specifically, I identify where automation is likely to emerge and conclude that rote-like decision-making is unlikely to entirely define the practices of future campaigns. Collectively this article offers new theoretical insight into an overlooked aspect of modern campaigning - decision-making - and provides offers a foundation for more accurate predictions about the future of campaigns."

    "abstract": "Research on screen usage frequently relies on broad measures of “screen time,” which fail to differentiate between various types of activities and their effects. To clarify how digital behavior is defined, we conducted a rapid review and methodological mapping of 36 screen use measurement tools. Three independent coders applied a piloted framework to classify measurement constructs, data collection modality (objective logs, self-, or proxy-report), temporal specificity, framing valence, opportunity cost, dyadic/social context, developmental focus, and evidence of reliability and validity. Interrater agreement was high (Fleiss’ Kappa; Gwet’s AC1). Most instruments used negatively framed item content, emphasizing impairment, dysregulation, or loss of control, focused on adolescents and young adults, and lacked precision in temporal anchoring. Very few assessed opportunity costs, dyadic use, or included validation against device-logged data. No measure emphasized positive or beneficial aspects of screen engagement. These gaps suggest a need for more conceptually balanced tools that integrate objective tracking with context-sensitive self-report items across the lifespan. We propose a blueprint for future development: improve temporal anchoring (e.g., within-day, weekday vs. weekend), broaden age inclusion, assess social and functional context, and report both reliability and validation against behavioral data. Strengthening measurement will advance efforts to identify when, how, and for whom digital behavior supports or undermines well-being."

    "abstract": "Current explanations for political divides in entertainment media use identify divergent preferences for or evaluations of content. According to the theory of normative social behavior (TNSB), extratextual information such as cues about the audience may also influence exposure intentions due to viewers’ perceptions of ingroup norms. Social media users discuss and form communities around entertainment content while conveying partisan and racial identities. A preregistered experiment exposed Black and White partisans (N = 1,259) to tweets in which a television show was endorsed by co- or out-partisans who were racial in- or out-group members. Exposure intentions were stronger when endorsement came from co-partisans; however, this effect was stronger for White partisans. Treatment effects were mediated by perceived ingroup norms and perceptions of how much of the audience consisted of ingroup members. Implications of multiple identities (i.e., race and partisanship) for the TNSB and the study of partisan entertainment divides are discussed."

Inspired by the marketing concept of the choice set, we conducted two experiments in the US (N1 = 731; N2 = 396) to examine how choice set size (number of articles presented at a time) and composition (ratio of supportive “pro” to opposing “anti” articles) affect news exposure, attitudes, and intentions. Smaller choice sets with fewer articles led individuals to select fewer articles overall and fewer cross-cutting articles that challenged preexisting attitudes. Choice set composition did not affect whether individuals engaged with articles or their overall news exposure, but it shaped which articles they chose: the selection and browsing of cross-cutting news differed notably between homogeneous (all pro or all anti) and mixed sets. Neither choice set size nor composition systematically affected attitudes or behavioral intentions in the short term."

Using a two-alternative forced-choice task, participants selected between two faces differing in masculinity-femininity traits to match an Italian cue word. In Study 1, participants were presented with gender-marked pronouns as cue words, and they consistently chose faces matching the pronoun's gender. Study 2 replaced pronouns with common gender nouns denoting professional roles, revealing a gender-career bias: female-dominated jobs were matched with more feminine faces, and male-dominated jobs with more masculine ones. Study 3 introduced gender-marked articles, which eliminated the bias of Study 2, suggesting that explicit linguistic markers can override implicit associations. Across all studies, effects were stronger when facial traits were clearly distinct. The findings highlight how language shapes cognitive biases and introduce a novel paradigm for assessing implicit associations. This research offers practical insights for promoting gender equality through language-based interventions."

Drawing on Hallin’s sphere model and Egelhofer et al.’s coding categories, it uses manual content analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling to identify rhetorical functions and patterns. Findings show that the term “fake news” functions mainly as a weaponized label to delegitimize opponents rather than describe misinformation. The results show how alternative media redraw boundaries between consensus, controversy, and deviance, underscoring their role in intensifying partisan discourse and redefining political communication."

In doing so, I focus on bystanders , or non-consenting participants whose data are implicated by researchers’ use of the screenshot feature. Considering relevant US law, internationally recognized ethics frameworks, and user expectations across digital platforms from which screenshots are collected, this article offers guidelines for researchers and policymakers about usage of and building formal restrictions around the screenshot feature, respectively. I argue usage of the screenshot feature in human communication research must (1) obscure sensitive and extraneous participant data, (2) recognize platform-specific user expectations, and (3) protect bystander privacy."

Against this background, we rely on a pre-registered experimental study in the United States ( N = 982) in which we exposed participants to various modes of textual and visual disinformation on two different issues: The disappearance of flight MH370 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Findings show that, for MH370, there was no difference in credibility between textual, AI-generated, or video-based disinformation. Yet, for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, video-based disinformation was perceived as more credible than textual or image-based disinformation. Our findings indicate that the consequences of visual disinformation are context-bound: Especially in the case of polarizing issues, the out-of-context placement of videos can serve as a plausible form of deceptive evidence."

Mukerjee et al. examined this phenomenon empirically by estimating the extent to which media outlets respond to audience engagement signals on Facebook in deciding what news to publish on the platform. However, the extent to which their findings can be generalized to other social media platforms remains unknown. We replicate their study on Twitter using the same methodological pipeline ( N ≈ 4 . 55 million posts, twenty-eight media outlets, between 2015 and 2019). Our results indicate that media responsiveness to audience engagement on Twitter aligns with the core patterns identified in the Facebook study. Specifically, topics receiving higher audience engagement generally experience significantly increased coverage shortly thereafter, and the responsiveness is not conditioned on the nature of topics. However, we observe three differences in dynamics on Twitter compared to Facebook: first, the maximum response window on Twitter is shorter; second, conservative outlets on Twitter are not more likely to respond to engagement signals; third, platform-specific metrics (e.g., retweets) show different patterns of responsiveness. Our replication thus highlights the generalizability of the original study while underscoring the importance of platform-specific characteristics in shaping media production on social media."

The implementation of such policies is often met with resistance from the public due to their perceived costs and distributional implications. Scholars have mostly focused on material compensations to increase public support among policy losers. This article goes beyond the existing literature by showing how what we term symbolic policies can enhance support for costlier policies. We define symbolic policies as policies sending meaningful messages to the public but having low material impacts. We argue that without changing the material costs that climate policies impose, symbolic policies increase public support by altering the message that costly policies convey. We demonstrate our argument using survey experiments and qualitative interviews conducted in France, showing that symbolic policies can significantly increase support for costly climate policies and increase perceptions of fairness, elite behavior, and government credibility."

    "abstract": "Efforts to curb online hate speech depend on our ability to reliably detect it at scale. Previous studies have highlighted the strong zero-shot classification performance of large language models (LLMs), offering a potential tool to efficiently identify harmful content. Yet for complex and ambivalent tasks like hate speech detection, pre-trained LLMs can be insufficient and carry systemic biases. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for the given task and empirical context could help address these issues, but, as we demonstrate, the quality of data used for fine-tuning decisively matters. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini using a unique corpus of online comments annotated by diverse groups of coders with varying annotation quality: research assistants, activists, two kinds of crowd workers, and citizen scientists. We find that only annotations from those groups of annotators that are better than zero-shot GPT-4o-mini in recognizing hate speech improve the classification performance of the fine-tuned LLM. Specifically, fine-tuning using the highest-quality annotator group – trained research assistants – boosts classification performance by increasing the model’s precision without notably sacrificing the good recall of zero-shot GPT-4o-mini. In contrast, lower-quality annotations do not improve and may even decrease the ability to identify hate speech. By examining tasks reliant on human judgment and context, we offer insights that go beyond hate speech detection."

These message-based experiments often hinge on intermediary variables—actions subjects must take to actually receive the treatment or control embedded in a message. Whether subjects open the message is a crucial intermediary step, which can serve as a condition for estimating downstream treatment effects or as an outcome of interest in its own right. Yet opens are often measured with error, most notably when some openers are misclassified as non-openers in email-based studies. We characterize the resulting bias, derive interpretable bounds on effects for well-defined subgroups, and provide sensitivity analyses for mismeasurement, thereby offering practical guidance for message-based experiments conducted through email and other communication technologies."

In-person deep canvassing is the gold standard for durably changing attitudes on polarizing topics. However, door-to-door canvassing is costly, and many populations may not be feasibly reached in this manner. Campaigns are already conducting outreach using digital tools, including text messages and social media. If appropriately trained agents messaging over social media can achieve a fraction of the effect of in-person canvassing, canvassing may be scaled up to achieve large overall impacts at lower costs. Scripts used in this application are based on those used by transgender allies in the original study. To personalize messaging, the conversational agent uses natural language processing to detect conversational topics, and shares relevant pre-scripted messages of information and third-person experiences, encouraging respondents to engage in perspective-taking with respect to an outgroup. This study demonstrates the potential of automated social media messaging for deep canvassing, with possible applications by governments, public health agencies, and political organizations. Estimated effects are positive and significant under covariate adjustment and reweighting; due to important differential attrition, partial-identification bounds are also reported and include zero."

Drawing on survey responses ( n = 9,254) and in-game data from over 660,000 players, we use an innovative graph-based machine learning approach to quantify how individuals influence others’ playtime, and regression analyses to test predictors from the COM-B model. Results show that Capability enhances influence, although excessive task focus correlates negatively with social impact; Opportunity emerges as the strongest predictor, with active social interactions significantly boosting influence; and Motivation varies by playstyle, with socializers and competitors demonstrating greater influence than narrative-focused players. By applying the COM-B model in a digital gaming context, this research highlights behavioral dimensions of player influence and employs a novel metric for quantifying interpersonal influence. These findings suggest practical implications for game design, particularly by highlighting how social interaction opportunities and different player motivations shape influence within communities."

This study tests whether Google Trends predicts official divorce rates in the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom from 2009 to 2023. We introduce Digital Behavioral Decoupling, in which online distress signals diverge from legal outcomes as divorce shifts from an institutional procedure to an emotionally mediated digital phenomenon. Methods include unit root tests, cointegration analysis, Granger causality, spectral coherence, and rolling-origin nowcasting. Search queries are grouped into pre-divorce (cognitive distress), during-divorce (procedural action), and post-divorce (emotional recovery) phases. Results show 62.5% of terms lead divorce rates by 1–2 years, yet only 8.3% remain significant after False Discovery Rate correction. The Netherlands demonstrates 100% forecast improvements beyond autoregressive models (DM 2.87–3.43, p &lt; 0.02) across all search terms, from early relationship therapy queries through procedural and post-divorce searches, indicating systematic capture of the entire divorce pathway. Germany shows intermediate results with 33% forecast success beyond autoregressive benchmarks (DM 2.40–2.81) limited to problem-recognition terms, suggesting episodic crisis-driven engagement. The United States and United Kingdom show no forecast gains beyond autoregressive models despite high search volumes, consistent with information saturation in normalized divorce cultures. Lead-lag relationships are frequency-specific, concentrated at 3–5 year periodicities. Findings link family sociology with affective computing and provide a replicable toolkit for tracking relationship dissolution in algorithmically curated information environments."

    "abstract": "Following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election of Donald Trump, prejudice toward groups targeted during his campaign (e.g., Asian Americans, Mexicans) become more acceptable. By contrast, both Trump and Clinton voters reported less prejudice of their own. We conducted a 2024 conceptual replication, measuring perceived norms of prejudice and own-prejudice toward 128 groups, both before ( N = 362) and after ( N = 261) the U.S. election. We separately measured the negativity of Trump’s campaign rhetoric toward these groups ( N = 188). Levels of prejudice and perceived norms of prejudice acceptability were mostly stable pre-/post-election, but Trump’s negative rhetoric predicted an increase in perceived acceptability of prejudice among targeted groups (replicating the 2016 results), and a rise in self-reported prejudice in the same groups post-election (reversing the 2016 results). Despite changes in the sociopolitical context between elections, the election of a leading politician who campaigned on prejudice was again associated with increases in the acceptability of prejudice."

    "abstract": "AI is expected to reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Large-scale survey data ( N = 37,079; 38 European countries) indicate that the public tends to view AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for technology-related, political, and sociodemographic factors, these data further show that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Two preregistered, nationally representative experiments ( N = 1,202, United Kingdom; replication study N = 1,200, United States) provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democracy and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may decrease democratic legitimacy and public engagement in shaping the future of AI."
