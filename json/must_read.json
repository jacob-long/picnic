    "abstract": "Understanding covert discrimination is as critical as overt discrimination in combating injustices. This study examines how news media consumption and trust shape covert discriminatory preferences. By analyzing various news media sources (television, newspapers, and social media) and various discrimination grounds, we highlight the complex relationship between factors driving covert discrimination. We use data from an online survey among 3000 Belgian adults, employing a conjoint experimental design to capture implicit bias in the seating preferences on public transport. Results show that media consumption and trust significantly moderate discriminatory preferences. Light consumers of public television news and heavy consumers of commercial television news display greater discriminatory preferences. Higher trust in public broadcasters and quality newspapers aligns with favoring individuals without visible minority traits, while lower trust correlates with preferences for overweight and transgender individuals. TikTok, X, and Instagram consumption also influences these patterns. Our findings have implications for media policy and diversity interventions."

    "abstract": "The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in socio-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as “companions,” yet there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71; 2017–2025). Works varied widely in considerations of MC according to guiding theories, dimensions of a priori specified properties (subjectively positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts (with more than 50 distinct measured variables). We ultimately offer a literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive; through a facet-theoretical lens, we suggest how this definition can scaffold future research."

    "abstract": "Considering TikTok’s increasing geopolitical influence, this article presents the TikTok Global Observatory (TKGO) as a case of data-reappropriation and introduces the concept of platform-mediated proximity as a counter-data mapping framework for data activist research. While TikTok enables global connection beyond local and cultural boundaries, its content is sensitive to locally specific conditions to which the platform provides no public insight. To counter this lack of transparency, the TKGO makes data for global and cross-national analysis of TikTok feeds available and navigable to the research community. The TKGO is an archive, updated daily, that collects the metadata of videos scraped from the non-logged-in web version of TikTok’s for you page (FYP) across 197 countries and territories. The tool’s main feature is a geographic map that allows users to view, filter, sort, and extrapolate the FYP data as prioritized in different geographical locations. This offers a unique access point for researchers, journalists, and activists investigating cross-national trends, content moderation, and content promotion. In this article, we firstly present the TKGO and contextually position its development in the contentious politics of data access, archiving, and mapping practices. Secondly, we elaborate on the notion of platform-mediated proximities, a conceptual lens that highlights how TikTok remediates geographical proximities through algorithmic content recommendation. Lastly, we apply this framework to the mapping of a three-month sample of the TKGO data, showing how TikTok’s cross-national content prioritization patterns generate new geographical boundaries, observing regional and geopolitical clustering as well as notable exceptions."

    "abstract": "Social media platforms increasingly offer users control over their feeds, promising to reduce toxic discourse. This study tests how the mere offer of algorithmic control shapes user experiences. Respondents evaluated identical posts from a fictional platform, with half given the option to filter out toxic political content. Those given this choice reported greater platform satisfaction. However, those who opted for filtering rated content as more hostile than similar respondents who were not offered the choice. A follow-up experiment showed that exposure to only positive content did not reduce hostility ratings; it heightened them compared to exposure to both positive and negative content. These findings challenge the assumption that user autonomy will improve content experiences. Instead, algorithmic choice raises expectations, prompting users to scrutinize content more critically or attempt to “train” the algorithm to align with their preferences. Platforms must consider how expectations, not just content exposure, shape online experiences."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming adult content production by enabling users to generate highly customized sexual media through AI pornography platforms. Despite growing concerns about risks (e.g. illegal material generation and sex worker exploitation), AI pornography platform governance remains largely undocumented. We conceptualize AI pornography governance as fantasy arbitration, the process by which platforms determine which sexual fantasies can be technologically instantiated. Using an inductive content analysis of governance materials from 98 AI pornography platforms, we examine content prohibitions, moderation strategies and enforcement mechanisms, liability allocation, intellectual property rights, and privacy policies. Findings reveal heterogeneous governance regimes that create differential risk environments and illuminate how platforms independently dictate legitimate sexuality, determine who captures value from content generation, and commodify intimate data. Collectively, these governance practices position AI pornography platforms as corporate arbiters of sexual possibilities, with broader implications for intimate freedom, labor exploitation, and our co-evolution with technologies."

    "abstract": "This study explores online deliberation and discursive (in)civility within Vietnam’s authoritarian context, focusing on Facebook discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how different types of Facebook pages (i.e. government information pages, state-sponsored media, foreign media, and private discussion groups) shape deliberative quality and how (in)civility can both facilitate and hinder public discussion. Quantitative analysis reveals that foreign media pages foster more rational, diverse, reflexive, and interactive discussions, despite higher levels of incivility. In contrast, government and state-sponsored media pages maintain greater civility but demonstrate lower deliberative quality, while private groups show high incivility with minimal deliberation. To further contextualize these patterns, a close reading identifies emotional triggers and target-induced behaviors in uncivil comments. By integrating macro-level metrics with micro-level discursive practices, this study offers valuable insights for scholars and policymakers seeking to enhance deliberative engagement in digital environments under varying degrees of state control."

This article offers a systematic, cross-disciplinary review of empirical research on digital populism published between 2015 and early 2025. Analysing 188 studies from political communication, media studies and political science, we map how platform affordances structure populist communication, how digital populism is conceptualised and how it is studied. The literature portrays digital populism as the communicative enactment of populist ideology in environments that privilege personalisation, affective intensity and direct leader–follower engagement. Methods span qualitative, computational and experimental designs, with research concentrated on Twitter/X and Facebook. Most studies examine exclusionary, right-wing cases in European and Western contexts and associate them with polarisation, misinformation and declining institutional trust. Evidence remains largely correlational, and inclusionary or participatory variants are underexplored. We identify key gaps and call for greater analytical precision in assessing democratic consequences."

As a result, some users flock to alternative platforms, like Telegram, Signal, VK, Parler, or Gettr. This study examines the roles of political ideology, anti-establishment views, and privacy concerns in the use of these five platforms. Based on survey data gathered in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany ( n = 1500 each), we find that alternative platform use is highest in the United States and in Germany. Digitally skilled, young, male, educated, and right-wing individuals are drawn to alternative social media. Across all five platforms, right-wing ideology is a stronger predictor of usage than anti-establishment views. In the pooled sample, privacy concerns do not correlate with usage. However, given inconsistencies in the roles of privacy concerns and anti-establishment views, we highlight the importance of specific platform affordances and national context."

Two preregistered experiments found that consensus messages increased support for AI research and willingness to raise awareness indirectly through increasing perceived consensus, which enhanced favorable beliefs and hope. These effects varied by collective scientific efficacy—perceived ability of scientists to work together effectively. Belief-based pathways were stronger under low efficacy, while hope-based pathways were stronger under high efficacy. Findings underscore the value of combining consensus and efficacy cues in science communication to promote engagement with emerging technologies like AI."

This project uses two studies conducted during the 2020 and 2022 elections to test whether the presumed prevalence/persuasiveness of online misinformation (P3OM)—the perception that online misinformation is both widespread and persuasive—undermines Americans’ satisfaction with democracy. Fixed-effects regression analysis of an eight-wave online panel survey reveals that both dimensions of P3OM are correlated with reduced democratic satisfaction. A follow-up online survey experiment provides evidence that exposure to messages about online misinformation reduces democratic satisfaction. Theoretical implications and strategies for reducing the presumed influence of online misinformation on democratic satisfaction are discussed."

This study illuminates a less-explored facet of non-democratic contexts’ digital politics by shedding light on discourse quality in cyberspace. Guided by Gastil and Black’s analytical–social framework of deliberation, we propose an integrated analytical model comprising seven dimensions and employ a case study approach combined with supervised machine learning to analyze Chinese netizens’ digital engagement with the public policy of “delaying retirement age” on the popular Q&amp;A platform. The findings reveal deliberative virtues—topic relevance, rationality, and civility—alongside a low presence of political alienation and minimal institutional alignment, suggesting generally strong analytical performance. In contrast, the social dimension, represented by argument reciprocity and transpositional consideration, remains weak, reflecting a lack of sustained interaction. Based on these empirical results, we coin the concept of the “ solo of deliberator ” to describe a pattern of online deliberation where analytical reasoning prevails while social engagement is subdued. Implications for deliberative democracy in non-democratic nations are discussed."

Far less attention has been given to more active forms of news engagement, however. News commentary, an active form of engagement, may reflect cross-cutting engagement rather than pro-attitudinal selectivity, given its expressive and often confrontational nature. Using ten years of commenting data from South Korea’s largest news aggregator—amounting to over 250 million comments posted by approximately six million users—and a deep-learning content analysis to classify political attitudes and hostility, we examine whether hostile commentary is indeed characterized by cross-cutting patterns across both content and source levels. We specifically analyze whether users comment on counter-attitudinal news stories and whether hostile commenters are structurally confined within fragmented outlet clusters in co-engagement media networks. Findings show that hostile commenters are more likely to cross boundaries by targeting opposing news stories and exhibit weaker echo chamber structures, reflecting cross-cutting engagement beyond their clusters. This pattern is especially pronounced in political and societal domains. In today’s media environment, hostility and opposition may ironically disrupt, rather than reinforce, echo chambers."

We explore this question through the case of abortion, using a large‐scale panel dataset ( n  ≈ 130,000) and applying three key diagnostics: coherence, stability, and changes in vote choice. First, we demonstrate that abortion policy preferences exhibit logical coherence, both within and across reasons for seeking an abortion. Second, we show that these preferences are highly stable over time–more so than personality traits–suggesting that abortion attitudes are deeply engrained rather than fleeting opinions. Lastly, we find that abortion policy preferences, measured before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, predict shifts in intended voting behavior between 2020 and 2024. This overall pattern helps rule out key theoretical alternatives, such as non‐opinions, attitudes following vote choice, and elite cues. Additionally, these findings highlight the significant and independent role of abortion attitudes in shaping American political behavior."

Yet, the actions taken by women parliamentarians to shape these outcomes have not been identified in the literature. I assert that a primary step by which women may generate impact is by championing environmentalism in their speeches before parliament. To test this, I analyse speeches from the UK House of Commons from 2010 to 2021, and find that women MPs both speak proportionately more about the environment than their male counterparts, and bring environmentalism into debates that are not explicitly coded as environmental. Finally, while Conservative women are outnumbered by men, they contribute significantly more to environmental speeches than their male counterparts. These results suggest that women are disproportionately responsible for embedding environmentalism into political discussions across Parliament and the Conservative Party, and prompt questions around the true cost of unequal representation for our climate."

Based on reference group theory and drawing on ANES data as well as recent Danish and Austrian election surveys, we examine how voters’ sympathies with a range of groups are related to party choice across time and space. We find that group sympathies are related to vote choice in all three countries, even when controlling for objective group memberships and social identities. Across time, most relationships are stable or strengthening and comparable in strength to the relationship between group memberships and party choice. The relationship between group sympathies and vote choice is, furthermore, conditioned by perceived linkages between groups and parties. Hence, analyses of the role of social groups in voting also need to include group sympathies to grasp the full influence of social groups."

    "abstract": "Peaceful transfers of power are a fundamental principle of democracy. Yet, in times of heightened affective polarisation, election losses may trigger strong negative emotional reactions in partisans, which in turn undermine support for fundamental democratic principles among partisans. We test this idea through two pre-registered survey experiments conducted after the 2022 and 2024 elections in the United States. We randomly assign partisans to receive either a placebo or an emotive reminder about the election that their party lost, containing others’ angry or worried reactions at the election outcome. Contrary to our pre-registered expectations, we do not find evidence that priming negative feelings about electoral loss affects support for political violence or democratic norms. Emotive reminders about salient political events can momentarily turn up the heat on politics, but are not enough to propel partisans to adopt extreme anti-democratic attitudes. By linking the study of emotions to democratic norms, this article contributes to our understanding of when negative emotions (fail to) radicalise partisans."

To effectively measure this phenomenon, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach capable of automatically classifying large volumes of text. Case studies on coalition signals in Germany and negative campaigning in Austria demonstrate its effectiveness. The study deepens our understanding of party competition, advances methods of automated text classification, and enables new research on political communication."

Surprisingly, the control group had higher acceptance rates than retrospective for both events, and for prospective in May. After accounting for this, treatment groups remained on the call longer, significantly for prospective in July. We see no differences by gender, but the youngest cohort had higher acceptance rates in the prospective condition than in the control for both events."

    "abstract": "How should we measure “pure” or “true” independents? For years, the respective item required a respondent to volunteer that answer. Recent surveys have moved toward presenting it explicitly. Those that do produce estimates of pure independents that are much larger than in past surveys. We present evidence of this phenomenon across multiple surveys and ask: Are self-administered surveys overcounting independents, or are traditional live-interviewer surveys undercounting independents? We answer that question by comparing live-interview and self-administered samples from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, by undertaking tests to rule out mode effects (including an experiment), and by seeing which question wording correlates more strongly with measures of latent ideology, vote choice, and ratings of the parties. Our findings suggest that surveys that include an explicit response option, allowing Americans to self-identify easily as “(pure) independent,” offer a more precise measurement of the concept of party identification. This has implications for the study of independents, as well as for discussions about polarization and party-system dealignment."

    "abstract": "Electoral democracy rests on the conferral of Loser’s Consent. The Capitol insurrection of January 6, 2021—and the widespread sympathy for it that endures among Republican citizens and elected officials—can be understood as an unprecedented denial of that Consent. We hypothesize that insurrectionist sympathies among 2020 election losers are structured in part by hypercompetitiveness—a psychological need to win at all costs. Using original survey data collected in the spring of 2022, we find strong suggestive support for our hypothesis. Many of the Americans who fail to condemn the Capitol riot may not be simply knee-jerk partisans, well-intentioned victims of propaganda, or sycophants in thrall to a would-be authoritarian leader. Substantiating the anxieties of many observers, those people may instead be unwilling to abide by democratic rules if it means they have to lose."

    "abstract": "Feed algorithms are widely suspected to influence political attitudes. However, previous evidence from switching off the algorithm on Meta platforms found no political effects1. Here we present results from a 2023 field experiment on Elon Musk’s platform X shedding light on this puzzle. We assigned active US-based users randomly to either an algorithmic or a chronological feed for 7 weeks, measuring political attitudes and online behaviour. Switching from a chronological to an algorithmic feed increased engagement and shifted political opinion towards more conservative positions, particularly regarding policy priorities, perceptions of criminal investigations into Donald Trump and views on the war in Ukraine. In contrast, switching from the algorithmic to the chronological feed had no comparable effects. Neither switching the algorithm on nor switching it off significantly affected affective polarization or self-reported partisanship. To investigate the mechanism, we analysed users’ feed content and behaviour. We found that the algorithm promotes conservative content and demotes posts by traditional media. Exposure to algorithmic content leads users to follow conservative political activist accounts, which they continue to follow even after switching off the algorithm, helping explain the asymmetry in effects. These results suggest that initial exposure to X’s algorithm has persistent effects on users’ current political attitudes and account-following behaviour, even in the absence of a detectable effect on partisanship."

    "abstract": "This research explores the impact of large language models (LLMs) on consumer complaints submitted to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Analysing 1,134,512 complaints from 2015 to 2024, we document a sharp increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. An instrumental variable analysis estimates that LLM usage increases the probability of obtaining favourable relief by 6.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval, (4.9, 8.9)). The analysis also reveals evidence of negative selection, where consumers otherwise prone to adverse outcomes are more likely to adopt LLMs. To further substantiate these findings and test the mechanism, we conducted three online controlled experiments (total N = 1,010 US participants); these demonstrate that LLMs can increase the likelihood of obtaining relief by enhancing the presentation of complaints without altering factual content. These findings suggest that LLMs can act as an equalizer, highlighting the need for policies that expand access to these technologies."

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of generative AI into academic writing has prompted widespread policy responses from journals and publishers. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. Here, we analyze 5,114 journals and over 5.2 million papers to evaluate the real-world impact of AI usage guidelines. We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers’ use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164 k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75 k papers published since 2023, only 76 (~0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use. Our findings suggest that current policies have largely failed to promote transparency or restrain AI adoption. We urge a reevaluation of ethical frameworks to foster responsible AI integration in science."
