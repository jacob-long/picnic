## EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE

Even just looking backwards a week, there are a lot more articles published 
than most of us could hope to read. We can always skim the titles and abstracts
ourselves, but I wanted to test out some automation. The articles below, all 
of which can be found elsewhere on this site among other new publications,
were chosen by **Google Gemini Pro** as "must-read" articles. The proper criteria
are in the eyes of the beholder and Gemini doesn't apply my criteria without
error. I may continue to refine the prompting based on experience and feedback.
Like the rest of the site, this will update daily!
