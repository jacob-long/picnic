    "authors": "Graham D Bodie, Miriam Brinberg, Susanne Jones, Denise H Solomon, Nilam Ram",
    "abstract": "This study proposes and tests five temporally explicit models of message evaluation derived from work on supportive communication. Although most empirical work in this area is based on a limited number of time-scales (temporal isolation of messages or temporal aggregation of conversations), theories that direct that work have the potential to make much more sophisticated predictions of how supportive messages, and the conversations within which they occur, are evaluated. Using data produced by pairs of friends who engaged in 5-min supportive conversations, we articulated a series of theoretically informed models that examined how type, accumulation, and timing of conversational moves impacted how disclosers evaluated the supportiveness of the statements made throughout the conversation (evaluated by the discloser using video-assisted recall) and how they felt after the conversation. Results confirmed that (a) evaluations made throughout a conversation are related to post-conversation reports of supportiveness and emotional improvement, (b) different types of speaking acts are generally not differentially supportive, and (c) timing of some speaking acts matters—altogether suggesting we pay more attention to how we conceptualize and measure time in studies of enacted support.",

    "abstract": "Negotiations are a key mechanism for resolving societal conflicts. Since they usually take place behind closed doors, it has long been assumed that the media have no impact on the workflow and results. In this article, we demonstrate that media attention and framing affect the negotiation process and outcomes through the moods of the negotiators.

    "abstract": "In today's digitized societies, where constant connectivity is perceived as a social norm, many people voluntarily seek temporary digital disconnection to balance out benefits and harms. Given that any direct effectiveness of digital disconnection is limited, recent approaches emphasized its conditionality. Conducted in two culturally dissimilar countries (the United States and Indonesia), the present large-scale cross-sectional youth surveys ( N s = 1,922 and 2,107, respectively) explored whether different popular feature- and rules-based digital disconnection strategies (digital detox app use vs. reflective smartphone disengagement vs. digital solitude) may serve as an ambivalent moderator for relationships between habitual and compulsive smartphone checking, on one side, and digital stress experiences, on the other. For U.S. youth only, results indeed suggested that reflective smartphone disengagement might minimize detrimental side effects of firm checking habits, whereas it exacerbates links to digital stress for people who struggle with smartphone checking compulsiveness.",

    "abstract": "People increasingly live within and across physical and digital spaces, forming idiosyncratic connections with those locales. Building on extant work indicating cross-materiality Sense of Place (SoP) to be a function of symbolism, purpose, identity, relationality, and emotion (SPIRE), the current study tested the validity of a five-factor SPIRE measure and examined variance as a function of physical (vs. digital) and positive (vs. negative) places. Among cross-national participants (N = 348 from &gt; 30 countries), response patterns forward a two-factor solution: One combines SPIR elements anchored to identity items representing an egocentric orientation toward the place (55% of variance explained), and another comprises only emotion items representing idiosyncratic emotion dynamics (14%). Validation analyses found egocentricity to be strongly and positively associated with metaphorical conceptualizations of SoP, emotionality less so, differentially across place materiality and valence. Findings hold implications for digital and physical space design, especially as generative technologies increasingly afford place personalization.",

    "authors": "Xiaoyang Zhao, Rens Vliegenthart, Knut De Swert, Mark Boukes",
    "abstract": "China is a major trading partner of the European Union (EU), and the debate over China’s economic influence has gained prominence on both the political and media agendas in EU countries. Through time-series analysis, this study investigates reciprocal relationships between the European Parliament’s (EP) political agenda and the national media agenda regarding EU–China trade relations (2001–2020). The analysis is based on a sample of 538 speeches from the EP Plenary Debates and a total of 867 newspaper articles from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK). Combined with a manual quantitative content analysis, this study also examines the salience of sub-issues in EU–China trade relations. Monthly-level vector autoregressive analyses yielded four major findings. First, a positive reciprocal relationship was observed between the EP’s political agenda and the national media agenda on EU–China trade relations, with mutual influences showing similar effect sizes. Second, it was especially the speeches by Far-Right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from the Netherlands and the UK that elicited more national media attention, and vice versa. Third, we found positive mutual influences not only between the national media agenda and the political agenda set by MEPs but also between the national media agenda and the political agenda set by EU representatives. Fourth, the geographical and social proximity of sub-issues in EU–China trade relations appears to moderate the politics-media dynamics. The findings contribute to existing scholarship by examining the function of multilevel structures (i.e., supranational vs. national) in agenda-setting research.",

    "authors": "Franz Reiter, Uta Russmann",
    "abstract": "Most research studying the content of political campaigns has employed cross-sectional, cross-national, or longitudinal designs. Although this research has enhanced our understanding of campaigns, there is still a lack of cross-level studies that compare the content of campaigns at different political levels. In this study, we employ a cross-level design by comparing campaign strategies in the 2024 European Parliament (EP) election and the 2024 National Parliament (NP) election in Austria. We focus on campaign strategies related to dissonant public spheres: Populist content, negative campaigning, and the polarizing issues of immigration and environmental policy. To do so, we apply a quantitative content analysis ( N = 1,794) of the Facebook posts of political parties and candidates during both campaigns. Using binary logistic regression, we find that negative campaigning is significantly more likely and the issue of environmental policy is significantly less likely to occur in the NP campaign compared to the EP campaign. However, there are no significant differences between the EP and NP campaigns regarding populist content and the issue of immigration. Our findings demonstrate that the second-order elections theory may be less applicable to the analysis of digital campaign strategies. Instead, other frameworks—such as populist discourse as a global phenomenon, the transnationalization of issues like immigration, and the increasing salience of global concerns such as climate change—may offer more analytical traction.",

    "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Elske van den Hoogen, Marina Tulin, Claes de Vreese",
    "abstract": "The 2024 European Parliament (EP) elections (EP24) were regarded as a “testing ground” for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered disinformation threats. Instances of multimodal, AI-generated disinformation were found across European democracies, leading to questions about just how prevalent this threat may be in the eyes of citizens poised to vote in the EP elections, and its influence on electoral processes. Utilizing a three-wave panel approach, we surveyed a sample of citizens in the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland ( N = 2929) to track changes over the course of the election cycle. We explored the association between citizens’ concerns about and perceived encounters with AI-generated content, including disinformation. We were also interested in how these concerns and perceived encounters differ over the course of the campaign, differ by country, and ultimately, how they relate to citizens’ perceptions of the fairness of the electoral process. We found that increased reported exposure to AI-generated election content, including disinformation, is associated with heightened concern about AI’s threat to democratic integrity in the EP24. While reported exposure to AI-generated content positively influenced perceptions of electoral integrity and democratic satisfaction at the EU-level, disinformation eroded these perceptions, albeit modestly. Reported exposure to AI-generated disinformation peaked just before elections, suggesting strategic timing. Understanding citizens’ perspectives can be crucial for the development of a robust, democratic and resilient information ecosystem—particularly during elections.",

    "abstract": "As elected officials and citizens struggle to understand the increasingly polarized political landscape in the United States, some have pointed to the introduction of “gavel-to-gavel” camera coverage in legislative bodies as driving the downward trajectory of these institutions. Advocates of increased transparency suggest cameras empower voters, producing more moderate behavior among legislators, whereas opponents suggest cameras encourage partisanship and dysfunction. Previous research offers mixed conclusions, in part, because of a focus on national legislatures where the introduction of cameras occurs only once. Using an original dataset of the adoption of gavel-to-gavel coverage in state legislative chambers, we examine whether cameras are associated with a range of chamber- and individual-level outcomes. The findings suggest that there are no systematic impacts from the introduction of gavel-to-gavel coverage. Normative concerns about cameras in legislatures may be overstated, an important finding given their proliferation in public proceedings since the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Focusing on two population-based survey experiments in Germany and Austria on the prioritization of health or freedom (Germany) and the introduction of mandatory vaccination (Austria) in the COVID-19 crisis, we find an important trade-off: while a contestatory and open mode enhances in-depth reasoning, a collaborative mode promotes constructive thinking. Regarding opinion formation, we find that when societal polarization is not extreme, communication modes do not matter for opinion (de-)polarization; here, the exposure to information is all that is needed to move minds. In highly polarized situations, however, open communication is the only way to communicatively reach out to people. Our results contradict both advocates of a contestatory and collaborative renewal of public discourse.",

Previous research shows that mainstream parties contribute to the electoral success of far-right parties through coalitions or policy alliances. However, a long-term perspective on the influence of far-right actors, including parties, civil society organisations, and social movements, on mainstream parties’ communication is lacking. This article investigates how far-right actors and issues have influenced mainstream parties’ communication in Germany since the 1990s. Using automated text analysis, we analyse 520,408 articles from six newspapers. First, we semi-automatically collect far-right actors and mainstream parties and implement a structural topic model to analyse their issue agendas. Second, we use time-series analysis to examine agenda-setting effects and their drivers. The results show that far-right influence on mainstream parties’ communication has increased, particularly among opposition parties and around issues of Islam and migration. Notably, the agenda-setting effect cuts across party ideologies, indicating mainstream parties’ impact on the rise of the far right in democracies.",

    "abstract": "Affective polarization among citizens is often attributed to the harsh rhetoric and personal attacks that politicians direct at one another. However, the influence of elite rhetoric on affective polarization may work in both directions. We theorize that politicians can reduce affective polarization by making positive or respectful statements about their political opponents. A preregistered survey experiment with 2,000 citizens provides strong support for this expectation. Politicians’ congenial messages about their opponents significantly reduce affective polarization on two distinct measures. Specifically, the experimental treatments reduce citizens’ negative emotions toward outpartisans, as well as their desire to socially distance themselves from such outpartisans. The depolarizing effect of such messages does not depend on the political alignment of either the politician or the citizen, nor does it necessarily require high levels of political trust.",

Using a novel survey experiment design that exposed voters to arguments at the start and the end of the campaign, we were able to directly test the impact of a real-world campaign on voter susceptibility to frames. The findings reveal a notable reduction in framing effects. Initially, loss-related framed arguments swayed voters, but this impact waned at the campaign’s end. Our analysis suggests that the campaign provided voters with information and arguments that made them less susceptible to framing effects and instead empowered voters to make informed decisions on the referendum based on their own attitudes towards the EU. In the conclusions, we encourage further research on susceptibility to elite messages in real-world settings.",

Visual characteristics affect people’s preferences, but it is difficult to measure the extent of this effect precisely and concisely in surveys. We present a new adaptive design that measures the impact of visual characteristics on people’s preferences: The plot staircase. We apply it to graphs of time series data, identifying the effect of the slope of a sequence on evaluations of the sequence. The plot staircase replicates the existing finding that people have a strong preference for increasing trends. Using fewer survey questions than past approaches, it measures at the individual level how much overall welfare a survey respondent is willing to sacrifice for an increasing trend. We demonstrate the flexibility of the plot staircase across domains (economic growth, jobs creation, and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout) and across sequence characteristics. Survey measurement is more difficult for concepts that cannot be represented textually or numerically; our method enables researchers to measure preferences for graphical properties not reducible to the individual pieces of information.",

I test this theory in two preregistered vignette experiments on a sample of American Christians. Results show that elite cues significantly affect identification: negative cues notably decrease identification, especially among individuals without strong pre-existing beliefs. These findings demonstrate that elite discourse plays a powerful and enduring role in shaping public support for Christian Nationalism.",

To test these questions, we use a pre-registered candidate evaluation survey experiment that was fielded as part of the 2020 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We find that voters are more likely to vote for, donate to, and trust candidates that reject PAC contributions. Surprisingly, we fail to find evidence that this effect is moderated by party ID. The evidence indicates that Republican and Democratic voters alike penalize candidates that accept PAC money.

    "abstract": "Regardless of country, populist attitudes can better explain voting behavior and attitude formation toward social issues than party identification and political ideology. Nonetheless, despite the increased attention to rural/urban divides and diverse living experiences in each community, it has not been sufficiently uncovered how contextual factors, including local socioeconomic and health disparities, can moderate the roles of populist attitudes. Based on these findings, we explore (1) the roles of red and blue media use and populist attitudes in predicting support for preventive policies and (2) the moderation effects of local socioeconomic and health disparities in such associations. By analyzing online survey data from US adults (N = 1,700) conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate that blue media use was significantly associated with preventive policy support but not moderated by any socioeconomic and health disparities examined in this research. Meanwhile, red media use was significantly moderated by the Democrat vote share. Moreover, the 2 subdimensions of populist attitudes—anti-elitism and Manichaean outlook—were significantly moderated by community-based socioeconomic disparities, namely the cumulative COVID-19 infection rates and population size change in 2016–2020. We discuss these results and highlight the significance of exploring local and international contextual factors in studying populism.",

Little is known about the ebb and flow of this sentiment, however. This paper develops a measure of public sentiment, pooling results of thousands of polls between 2000 and 2021. It then develops an analogous measure of media sentiment based on a content analysis of millions of network television news transcripts. Analyses explore differences across data sources (i.e., polling houses and television networks) and consider the relationship between public and media sentiment. Results suggest that the measures are correlated concurrently, and there is some evidence that public sentiment responds to earlier media coverage. However, connections between the measures wax and wane over time, highlighting the potential importance of accounting for time-varying parameters in the study of public opinion and media effects.",

    "authors": "Felix J. Clouth, Maarten J. Bijlsma, Steffen Pauws, Jeroen K. Vermunt",
    "abstract": "The parametric g-formula can be used to estimate causal effects of time-varying exposures on observable outcomes. It resolves intermediate confounding in such settings by specifying several parametric models, one each for every time-varying variable, and by performing micro-simulations. However, its restriction to applications with observable outcomes limits its usability for social sciences where variables of interest are often unobservable constructs. In such cases, measurement models are needed. We propose a new approach utilizing bias-adjusted three-step latent Markov models (LMMs) within the parametric g-formula. LMMs estimate the probability of membership in an unobservable state conditional on observed indicator variables. By replacing the parametric models in the g-formula with LMMs, micro-simulations are performed as usual to estimate a causal effect of the time-varying exposure. We illustrate this new approach by estimating the average treatment effect of unemployment on several unobservable mental health states utilizing longitudinal data from the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences panel.",
