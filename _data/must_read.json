    "abstract": "Digital addictions, such as Internet, game, social media, and smartphone addiction, pose health risks. This cross-sectional online survey of 1,764 participants aged 16–28 (75.7 percent women) identified four addiction subtypes using specific scales. Network analysis revealed significant comorbidity (95.35 percent) among subtypes, with smartphone addiction playing a dominant role, leading to social media, Internet, and potentially game addiction. High comorbidity suggests a shared vulnerability, with smartphone use as a catalyst. Smartphone addiction is a key precursor to other digital addictions."

Based on a two (ad creativity: low vs. high) by two (creator label: human vs. AI) between-subjects experimental design, the present study showed that ad creativity in general had a positive direct impact on attitude toward the ad (A ad ), attitude toward the brand (A b ), and purchase intentions. In addition, there were significant mediation effects of perceived creativity on A ad and A b via perceived uncanniness, which was moderated by creator label. For the AI-creator-labeled condition, perceived creativity had negative indirect effects on A ad and A b via perceived uncanniness, such that greater perceived creativity led to greater perceived uncanniness, which in turn induced less favorable A ad and A b . However, the mediation effect was not found for the human-creator-labeled condition. Thus, the positive effect of ad creativity was smaller for the AI-creator-labeled ad."

Drawing on pragmatism and mediatization theory, we analyse communicative figurations in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) using survey data ( N = 529) and develop a Participatory Public Connection Index. Regression models reveal that public connection is driven more by communicative and territorial factors – such as local radio use, civic motivations and municipality size – than by sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that local media help sustain symbolic bonds and latent publics, contributing to democratic engagement and territorial cohesion despite the absence of visible collective action. We conceptualize latency as the communicative and symbolic potential through which publics persist beyond visible mobilization; operationally, the Participatory Public Connection Index captures this latent connection sustained by everyday local media practices."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how students perceive mobile, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as regulating cognitive load and emotional demands during learning. The research examines how AI-mediated mobile communication affects intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load, and how these perceptions influence mental effort, cognitive engagement, learning anxiety, and perceived academic performance. The study is situated in Nepal, where mobile learning and smartphone-based educational practices often substitute for limited institutional support. Guided by Cognitive Load Theory, a structural equation model was developed to examine relationships between perceived AI-mediated load types and student outcomes. The model was tested using survey data from 314 higher education students who had experience using ChatGPT through mobile devices. Results show that students who perceived ChatGPT as reducing extraneous load and enhancing germane load reported lower anxiety and higher cognitive engagement. These perceptions were also associated with higher perceived academic performance and more efficient mental effort. Intrinsic load remained a significant constraint but was mitigated when ChatGPT was used as a mobile scaffold in complex learning tasks. This is one of the first theory-driven studies to empirically test how students perceive generative AI's influence on multiple dimensions of cognitive load in mobile learning environments. The research contributes theoretical and empirical insights to information systems and educational technology by reframing mobile AI not merely as a usability tool but as a mechanism for cognitive load management and emotional regulation in under-resourced educational systems. The findings offer practical guidance for educators and instructional designers seeking to integrate generative AI into mobile learning strategies. ChatGPT can serve as a portable cognitive and emotional support system that clarifies complex concepts, reduces learning anxiety, and enhances engagement. Incorporating guided mobile AI use into coursework can improve learning efficiency and emotional well-being without increasing instructional workload, particularly in resource-constrained higher education settings."

    "abstract": "Current theories and measures of social media literacy are politically neutral, which poses a problem as far-right influences permeate mainstream social media platforms. The theory of Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy describes three orientations social media users may display toward far-right content: endorsement of far-right content, ambivalence toward far-right content, or rejection of far-right content. Based on this theory, we created a survey measure in which participants were asked to rate their likelihood of responding in various ways to hypothetical social media posts that included far-right dog whistles. Our sample of 14 young adults aged 18–24 consisted of 57% Black participants, 71% full-time students, and 71% people who worked at least part-time. We conducted cognitive interviews to examine how participants interpreted these scenarios and their response items. Findings revealed the measure’s overall effectiveness and identified actionable revisions. This study can inform future measure development based on Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy."

Conceptually, the article draws on key feminist perspectives, which have, over the past decades, been vital for turning sexual misconduct into a central issue of public concern. Our analysis of Dutch public broadcasting (1984–2019) and Twitter (2011–2019) reveals that Dutch television consistently advocated feminist perspectives and framed sexual misconduct as a national problem rooted in ‘internal’ structural failures. By contrast, Twitter discourse, particularly since 2015, was dominated by far-right rhetoric, framing the issue as an ‘external’ cultural threat linked to Islam and immigration. #MeToo was not visible in the dominant Twitter discourse on sexual misconduct but did appear on public television. Nevertheless, Dutch public broadcasters’ feminist agenda remained limited, failing to debunk the hypervisible racist and Islamophobic perpetrator myths circulating on Dutch social media."

Combining two empirical approaches—a small-scale analysis of top-ranked videos from YouTube search results in 2022 and 2024, and a large-scale data set of over 112k videos—we examine how Tate-related content continues to circulate and how the platform moderates such material. Our findings show that Tate remains highly visible through a diffuse and decentralized network of actors who repackage his messaging into interviews, remixes, and YouTube-native formats. This configuration produces what we term the “Tate-space”: an ambient ideological environment where motivational rhetoric, aspirational masculinity, and far-right talking points converge. We find that YouTube’s substantial moderation efforts are outpaced by the speed and scale of recommendation-driven circulation and that deplatforming, while symbolically significant, fails to disrupt the cultural and logistical dynamics that sustain Tate’s influence."

    "abstract": "It is often suggested that one way to reduce affective polarization is to remind citizens of a common in-group identity – such as the national one – to bridge partisan divides. Yet, to our knowledge, such a causal link has only been found in the United States, and even there, it has not been tested by exposure to the most common national symbol: the flag. Thus, we still do not know if such implicit yet ubiquitous reminders of national identity, rather than those that explicitly invoke national pride, are able to reduce affective polarization. In order to fill this research gap, we conducted a survey experiment in Sweden and Denmark in 2023/2024, two countries where national flags are omnipresent yet often ‘unwaved’. Using two versions of subtle flag treatments, our results show that in Sweden, subjects who were primed with a picture of the national flag showed lower levels of affective polarization measured as social distancing, but not in terms of trait stereotyping or party dislike. This effect was not mediated, however, by the strengthening of explicit national identity attitudes, such as national pride. These results suggest that flags need indeed not be explicitly waved in order to work their unifying magic."

Building on the updated PolDem dataset, which tracks media coverage of national election campaigns across fifteen European countries from 1972 to 2023, the symposium investigates how issue salience, party positioning, and voter behaviour interact under turbulent conditions. The introduction situates the contributions around three core themes: (1) measuring and comparing party communication across media and manifestos; (2) mapping cross-national and longitudinal variation in political conflict lines; and (3) identifying the drivers of politicization across economic, cultural, and political dimensions. Together, the articles offer an integrated, content-based perspective on campaign dynamics that links short-term issue emphasis to long-term party-system structuration. The collection advances our understanding of how crises reshape electoral competition and democratic representation in Europe."

This study investigates how candidates adapted their issue emphasis strategies in response to this crisis and whether their adjustments aligned with voter issue salience. Using a combination of media content analysis (PolDem dataset) and public opinion survey data (Enquête Electorale Française – EnEF), the study systematically examines issue emphasis for the six major candidates. The findings show that while candidates initially engaged with the Ukraine crisis, their emphasis on the issue declined over time, as economic concerns dominated the campaign agenda. The analyses confirm that mainstream candidates followed public issue salience more closely than challenger candidates, who engaged in selective issue emphasis strategies. Notably, Marine Le Pen, often classified as a challenger, behaved as a mainstream candidate, prioritizing economic issues over her traditionally owned themes such as immigration. These findings contribute to broader debates on issue salience, electoral shocks, and strategic campaign behavior, demonstrating that while external crises can momentarily disrupt campaign agendas, they do not necessarily redefine electoral competition."

    "abstract": "In this note, we offer a cautionary tale on the dangers of drawing inferences from low-quality online survey datasets. We reanalyze and replicate a survey experiment studying the effect of acquiescence bias on estimates of conspiratorial beliefs and political misinformation. Correcting a minor data coding error yields a puzzling result: respondents with a postgraduate education appear to be the most prone to acquiescence bias. We conduct two preregistered replication studies to better understand this finding. In our first replication, conducted using the same survey platform as the original study, we find a nearly identical set of results. But in our second replication, conducted with a larger and higher-quality survey panel, this apparent effect disappears. We conclude that the observed relationship was an artifact of inattentive and fraudulent responses in the original survey panel, and that attention checks alone do not fully resolve the problem. This demonstrates how “survey trolls” and inattentive respondents on low-quality survey platforms can generate spurious and theoretically confusing results."

Employing various panel data estimators, including difference-in-differences, we evaluate how partisan gaps evolve across changes to the political and health contexts, including the national vaccine rollout, individual vaccination status, and within-state policy variation. We find partisan divides are substantial even in (ostensibly) apolitical domains, although they are tempered by higher net personal costs to actions, lower public symbolism, and elite policy choices that counter national party cues."

Using a new data collection effort, I show that subjects who are more Agreeable or Neurotic have systematically different propensities to complete surveys. This result in hand, I show how relationships between the Big Five and political behavior may change estimated relationships between the traits and behavior.

We evaluate the effects of five distinct message frames—scientific, religious, moral, and two economic (efficiency and equity)—on support for climate change policy using a randomized experiment with over 2300 U.S. respondents. Moving beyond pairwise frame comparisons, we adopt a policy learning approach that identifies the most effective frame using cross-validated sample splitting, thereby avoiding selective inference. We find that the economic efficiency frame consistently yields the largest gains in policy support, outperforming both the control condition and all alternative frames, on average. While the effects of covariate conditional frame assignment were modest and not significantly different from assigning the best overall frame, we find consistent positive effects of the efficiency frame across partisan subgroups. Our findings offer methodological and substantive contributions: we highlight how policy-learning methods can be applied in experimental framing studies, and we offer specific evidence on the relative efficacy of alternative framing messages on support for several climate policies."

Following the recent adoption of sequential mixed-mode designs by panel studies worldwide, it has been observed that interview completion for respondents offered the initial mode of web is faster compared to those initially offered the telephone. This study describes an experiment designed to evaluate whether the new mixed-mode designs can support an accelerated field period and achieve cost savings while still meeting fieldwork goals. We assessed a shorter field period of 20 weeks against the standard 28-week field period and randomized study participants to each condition. The treatment group received accelerated fieldwork protocols over a 20-week data collection period, and a control group received the same protocols over the standard 28-week period. We compare the effect of the shortened duration on fieldwork outcomes, including response rates, sample composition, interviewer effort, time to interview completion, survey costs, and interview quality. We find that the accelerated protocol yields higher response rates, lower interviewer effort, and cost savings with no differences in sample composition or decrements to interview quality. We describe the strengths and limitations of the study and provide suggestions for future research on fieldwork duration."

Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments or a control (no message) condition. Treated individuals received a message that connected vaccination to patriotism, a core conservative value, and this was attributed to a public health official (treatment 1), Republican voter (2), or Democratic voter (3). With the exception of those who were vaccinated and boosted, the message either had no effect or, more often, produced a backlash that led Republicans to express less favorable dispositions toward vaccination; backlash was stronger for messages sourced to a Democrat or public health official. Our conclusion discusses implications for moral reframing research and public health messaging."

Although public perceptions associate somewhat with elite ideology, more variation is attributable to how citizen-level partisans identify ideologically. This carries mixed implications. On one hand, partisan-ideological sorting in the electorate has made it easier for voters to see the difference between parties. On the other, it leads voters to see the parties as being more extreme than they would otherwise. These findings underscore the extent to which parties, beyond their governmental function, are social groups with norms that are fluid, identifiable, and politically impactful."

    "abstract": "In June 2024, youth-led protests in Kenya against a controversial Finance Bill demonstrated the connection between digital technologies and political activism in the Global South. This study examines how generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shapes political participation by focusing on Kenyan Gen Z activists who used ChatGPT to create custom models: Finance_Bill_GPT, Corrupt_Politicians_GPT, and MPs_Contribution_GPT (collectively called Protest_GPT_KE). These tools simplified complex laws, exposed corruption, and mobilized young people online, allowing them to bypass traditional sources such as media and elites. However, using GAI for activism raises ethical and political concerns, including surveillance, data rights, and state repression. The study surveyed 374 Kenyan Gen Z participants, primarily in Nairobi, and used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the connections among AI use, tool appropriation, and political participation. Results show that ChatGPT use alone did not directly increase offline activism; its effect appeared when combined with Protest_GPT_KE and online participation. This study is one of the first to document how youth in the Global South are creatively using GAI for grassroots mobilization, demonstrating that GAI’s political influence depends on user innovation and context."

    "abstract": "Online survey participants are frequently recruited through social media platforms, opt-in online access panels, and river sampling approaches. Such online surveys are threatened by bots that shift survey outcomes and exploit incentives. In this proof-of-concept study, we advance the identification of bots driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) through the prediction of LLM-generated text in open narrative responses. We conducted an online survey on same-gender partnerships, including three open narrative questions, and recruited 1512 participants through Facebook. In addition, we utilized two LLM-driven bots, each of which responded to the open narrative questions 400 times. Open narrative responses synthesized by our bots were labeled as containing LLM-generated text (“yes”). Facebook responses were assigned a proxy label (“unclear”) as they may contain bots themselves. Using this binary label as ground truth, we fine-tuned prediction models relying on the “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers” (BERT) model, resulting in an impressive prediction performance: The models accurately identified between 97% and 100% of bot responses. However, prediction performance decreases if the models make predictions about questions they were not fine-tuned with. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on bots and extends the methodological toolkit for protecting the quality and integrity of online survey data."

    "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs can harm interpersonal relationships, but their impact on future relationships remains underexplored. Across four preregistered experiments ( N = 1,603), we examined how sharing conspiracy theories in online dating profiles affects interpersonal impressions and intentions to start relationships, and whether these outcomes depend on perceivers’ political orientation. Experiments 1a and 1b revealed that profiles including right-wing conspiracy theories were perceived less favorably compared to controls. Participants were also more reluctant to start relationships with the profile holder. In Experiment 2, implausible (vs. plausible) left-wing conspiracy theories elicited stronger negative reactions. In Experiment 3, participants showed less interest in conspiracy-sharing profiles (vs. controls) on a mock dating app. Political orientation moderated these effects—liberals were more critical, while conservatives were more lenient and sometimes favored conspiracy-sharing profiles. These findings further highlight the social consequences of sharing conspiracy theories and the moderating role of political orientation."

    "abstract": "Conspiracy theorists often prompt others to “Do your own research.” Could a general desire for such epistemic autonomy—to make up one’s own mind rather than deferring to others’ testimony—explain why some people are attracted to conspiracy theories? In four pre-registered studies (United States and United Kingdom, N = 1196), we test whether participants more likely to believe in conspiracy theories have a stronger preference for forming their own beliefs independently. Participants chose between doing a difficult perceptual task themselves or relying on an expert’s answer. Internal fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed a weak but statistically significant relationship between belief in conspiracy theories and preference for first-hand evidence. By contrast, the relationship between epistemic individualism and this preference was stronger and more robust. This suggests that, although individuals endorsing conspiracy theories express a stronger preference for “doing their own research,” their behavior mostly does not match this preference in non-conspiratorial contexts."

    "abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, prosociality across group boundaries becomes ever more important. Yet, a common premise in the behavioral and social sciences is that people are prosocial mainly toward their ingroup and not outgroups. So far, evidence for this premise comes mostly from studies in which people must choose between ingroup and outgroup prosociality, thereby precluding positive associations between the two types of prosociality. We study situations in which people make separate decisions regarding the ingroup and outgroup, allowing us to examine how ingroup and outgroup prosociality are related. Across six large-scale and cross-societal datasets spanning 743,402 individuals in 121 societies, we find a robust positive relationship between ingroup and outgroup prosociality. This relationship holds across societies, different group categorizations, and a diverse range of prosociality measures, including prisoner’s dilemmas, public good dilemmas, dictator games, and survey items on trust and tolerance. Although people are slightly more prosocial toward their ingroup than the outgroup, those who are prosocial toward the ingroup also tend to be prosocial toward the outgroup. The results offer an optimistic message for prosociality across group boundaries. When people are not made to choose between the ingroup and outgroup, they are generally prosocial toward both."
