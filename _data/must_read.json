    "abstract": "Human assumption of superior performance by machines has a long history, resulting in the concept of “machine heuristic” (MH), which is a mental shortcut that individuals apply to automated systems. This article provides a formal explication of this concept and develops a new scale based on three studies (Combined N = 1129). Measurement items were derived from the explication and an open-ended survey (Study 1, N = 270). These were then administered in a closed-ended survey (Study 2, N = 448) to identify their dimensionality through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Lastly, we conducted another survey (Study 3, N = 411) to verify the factor structure obtained in Study 2 by employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Analyses resulted in a validated scale of seven items that reflect the level of MH in individuals and identified six sets of descriptive labels for machines (expert, efficient, rigid, superfluous, fair, and complex) that serve as formative indicators of MH. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

    "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of “topic territoriality,” a mechanism that governs participation in conversational spaces. When a discussion becomes prone to territorialization, individuals are more likely to claim topics (participating in discussions about topics they own as “stakeholders”) and defer (reducing participation in topics owned by others). They are also more likely to patrol topic boundaries (monitoring who is participating and confronting topic “intruders”). We document the operation of topic territoriality by analyzing 112,278 conversational turns on Weibo before and after a policy that reveals users’ broad geographic locations. We find that revealing these locations increased territorial behaviors, leading to more homogenous participation in conversations. Although the display of locations has improved the overall civility in language, the confrontations between stakeholders and intruders became more toxic. Our research emphasizes the impact of topic territoriality in online conversations and sheds light on the unintended consequences of social media policies."

Using the 2004 and 2018 U.S. local news deserts datasets alongside census and election data, I adopt spatial panel regressions to delineate causal relationships between county-level attributes and local news preservation and further demonstrate spatial heterogeneity in these relationships through geographically weighted panel regressions. I find that news media follow the money and often move away from places where they are needed most—those with more racial-ethnic diversity and growing populations. Partisan composition does not help or hinder local newspaper preservation."

However, prior work often compares game-based interventions with the conventional non-game approach, failing to generate insights about which game features should be emphasized to create more effective games. To bridge this research gap, in light of video games’ advantages for creating immersive experiences that benefit persuasion, we created a narrative-based serious game addressing school bullying and conducted two studies (Study 1, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 130; Study 2, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 250) to explore the persuasive effects of two game features, respectively player–avatar similarity and in-game control, on player experience (including player–avatar identification, narrative engagement, and empathy) and prosocial intention. We found mixed results subject to player perspective such that only when players took the bully’s perspective did one of the game features—in-game control—successfully create the intended empathy via amplified narrative engagement toward the desirable prosocial intention."

Drawing upon the intergroup contact hypothesis and social penetration theory, a national sample of U.S. adults ( N = 1,596) participated in a 3 (sexual identity cue: explicit-cue vs implicit-cue vs no-cue) × 5 (coping with mental disorders: good-coping vs balanced-coping vs poor-coping vs no-coping vs control) between-subjects experiment. Results revealed that while dual stigma disclosure occasionally showed enhanced positive impacts, it never exacerbated stigmatized attitudes compared to single stigma disclosure. In addition, the two self-disclosure strategies interacted to influence destigmatization, mediated by perceived competence rather than perceived authenticity. Implications from the findings are provided."

We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining computational keyword filtering and content analysis with qualitative discourse analysis and applied to a corpus of 10,519 posts across seven social media platforms. The analysis informs two key findings. First, in both Bolsonaro and Erdogan’s presidential campaigns, religious rhetoric and symbolism is used to bolster personal authority and in-group support to consolidate the idea of (presiding over) a majority bloc. Second, while disinformation interfaces with religious messaging in both presidential campaigns, we find that religion is overwhelmingly instrumentalized as a vector for political disinformation—thus, we did not identify any significant presence of “religious disinformation,” classically understood. Ultimately, our article creates space for further comparative and region-specific scholarship to explore how religion, politics, and disinformation intersect with authoritarian populism in modern elections and beyond, while also contributing to the conceptual refinement of “religious disinformation.”"

    "abstract": "News sources that correct misinformation seek to foster an informed citizenry and promote democratic accountability. One such effort is being made by fact-checking sites across the globe. However, public trust in these outlets remains limited. Is their politics-focused coverage one factor behind the limited trust? Politics-focused coverage highlights partisan competition, which can harm credibility by activating identity-protective biases or resistance to persuasive intent. Prior research suggests depoliticized contexts can help mitigate defensive psychological tendencies in news source assessments. Thus, a potential approach to build broad-based trust could be to broaden the scope of coverage to include nonpolitical topics. Through a preregistered survey experiment in the United States, I test how the topical scope of coverage affects source credibility perceptions. Compared to politics-focused coverage, science-focused coverage improves credibility assessments. Focusing solely or partially on popular culture topics such as entertainment, sports, and lifestyle reduces source credibility. The effects of nonpolitical coverage on source credibility perceptions are similar across partisan groups. The results suggest the public shares the notion that serious public affairs coverage is central to reputable journalism. Overall, coverage of politics and science fares relatively well in building source credibility, whereas coverage of popular culture undermines credibility assessments. People find news sources that correct misinformation more credible when they cover a range of serious topics, but less credible when they cover lighter topics."

We conducted a case study of Chinese microblogging Weibo on conversations that emerged following a publicised celebrity suicide of South Korean superstar Sulli. This incident sparked an extensive discussion on mental health issues as Sulli was reported to have suffered from depression prior to her death. Whilst previous studies on users’ information acceptance mainly adopted survey methods, our study employs a mixed-method approach (i.e. computational data collection method, content analysis and statistical analysis), which opens up new directions to utilise secondary social media data. We identified MHRM from the discussions on Weibo and labelled the responses to the misinformation as whether they indicate an acceptance of the MHRM. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the associations of receivers’ acceptance of MHRM with its information features (e.g. number of likes) and information sources (e.g. gender). Inconsistent with previous studies, our findings suggest that MHRM is less likely to be accepted when published by male users, underscoring the context-specific nature of heuristic cues. This study also revealed some novel findings, such as MHRM with more pictures or with more words is less likely to be accepted. A theoretical model was proposed based on the findings, which highlights the importance of heuristic cues and individuals’ pre-existing knowledge in information processing."

    "abstract": "In psychology and human neuroscience, the practice of creating multiple subplots and combining them into a composite plot has become common because the nature of research has become more multifaceted and sophisticated. In the last decade, the number of methods and tools for data visualization has surged. For example, R, a programming language, has become widely used in part because of ggplot2, a free, open-source, and intuitive plotting library. However, despite its strength and ubiquity, it has some built-in restrictions that are most noticeable when one creates a composite plot, which currently involves a complex and repetitive process with steps that go against the principles of open science out of necessity. To address this issue, I introduce smplot2, an open-source R package that integrates ggplot2’s declarative syntax and a programmatic approach to plotting. The package aims to enable users to create customizable composite plots by linearizing the process of complex visualization. The documentation and code examples of the smplot2 package are available online ( https://smin95.github.io/dataviz )."

However, unsound study designs can lead to erroneous conclusions that impede this crucial work. In this article, we highlight a critical methodological challenge to drawing valid causal inferences in disparities research: selection bias. We describe two commonly adopted study designs in the literature on group-based disparities. The first is outcome-dependent selection, when the outcome determines whether an observation is selected. The second is outcome-associated selection, when the outcome is associated with whether an observation is selected. We explain the methodological challenge each study design presents and why it can lead to selection biases when evaluating the actual disparity of interest. We urge researchers to recognize the complications that beset these study designs and to avoid the insidious impact of inappropriate selection. We offer practical suggestions on how researchers can improve the rigor and demonstrate the defensibility of their conclusions when investigating group-based disparities. Finally, we highlight the broad implications of selection mechanisms for psychological science."

This intervention aimed to help students improve their performance by stimulating them to think about using learning resources for an exam preparation. The SRU intervention was tested in two undergraduate introductory-statistics courses. In the first experiment, students in the control condition received an email asking them to state their desired grade, how motivated they were to get that grade, how important it was to obtain the desired grade, and how confident they were in obtaining it. Participants in the experimental condition received the same mail and took the 15-min SRU intervention. On the final course exam, the SRU group outperformed the control group, yielding a small to medium effect size, a finding that was replicated in a second study. We conducted four preregistered conceptual replications of Chen and colleagues’ study in four undergraduate introductory-statistics courses at two Dutch higher-education institutions. In our study, the meta-analytic standardized effects on the final-exam scores in the intention-to-treat meta-analysis and the compliant-only analysis were small and not significantly different from 0, and the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals of both meta-analyses were smaller than the effect sizes of the two studies reported by Chen and colleagues. Comparable results were obtained for the pass rates. Thus, the results of the present study failed to corroborate the previously demonstrated positive effect of the SRU intervention on final-exam scores and pass rates."

Given that rapid methodological developments make it increasingly difficult for novice ESM researchers to be well informed about standards of ESM research and to identify resources that can serve as useful starting points, we here provide a primer on 10 essential design and implementation considerations for ESM studies. Specifically, we (a) compare ESM with cross-sectional, panel, and cohort approaches and discuss considerations regarding (b) item content and phrasing; (c) choosing and formulating response options; (d) timescale (sampling scheme, sampling frequency, survey length, and study duration); (e) change properties and stationarity; (f) power and effect sizes; (g) missingness, attrition, and compliance; (h) data assessment and administration; (i) reliability; and (j) replicability and generalizability. For all 10 topics, we discuss challenges and—if available—potential solutions and provide literature that can serve as starting points for more in-depth readings. We also share access to a living, web-based resources library with a more extensive catalogue of literature to facilitate further learning about the design and implementation of ESM. Finally, we list topics that although beyond the scope of our article, can be relevant for the success of ESM studies. Taken together, our article highlights the most essential design and implementation considerations for ESM studies, aids the identification of relevant in-depth readings, and can thereby support the quality of future ESM studies."

Journals, including Behavior Research Methods ( BRM ), continue to support the dissemination and evaluation of research assets including data, software/hardware, statistical code, and databases of stimuli. However, such research assets rarely allow for computational reproducibility, meaning they are difficult to reuse. Therefore, in this preregistered report, we explore how BRM ’s authors and BRM structures shape the landscape of functional research assets. Our broad research questions concern: (1) How quickly methods and analytical techniques reported in BRM can be used and developed further by other scientists; (2) Whether functionality has improved following changes to BRM journal policy in support of computational reproducibility; (3) Whether we can disentangle such policy changes from changes in reproducibility over time. We randomly sampled equal numbers of papers ( N = 204) published in BRM before and after the implementation of policy changes. Pairs of researchers recorded how long it took to ensure assets (data, software/hardware, statistical code, and materials) were fully operational. They also coded the completeness and reusability of the assets. While improvements were observed in all measures, only changes to completeness were altered significantly following the policy changes ( d = .37). The effects varied between different types of research assets, with data sets from surveys/experiments showing the largest improvements in completeness and reusability. Perhaps more importantly, changes to policy do appear to have improved the life span of research products by reducing natural decline. We conclude with a discussion of how, in the future, research and policy might better support computational reproducibility within and beyond psychological science."

However, there is little methodological research on the validity and reliability of human-produced continuous-time annotation of these states. We present a psychometric perspective on valid and reliable construct assessment, examine the robustness of interval-scale (e.g., values between zero and one) continuous-time annotation, and identify three major threats to validity and reliability in current approaches. We then propose a novel ground truth generation pipeline that combines emerging techniques for improving validity and robustness. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a case study involving crowd-sourced annotation of perceived violence in movies, where our pipeline achieves a .95 Spearman correlation in summarized ratings compared to a .15 baseline. These results suggest that highly accurate ground truth signals can be produced from continuous annotations using additional comparative annotation (e.g., a versus b) to correct structured errors, highlighting the need for a paradigm shift in robust construct measurement over time."
