    "authors": "Diego F M Oliveira, Qian Huang",
    "abstract": "This article examines gender disparities in academic communication research, focusing on authorship, collaboration, citation impact, faculty representation, and compensation in leading U.S. public universities. An analysis of 62,359 papers from 121 journals (2004–2023) shows women constitute 50.4% of authors and nearly half of sole-authored works, yet receive fewer citations, even in higher-impact journals. Women-only teams perform strongly in journal impact factors, particularly in smaller groups, suggesting parity in some contexts. Persistent biases remain: women in larger mixed-gender teams are cited less, and women Assistant Professors earn 5.61% less than men, though women Associates slightly out-earn men. These findings highlight the need for institutional reforms to promote equitable pay, recognition, and representation in communication research.",

    "authors": "Jana H Dreston, Andreas Nanz",
    "abstract": "As political campaigns increasingly use social media to reach voters, scholars debate whether users actually acquire election-related knowledge or merely perceive themselves as more knowledgeable. It remains unclear whether social media enhances voting that aligns with users’ political attitudes (“correct voting”). Previous studies suggest social media effects vary substantially based on whether exposure is intentional or incidental. In a between-subject online experiment (N = 1,460), participants scrolled through a social media feed exposing them to policy statements either intentionally, incidentally, or not at all before voting in a mock election. We found that both intentional and incidental exposure increased objective knowledge, whereas only intentional exposure enhanced subjective knowledge. Yet, participants did not translate the acquired knowledge into aligned voting. However, those who intentionally sought election information felt more confident in their voting decision. Our findings suggest social media may mobilize voters more effectively than it enables them to make “good” decisions.",

Drawing from the two-step flow of communication theory and behavioral models of collective action, we conducted two experimental studies and an innovative quasi-experimental field study (total N = 2,960). Across these studies, influencer messages increased collective response efficacy beliefs and political action intentions, particularly among followers with strong parasocial ties. Moreover, repeated exposure to an influencer’s message reinforced these effects. Our research underscores the potential of influencers in mobilizing collective political action within digital media environments.",

    "abstract": "The present study provides an Italian-adapted version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) 2.0, namely Italian version of the MFD (it-MFD), for use in the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count software. The MFD 2.0 was translated and adapted from English into Italian following a multistep process. Subsequently, the reviewers compared the output with the original text to identify semantic discrepancies. Independent judges then evaluated the relevance of each word to the five moral foundations, and only the words assessed as both relevant and with a high level of agreement between the judges were included in the final version. The resulting it-MFD comprises 2,881 words. To evaluate the tool's effectiveness, we applied it to a sample of salient texts originally written in Italian and for which official English translations were available. The results are presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has prompted many corporations to collaborate with social media influencers (SMIs) to create sponsored personal stories to engage their consumers. While the positive effects of narrative transportation have been examined in the SMI context, its potential backfire effects are rarely explored. Through two online experiments, Study 1 ( N = 161) found that narratives (vs. non-narratives) resulted in less positive ad responses, with these effects fully mediated by perceived manipulative intent. Study 2 ( N = 257) replicated these findings and further revealed that sponsorship disclosure moderated these effects: disclosure exacerbates the backfire effects of narratives by heightening perceived manipulative intent, whereas in non-narrative ads, it enhances ad effects by reducing consumers’ inference of manipulative intent.",

    "authors": "Vanesa Saiz-Echezarreta, Belén Galletero-Campos, Joan Ramon Rodriguez-Amat",
    "abstract": "This article explores the relationship between local media ecosystems and territorial hope in depopulated rural areas of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Drawing on geographies of hope as a travelling concept, we examine how local media shape affective orientations toward the future. Within the framework of rural mediatization, we conceptualize media ensembles as key drivers in the symbolic construction of place and as potential enablers of hope in territories historically marked by demographic decline. Approaching news deserts from the perspective of communicative resilience, we combine a media mapping of 721 depopulated municipalities with a face-to-face survey of 529 residents to analyze the role of local media in sustaining collective affective configurations. We construct an index of territorial hope based on three interrelated indicators: personal optimism, sense of belonging, and outward projection of the locality. Statistical analyses show that municipalities with more local media score significantly higher on this index, and a regression model confirms that media-related variables—especially interest in local news and trust in professional media—are stronger predictors of territorial hope than most sociodemographic factors. Our findings suggest that local media contribute to the emergence of territorial hope. This underscores the importance of integrating communication indicators into the study of geographies of hope and highlights their relevance to strengthen the symbolic agency of rural communities.",

    "abstract": "New media technologies have transformed social interactions, offering connectivity but also drawbacks such as phubbing – the act of ignoring others by using mobile phones during face-to-face interactions. This study examines the psychological consequences of being phubbed and how individuals cope through mobile use based on the temporal need-threat model. A lab experiment was conducted where participants interacted with partners and were phubbed. Results showed that phubbed individuals felt socially excluded, experienced threats to fundamental needs, and reported lower mood than those in the no-phubbing condition. Phubbing also led to less favorable attitudes toward the partners and lower interaction intention. Analysis of mobile use during a break after phubbing revealed no significant differences in social versus non-social mobile use. Interestingly, individuals with high social mobile use reported increased need threats. These findings highlight the impact of phubbing and its implications for need satisfaction and social interactions in the digital age.",

In a single-factor experiment ( N = 1,264), compared to lean narratives or statistics, rich narratives most effectively elicited fear through heightened transportation, although they did not outperform lean narratives in evoking guilt. Fear increased risk perception through reduced psychological distance and greater self-referencing; guilt was positively associated with both. Elevated risk perception predicted more favorable attitudes and stronger behavioral intentions.

    "abstract": "Many individuals regularly use multiple social media platforms, and their information exposure is shaped by the various networks they maintain across these platforms. Given the rising trend of multi-platform social media use, this article introduces a two-step approach to investigate how networks across platforms conjointly and distinctly relate to incidental exposure to news and political information. Our analysis of survey data from the United States showed that greater immersion in multiple politically heterogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal incidental exposure, while greater immersion in multiple politically homogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher pro-attitudinal incidental exposure. Among the popular platforms, immersion in networks on Facebook, X (Twitter), and YouTube played a particularly influential role in these relationships. Surprisingly, we also found that greater immersion in homogeneous networks across multiple platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal exposure, even though immersion in any single platform’s homogeneous network was not a significant predictor.",

We rely on an online survey fielded in 17 European countries on more than 28,000 individuals. Our findings indicate that being embedded in healthier discussions on social media is more of an important predictor of online participation for those respondents reporting higher political discussion fatigue and less so for those perceiving online discussions as fun.

    "abstract": "The “News Finds Me” (NFM) perception captures the common belief that one can stay informed without actively seeking news. This study aims to extend previous research by comparing the widely used general NFM measure with topic-specific perceptions of entertainment, sports, politics, COVID-19, and climate change news. We assess the strength, predictors, and outcomes of NFM perceptions across those different thematic domains. Our findings show that NFM perceptions are stronger for soft news (entertainment and sports) compared to hard news (politics, COVID-19, climate change). In addition, interest in a news topic is associated with lower NFM perceptions for hard news and higher perceptions for soft news. While the traditional NFM measure reflects “News Finds Me” perceptions in politics and COVID-19 well, it is not as effective in capturing perceptions of climate change and soft news. Our results emphasize the need to explore different news genres to better understand news consumption beliefs and behaviors.",

We argue that only high-intensity attacks, whose motives and targets mirror PRRPs’ nativist agenda, are likely to generate a media backlash that dampens electoral support for PRRPs. We test this argument by combining high-frequency survey and social media data with a natural and survey experimental design. We find that right-wing terror reduced support for the radical right party Alternative für Deutschland after one of the most intense nativist attacks in recent German history. An analysis of all ninety-eight fatal right-wing attacks in Germany between 1990 and 2020 supports our argument. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how political violence triggers partisan detachment and have important implications for media responsibility in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.",

This article presents a dataset of climate change salience in 1,792 political manifestos of 620 political parties across different party families in forty-five OECD, European, and South American countries from 1990 to 2022. Importantly, our measure uniquely isolates climate change salience, avoiding the conflation with general environmental and sustainability content found in other work. Exploiting recent advances in supervised machine learning, we developed the dataset by fine-tuning a pre-trained multilingual transformer with human coding, employing a resource-efficient and replicable pipeline for multilingual text classification that can serve as a template for similar tasks. The dataset unlocks new avenues of research on the political discourse of climate change, on the role of parties in climate policy making, and on the political economy of climate change. We make the model and the dataset available to the research community.",

    "authors": "Christopher D. Johnston, David J. Ciuk, Jesse Lopez",
    "abstract": "What drives ideological and partisan divisions in contemporary American politics? An influential line of research suggests they are rooted in disagreement about the nature of morality. While the left uses principles of care and fairness in moral judgment, the right considers loyalty, authority, and sanctity to be additional morally relevant values. This creates a “moral empathy gap” that makes it difficult for people to understand the perspective of their political opponents and fosters intolerance and gridlock. Evidence for moral disagreement between the left and right rests largely on a survey measure with significant limitations—the moral foundations questionnaire. We review the methodological issues associated with this measure and use two alternative strategies to examine moral disagreement in American politics. Across six distinct empirical tests with U.S. adults, we find that moral differences between the left and right are smaller than what is measured with the moral foundations questionnaire.",

    "title": "STATISTICAL INFERENCE UNDER NONIGNORABLE SAMPLING AND NONRESPONSE—AN EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD APPROACH",
    "authors": "Danny Pfeffermann, Arie Preminger, Anna Sikov",
    "abstract": "Statistical models are often based on sample surveys. When the sample selection probabilities and/or the response probabilities are related to a model outcome variable, even after conditioning on the model covariates, the model holding for the observed data is different from the model holding in the population, resulting in biased inference if not accounted for properly. Accounting for sample selection bias is relatively simple because the sample selection probabilities are usually known. Accounting for nonignorable nonresponse is much harder since the response probabilities are, in practice, unknown. In this article, we develop a new approach for modelling complex survey data, which accounts simultaneously for nonignorable sampling and nonresponse. Our proposed approach combines the nonparametric empirical likelihood with a parametric model for the response probabilities, which contains the outcome variable as one of the covariates. Combining the model holding for the responding units with the model for the response probabilities enables extracting the model holding for the missing data and imputing them. We propose ways of testing the underlying model holding for the respondents’ data. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the approach in terms of parameter estimation and imputation. We conclude with an application to the household expenditure survey in Israel, carried out by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics. The survey collects information on the socio-demographic characteristics of each member of the sampled households (HH), as well as detailed information on the HH income and expenditure. The total sample size was n = 12,136 with 7,827 responding HHs. The target estimated parameter in this application is the population mean of the gross HH income.",

    "title": "Prompt Engineering for Large Language Model-Assisted Inductive Thematic Analysis",
    "authors": "Muhammad Talal Khalid, Ann-Perry Witmer",
    "abstract": "The potential of large language models (LLMs) to mitigate the time- and cost-related challenges associated with inductive thematic analysis (ITA) is being increasingly explored in the literature. However, the use of LLMs to support ITA has often been opportunistic, relying on ad hoc prompt engineering (PE) approaches, thereby undermining the reliability, transparency, and replicability of the analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a structured approach to PE in LLM-assisted ITA. To this end, a comprehensive review of the existing literature is conducted to examine how researchers applying ITA integrate LLMs into their workflows and, in particular, how PE is utilized to support the analytical process. Built on the insights generated from this review, four key steps for effective PE in LLM-assisted ITA are identified and proposed. Furthermore, the study explores advanced PE techniques that can enhance the execution of these steps, providing researchers with practical strategies to improve their analyses. In conclusion, the main contributions of this paper include: (i) mapping the existing research on LLM-assisted ITA to enable a better understanding of the rapidly developing field, (ii) proposing a structured four-step PE process to enhance methodological rigor, (iii) discussing the application of advanced PE techniques to support the execution of these steps, and (iv) highlighting key directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Attention has become a vital form of capital in the digital age, yet the mechanisms underlying its allocation on social media remain poorly understood. Using a nationally representative, online and offline-integrated dataset of a Generation Z cohort in China, we provide large-scale evidence on the determinants of success in attracting attention. Our findings reveal that ‘how you express yourself’ (using various emojis and expressing multiple emotions) is more influential than ‘who you are’ (in terms of gender, education, family background and personality traits) in attracting attention on social media. Further analysis confirms a causal effect of the variety of emojis and types of emotions on attracted attention, while simulation processes using agent-based models suggest that empathy evocation is the primary underlying mechanism. We also show that the mode of expression is largely independent of individual characteristics and that the attention gained from highly appealing expressions is easier to acquire than to sustain, as it is highly sensitive to changes in expression modes over time. Overall, our research identifies three key features of attention capital allocation on social media: low alignment with traditional resources, considerable manipulability and ease of acquisition but difficulty sustaining it over time.",
