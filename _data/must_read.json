    "abstract": "This meta-analysis reviews the findings from 26 studies ( N = 8,061) examining the association between children feeling caught between parents (also referred to as parent-child triangulation) and parent-child relationship quality. The cumulative evidence indicated a small but meaningful inverse relationship between children feeling caught and relationship quality with parents ( r = −.218, 95% CI: −.260, −.175). The overall effect was heterogenous. Moderator analyses revealed that the inverse association was stronger in studies using non-U.S. samples ( k = 4, r = −.332, 95% CI: −.419, −.239) compared with U.S. samples ( k = 22, r = −.197, 95% CI: −.237, −.155). Conversely, the association was not moderated by the divorce status of the parents, the Whiteness of the samples, gender of the children, measures of feeling caught and relationship quality, or by research design. Implications for family systems theory are discussed.",

    "authors": "Chaerim Park, Huiyoung Shin",
    "abstract": "Depression and loneliness are major threats to health in midlife and older adulthood, carrying substantial mental and physical consequences. Although they frequently co-occur, they are conceptually distinct: depression reflects a broader pattern of psychological distress, whereas loneliness captures the subjective perception of social disconnection. Few studies have simultaneously examined multiple relational dimensions in relation to these outcomes, particularly in non-Western contexts. This study applied network analysis to investigate how diverse features of social relationships—including network size, contact frequency, social engagement, perceived support and strain, and relationship quality—relate to loneliness and depression in South Korean adults aged 40–69 years ( N = 502, M = 54.4; 49.4% male). The network revealed that loneliness was most strongly linked to friend network size, marital quality, and friendship quality and was positively associated with friend and spousal strain. Depression was directly connected to loneliness and marital quality, while indirectly shaped by broader relational features, including friend network size and dynamics within friendships and marriages. Centrality analyses highlighted the pivotal role of emotionally meaningful ties—particularly with spouses and friends—in shaping these outcomes. Gender-stratified networks further showed that women’s outcomes were more closely tied to the quality of close relationships, whereas men’s were more strongly linked to broader social participation. Together, these findings underscore the interdependent and multidimensional nature of social relationships in midlife and older adulthood, extend evidence to a non-Western context, and suggest that strengthening intimate ties and opportunities for meaningful engagement may help reduce loneliness and depression.",

    "authors": "Ta’Les Love, Sonya Dal Cin, Apryl Williams",
    "abstract": "Skin tone discrimination—or colorism—is an additional marginalization barrier that People of Color must navigate. Black women, especially those with darker complexions, are often discursively constructed as the antithesis to Western beauty standards—standards that commonly prioritize White femininity as the beauty benchmark. Studies on the beauty influencer economy reveal that Black women remain at a disadvantage in the beauty hierarchy. This study uses a survey experiment to explore how skin tone impacts perceptions of attractiveness and competence among viewers of digital beauty content. Surveying African Americans ( N = 576), primarily Black Women ( n = 524), we found that beauty influencers with darker skin tones are rated as less attractive and less competent. Participants also revealed that they would be less likely to click on the videos of darker skinned beauty influencers in comparison to influencers with lighter brown and medium brown skin tones. These results suggest that, among Black women viewers, preferences for beauty content is skin tone dependent. Because view counts are a significant metric in influencer marketability, viewing disparities along the lines of skin tone have the potential to widen the gap among Black influencers, creating disproportionate opportunities for success within an already marginalized population.",

    "authors": "Robert E. Wickham",
    "abstract": "Interest in two‐person interaction scenarios has increased substantially over the prior decades, and a multitude of analytic approaches have been developed to accommodate these designs. Although the Actor‐Partner model has received the most attention, useful variations on the Common Fate Model (CFM) for dyadic analysis have emerged. Specifically, the Between‐Within CFM (BW‐CFM) has arisen as a compelling approach, as it produces a Dyad‐level coefficient representing the between‐dyads effect, within‐dyad coefficients at the Person‐level, and allows for the estimation of contextual effects. Although the basic configuration of the BW‐CFM is well understood, several configurations of the model that accommodate different patterns of Person‐level relationships remain unexplored. The present work examines specifications of the BW‐CFM that are likely to arise in real‐world analysis, describes a procedure for selecting the optimal specification of Person‐level parameters and illustrates the application of a procedure for quantifying the degree of model selection uncertainty.",

Using network psychometrics on responses from 71,922 individuals in 68 countries, we model trust as an interconnected community system of attitudes and beliefs.

This dynamic structure challenges reflective latent models and emphasizes trust as a product of message framing and credibility cues.

    "abstract": "This study investigates Russian television coverage of Ukraine between 2009 and 2019, drawing on a dataset of over 2.3 million news episodes from eight major television networks and one news agency (Interfax), including both state-controlled and relatively independent outlets. Combining natural language processing techniques with a quasi-experimental design, the analysis traces changes in content patterns over time. The results provide strong evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: following a state-enforced management change at RBC TV in 2016, the network increased the share of news coverage primarily focused on Ukraine by up to 40 percent, depending on the assumed treatment date. Evidence for the second hypothesis—which posits that RBC’s reporting would become more similar to state-controlled outlets—remains only partial. Cosine similarity analysis shows that RBC’s content became more similar to several state-controlled outlets while diverging from relatively independent TV Rain (Dozhd). Sentiment-polarity analysis indicates that RBC’s coverage became modestly more negative after the takeover. These findings suggest that content changes following institutional intervention may reflect increased alignment with state-linked narratives while preserving outlet-specific variation. The study contributes to research on media alignment in autocratic contexts by analyzing a single-case pattern and highlights both the potential and limitations of computational text analysis in examining large-scale trends in state media coverage.",

    "abstract": "What democratic institutions and practices do citizens prioritize, and how responsive are their preferences to competing concerns such as economic and physical security? We explore this through a conjoint experiment with over 35,000 respondents across thirty-two countries – spanning democracies and autocracies – who evaluate hypothetical countries varying in democratic features, cultural characteristics, economic prosperity, and physical security. Our findings reveal that citizens consistently prioritize free and fair elections, highlighting their salience as a core democratic value. However, executive constraints appear less central to citizens’ preferences, especially when set against the promise of economic prosperity. These patterns hold across a wide range of national and individual contexts. The results suggest that while elections remain symbolically and substantively important, many citizens are responsive to appeals that frame strong, unconstrained leadership as a pathway to economic prosperity – an emphasis often seen in electoral authoritarian regimes.",

This article shows that (1) two individuals who live in equally diverse local contexts may not perceive the same amount of diversity in that context, nor think of the boundaries of their local community in the same way; and (2) when comparing two individuals who live in equally diverse local contexts, the one who thinks they live with more minorities tends, on average, to see lower social cohesion and less collective efficacy among their neighbors. These descriptive results align with a causal framework that distinguishes the objective environment from that of the subjective context. Revealing that perceptions of social reality matter above and beyond the experience of objective context adds evidence to a theory of context effects that involves perceptions as well as experience.",

Key to that success, arguably, is news media attention. Is the media attention that niche parties receive affected by mainstream parties as well? In this paper, we combine news value theory with party competition theory to argue that other parties influence niche party visibility. Focusing on green parties in 11 countries between 1992 and 2021, we find evidence that the salience of green policies in mainstream parties’ manifestoes enhance green party visibility in newspapers if these parties take an adversarial position. This positive effect turns negative as the mainstream party becomes greener, which suggests that it steals a niche party’s thunder. The insight that mainstream parties can influence media attention to niche parties opens up new lines of research on the emergence of niche parties.",

Using the 2022 budget negotiations between Norway’s two-party minority government and its informal support party as a case, we test whether voters attribute more responsibility to parties who “own” the issues that are particularly salient during the negotiations. We test our hypotheses with a 3 × 2 × 2 factorial vignette experiment. The results reveal that junior members and support parties are perceived as more responsible for policy outcomes when their issue ownership is emphasized in budget negotiations. This effect is amplified when voters are primed to consider policy influence. This has important strategic implications especially for smaller parties involved in coalition governing.",

    "authors": "Licheng Liu, Teppei Yamamoto",
    "abstract": "Despite the recent methodological advancements in causal panel data analysis, concerns remain about unobserved unit-specific time-varying confounders that cannot be addressed by unit or time fixed effects or their interactions. We develop a Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) method to address the concern. Our proposed method is built upon a general framework combining Rubin’s Bayesian framework for model-based causal inference (Rubin [1978], The Annals of Statistics 6(1), 34–58) with parametric BSA (McCandless, Gustafson, and Levy [2007], Statistics in Medicine 26(11), 2331–2347). We assess the sensitivity of the causal effect estimate from a linear factor model to the possible existence of unobserved unit-specific time-varying confounding, using the coefficients of the treatment variable and observed confounders in the model for the unobserved confounding as sensitivity parameters. We utilize priors on these coefficients to constrain the hypothetical severity of unobserved confounding. Our proposed approach allows researchers to benchmark the assumed strength of confounding on observed confounders more systematically than conventional frequentist sensitivity analysis techniques. Moreover, to cope with convergence issues typically encountered in nonidentified Bayesian models, we develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm exploiting transparent parameterization (Gustafson [2005], Statistical Science 20(2), 111–140). We illustrate our proposed method in a Monte Carlo simulation study as well as an empirical example on the effect of war on inheritance tax rates.",

Yet, the link between micro‐level mechanisms and macro‐level phenomena remains unclear. We investigated the consequences of individuals striving for cognitive coherence in their belief systems on political polarization in society in an agent‐based model. In this, we formalized how cognitive coherence affects how individuals update their beliefs following social influence and self‐reflection processes. We derive agents' political beliefs as well as their subjective belief systems, defining what determines coherence for different individuals, from European Social Survey data via correlational class analysis. The simulation shows that agents polarize in their beliefs when they have a strong strive for cognitive coherence, and especially when they have structurally different belief systems. In a mathematical analysis, we not only explain the main findings but also underscore the necessity of simulations for understanding the complex dynamics of socially embedded phenomena such as political polarization.",

We address this missing link by first examining the distribution of hate speech in five original datasets that collect user-generated posts across multiple platforms (social media and online newspapers) and countries (Switzerland and the United States). Across these diverse samples, the vast majority of hate speech is produced by a small fraction of users. Second, results from a pre-registered field experiment on Twitter indicate that counterspeech strategies obtain only small reductions of future hate speech, mainly because this approach proves ineffective against the most prolific contributors of hate.

Our thesis is that, irrespective of the direction of the policy (progressive or conservative), nativists express selective support for policies based on different signals of group-identity: descriptive markers, group-based substantive representation, in- and out-group norms, and group-based reasoning. We test this theoretical expectation using a novel AI-powered visual conjoint experiment in the Netherlands and Germany that asked individuals to select between hypothetical educational reform proposals presented by civic actors during a public consultation. Empirically, our results demonstrate that citizens, on average, are indeed selectively (il)liberal and that this instrumental policy support is greater among those with higher levels of underlying nativism. Specifically, we show that—among our multidimensional markers of group-based identities, norms, and reasoning—group-based substantive representation and in-group norms are the strongest determinants of support for diverse reform proposals. These findings have key implications on the malleable nature of citizens’ support for the backsliding of the liberal tenets of democracy as well as the persuasive power of out-group disidentification .",

Given the limits of observational data, we present results from a 2022 survey experiment of nearly 2000 residents in Spain. Respondents were prompted to write about one of two common types of poor government performance—corruption or unemployment. In addition, we asked respondents to write about corruption as generated either by elites or by the system of government generally. Our outcome, support for democracy, is measured using questions about commonly eroded democratic practices and about democracy generally (labeled “conceptual democracy”). We find that the writing primes reduce support for conceptual democracy but did not reduce support for specific democratic practices like civil liberties or institutional checks on executives. These findings show that in addition to factors like partisanship and elite rhetoric, government performance plays an important role in shaping public support for democracy in nuanced ways.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates how regional-level immigration of different origins and educational backgrounds predicts individual policy preferences across Western European countries between 2010 and 2020. Combining data from the European Social Survey and the European Union Labour Force Survey, we examine how changes in net migration affect support for restrictive immigration policies. We find that short-term increases in non-European immigration within a given region are associated with more restrictive migration policy views among natives, regardless of immigrants' education levels. Attitudes toward immigration are also relatively more negatively affected among natives with financial difficulties when immigrants are not tertiary educated, but not when those immigrants have a tertiary education. Our findings suggest that while origin-based heuristics dominate public responses to immigration, natives are not entirely blind to immigrants' educational attainment.",

    "authors": "Taewoo Kang, Kjerstin Thorson, Tai-Quan Peng, Dan Hiaeshutter-Rice, Sanguk Lee, Stuart Soroka",
    "abstract": "This study attempts to advance automated content analysis from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign. By assessing each model’s alignment with partisan perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing can be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). The findings indicate that LLM-based partisan perspective simulations reflect politically polarized standpoints across partisan groups, revealing a pronounced divergence in sentiment analysis between Democrat-aligned and Republican-aligned persona models. This pattern is evident in intercoder-reliability metrics, which are higher among same-partisan than cross-partisan persona model pairs. Results also suggest that LLM partisan simulations exhibit stronger ideological biases when analyzing politically congruent content. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research and may also enable simulations of real-world implications.",

    "title": "Generating the Past: How Artificial Intelligence Summaries of Historical Events Affect Knowledge",
    "authors": "Daniel Karell, Matthew Shu, Thomas Davidson, Keitaro Okura",
    "abstract": "Many people now use AI chatbots to obtain summaries of complex topics, yet we know little about how this affects knowledge acquisition, including how the effects might vary across different groups of people. We conducted two experiments comparing how well people recalled factual information after reading AI-generated or human-written historical summaries. Participants who read AI-generated summaries scored significantly higher on knowledge tests than those who read expert-written blog posts (Study 1) or Wikipedia articles (Study 2). These improvements were present regardless of whether readers knew the content was AI-generated or if the AI summaries were politically biased. Moreover, AI summaries improved recall across various demographic groups, including gender, race, income, education, and digital literacy levels. This suggets that using AI tools for everyday factual queries does not create new knowledge inequalities but could still amplify existing ones through differential access. Our findings indicate that the increasingly routine use of AI for information-seeking could enhance factual learning, with implications for education policy and addressing inequality.",

    "title": "The impact of the pupil size artifact on pupil-based eye-tracking data in reading tasks: Assessment and compensation",
    "authors": "Wolf Culemann, Angela Heine, Ignace T. C. Hooge",
    "abstract": "Eye tracking in reading research requires high spatial accuracy due to small, densely arranged areas of interest. However, despite widespread use of pupil-based eye trackers in reading studies, a major source of systematic inaccuracy remains largely unaddressed: the pupil size artifact (PSA) – apparent gaze shift in fact caused by pupil dilation even when the eye remains stationary. Using pupillary light reflex manipulations and reading tasks under controlled luminance, we quantified gaze inaccuracy due to the PSA and compared correction methods. We observed systematic apparent gaze shift of up to 2 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ as pupil sizes varied from 2 to 6 mm. Horizontal PSA showed contralateral patterns (median slopes: 0.38 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ /mm), while vertical PSA increased with pupil size (up to 0.86 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ /mm for larger pupils). Even under constant luminance, pupil size varied substantially during reading (median 95% ranges 0.78–1.38 mm). We compared two correction approaches: line assignment (standard in reading research) and PSA recalibration (modeling pupil-size-induced apparent gaze shift across the screen). Both methods effectively corrected vertical apparent gaze shift, showing similar average correction offsets and sensitivity of correction to pupil size, suggesting that line assignment implicitly compensates for vertical PSA effects. However, only PSA recalibration addressed horizontal apparent gaze shift, reducing overall gaze shift by over 50% and improving the performance of line assignment algorithms. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for PSA in reading research. We offer practical recommendations for improving gaze accuracy in eye-tracking reading studies.",

    "abstract": "Human–machine partnerships are increasingly used to address grand societal challenges, yet knowledge of the comparative strengths of humans and machines to innovate is nascent. Here we compare the ability of humans (N = 9,198) and large language models (LLMs, N = 215,542 observations) to generate novel ideas in an established creativity task. We present three key results. First, human creativity on average is slightly higher than that of LLMs. Second, creativity differences are pronounced at the extremes of the distribution, with humans exhibiting greater variability and higher levels of creativity in the right-hand tail of the distribution. Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results. We discuss the implications of our findings for human–machine collaboration and problem solving.",
