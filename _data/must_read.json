    "abstract": "Purpose The present research aims to explore the influence of enterprise social media (ESM) features on employee agility through knowledge sharing and hiding. ESM strain was taken as a moderator in the association among knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding and employee agility. Communication visibility theory is used to underpin the hypothesized research model. Design/methodology/approach Data is collected from 374 Chinese employees working in different companies. A structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied using AMOS software 21.0. Findings Findings illustrate that ESM features namely analysis, tracking and communication are significantly connected to knowledge sharing and negatively to knowledge hiding. Knowledge sharing is significantly related to employee agility while knowledge hiding is negatively linked to employee agility. Further, ESM strain strengthens the negative connection between knowledge hiding and employee agility. However, ESM strain has an insignificant moderating effect in the connection between knowledge sharing and employee agility. Practical implications The current research has practical implications for ESM users and ESM-enabled organizations. For individuals who use ESM to promote knowledge within an organization, this study highlights the important functioning of ESM features that include analysis, tracking and communication. For managers, this study suggests the use of ESM features to promote knowledge sharing and inhibit knowledge hiding. Originality/value The current research investigates how ESM features are associated with employee agility in the workplace. This study proposes that knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding are the mediators of the effect path between ESM features and employee agility. Moreover, the present study extends to ESM literature by highlighting the moderating role of ESM strain using communication visibility theory as a theoretical lens. Lastly, this study quantifies the benefits of ESM features to help organizations train agile employees."

This study explores the intrinsic relationship between enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility and self-leadership on the basis of communication visibility theory (CVT) and conservation of resources theory (COR) to support the sustainable growth of employee self-leadership. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 332 Chinese employees across three stages. Hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method were employed to test the hypotheses. Findings Network translucence and message transparency positively affect self-leadership. Relational energy and job control mediate the relationship between communication visibility and self-leadership. Moreover, response expectations weaken the positive relationship between relational energy and self-leadership as well as between job control and self-leadership. Practical implications Managers can use ESM to provide work and social support for employees’ job control and social network development to achieve long-term maintenance of employees’ self-leadership. At the same time, within the context of ESM use, moderately reducing response expectations can offer situational support for employees to achieve self-leadership. Originality/value This research sheds light on the internal mechanism by which ESM communication visibility affects self-leadership and explores the key boundary conditions that impact how self-leadership is formed. These findings expand the understanding of self-leadership development in the context of ESM use and offer new technical insights for guiding and fostering sustainable employee self-leadership."

    "abstract": "Purpose Users contribute to online communities by posting and responding to discussion threads. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of threads gain popularity and shape community discourse. Prior studies have identified several factors driving thread popularity; however, despite their prevalence, the role of emotional expressions within discussion threads remains understudied. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of thread starters’ valence and embedded discrete emotions of anger, anxiety and sadness on thread popularity, drawing on the negativity bias and the emotion-as-social-information theories. Design/methodology/approach Using two samples from Reddit, this study employs negative binomial regression analysis to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that negativity in thread starters significantly influences thread popularity; however, the expression of discrete emotions impacts popularity variously. In some contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccination subreddits, embedded anger in thread starters decreases thread popularity, whereas anxiety and sad expressions enhance it. In other contexts, such as professional discussions (e.g. r/Medicine subreddit), anger and anxiety expressions increase thread popularity, while sad expressions have no significant influence. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by its focus on specific emotions and contexts. Future research could examine a broader range of emotions, post-content modalities and the impact of cultural and linguistic differences. Originality/value This study contributes to theory by offering a new definition of thread popularity and enhancing our understanding of the impact of emotions in online discussions. It also provides practical implications for online community members and moderators seeking to promote discussion posts that help achieve community goals."

    "abstract": "Purpose Digital device recycling platforms (DDRPs) are customer-to-business online marketplaces that allow consumers to trade in or sell their used electronics, like smartphones and laptops, directly to a business for cash or credit. Guaranteed data destruction is a service provided by most DDRPs to securely erase all data on devices being recycled or traded in. Perceived credibility of the service refers to the extent to which customers are confident in the effectiveness and reliability of the service offered by a given DDRP. Grounded in privacy calculus theory, the current study aims to explore the influence of perceived credibility of guaranteed data destruction service (GDDS) on one’s intention to use a DDRP. Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was conducted through an online survey of Chinese DDRP users. The proposed model was tested by analyzing the collected data using the structural equation modeling approach. Findings Our results indicate that perceived credibility of GDDS affects users’ intention to use DDRPs by decreasing privacy concerns and increasing perceived convenience and environmental benefits of these platforms. Research limitations/implications This study’s findings are based on data collected from Chinese DDRP users, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other cultural or market contexts. Practical implications This study provides practical guidance for DDRPs, emphasizing the importance of enhancing perceived credibility through transparent data destruction practices and certifications. Originality/value The findings of the current study offer implications for theory development in sustainable information technology and e-commerce as well as practical suggestions for increasing usage of DDRPs."

    "abstract": "Purpose This study explores how employees respond to social media-induced fear of missing out (FoMO) in the workplace and examines the subsequent impacts of these responses. Based on the transactional theory of stress and coping, the research focuses on how FoMO affects employees’ adoption of stress-coping behaviors: active work interruption (a problem-oriented strategy) and social network interaction (an emotion-oriented strategy). It further investigates the outcomes of these coping strategies – job burnout (resulting from the problem-oriented strategy) and workplace relationships (resulting from the emotion-oriented strategy). Additionally, the study explores how the perceived competitive climate moderates the effect of FoMO on these coping behaviors. Design/methodology/approach A two-phase survey yielded 244 responses, which were then analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling to validate the relationships among the variables. Findings The findings revealed that FoMO increases employees’ active work interruption, leading to job burnout. In addition, FoMO leads employees to engage in more social network interaction, which promotes workplace relations. The perceived competitive climate positively moderates the indirect effect of workplace FoMO through active work interruption and job burnout. Originality/value This study emphasizes that individuals are not merely passive recipients of stress but active agents in coping with it. This shift from “passive impacts” to “active responses” helps uncover the bidirectional impacts of social media-induced FoMO on employees, thereby enriching our understanding of FoMO and expanding the application of the transactional theory of stress and coping. Additionally, we explore the boundary conditions of the FoMO mechanism and advance research related to the perceived competitive climate."

Datafication, the strategic use of data in organizations, offers insights into, and transforms, how work and individual outcomes are perceived and evaluated. This study examines how data-centric practices—embodied in metrics, rankings, and algorithms—can skew the playing field, creating scenarios where workers may feel (un)fairly (dis)advantaged or (mis)represented. The findings indicate that while data can provide valuable insights fostering cooperation and learning, it can also create competition and apprehension among journalists. Through the concept of “coopetition” we show how media professionals employ data opportunism to leverage information while also grappling with data skepticism amid potential misinterpretations and increased competition. Hence, the findings contribute to the research on datafication by demonstrating how workers utilize interpretative flexibility depending on what the data and metrics make visible."

Although research on emotion regulation is blooming, insights into joint emotion regulation profiles—that is, the overlap between partners’ specific strategies to regulate themselves and their partner—remain limited. To address this gap, we identified joint intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation profiles in 120 mixed-sex couples; clustering couples together based on both partners’ reported intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. Additionally, we examined associations between profile-membership and well-being indicators. The identified joint emotion regulation profiles differed in three ways: (1) degree of regulation (e.g., no use of any vs. high use of all strategies), (2) strategies predominantly used; and (3) degree of similarity—or lack thereof—between partners. Together, these findings provide the first insights into the role of joint emotion regulation profiles in the health of couples and their relationships, highlighting the unique roles played by both partners in regulating their own and their partner’s emotions. Further research is needed to assess if these results generalize to inclusive samples and daily life."

However, not much is known about the endorsement of scientific norms by non-scientists and how those endorsements differ between controversial und uncontroversial science fields. We conducted a cross-sectional national survey in Germany ( N = 1007) to capture the public endorsement of scientific norms and explored the role of the science field, political ideology, and science news consumption. Results suggest that the endorsement of scientific norms is significantly higher in controversial fields than in less controversial fields. More left-leaning political ideology is connected to higher levels of norm endorsement; science news consumption is partly associated with lower scientific norm endorsement. We discuss our findings regarding their implications for the public’s image and understanding of controversial science fields."

As such, this study examines the framing of communicative artificial intelligence in Singapore, looking at how the news media frame communicative artificial intelligence and characterize it as a social actor. Through a manual content analysis of 336 news articles from three major news websites in Singapore, this study found that the news media in Singapore tend to focus on the benefits and advances of communicative artificial intelligence and portray communicative artificial intelligence as a tool rather than social actor. However, when comparing news coverage of communicative artificial intelligence after the advent of ChatGPT, the news framed communicative artificial intelligence more in terms of risks, regulations, responsibilities, and conflict."

However, the extent to which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest and concern. In this work, we present a large-scale audit of adult advertising on Twitter (now X), specifically focusing on compliance with its adult (sexual) content advertising policy. Twitter is an interesting case study in that it—uniquely from other social media platforms—allows posting of adult content but prohibits adult content in advertising. We analyze approximately 35,000 ads on Twitter with respect to their compliance with the adult content ad policy through Perspective API and manual annotations. Among other things, we find that nearly 38% of ads violate Twitter’s adult content advertising policy—of which, the platform eventually removed only about 63% of these non-compliant adult ads. We also find inconsistencies in the moderation of such ads across languages, highlighting the need for more reliable and consistent moderation practices across different languages. Overall, our findings highlight blindspots in Twitter’s adult ad policy enforcement for certain languages and countries. Our work underscores the importance of external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online advertising."

    "abstract": "In many settings, scholars wish to estimate the similarity of political texts. However, the most commonly used methods in political science struggle to identify when two texts convey the same meaning as they rely too heavily on identifying words that appear in both documents. This limitation is especially salient when the underlying documents are short, an increasingly prevalent form of textual data in modern political research. Building on recent advances in computer science, I introduce to political science cross‐encoders for precise estimates of semantic similarity in short texts. Scholars can use either off‐the‐shelf versions or build a customized model. I illustrate this approach in three examples applied to social messages generated in a telephone game, news headlines about US Supreme Court decisions, and Facebook posts from members of Congress. I show that cross‐encoders, which utilize pair‐ level embeddings, offer superior performance across tasks relative to word‐based and sentence‐level embedding approaches."
