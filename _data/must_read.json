    "abstract": "The penetration of social media platforms in the cultural production and consumption circuits of sport mega-events means that organisations like the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are afforded new and alternative channels to engage with their audiences. TikTok, one of the largest platforms, is characterised by a higher degree of playfulness and humorous content and has been used to mobilise audiences for prosocial political aims. Using TikTok’s Research API access, this article relies on automatically collected metadata from all IPC posts between May 2023 and May 2024. After consolidating and manipulating the data through Python, statistical analyses were performed on SPSS to understand how certain content becomes more visible on the platform. In a second stage, videos with most virality underwent visual discourse analysis. We hold that the IPC, to challenge invisibilities, arguably one of the biggest obstacles for disability sport, engages in the circulation of humorous content with the aim of promoting inclusion and social change for persons with disabilities. While TikTok and the circulation of humorous content afford the IPC wider visibility to new audiences, it might provoke unintended consequences through further stigmatisation of disability sport as non-serious activity."

    "abstract": "Using the concepts of data reflectivity and user reflexivity, this paper explores the intricate interplay between human users and algorithms through the lens of domestication. Through the metaphor of yanghao on the Chinese digital platform Xiaohongshu (RED), this paper posits that three failure types relating to data reflectivity result in dissatisfaction with RED’s algorithmic outputs and a perceived loss of control over algorithmic identity. In response, users reflexively feed six specific types of data into the algorithm to shape its understanding of themselves. Ultimately, by strategically curating data and interacting with an algorithm, yanghao demonstrates a successful domestication process, highlighting how data reflectivity and user reflexivity empower users to gain agency within the human–algorithm power dynamic."

    "abstract": "This paper explores how non-experts reflect on and come to understand ‘data uses’, a phrase we used to refer to data collection, analysis and sharing. In recent years, research into what people think and feel about data uses has proliferated, whereas this paper focuses on how they do their thinking and feeling. We argue that imagining – that is, building or creating a mental image of something that is not present – is an important aspect of reflecting on data uses. We challenge the proposition that imagining takes place when there is a gap in knowledge or a lack of information, arguing instead that imagining plays an agentic role in reflection, enabling critical questioning of data uses. We draw on qualitative research carried out in the UK, in which we provided information about specific public sector data uses and asked participants how they felt about them. We found that imaginings, or ‘what ifs’, exist in a complex entanglement with different knowledges, including experiential knowledge."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a transnational case study on binge-watching and media habits. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. The first contribution is methodological, proposing ‘data-prompted interviewing’, a variant of trace interviewing. Participants’ own trace data is used to help them recall their own behavior in more detail, which in turn enables them to identify gaps or flaws in trace data records. This case study, which includes sixty interviews in platform logs from YouTube, Netflix and a large self-tracking service, provides evidence that ‘data-prompted interviewing’ yields robust results. Using data to prompt interviewees’ memories substantially improved their recall, and interviewees’ insights into platform data substantially improved its interpretation. The second contribution of this case study is theoretical, engaging with calls for reflexivity in media studies by empirically embracing Jenssen’s idea of dual ‘data movements’ and operationalizing reflexivity into concrete methods. Looking at the platform logs with the interviewee revealed patterns and habits in watching behavior which an interview alone would have entirely missed. But interviews also revealed quirks in the platform data which would have completely misled a researcher working with platform logs alone. The combination produces more insightful and robust research results for both ‘big data’ and ‘small data’ approaches. Recent data protection laws, which give millions of people the right to access their own trace data from platforms, make this approach practical for a wide range of questions in media studies. We propose that media studies scholars embrace reflexivity as not just theory but method, and through data-prompted interviews, fully embrace how the field affects research, and how research affects the field."

    "abstract": "Ongoing societal datafication and, most recently, the widely noticed launch of ChatGPT, continue to raise the “user question”: what role(s) does the user play in datafied, artificial, and automated environments? Recent technological advancements have begun to challenge fundamental assumptions in media and communication theory and, thus, urge scholars to (re-)visit and (re-)examine the interrelations, dynamics, and entanglements of (human) users with datafied environments. Two rapidly expanding but still largely distinct bodies of research are addressing these topics: critical data and platform studies, primarily focusing on structural approaches, and user-centered perspectives anchored in the tradition of audience research. Situated at the intersection of studying platform power and user agency, the aim of this special issue is to connect structural approaches with studies of lived user experiences through the lenses of reflectivity and reflexivity. We believe that linking platform and data perspectives dealing with questions of power, accountability, and governance on a societal level to users’ engagement with digital technologies and automated systems in an everyday context is a fruitful path when aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the societal implications of the widespread adoption and integration of digital platforms and intelligent technologies. The concepts of reflectivity and reflexivity provide a valuable conceptual starting point for a more integrated and holistic discussion of the complex user-data relations emerging in and from datafied environments. While the individual contributions in this special issue present their own take on the proposed concepts, the purpose of this introduction is to establish a broader theoretical foundation by outlining some overarching considerations on how these concepts can be understood and integrated."

This study uses the concepts of emotional affordances and affective practice in digital culture to investigate the online emotional experiences of Chinese left-behind women living in a rural location. From an analysis of Douyin (TikTok) video posts and interviews with 18 participants, the study develops a notion of ‘ambivalent positivity’ manifested by overt conviviality and the repressed negativity of distress and separation. Furthermore, rural women are obligated to maintain the norm of positivity that is deeply intertwined with their gender roles and social relations. These practices are evident in and through Douyin use, such as beauty filters, streamlined video editing, and background music. Responding to the ambivalence of positivity, we argue that social media empower rural women to achieve positive self-representation; however, they remain constrained within social-cultural conditions as left-behind rural women in a patriarchal society. Findings contribute to understanding how interactional offline-online contexts shape dynamic emotional experiences."

Departing from the mainstream approach according to which Heritage Communities relate to intangible goods or material collections of Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs), we rather focus on the creative and cultural participatory assets enhanced by the advent of digital media (such as fanfictions) and the online communities (resp., fandoms) that support them. Here, we study by means of computational techniques the case of the Archive of Our Own (AO3), an Internet forum created and managed by fanfiction writers willing to share their work with a global fandom community. We find that AO3 cultivates a prosocial relational atmosphere that favors the emergence of stable sub-communities committed to writing, reading and enriching fanfictions as a shared cultural resource (a commons). Such features align with those outlined as characteristic of Heritage Communities, while emerging around a yet undervalued form of ‘born-digital’ cultural assets."

The research specifically evaluates the impact of creativity and digital nativity on general innovative performance and personal innovativeness using IT (PIIT). Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted. Study 1 surveyed 497 individuals on Prolific using objective measures of general innovative performance and self-report measures of PIIT. Study 2 replicated the same research design on Amazon Mechanical Turk with 336 participants and other-rated measures of PIIT. Findings Results were consistent across both studies and showed that creativity influenced general innovative performance more than digital nativity. However, digital nativity was a stronger predictor of PIIT, above and beyond the nonsignificant effects of creativity. Research limitations/implications This study helps understand the roles that digital nativity and creativity play in general innovative performance and in IT-related innovative performance by providing a relative importance analysis of these components. Practical implications We offer guidance to organizations on how to select individuals and assign them to particular tasks depending on digital or general innovative task requirements. Originality/value This is the first study to examine the direct comparison of creativity and digital nativity. Although the literature highlights the importance of digital nativity for innovation, our research reveals that creativity is more important for general innovative performance."

We analyzed 76,217 publications from 73 communication journals, spanning from 1990 to 2023, with a focus on racial diversity in authorship as an indicator of collaboration diversity. Our results reveal that diversity is positively associated with the number of citations received, with this positive effect increasing over time. In addition, non-White lead authors collaborated more diversely, whereas White authors exhibited a faster increase in collaboration diversity over the years. Furthermore, the positive association between collaboration diversity and citations was more pronounced when the lead author was non-White than when White. Additional analyses show a concerning disparity: While non-White first authors are equally likely as their White counterparts to publish in top journals, they receive significantly fewer citations."

We use data from 2015 to 2023 in 46 countries to explore how trust in news has changed, while also exploring the links with sociodemographic variables, differences by media system, and changing patterns of news use. We find that (a) there has been a small overall decline in trust in news since 2015, but also that (b) there are different trends in different countries. More specifically, trust has declined more in media environments that have become less structured by television news use, and increasingly structured by social media news use. Our findings underscore how changing structures of media use may be central to explaining trust dynamics in recent years, which suggests new avenues for restoring trust where it has eroded."

Negative binomial regressions revealed that the explicit populist style, which articulates “the people” and “the harmful others” in the same message unit, predicts user engagement. The study shows that explicit populism triggers more favorites, retweets, and replies than any other populist style. Although implicit people-centrism has positive associations with retweets and replies, implicit antagonism has no effect on user engagement data."

    "abstract": "&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virtual reality (VR) can evoke powerful emotions and transport people to diverse environments, making it a compelling tool for storytelling and learning. However, those who are anxious about technology may need to spend more cognitive resources and could have negative experiences because of the complexity of the medium, altering how they experience the narrative. Training may help people better-navigate virtual experiences by providing guidance. This study evaluates how individuals’ training type (paper, video, and VR) and computer anxiety influenced outcomes. We measured performance and self-reported outcomes while participants (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; = 284) navigated scenes, interacted with objects, and watched a narrative 360° video. Results showed that compared to participants who received training in paper, participants who received training in video or VR mastered more VR functions. Compared to participants who received training in video, those who trained directly in VR had less of a negative VR experience. Furthermore, participants who trained in VR perceived the training as more useful and found the VR tasks to be easier compared to those who received training in paper or video. Additionally, those with high levels of computer anxiety, regardless of training, had more negative outcomes than those with low computer anxiety, including less mastery of VR functions and engagement with the 360° video content, more of a negative VR experience, perceived the training as being less useful, and completed tasks with more difficulty. We discuss implications for theories of information processing in VR, as well as implications for scaled engagement with narratives and learning in VR. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;360-degree videos visualized through virtual reality (VR) technologies are recognized as an effective tool for fostering positive attitudes towards environmental stewardship by immersing users in persuasive storytelling narratives. However, a lack of an overarching framework hinders the understanding of its role in promoting prosocial environmental behaviors, particularly its effects on information processing and behavioral intentions. Notably, recent studies have suggested that feeling transported into a VR environment (i.e., presence) could positively bias message evaluation and the way people process information by activating heuristics connected to immersive experiences (i.e., the bias hypothesis of the heuristic-systematic model). Drawing on this proposition, this study conducted a between-subject design experiment (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 60), comparing a 360-degree pro-environmental campaign video in VR with that in a two-dimensional format. Results from PLS-SEM indicated that a 360-degree video in VR induced a higher sense of presence, yet heuristic evaluation of message credibility decreased when a sense of presence was low. Moreover, message credibility was found to be positively associated with the valence of message-relevant thoughts, but moderate evaluation of message credibility buffered the generation of valence of message-relevant thoughts. Finally, the valence of message-relevant thoughts had a curvilinear relationship with the intention to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, albeit with a small effect size. Results suggest the complexity in influencing behavioral intentions via 360-degree videos in VR. Nonetheless, the findings support the proposition that immersive affordance in immersive storytelling content could prompt users to align with campaign messages through activating a positive heuristic bias.&lt;/p&gt;"

In response, in the present study, we analyzed survey data from 956 Flemish adolescents in Belgium (&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;= 15.10, &lt;em&gt;SD &lt;/em&gt;= 1.61, and 64.8% girls) and, using latent class analysis, identified two subgroups: Class 1 labeled as “low adoption of social media apps and disconnection tools,” and Class 2 labeled as “high adoption of social media apps and disconnection tools.” Adolescents in Class 2 were more likely to use social media, specifically social networking, instant messaging, and entertainment apps, and to adopt disconnection tools (e.g., iOS Screentime or the Forest app). Next, drawing on the media practice model, we investigated how sociodemographic and sociopsychological factors contribute to those usage patterns and found that girls, older adolescents, and adolescents with higher scores for depressive symptoms and flourishing were more likely to belong to Class 2. Those findings offer new insights into adolescents’ social media connection and disconnection that can inform interventions to promote healthier smartphone use among adolescents."

By harnessing the potential of VR, these avant-garde narratives aim to instill values of equity, justice, and fairness. This article critically examines the largely unsubstantiated assertion that VR is the ultimate tool for fostering empathy by means of a qualitative evaluation of the influence of prosocial VR audiovisual narratives. The study involved the production of the first episode of &lt;em&gt;The Stigma Machine&lt;/em&gt;, a VR short film series in both traditional 2D and immersive VR formats, in a two-pronged production approach designed to examine the effects of the film on a sample of 44 university students from Spain (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 22) and Canada (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 22). The participants were segregated into two groups: Group 1 (1st VR Condition) viewed the VR experience first, followed by the traditional version, while Group 2 (1st Video Condition) viewed the two formats in reverse order. Data was collected before, during, and after viewing, using standardized questionnaires (interpersonal reactivity index, basic empathy scale, and Igroup presence questionnaire) and electroencephalogram devices to monitor brain activity. The dependent variables included: empathy, assessed using the interpersonal reactivity index and basic empathy scale surveys; electroencephalogram brain activity measures, indicating engagement, excitement, focus, interest, relaxation, and stress; presence, evaluated using the Igroup presence questionnaire; and various outcome variables. The results reveal no significant differences in presence and no significant changes to the empathy scores. The findings point to a need to focus more on narrative design and audiovisual content creation strategies than on VR technology itself."

First, because Ethiopia is ruled by an authoritarian government, which restricts the information environment, and second, because the conflict in northern Ethiopia that erupted in November 2020 has made disinformation more rampant, and its implications deadly. But fact-checking in Ethiopia is the product not only of the work of Ethiopian organizations: local fact-checkers international allies and funders also play important roles. This article explores the practice of fact-checking by local organizations and the challenges they encounter in this work in an authoritarian, conflict-affected context. It also serves as a case study shedding light on the interplay between Ethiopian fact-checking organizations and their allies in the international development sector. Local and international organizations have distinct positions within the fact-checking ecosystem and funder (grantee relationships, and funders, at times, compound local organizations’ challenges). This research reflects information gathered through semi-structured interviews with local fact-checkers and their international allies, as well as a qualitative content analysis of publicly available materials and social media channels. Its findings imply that local fact-checking organizations, their funders, and allied international organizations interact in complex ways in challenging environments."

    "abstract": "The concept of digital disconnection, which refers to limiting digital media use for the sake of one’s well-being, has gained prominence in scholarly and public debates. Compared to a burgeoning digital disconnection industry that commodifies individuals’ struggles with constant connectivity, the development of evidence-based disconnection policies and regulations that support individuals to maintain digital well-being lags behind. The absence of digital disconnection policy may partly be due to a lack of studies investigating the contextual and institutional conditions in which policies and regulations are designed, implemented, and received. The few studies that do shed light on these conditions show that politicians’ and policymakers’ responses to digitalization involve discourses of individual responsibilization. Building on these insights, our study draws from in-depth interviews with 21 experts from organizations in Flanders (Belgium) who are responsible for digital well-being and digital disconnection across work, school, and family contexts. In particular, we have explored their perspectives on the challenges of constructing and implementing digital disconnection policies and regulations. Overall, the experts’ discourses reveal a conflict between striving for autonomy and the need for regulations concerning digital disconnection. This conflict leads to a digital disconnection policy paradox in which experts advocate for collective disconnection initiatives but ultimately resort to solutions on an individual level. We discuss the implications of our findings for the scholarly field of digital disconnection as well as for media policymakers."

    "abstract": "Right-wing think tanks are a major source of partisan knowledge. Their influence is rooted in their strategic hybridity, namely their ability to use the resources of fields outside politics to promote their partisan messages. This strategic hybridity is especially powerful in relation to the academy, as arguments can be framed with the trappings of scholarship without first passing muster in the scholarly community. This article documents how strategic hybridity has deepened online as the organization PragerU embraces a new tactic—the influencer-intellectual—and a new genre—social media ads—to advance its right-wing cause. To illustrate this new complexity, I analyze ads PragerU ran on Meta platforms that attacked the 1619 Project and had at least 20 million impressions. Beyond reconceptualizing hybridity, I review the shortcomings of Meta’s Ad Library while making the case for its value in tracking the spilling of partisanship from formal politics into culture."

    "abstract": "This article explores how the influencer and traditional entertainment industries are converging in the “child idol” phenomenon—a celebrity genre and system that had existed prior to the emergence of the influencer industry but has now been remixed with the influencer industry’s convention and refashioned as the stepping stone to lubricate children’s journeys toward professional idol careers in the wake of K-pop culture. We examine the “child idol” phenomenon as a case study wherein children perform as a younger version of K-pop idols under entertainment agencies’ in-house training systems, with calibrated construction of social media personae by influencer agencies and their parents. Despite ongoing attempts to protect children in the industry, undertaken by the Korean government and human rights organizations, the exploitative environment of child stars becomes even more serious as it becomes a template adopted by other countries emulating the success of K-pop."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of Fitspiration on women’s body shame and sexual assertiveness. By integrating the tripartite influence model’s focus on media influence with self-objectification theory, we explore the mechanisms connecting Fitspiration consumption to female sexual autonomy. Specifically, we examine the mediating roles of perceived realism, ideal body internalization, appearance comparison, and body shame, as well as the moderating effect of social media usage habits. Data from 818 Chinese women were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results indicate that exposure to Fitspiration content increases perceived realism, which in turn influences ideal body internalization and appearance comparison, leading to heightened body shame and reduced sexual assertiveness. In addition, social media usage habits further shape the relationship between media exposure and perceived realism."

    "abstract": "Based on social identity theory and the resilience literature, this study explored the ways social media impacted Asian Americans’ emotional well-being, racial identity negotiation, and coping strategies amid the surge in anti-Asian discourses during the Covid-19 pandemic. We interviewed 32 Asian Americans aged 18–59 ( M = 26.63, SD = 7.66; 28% = Ethnic Chinese) who had experienced anti-Asian sentiment on social media during the pandemic. Our study shows that social media played a contradictory role in how Asian Americans experience and cope with the surge in anti-Asian sentiment. Findings from our thematic analysis demonstrate that (1) the negative experiences of social media in conjunction with racial identity that influences Asian Americans’ psychological well-being, (2) the positive role of social media offering a space for collective solidarity, and (3) the positive role of social media activism as a means of collective coping and resilience."

    "abstract": "This study explores whether the emphasis of science news websites on dissemination over dialogue corresponds to the actual preferences of their science-oriented audiences. Based on interviews with science news website administrators ( n = 8) and readers ( n = 20) and two reader questionnaires ( n = 89; n = 55), we found that readers favor dissemination, yet certain readers may also desire interactive discussions. Readers perceive the ability to comment as beneficial for readers and administrators; however, they do not expect administrators to engage in dialogue. Younger audiences showed a somewhat greater preference for online dialogic communication than their older counterparts."
