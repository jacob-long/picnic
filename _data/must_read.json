    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of political correctness (PC) on perception and behavioral intentions, evaluating its effectiveness in being inoffensive, inclusive, and nonstigmatizing. Despite its widespread institutional adoption, its real-world effects remain understudied. We explored three questions: Does PC succeed in its aims? How does it influence perceptions? How does it affect behavioral intentions? We conducted six survey-based experiments with 2,179 participants balanced across political affiliation, age, sex, and education. Tasks assessed reactions to PC, its effects on mood and perceptions, and how it shaped judgments and behavioral intentions in varied contexts. Results indicate PC often fails its objectives. Participants, especially Conservatives and older individuals, found it exclusive, stigmatizing, and offensive. It reduced positive mood, undermined a doctor's credibility, and decreased care-seeking intent. PC also lessened concern for serious issues and shifted behavioral motivations. Despite its inclusive intent, PC can trigger negative responses, warranting scrutiny of its pervasive use."

    "abstract": "Gaslighting is a covert form of psychological manipulation that undermines an individual’s confidence in their perceptions, thoughts, and memories, often by labelling them as irrational or ‘crazy.’ Public awareness of gaslighting has surged in recent years, making it a common topic in media and popular culture. However, empirical research has lagged behind, leaving gaps in understanding how the public perceives and defines this form of abuse. Addressing public understanding of covert abuse is critical for improving early recognition by victims, bystanders, and front-line services, as well as encouraging support-seeking behaviours. This study examined public perceptions of gaslighting by presenting 595 university students with vignettes manipulating key contested components: repetition, intention, and victim outcomes. Participants assessed the vignettes on seriousness, acceptability, likelihood of intervention, and whether they classified the behaviour as gaslighting. They also provided definitions of gaslighting and completed a gaslighting acceptance scale. Findings indicate that while students generally recognise gaslighting as emotional abuse, ambiguities remain in its definition and identification. These results underscore the need for educational campaigns to clarify gaslighting’s patterns and severity. Targeted initiatives, particularly in schools and community settings, could foster cultural change, enhance bystander intervention, and reduce the prevalence of covert abusive behaviours."

Our findings suggest that partisan media use may undermine willingness to support politicians who engage in deliberative compromises with opponents. This effect is likely driven by the tendency of partisan media to diminish willingness to engage in political listening and instigate moral considerations of the party’s policy goals."

    "abstract": "Do parties respond to inequality? Despite the relevance of inequality and its consequences, existing studies fail to capture parties’ emphasis on economic equality and redistribution or to differentiate between existing levels of inequality and increases in inequality. Based on 850,000 party statements from 12 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries (1970–2020), we introduce a crowd-coded dataset that allows us to distinguish positive references to economic equality and redistribution from upward-trending equal-rights/anti-discrimination rhetoric. We show that responses found in previous studies do not capture economic equality and redistribution. In reassessing the impact of inequality, we argue that low visibility, status quo bias, and turnout effects discourage party responses to high inequality levels , while rising inequality poses a visible status quo change and a threat that left parties respond to. We find that left parties respond to inequality increases (except less tangible gains among the most affluent) but not to (high) inequality levels. This helps to understand why inequality is not self-correcting."

    "abstract": "Public allegations of international law violations are common in international politics. When do these accusations generate international backlash for governments? We argue that political costs hinge on a rhetorical battle to shape perceptions of the government’s behavior. Governments use strategic messaging to contest information, challenge the appropriateness of international law, or cite extenuating circumstances. International organizations (IOs) counter government rhetoric to reinforce the law. These competing messages shape support for punishment among citizens and political elites. We test our argument with survey experiments measuring perceptions of alleged military aggression and human rights violations. Among the US public and a global sample of diplomatic elites, foreign government denials and claims about mitigating circumstances reduce punitive attitudes. IO rebuttals counter denials but can only partially neutralize other claims. We offer a new framework for analyzing the politics of noncompliance and present novel evidence illuminating the strengths and limitations of IOs in enforcing international law."

    "abstract": "Recent experimental research suggests that when women stand as political candidates, they often enjoy more support amongst voters than men. However, women remain under-represented in politics worldwide, and observational research suggests sexism is prevalent and consequential for voter behaviour. Here, we attempt to bridge these contradictory findings and offer observational evidence of approximately 26,000 voters and 5,346 candidates in Australia, Canada, Britain, and the USA. American voters are slightly more likely to vote for a woman than a man, but we find no evidence of gender preference in the other countries. Interestingly, although sexism is prevalent in all four countries, we find no evidence for an effect of voter sexism on support for women candidates. We do find evidence that abstention, at least in the USA, is an important electoral choice for sexist partisans faced with a woman co-partisan candidate."

How do these actors respond when officeholders violate widely held norms, such as accepting the results of free and fair elections? We argue that businesses are sensitive to norm violations because they balance their economic interests with accountability demands from employees and other stakeholders. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that legislators who supported Donald Trump’s false claims about a ‘stolen election’ experienced a significant decline in contributions from Fortune 500 PACs in 2021 and 2022. Additionally, our analysis reveals that companies continue to contribute more to party leaders and members of key committees, consistent with our hypothesis. These findings suggest that corporations are willing to balance the interests of their two audiences by sending signals of disapproval towards those who violate established norms while continuing to lobby key lawmakers."

    "abstract": "Globally, prejudicial attitudes toward women persist. By taking anti-discriminatory stances, value-oriented organizations – e.g., political parties and religious denominations – can tap into group identities to shape their members’ attitudes. We know much less about the role of organizations that are not inherently value-oriented – such as sports teams – in accomplishing the same. Yet, as various campaigns by sports teams worldwide indicate, this is precisely what non-value-oriented organizations increasingly attempt to do. Can football team fandom be leveraged to promote gender-egalitarian attitudes? We address this question with data from a national survey in Brazil and a survey experiment conducted in partnership with a major Brazilian football club. We find that while football team identity is salient and may be leveraged to change displayed social attitudes, the Club’s anti-sexism campaign inadvertently increased men’s expressed prejudice toward women in football – although it may have also improved institutional trust among women."

When voting by mail, people can make their choices at their own pace at a time convenient to them, conducting additional research if they wish to do so. We propose that when people vote by mail, they are more likely to successfully identify the candidates that are best aligned with their preferences. Using cross-sectional and causal inference approaches, we show that people who voted by mail in 2020 were more likely to vote correctly than those who cast their ballots in-person. Vote-by-mail was more than just a way to minimize health risks during the coronavirus pandemic – it also had civic dividends. When people vote by mail, they are more likely to choose candidates aligned with their stated preferences."

    "abstract": "Can a second far-right party succeed in a country where the radical right was, until recently, absent? Spain’s 2024 European Parliament elections provided a striking answer with the emergence of SALF (“Let the Party Be Over”), a far-right anti-politics platform that captured 4.6% of the vote in its electoral debut, outperforming Podemos and the major regional parties. Through a comprehensive analysis of individual-level data from approximately 38,000 respondents across eleven surveys, we provide the first systematic assessment of SALF’s voters and compare them to other Spanish constituencies. First, our findings reveal an intriguing paradox: while SALF voters self-identify as more centrist than supporters of VOX (Spain’s main far-right party), their positions on substantive policies are similarly extreme. In contrast, SALF’s success stems from a distinctive combination of dissatisfaction with democracy and nontraditional media consumption patterns, especially among young male voters. Notably, while VOX’s earlier rise was primarily driven by Spain’s territorial tensions, SALF’s emergence signals a deeper phenomenon: profound disillusionment with Spain’s political system among specific segments of society."

    "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, it has been argued that the pandemic has negative aspects related not only to public health but also to democracy. While various crises have been shown to undermine citizens’ attitudes toward democracy, the pandemic, characterized by viral risk, likely showed distinct patterns in democratic attitudes compared to previous crises. In this study, I argue that the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative aspects for democracy were not evident in citizens’ satisfaction with democracy but were more significantly evident in their attitudes toward democratic norms and principles. Data collected in South Korea between 2020 and 2024 show that, while citizens’ perceptions of viral risk are not significantly associated with their satisfaction with democracy, positive evaluations of the government’s capacity in handling COVID-19 are tied to an increase in satisfaction. However, higher perceived viral risk levels and greater government capacity evaluations are associated with stronger support for stringent policy measures that violate democratic norms and principles. Finally, the reduction in perceived viral risk does not correlate with changes in attitudes toward stringent policy measures. Therefore, the pandemic’s negative implications for attitudes toward democratic norms and principles have the potential to linger long-term in post-pandemic politics."

What role does approval for candidates’ usage of AI play as a moderator in this relationship? This paper examines these questions using data from a survey experiment ( N = 1627), in which each respondent exposed to a news story that varied in their coverage of the growing deployment of AI-powered deepfakes during the 2024 India’s national election campaigns. The findings indicate that exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ use of deepfakes did not polarize attitudes towards coalitions, parties, and leaders. In contrast, approval for candidates’ use of AI was negatively associated with polarization towards coalitions, parties, and leaders, but this did not moderate the experimental effects: respondents who approved of candidates’ AI usage and saw a news article about out-party use of deepfakes were not more polarized toward either coalitions, parties or leaders. This study not only extends the understanding of AI’s role in campaigns by examining its complex effects on affective polarization, but it also broadens empirical research into the impact of deepfakes by focusing on the non-Western context of India, thereby offering new theoretical insights into how technological advancements intersect with political behaviors and attitudes."

This study explores the associations between perceived exposure to positively-biased romantic social media content and relationship satisfaction, as well as fear of being single (FOBS). A cross-sectional survey ( N = 605) was administered and a separate model was tested for young adults in a committed relationship for the outcome relationship satisfaction and for single young adults for the outcome FOBS, by using Structural Equation Modeling. Both models considered romantic partner expectations as a mediator and tested gender and social comparison orientation (SCO) as moderators. Perceived exposure to positively-biased portrayals was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction. There was no link with FOBS. For young adults in a committed relationship, higher partner expectations related positively to relationship satisfaction but were not predicted by exposure to positively-biased portrayals. For singles, exposure to such content did predict higher partner expectations but this did not, in turn, relate to FOBS. Also no significant moderation effects were found for gender and SCO. Our findings highlight the nuanced ways in which the positivity bias can relate to romantic outcomes and underscore the value of authenticity on social media."

However, annotating syntactic structure for a given natural language is arguably a harder task than annotating the onset and offset of speech units such as phonemes and syllables, as the latter can be identified by relying on the physically overt and temporally measurable properties of the signal, while syntactic units are generally covert and their chunking is model-driven. We describe and validate a pipeline that takes into account both physical and theoretical aspects of speech and language signals, and operates a theory-driven and explicit alignment between overt speech units and covert syntactic units."

Using survey data ( N = 1,812) collected in three eastern cities of war-torn Ukraine, we examined the relationship between threat perceptions and support for continuing the war or making concessions to pursue peace negotiations, and how social identities moderated that relationship. We found that symbolic and realistic threats predicted support for continuing the war over pursuing peace. Additionally, we identified latent profiles of meaningful social identities implicated in the war, including Ukrainian, European, and Russian cultural and linguistic identities, which also predicted support for war or peace. While the latent identity profiles did not interact with threat perceptions in explaining support for war or peace, separate measures of European identity and Russian cultural and linguistic identity identities did interact with some realistic and symbolic threats, indicating a stronger association between threat perceptions and support for war among respondents with lower European and higher Russian cultural and linguistic identities. The findings contribute to scholarly debates on support for war or peace, suggesting that threat perceptions may increase support for war during active violent conflict and that social identities shaped by the war may help explain variations in those effects."

Analyses of two large AI-related text corpora (Studies 1A and 1B) and four experiments ( N = 1,451) revealed that using “we” versus “I” pronouns positively predicted and heightened perceived AI threat among English (Studies 1–4) and Chinese (Studies 3 and 5) speakers. This effect, explained by a broader regulatory scope (Studies 3 and 5), was stronger for psychologically distant (vs. close) AI threat (Studies 4 and 5) and among English (vs. Chinese) speakers (Study 3). These findings expand the role of first-person pronouns and enhance our understanding of public perceptions of AI threat."

However, limited evidence and low-powered studies hinder strong conclusions about this hypothesis from the extant literature, a gap the present research aimed to address. Because anxiety entails heightened threat anticipation, a second aim was to examine if higher anxiety intensifies this differential habituation pattern (i.e., anxiety potentiation hypothesis ). Two experiments ( N 1 = 104, N 2 = 211) provided within-subject exposure to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images, manipulated stimulus valence, and assessed anxiety at baseline (Studies 1 and 2) or following an anxiety manipulation (Study 2). Results supported both hypotheses, highlighting the importance of examining positive habituation as a key mechanism in psychological functioning and suggesting that, despite its potential survival function, differential habituation may carry psychological costs."

Second, to analyze online behavior, a donation-based digital behavioral dataset is used, which is linked with a representative survey of the Hungarian Internet user population. There has been a notable decline in research activity regarding the first level of the digital divide, but these results indicate that the access level of the digital divide persists in Hungary, particularly among unskilled workers. In addition to the anticipated finding that individuals belonging to higher social classes are more likely to engage in digital activities and possess advanced digital skills, the analyses revealed that social class also influences social media use. Although a considerable proportion of the unskilled workforce lacks Internet access, those who are connected demonstrate the highest levels of digital engagement, posting the most often and spending the most time on Facebook. However, on average, the upper classes write longer posts and comments."

Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method that uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviours of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method ‘science fiction science’. We suggest that the reason that this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work that faces such serious validity threats. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the types of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that it may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, the benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement."

Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness."

    "abstract": "Among the most significant modes of human creative expression is style: the capacity to represent objects, events and scenes (for example, lilies dotting a pond) in some distinctive manner (for example, Monet’s broken brushstrokes and blended colours). Diverse research traditions analyse the social, political and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here we characterize style perception as a process that ‘parses’ form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgements of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception and opens the door to further investigation of styled media."

    "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and observers infer shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three preregistered experiments ( N = 1 , 254 ) and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework that captures and explains these inferences and their interactions quantitatively and parsimoniously. When people have different priors about norms or authorities, the model predicted and we experimentally confirmed that observing punishment by the authority can sustain polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms."

    "abstract": "People and cultures differ in the extent to which they view the world as a zero-sum environment (where one person’s gain is another’s loss) or a positive-sum environment (where certain actions can benefit everyone). These beliefs shape individuals’ willingness to work, invest, collaborate, or show hostility toward out-groups, and accept or reject various social policies. We model dyadic interactions in a heterogeneous population where individuals biased toward a zero-sum worldview are more likely to invest in competition, while those biased toward a positive-sum worldview are more likely to invest in cooperation. The environment alternates stochastically between cooperative and competitive states. Without social influence, the more accurate worldview yields higher utilities and spreads throughout the population. However, assortative matching by bias can favor the positive-sum worldview even if a positive-sum environment is somewhat less likely. With peer conformity, inaccurate worldviews can persist after a structural change in the environment, leading to cultural evolutionary mismatch. In the presence of cultural authorities who can alter beliefs, either both worldviews can coexist or one excludes the other. Moreover, when assortative matching and conformity interact, authorities may profit by amplifying individuals’ biases, creating enclaves of similarly biased people who can pay the authorities enough to make investment in persuasive technology economically viable. Cultural evolutionary mismatch is more likely in cultures marked by strong peer conformity and high responsiveness to authority when the authority promotes a suboptimal worldview. This study demonstrates how real-world conditions, peer influence, and authority interventions can perpetuate or shift zero-sum and positive-sum worldviews-at times leading to inaccurate beliefs."

    "abstract": "Whether and to what degree culture modifies cognition has been an area of research often limited by possibilities to gather relevant data across societies. In this project, we leverage webcam-based eye-tracking to study cultural variations of cognitive processes underlying in-group favoritism. Participants (n = 1850, k = 20) are assigned to an in-group based on a color perception task, complete a group reinforcement stage, and then make decisions to allocate points between themselves and random matched players in a repeated decomposed dictator game, facing either an in- or an out-group member. During this task, we recorded eye-gaze with participants’ webcams. Results show substantial variation in behavioral in-group favoritism across cultures, linking discrimination based on group membership to higher societal uncertainty. Individual preferences for prosociality conditioned differences in visual search effort, but the directionality of the effect differs between countries. Individual-level predictors explained participants remaining colorblind toward others’ group membership, where society-level predictors did not. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of taking culture into account when assessing cognitive processes underlying behavior. Implications for globally oriented policymaking to reduce discrimination are discussed."
