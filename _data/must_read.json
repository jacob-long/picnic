    "abstract": "Communication researchers have long sought to situate or contextualize media behaviors in their natural settings. However, the many approaches taken to understand media behavior in context have varied considerably. This article proposes a metatheoretical framework for theorizing media behavior at the situational level, encompassing the entirety of circumstances surrounding a media behavior at a given moment. The framework describes how psychological states, environmental context, and media context combine to shape moment-to-moment media behavior. We then describe how situational factors have the potential to interact with the three phases of media behavior—i.e., selection, processing, and disengagement—in distinctive ways. We argue that communication researchers only gain the ability to explain the variability in media behavior by taking the situational level into account. We conclude by providing future theoretical and empirical directions to guide the field in building a more generalizable and durable understanding of situated media behavior."

    "abstract": "Following the widely noticed launch of ChatGPT 3.5 in November 2022, an unprecedented number of users have started to experiment with generative AI for communication purposes. Prior studies have shown how users are commodified by platforms, and the unprecedented development of generative AI raises hence once again questions of platform dynamics vs user agency. In this study, we argue that platformized generative AI (GenAI) actively ‘talks back’ to their users, prompting them to act accordingly. Theoretically, we develop the concept of data reflectivity as a critical lens, showing that users exhibit reflective practices. These allow them to reflect upon their own role in relation to platformized GenAI and thus alter their patterns of action. The empirical case study, carried out in Spring 2023, draws on a survey with 60 early adopters and 14 subsequent semi-structured interviews, collected in an NGO operating in Southeast Asia. The thematic analysis shows that users relate to platformized GenAI in three distinct but related ways: (1) as a happy helper to organize and systematize knowledge and information; (2) as a creative tool to generate ideas; and (3) as a conversation partner for personal and life-related matters. In conclusion, we discuss the findings critically in relation to overall platform dynamics and the notion of systems ‘speaking back’ and further suggest that future research should aim to bring the two research fields of datafication and user studies even closer together."

    "abstract": "Popular social media platforms in China, such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu (REDnote), use machine learning algorithms to curate personalized feeds and enforce content moderation. But the opacity of such algorithms introduces socially consequential and often problematic mechanisms of classification. Given the playful resistance of queer individuals against a normative social environment, the interaction between algorithms and content creators warrants close examination. This study investigates how LGBTQ+ content creators navigate these algorithm-driven platforms, focusing on their negotiation of digital normativity to share non-heterosexual content and foster queer sociality in China. Avoiding the oversimplification of viewing algorithms and those implementing them as monolithic entities, I explore how content creators creatively manage to produce and distribute their work within the constraints of these platforms, and even by playing with these constraints. I collected data from an ethnography on algorithms, interviews, and an open-source investigation into recommendation algorithms, through a scavenge approach. I argue that LGBTQ+ content creators engage with algorithms in ways that are simultaneously non-conforming and non-confrontational. They imagine algorithmic effects, appropriate outcomes, and play with the opacity of machine learning to navigate three aspects of digital normativity in China: heteronormativity, Internet civilization, and commercialization. Empirically, I identified three strategies used to create and expand queer sociality within these constraints: camouflaging, filtering, and verticalizing. Theoretically, I introduce ‘workarounds’ as a framework that transcends the binary perspectives of conformity and resistance in discussions of authoritarian governance, algorithmic control, and user-platform interaction."

However, the effectiveness of AI augmentation remains controversial. This study investigates whether, how and why AI enhances human agents’ sales through a randomized field experiment. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a two-by-two factorial randomized field experiment ( N  = 1,090) to investigate the effects of AI augmentation on sales. The experiment compares sales outcomes handled solely by human agents with those augmented by AI, while also examining the moderating effect of agents’ experience levels and the underlying mechanisms behind agents’ responses. Findings The results reveal that AI augmentation leads to a significant 5.46% increase in sales. Notably, the impact of AI augmentation varies based on agents’ experience levels, with inexperienced agents benefiting nearly six times more than their experienced counterparts. Mediation analysis shows that AI augmentation improves response timeliness, accuracy and sentiment, thereby boosting sales. Originality/value This study highlights the role of AI augmentation in human–AI collaboration, demonstrates the varying impacts of AI augmentation based on agents’ experience levels and offers insights for organizations on how to regulate AI augmentation to enhance agent responses and drive sales."

Design/methodology/approach First, we identified 12 different aspects of online personalized advertisement and formulated candidate items through a literature review. A card sorting study and expert review were conducted to generate the initial scale items. We then conducted one survey ( n  = 308) to create a reliable measurement instrument and another ( n  = 296) to validate the instrument. Finally, we tested how the dimensions of the OPAD-Perception Framework can be used to differentiate between different levels of ad sensitivity, control/no control over the ad personalization process, and different levels of granularity of ad explanation. Findings The resulting OPAD-Perception Framework contains 49 Likert-formatted questions measuring ten distinct dimensions of online personalized advertising: reliability, usefulness, transparency, interactivity, targeting accuracy, accountability, creepiness, willingness to rely on, self-actualization, and persuasion. Originality/value The OPAD-Perception Framework can serve as a powerful tool to measure users’ attitudes toward online personalized advertising. This will enable advertisers and social media platforms to better support users’ privacy expectations and provide user-friendly interfaces for controlling the ad personalization process."

In Study 1, a total of 12,216 pieces of viewers’ comments and ten web news reports were coded and analyzed employing a grounded theory approach. In Study 2, data were collected from 587 Douyin e-commerce users. Exploratory factor analysis and partial least squares structural equation modeling were used to test the value co-creation framework of LStTS. Findings In Study 1, six value attributes in three categories were identified based on a content analysis of viewers’ comments. In Study 2, a three-order factorial model of value co-creation in LStTS was identified and tested. Research limitations/implications Our study is limited by the preponderance of female respondents in the sample and the unique nature of the research context. Practical implications Merchants and streamers should consider whether there is a fit between the merchandise and the tourism scene when selecting the tourism scene for live streaming marketing; they can select novel and beautiful natural tourism scenes to attract viewers. Detailed and comprehensive product information should be provided in the process of live streaming marketing and sharing with consumers. Originality/value The novelty of our study lies in the provision of a new value co-creation framework in LStTS, which offers a theoretical basis for analyzing the value of the tourism scene in live streaming marketing."

    "abstract": "Purpose Existing research has shown the role of social media in facilitating general protest participation. However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding the dynamics related to explicitly unlawful behaviors during protests, which have become increasingly prominent in recent times. Drawing upon the communication mediation model (O-S-O-R model), this study proposes a moderated mediation model to delineate specific mechanisms under which social media use influences individuals' support for unlawful behaviors in protests. Design/methodology/approach A survey of 1,121 Hong Kong residents was conducted in the context of the 2019 Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement to test the theoretical model. Findings Obtaining political information on social media has a dual effect on support for unlawful behaviors in protests. On one hand, social media use increases individuals' political knowledge, which is reinforced by frequent political discussions on social media. This enhanced political knowledge tends to reduce the likelihood of supporting unlawful behaviors in protests. On the other hand, acquiring political information on social media can also generate increased anger toward politics, potentially leading to a more supportive attitude toward unlawful behaviors in protests. Originality/value This study contributes to the expanding field of research on digital activism by revealing the intricate mechanisms by which social media usage shapes support for unlawful behaviors in protests. It also expands our understanding of explicit unlawful behaviors within protests as a distinct form of political behavior."

This article theorizes about expertise tension that arises when individuals with valuable insights lack corresponding authority to act, or vice versa. Using observations and interviews, we studied how physicians and nurses navigated this tension in problem-solving situations in a hospital emergency department. We found that nurses, who identified emergent problems, simultaneously asserted their situational authority and displayed a veneer of deference by asking physicians, “What do you want to do [in this situation]?” The question prompted one of three problem-solving activities (i.e., instruction by demand, reversed instruction, and collaborative improvisation) depending on the situation’s urgency and ambiguity. We discuss how nurses and physicians managed expertise tension without undermining their different claims to expertise and authority, highlighting the value of a communication-centered view in examining such dynamics."

Collecting all created and engaged posts ( n = 31,084) from 102 lesbian gamers in both lesbian gamer and female gamer groups, this research utilizes structural topic modeling to delineate their productive and consumptive curation across different groups. The results indicate that lesbian gamers often prioritize discussions on women and queer issues within the female gamer community while presenting a more gamer-centric identity in the lesbian gamer community. Group-swinging emerges as an optimal strategy for exploring a balance between belongingness and distinctiveness, enabling lesbian gamers to navigate their multiple minority identities effectively. This study enriches the understanding of identity curation and optimal distinctiveness theory, offering plausible strategies for the online resilience of marginalized groups within the polymedia context."

Via a socio-representational approach and from a critical gender perspective, this article aims to explore how people use digital media to communicate about the GE, and to analyse the experiences related to the GE and the representation systems underlying them. Using an inductive strategy, a corpus of discussion from the Doctissimo forum, and testimonies and comments from the PayeTonGynéco Facebook pages and Tumblr was created and submitted to lexicographical analysis. Our results suggest that the GE is indicative of a broader social function.

Two studies in the U.S. across both non-election and election settings test the centrality of political discussion on social media with strong and weak ties in explaining this relationship. Findings across both studies show no significant direct associations between incidental news exposure and political knowledge. However, mediation analyses suggest that incidental news exposure can influence political knowledge when mediated by interpersonal political conversations on social media: discussions with strong ties contribute to political knowledge, but discussions with weak ties are detrimental. Furthermore, the indirect effects via strong and weak ties are significantly conditioned by one’s cognitive ability. The findings highlight the conditions under which incidental news exposure helps yet also hinders individuals’ political knowledge."

An online survey was conducted among 1337 Belgian respondents, of which 78.4% were female ( M age = 21.64 years, SD = 3.57 years). Structural equation modeling showed that positive attitude and injunctive norms, higher descriptive norms, and greater perceived behavioral control regarding active bystander behaviors in the context of NCFS were related to youth’s intention to engage in such active bystander behaviors, which in turn was related to actual active bystander behavior. Differences were found based on youth’s empathy levels, though no sex differences were found. The findings provide a critical foundation for highly needed intervention approaches and educational curricula seeking to diminish the occurrence of NCFS in youth."

I offer the concept of “echoic affiliation” to describe how PoV memes leverage TikTok’s “use this sound” function to construct ephemeral bonds between users. Furthermore, PoV memes textually articulate multiple perspectives, producing intersubjective encounters that reflect a platform imaginary in which “the algorithm” efficiently clusters similar people on the same “side” of the app. In the conclusions, I present a novel definition of PoV memes and reflect on the pivotal role of affiliation for TikTok’s platform vernacular."

    "abstract": "This article reports on and analyses data from a situated and in-depth project on the experiences of six cisgender South Asian-Australian women/people who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, negatively racialized women experienced barriers to health care and a lack of social support, which were further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. International border closures in Australia combined with local mitigation strategies inhibited social and cultural support from families, impacting many migrant mothers/birthing people who gave birth for the first time in Australia. Many hospitals in the states of New South Wales and Victoria instituted restrictions to birthing services as a way of reducing exposure to the coronavirus during the pandemic. Our research suggests that pre-existing limitations of health care providers, digital platforms, and apps with regard to culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) women in Australia have been amplified during the pandemic. Online Facebook groups from the mothers’ countries of origin or cultural backgrounds, or for mothers who had babies due in the same month, represented a significant source of information and support for the participants. This was particularly important at a time when women’s capacities to engage in traditional cultural practices, which provide practical, emotional, and informational support, were compromised by the inability to garner familial support. We situate these findings in the literature on “performing good motherhood” in neoliberal times and via reliance on digital devices and platforms and what it means for CALD women’s sociality, sense of agency, and negotiations with cultural practices."

    "abstract": "While online hate speech has become a serious problem in multimedia environments, most studies in this area have examined text-based hateful content, with less attention paid to its other visual aspects. From a multimodal perspective, we conducted an online experiment ( N = 799) to investigate how multimodal hate speech (i.e., text and images presented together to convey hateful meanings) on social media affected users’ prejudicial attitudes and prosocial behavioral intentions. The results showed that participants in the text-plus-image (vs. text-only) condition felt more sympathy, which led to less implicit prejudice toward the target group and more prosocial behavioral intentions. In addition, exposure to text-plus-image hate speech had an indirect effect on prosocial behavioral intentions through sympathy and implicit prejudice. The findings contribute to scholarship on online hate speech and provide insights into the affect heuristics that individuals rely on when processing multimodal information."

    "abstract": "This article explores the cultural complexities of participatory censorship among young Chinese netizens, particularly within and beyond fan communities, through a digital ethnographic lens. By examining the interplay between social media practices and state governance, the study introduces the concepts of algorithmic folklore and interpretive labor to elucidate how fans engage in censorship as both a routine task and a form of ideological negotiation. Through immersive participant observations and in-depth interviews with 25 informants involved in fan conflicts, the findings highlight that while fans perceive their participation in reporting as a form of empowerment, this engagement paradoxically reinforces state control and self-censorship. The study argues that the dynamics of fan conflicts are intricately linked to broader political contexts, where fans become both agents and subjects of censorship. Ultimately, this research underscores the cultural complexities of participatory censorship, revealing the ways it can obscure deeper systemic inequalities and exploitation within the framework of cultural governance in China."

    "abstract": "Webtoons optimize interactivity and participation of media users in the world of digital media by consolidating a unique digital culture. This article examines the role of users in interactive media by exploring the case of webtoons in the context of a changing global political economy and cultural dominance. Korean platform monopolies have established a new business model for webtoons and developed it as a center of Korean creative power. While webtoons have increasingly expanded and attracted the global market and the global audience, some persistent social issues remain, including the precarious labor structure, monopolistic power in the industry, and ideological dominance in content. Although webtoon viewers are often recognized as cultural intermediaries and powerful agents for their contributions to interactive creativity, their role has fluctuated according to changing political-economic structures and industrial strategies. In the course of expanding to the global market and to new business areas such as intellectual property (IP), webtoons have evolved in new fashions while disclosing the ambivalent nature of participatory media and digital interactivity. This article elucidates the double faces of interactive creativity focusing on viewers’ participation in webtoon production in the context of changing webtoon industry and growing partnership with global media."

    "abstract": "Social media offer opportunities for companies to promote their image, but companies online also risk being denounced if their actions do not align with their words. The rise of social media bots amplifies this risk, as it becomes possible to automate such efforts to highlight corporate hypocrisy. Our experimental survey demonstrated that bots and human actors who confront a corporation touting their commitment to equality by calling out organizational pay gaps damage perceptions of the corporation, heighten anger toward them, and ultimately can elicit boycott intentions. These hypocrisy challenges are equally effective when they come from bots and user accounts. Challenges to hypocritical behavior on social media are consequential and require further exploration."
