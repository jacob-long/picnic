    "abstract": "In an online experiment, 498 U.S. Black parents (child aged 3–5, 9–11, 15–17) were randomized to imagine their child had “an okay day” or experienced peer racism. They watched four age-appropriate video trailers that varied in affective tone (positive vs. mixed) and theme (race-related vs. not), rated their likelihood of encouraging their child to watch each and selected one. Regardless of condition and child age, encouragement was higher for race-related versus “nonracial” videos. Parents in the racism (vs. okay day) condition had greater odds of selecting race-related content, including racism depictions. As such, results were more consistent with the Selective Exposure Self- and Affect-Management model than Mood Management predictions. Perceptions of child identity strength and parent identity strength predicted encouragement; parent identity strength predicted selection; child age group mostly did not predict outcomes. Effects of condition on selection of racial vs. entertainment content were mediated by three types of goals. Public significance This study suggests U.S. Black parents can see value in showing their child age-appropriate content featuring racial pride messages and youth racism experiences. Following a child racism experience, Black parents had greater inclinations to select both types of race-related content over race-unrelated content, with little differences by child age."

    "abstract": "Women often experience competence questioning communication (CQC), in which their contributions are overlooked or credit is misdirected to a male colleague. We examine whether gender metastereotypes—the stereotypes that women believe men hold of women, and the stereotypes men believe women hold of men—predict responses to sexism in the workplace. Specifically, through vignette-based experiments, we examine whether women’s and men’s willingness to directly confront male perpetrators of CQC, and men’s willingness to amplify the voice of female colleagues is affected by the activation of gender metastereotypes. For both women and men, positive metastereotypes directly predicted willingness to confront sexism, but, as theorized, only when individuals believed that the stereotypes held of their ingroup were held of them personally. We also found significant indirect effects of metastereotype activation on willingness to address sexism via felt responsibility for addressing sexism (for women) and concern for the group image (for men)."

    "abstract": "Contemporary discourse on the affordances of organizational information and communication technologies (ICTs) has largely been captivated by the allure of visibility. This article challenges that glare by elucidating the overlooked yet pivotal roles of a set of other organizational ICT affordances. Through a dominance analysis, our findings illuminate that awareness—the capacity of ICTs to link information and actors in an ongoing digital tapestry—and pervasiveness—the widespread nature, across time and space, of digital content and interactions—hold greater explanatory power compared to visibility in understanding some types of interactions fostered by ICTs (communication frequency, information-sharing quality at work [within and across departments], and identity processes [departmental and organizational]). By spotlighting the explanatory strength of affordances such as awareness and pervasiveness and somewhat dimming the role of visibility, this study urges scholars and practitioners alike to broaden their focus on the affordances of media in the digital workplace."

    "abstract": "Abstract: This study aimed to gain an understanding of what makes learning effective in educational virtual reality (VR) experiences. By integrating insights from cognitive load theory and the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing, we investigated the role of different dimensions of cognitive load as potential predictors (i.e., intrinsic and extraneous load) and outcomes (i.e., germane load) of interactivity and consequently learning. A one-group pretest-posttest laboratory experiment was conducted among young adults ( N = 102). The results show that intrinsic load hinders learner-content interactions, whereas extraneous load hinders overall interactivity. However, interactivity did not affect germane load, nor was germane load found to predict learning scores. Taken together, these findings call for refinements in cognitive load theory to account for the interplay between the different types of cognitive load in VR learning environments. Furthermore, the results suggest that instructional designers should be cautious in assuming that more interactions will necessarily lead to better learning outcomes. Instead, the focus should be on facilitating high-quality learner-content interactions that are directly aligned with learning objectives."

    "abstract": "Abstract: While there has been several decades of augmented reality (AR) research in terms of psychological effects and outcomes, the level of theoretical development in the AR space has been fairly limited. The manuscript identifies several factors that contribute to this, starting from the historical definitions of AR, to how it has become an umbrella term for a wide range of technologies, and how ongoing development in AR continues to stretch that definition. By understanding some of the factors that make theoretical development difficult, this article identifies some areas of media psychology theory that would be relevant to all implementations of AR as well as some contextual theories that would only be brought in with specific implementations of AR. The manuscript then advances a framework for thinking about these differences in AR implementations and theory building, whether that is to isolate specific variables and build theory in that way, combine these variables and attempt to combine/bridge theory, or identify unique features of AR that might necessitate transforming existing media theories. This article aims to help researchers understand the current state of theorization and identify certain pathways for improving theoretical development with future studies into AR media technologies."

Results demonstrate that tangram performance and partner trust increase as a function of neural similarities among interacting participants. These results signal a promise for low-cost hyperscanning in naturalistic AR communication. By validating various hyperscanning preprocessing routines and offering a high-control yet naturalistic AR task, this project sets the groundwork for theoretical and methodological advancements in understanding metaverse-mediated human interaction."

    "abstract": "When people experience conflicts between their ideal standards and their partner’s actual state, they often resolve conflict through communication. Numerous observational studies suggest that direct regulation attempts (e.g., requesting one’s partner to change) are positively associated with the behavior change of the target partner. However, previous research using between-person and correlational designs has provided limited evidence. Moreover, the psychological components of partner regulation that affect targets’ intentions and behavior remain unclear. Therefore, we employed a within-person experimental paradigm to rigorously test targets’ psychological processes underlying interpersonal conflict resolution through communication. This focused on the discrepancy between targets’ actual states and requesters’ ideals. In the paradigm, we systematically manipulated targets’ perceived discrepancy. In our experiment (N = 78 couples), targets were asked to rate the actual frequency of 40–80 important actions, and requesters were asked to rate the ideal frequency of the targets’ actions. These actions were then randomly assigned to either the discrepancy feedback or no-feedback condition. Results showed that, in the feedback condition, discrepancies were positively associated with targets’ intentions to improve their behavior (but not with behavioral changes). These findings suggest that although people can facilitate their partners’ intention to change important actions by simply communicating their ideals, they must make additional efforts (e.g., suggesting a solution and promoting prospective memory) to get their partners to execute the intention. This study provides critical insight into the psychological process underlying conflict resolution in close relationships using a within-person experiment."

    "abstract": "During challenging periods like the transition to parenthood, support from one’s partner becomes of vital importance for maintaining a healthy relationship. Responsiveness describes that relationship partners attend to and react in a supportive manner to one’s disclosed concerns and feelings in times of need. Perceived partner responsiveness occurs when one partner acts in a way that the other partner perceives as responsive to his or her needs, conveying understanding, validation, and care. However, such perceptions are highly subjective and shaped by attachment orientations of the perceiver, especially during challenging times. Besides, when partner behavior is perceived as responsive, this can also be beneficial for the relationship and promote a sense of security. The current study examined whether attachment insecurities predicted changes of perceived partner responsiveness across the transition to parenthood, and whether perceived partner responsiveness predicted changes in attachment orientations across time. We investigated changes in perceived responsiveness in 120 mixed-gender couples across the transition to parenthood over four different time points (during pregnancy, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months after the birth of their first child). The results suggest that although perceived responsiveness increased during the transition to parenthood, the increase was significantly less strong in individuals who scored higher in attachment insecurities. Additionally, examination of changes in attachment orientations shows significantly less increases of attachment insecurities when individuals perceived their partner’s responsiveness across the transition to parenthood."

Rooted in a constructionist framing analysis framework, it identifies frames as packages of framing elements, including actors (individuals and organizations) and topics, extending beyond topic-focused methods in prior unsupervised analyses. Compared with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)- and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based approaches on 1,300 U.S. gun violence news articles, this method addresses LDA’s limitations by focusing on high-level framing elements rather than keywords and is less labor-intensive than BERT-based supervised learning. Supporting both inductive and deductive analyses, it achieves comparable results to LDA while uncovering a previously unidentified gun violence frame."

To detect such fake news, we follow deceptive writing theory and link French hedges and modals to validity. As hedges indicate uncertainty, fake news writers can use it to include falsehoods while shifting responsibility to the audience. Whereas &lt;em&gt;devoir&lt;/em&gt; (must) emphasizes certainty and truth, &lt;em&gt;falloir &lt;/em&gt;(should, need) implies truth but emphasizes external factors, allowing writers to shirk responsibility. &lt;em&gt;Pouvoir&lt;/em&gt; (can) indicates possibility, making it less tied to truth or falsehood. We tested this model with 50,000 French tweets about Covid-19 during March–August 2020 via mixed response analysis. Tweets with hedges or the modal &lt;em&gt;falloir&lt;/em&gt; were more likely than others to be false, those with &lt;em&gt;devoir&lt;/em&gt; were more likely to be true, and those with &lt;em&gt;pouvoir &lt;/em&gt;showed no clear link to truth. Tweets of users with verification, more followers, or fewer status updates were more likely to be true. These results extend deceptive writing theory and inform fake news detection algorithms and media literacy instruction."

However, this unprecedented growth has led to the widespread dissemination of misinformation—deliberately or inadvertently false content that can trigger dangerous societal ramifications. Visual analytics combines advanced data analytics and interactive visualizations to explore data and mine insights. This article introduces the Social Media Analytics and Reporting Tool (SMART) 2.0, detailing its application in tracking misinformation on social media. An updated version of its predecessor, SMART 2.0 enables analysts to conduct real-time surveillance of social media content along with complementary data streams, including weather patterns, traffic conditions, and emergency service reports. SMART 2.0 offers enhanced capabilities like map-based, interactive, and AI-powered features that enable researchers to visualize and understand situational changes by assessing public social posts and comments. As a misinformation classification and tracking case study, we collected public, geo-tagged tweets from multiple cities in the UK during the 2024 riots. We showcased the effectiveness of SMART 2.0’s misinformation detection and tracking capabilities. Our findings show that SMART 2.0 effectively tracks and classifies misinformation using a human-in-the-loop approach."

It posits perceptions of legal and social risks, political frustration, political orientation, and secondary control as possible predictors of avoidance of political discussions. A survey of citizens in post-National Security Law Hong Kong shows that pro-democracy citizens in Hong Kong are more likely to perceive the presence of social and legal risks. They are also more likely to feel frustrated by the political environment. Perceived social risks significantly predict avoidance of political discussions, and the relationship is stronger among people with higher levels of secondary control.

    "abstract": "Media bias has long been a subject of scholarly interest due to its potential to shape public perceptions and behaviors. This systematic review leverages advances in natural language processing (NLP) to explore automated methods to detect media bias, addressing five core questions: it examines the definitions and operationalization of media bias, explores the NLP tasks addressed for its detection, the technologies used, and their respective outcomes and applied findings. This review also examines the practical applications of these methodologies and assesses the patterns, implications, and limitations associated with using artificial intelligence for media bias detection. Analyzing peer-reviewed articles from 2019 to 2023, the review initially identified 519 articles, which ultimately included 28 relevant ones. Significant heterogeneity is observed in bias definitions, affecting the analysis and detection approaches. The review highlights the predominant use of some methods and identifies challenges such as inconsistencies in problem definition, outcome measurement, and comparative method evaluation. Regardless of the conceptualizations of bias and the methods used, studies consistently identify bias in media outlets. Thus, studying media bias remains necessary for raising awareness and detection, and NLP methods are significant allies in this endeavor. This research aims to consolidate the foundations of recent advances in NLP for bias detection, encouraging researchers to focus on developing transparent, task-specific tools and work toward a consensus on a technical definition of bias and standardized metrics for its evaluation."

    "abstract": "To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥ .950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. No prior knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations or ROC analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-ROC approach."

    "abstract": "Here we report the results of two nationwide randomized controlled trials. By refining behavioural-science-informed text messages notifying patients of their vaccine eligibility, we observed improvements in vaccination rates. The randomized controlled trials involved adults aged 40–44 years (n = 1,825,937) and 24–29 years (n = 2,174,064) in England. Messages emphasizing ‘Top of queue’ status led to small, but policy-relevant, increases in vaccination rates in both the 40–44 age group (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.03) and the 24–29 age group (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.04). Consequently, the ‘Top of queue’ message was nationally rolled out to other age groups. These findings demonstrate the potential of ‘queue’ framing in relevant contexts and the value of rigorous testing of public health messaging."
