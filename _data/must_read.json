    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of the drivers of participation in online business forums (OBFs). Specifically, it examines how reciprocity and three distinct types of needs (functional, psychological and hedonic) shape the participation behaviour of members in OBFs. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a multilevel analysis, integrating Social Exchange Theory and Uses and Gratification Theory to develop and validate a research framework. Data were collected via online questionnaires ( N  = 596) from 48 business forums on LinkedIn. The data analysis was carried out using PLS-SEM in stages. A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to assess the measurement model, including validating the reliability and validity of the measurement items. The direct hypotheses were tested, followed by a post ad-hoc analysis to test the mediation and moderation hypotheses. Findings This study shows the impact of three need factors – functional, psychological and hedonic – and reciprocity on community members' participation behaviour in OBFs. The findings indicate that fulfiling functional, psychological and hedonic needs are key determinants driving active participation. The study further highlights the coexistence of two types of reciprocity: direct and indirect. However, the data analysis results show that only indirect reciprocity motivates participation in OBFs. Furthermore, the study reveals that indirect reciprocity not only precedes participation but also acts as a pivotal factor interacting with the interrelationship between the need factors and participation levels in OBFs. Originality/value This research advances theoretical understanding of participation in OBFs by offering novel insights into its complex, multi-faceted nature. Unlike some previous simplistic models, this study employs innovative multilevel analysis, uniquely demonstrating the synergistic impact of need factors and reciprocity on participation. It offers a nuanced perspective previously unexplored by addressing reciprocity’s paradoxical role and uncovering interconnections between various factors. This approach provides groundbreaking insights into OBF dynamics, advancing theoretical understanding while offering actionable strategies for enhancing member engagement and community development."

This paper aims to understand the factors determining digital influencers’ success concerning brand-related (i.e. intention to follow influencer advice) and influencer-related (i.e. intention to recommend the influencer) outcomes. We present a conceptual model derived from established theories and psychological reasoning, identifying influencer authenticity and perceived value as important antecedents. We present satisfaction with the influencer and influencer credibility as the psychological mechanism explaining why antecedents transform into favorable outcomes. Design/methodology/approach With structural equation modeling and two studies (N1 = 814; N2 = 685) relying on active followers from two countries (the UK and India), this paper examines the direct and indirect effects of the value and authenticity of digital influencers on followers’ behavioral outcomes and the cultural context’s potential moderating effect. Findings Authenticity and value of digital influencers positively affect intention to follow influencer advice and recommend the influencer. Such effects are mediated by follower satisfaction and influencer credibility. The effects of influencer authenticity and value on intentions to follow and recommend are not stronger in India than in the UK. Originality/value We contribute to the literature by presenting a theoretically informed framework capturing the antecedents of successful influencers and the importance of differentiating brand-related and influencer-related outcomes. Furthermore, our studies highlight that research findings about influencers’ impact may not be generalizable to other cultural contexts."

Design/methodology/approach We conducted a cross-sectional survey organized with social media users during the post-pandemic period. Based on the 342 valid responses, structural equation modeling was employed to validate the research model. Findings The results substantiate our multidimensional view of infodemic stress, which encompasses dimensions including information overload, uncertainty, diffusivity and insecurity. We found that the infodemic stress contributes to pandemic fatigue, then engenders both negative information behavior and reduced engagement in preventive behavior. Furthermore, infodemic stress has also been found to have a direct positive effect on individuals’ engagement in preventive behavior. Originality/value This study introduces the concept of “infodemic stress” and presents a comprehensive framework to capture its various dimensions. This study offers novel insights into the psychological and behavioral repercussions of the infodemic stress transmitted through social media."

This article provides a formal explication of this concept and develops a new scale based on three studies (Combined N = 1129). Measurement items were derived from the explication and an open-ended survey (Study 1, N = 270). These were then administered in a closed-ended survey (Study 2, N = 448) to identify their dimensionality through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Lastly, we conducted another survey (Study 3, N = 411) to verify the factor structure obtained in Study 2 by employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Analyses resulted in a validated scale of seven items that reflect the level of MH in individuals and identified six sets of descriptive labels for machines (expert, efficient, rigid, superfluous, fair, and complex) that serve as formative indicators of MH. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

We employed a diffusion of innovations framework to explore perceptions of compatibility, complexity, observability, relative advantage, and reinvention to determine their influence on participants' utilization of image recognition algorithms. Despite being more likely to encounter algorithm bias, individuals with darker skin tones perceived image recognition algorithms as having greater levels of compatibility and relative advantage, being more observable, and less complex and thus used them more extensively compared to those with lighter skin tones. Individuals with darker skin tones also displayed higher levels of reinvention behaviors, suggesting a potential adaptive response to counteract algorithm biases."

    "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of “topic territoriality,” a mechanism that governs participation in conversational spaces. When a discussion becomes prone to territorialization, individuals are more likely to claim topics (participating in discussions about topics they own as “stakeholders”) and defer (reducing participation in topics owned by others). They are also more likely to patrol topic boundaries (monitoring who is participating and confronting topic “intruders”). We document the operation of topic territoriality by analyzing 112,278 conversational turns on Weibo before and after a policy that reveals users’ broad geographic locations. We find that revealing these locations increased territorial behaviors, leading to more homogenous participation in conversations. Although the display of locations has improved the overall civility in language, the confrontations between stakeholders and intruders became more toxic. Our research emphasizes the impact of topic territoriality in online conversations and sheds light on the unintended consequences of social media policies."

Partisan composition does not help or hinder local newspaper preservation."

Drawing upon the “algorithmic imaginary” framework from critical algorithm studies and the anthropological concept of “ordinary ethics,” we analyzed Twitter discourse during ChatGPT’s initial deployment, examining 368,359 tweets. Our analysis identified five topics reflecting functional and critical aspects of ChatGPT. We specifically point to two topics with a critical perspective: “Ethics” and “Concerns.” The first aligns with scholarly discussions in AI ethics on fairness and transparency, while the second focuses on ChatGPT’s generative capabilities. This highlights an emerging trend: While the academic discussion on AI ethics has gained popularity, especially in scrutinizing ChatGPT, the conversation is now expanding to more nuanced ethical deliberations. We analyzed the posts’ engagement and sentiment over time, demonstrating the AI ethics community’s influence in addressing the potential and harms of generative AI systems."

This study explores “brand activism,” a phenomenon whereby brands engage in social advocacy through digital platforms, reflecting a strategic integration of social issues into their core identity and marketing practices. This proactive stance not only raises awareness and mobilizes support but also raises ethical concerns about the potential for brands to exploit social causes for commercial gain. Employing qualitative content analysis with a critical phenomenological approach, this research investigates how individuals engage empathy-based representations within brand activism on digital platforms. Data from interviews with 37 young adults reveal that while brand activism can foster a sense of empowerment and moral alignment, it also risks superficial engagement and selective empathy. This study highlights the ethical considerations in brand activism and how digital media shapes moral reasoning in contemporary branding."

    "abstract": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful new tool for text analysis. As these models are capable of zero-shot annotation based on instructions written in natural language, they obviate the need of large sets of training data—and thus bring potential paradigm-shifting implications for using text as data. While the models show substantial promise, their relative performance compared to human coders and supervised models remains poorly understood and subject to significant academic debate. This paper assesses the strengths and weaknesses of popular fine-tuned AI models compared to both conventional supervised classifiers and manual annotation by experts and crowd workers. The task used is to identify the political affiliation of politicians based on a single X/Twitter message, focusing on data from 11 different countries. The paper finds that GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy than both supervised models and human coders across all languages and country contexts. In the US context, it achieves an accuracy of 0.934 and an inter-coder reliability of 0.982. Examining the cases where the models fail, the paper finds that the LLM—unlike the supervised models—correctly annotates messages that require interpretation of implicit or unspoken references, or reasoning on the basis of contextual knowledge—capacities that have traditionally been understood to be distinctly human. The paper thus contributes to our understanding of the revolutionary implications of LLMs for text analysis within the social sciences."

    "abstract": "Drawing on dual-process theories, this study aims to investigate the factors associated with social media users’ acceptance of mental health-related misinformation (MHRM). We conducted a case study of Chinese microblogging Weibo on conversations that emerged following a publicised celebrity suicide of South Korean superstar Sulli. This incident sparked an extensive discussion on mental health issues as Sulli was reported to have suffered from depression prior to her death. Whilst previous studies on users’ information acceptance mainly adopted survey methods, our study employs a mixed-method approach (i.e. computational data collection method, content analysis and statistical analysis), which opens up new directions to utilise secondary social media data. We identified MHRM from the discussions on Weibo and labelled the responses to the misinformation as whether they indicate an acceptance of the MHRM. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the associations of receivers’ acceptance of MHRM with its information features (e.g. number of likes) and information sources (e.g. gender). Inconsistent with previous studies, our findings suggest that MHRM is less likely to be accepted when published by male users, underscoring the context-specific nature of heuristic cues. This study also revealed some novel findings, such as MHRM with more pictures or with more words is less likely to be accepted. A theoretical model was proposed based on the findings, which highlights the importance of heuristic cues and individuals’ pre-existing knowledge in information processing."
