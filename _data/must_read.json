    "authors": "Camille J Saucier, Nathan Walter",
    "abstract": "Although research on misinformation and conspiracy theories has grown exponentially in recent years, false and misleading content remains difficult to combat. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind conspiracy theory engagement may provide unique insight. Drawing upon distinct literatures around self-affirmation and motivation theories, this study aims to: (a) determine if conspiracy theories serve to bolster self-worth among those predisposed to believe them and (b) examine whether a priori affirmation reduces the desire to engage with these theories. To test these predictions, two experiments assessed participants’ likelihood of engaging with a conspiracy theory. Results were mixed, suggesting conspiracy theories serve a self-affirming function, yet also illustrating the complex nature of conspiracy beliefs and the diverse means to test them. Together, these findings speak to the continued importance of research into conspiracy theory engagement with an eye toward identifying boundary conditions and elucidating underlying mechanisms.",

    "authors": "Muniba Saleem, Ismaharif Ismail",
    "abstract": "Guided by social identity gratification theory, this study examines the reciprocal relationship between media consumption and social identity among 220 ethnically and linguistically diverse Muslim American adolescents over three years. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found stronger evidence for media-to-identity influence, particularly in predicting within-person changes over time. Media consumption was significantly associated with identity centrality and private esteem but not public esteem, highlighting the multidimensionality of social identity. The impact of media also varied by genre and language: native-language entertainment media positively influenced identity centrality and private esteem, whereas English-language media showed distinct effects at the between- and within-subject levels. Additionally, increased time on social networking sites was linked to a decline in Muslim private esteem over time. These findings highlight the complex ways media consumption shapes the social identity development of marginalized youth in the United States.",

    "authors": "Qiu Jiangnan, Qian Wang, Xinwei Wang, Yan Li, Min Zuo, Jingxian Wang",
    "abstract": "Purpose An online knowledge community (OKC) is an important platform for people to produce and share knowledge. Many factors affecting the knowledge quality of OKC have been explored, but the feedback effect of knowledge quality has been ignored while feedback is a potentially powerful tool to enhance organizational effectiveness. This paper explores the cyclical causal feedback relationship among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality. Design/methodology/approach We drew on the Input-Mediator-Output-Input model (IMOI) to explore the cyclical causal feedback among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality, then used panel data with the editing history of 117 articles extracted from Wikipedia to test the causality among these variables via the two-step system GMM estimation method. Findings There is a positive feedback loop among knowledge heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality. Experience heterogeneity had no significant impact on interactive processes and knowledge quality, while knowledge quality in the previous stage had a significant negative feedback effect on experience heterogeneity in the next stage. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted in the context of Wikipedia. We expect that the results will generalize to other OKC platforms. Practical implications The findings could assist OKC managers in understanding the dynamic evolution of knowledge quality. Enriching members’ knowledge heterogeneity and promoting interaction are the keys to continuously improving knowledge quality. Originality/value This study extends the IMOI framework to an OKC context and finds the cyclical causal feedback relationship among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The metaverse presents an emerging domain that offers many opportunities to various stakeholders. Despite the advantages, the metaverse has been witnessing increasing cases of violence and abuse. This study aims to empirically examine the dark side of the metaverse and its consequences on users. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the theoretical premise of deindividuation theory and psychodynamic theory to conceptualize a research model. A structured survey-based questionnaire is employed for data collection from 327 metaverse gaming users from US. Structured equation modeling was used for data analysis. Findings The study reveals that the loneliness of users is positively associated with dissociative anonymity and invisibility in the metaverse, which leads to deindividuation. Further, findings suggest that deindividuation fosters deviant behaviour in metaverse. Furthermore, deindividuation and deviant behaviour predict depression among users. The study also established the moderating effects of immersive experience. Originality/value Rarely studies have attempted to comprehend the dark side of the metaverse. The study is one of the first to empirically show that metaverse engagement might aggravate the well-being of lonely individuals. Findings also offer implications for metaverse game designers and public policymakers.",

    "authors": "Shanshan Shang, Tianyun Yi, Xiao-Yue You",
    "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of different types of chatbots on knowledge learning performance and continuous usage intention by designing thought-guided and affective thought-guided chatbots. Drawing on coping theory, the study further seeks to uncover the underlying mechanism, focusing on perceptions of three nuanced aspects of transparency—social, expressive and diagnostic—and cognitive effort in human–artificial intelligence interactions. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts. A within-subjects experiment compared search engines and popular simple chatbots. A between-subjects experiment added thought-guided and affective thought-guided chatbots. Analysis of variance and partial least squares structural equation modeling were employed to analyze the differences and relationships. Findings Results indicate that, despite users’ initial preference for selecting chatbots, there are no differences in terms of knowledge learning performance and continuous usage intention between the search engine and the simple chatbot. Among the four tools for knowledge acquisition, the affective thought-guided chatbot achieves the best knowledge learning performance, and the thought-guided chatbot shows the lowest continuous usage intention. The mechanism test reveals that, compared to the search engine, the affective thought-guided chatbot increases users’ perceptions of all three aspects of transparency and cognitive effort. Whereas the thought-guided chatbot only increases perceived expressive transparency and cognitive effort. Furthermore, perceived expressive transparency and perceived diagnostic transparency improve knowledge learning performance, perceived social transparency and perceived diagnostic transparency promote continuous usage intention and cognitive effort enhances knowledge learning performance but weakens continuous usage intention. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by concretizing coping theory in the chatbot context and dissecting interaction transparency into three nuanced aspects from a more detailed perspective. It addresses the ongoing debate over whether chatbots will replace search engines. It further introduces two innovative types of chatbots and presents a comprehensive framework to reveal the underlying mechanism.",

    "authors": "Aishwarya Deep Shukla, Jie Mein Goh, Laksh Agarwal",
    "abstract": "Purpose Online reviews shape consumer decisions, even in healthcare, a credence service where expertise is difficult to evaluate. Like unethical retailers, some healthcare providers post fake reviews. However, the impact of fake reviews on potential patients remains unclear. Using a dataset of fake reviews, this study examines how patients perceive the helpfulness and trustworthiness of fraudulent vs genuine physician reviews. Design/methodology/approach We used an archival dataset containing a representative sample of 5,000 online physician reviews, both fake and genuine, and performed empirical analysis. In addition to the helpful votes obtained from the data, we used large language models to derive the perceived trustworthiness score. Findings Fake physician reviews are paradoxically perceived as more helpful and trustworthy than genuine reviews. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we investigated the extent of personalized and specific health information. We found that fake reviews often contain more personalized and specific health information, making them appear more credible. Research limitations/implications Results may not generalize beyond online physician reviews. Future research could extend this investigation to other contexts. Practical implications Online platforms may need to reconsider their approach to managing online reviews, address ethical concerns, and strengthen regulatory oversight in sensitive areas, particularly in healthcare. Originality/value This study highlights an ethical paradox: while patients seek detailed health information, privacy concerns limit real patients from sharing such details, creating an information gap that fake reviews exploit. This is the first study to make use of unique data that contains real fake online physician reviews.",

The ToMM empowers researchers to ask how messages deemed unhelpful, harmful, or incomplete (e.g., absent) can be disrupted, or meaningfully transformed, to make room for new messages and meanings. To this aim, we first overview 40 years of atheoretical memorable messages scholarship, before detailing recent advancements in the ToMM. Next, we offer warrants for five propositions of the ToMM, aligning with metatheoretical assumptions for an interpretive approach to memorable messages scholarship. Lastly, we discuss future directions for ToMM scholarship, including opportunities to advance qualitative approaches to communication research and approach the ToMM from alternative metatheoretical perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Words carry gender associations from cultural influences like gender stereotypes, and spoken words are affected by speakers’ vocal characteristics. Listeners’ experiences and attitudes may also shape their perceptions. This study examined how individual differences in listener demographics, experiences, and attitudes influence the impact of speakers’ perceived vocal gender on listeners’ word-gender associations. Participants heard 21 words said by speakers of different gender identities and rated gender associations with each word on a masculine-feminine scale. Rating patterns were compared to those of separate participants who rated the speakers’ genders or the same words in print. As predicted, listeners with transgender experience or positive attitudes were less influenced by vocal gender in rating word gender. Findings suggest exposure to diverse experiences can enable listeners to focus more on linguistic content than voice characteristics. Understanding these dynamics is important for addressing biases in individual cognition and broader societal communication.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to examine whether emotional resilience mediated the relation between victimization and depression, and whether friendship (quality and quantity) and gender moderated these relations among middle school students in China. Data were collected from 765 middle school students (seventh and eighth graders, Mage = 13.14 years) from three middle schools in Beijing, China in November 2019 (T1) and November 2020 (T2). Results showed that emotional resilience at T2 mediated the relation between victimization at T1 and depressive symptoms at T2 (indirect effect = 0.10, 95% CI [0.06, 0.14]). Friendship quality at T1 moderated the relation between victimization at T1 and emotional resilience at T2 ( β = 0.16, p &lt; .05), and served as a buffer for girls, but not for boys. Friendship quantity at T1 moderated the relation between T1 victimization and T2 emotional resilience at T2 ( β = −0.09, p &lt; .05), particularly for boys. Additionally, friendship quantity at T1 moderated the relation between T1 victimization and T2 depression ( β = 0.04, p &lt; .05), especially for girls. Specifically, slope analysis showed that having more friends was protective for resilience and depression only for students who experienced lower levels of victimization, but not for those who experienced higher levels of victimization. Furthermore, the three-way interaction term between T1 friendship quality, T1 friendship quantity, and T1 victimization significantly predicted T2 emotional resilience ( β = 0.11, p &lt; .05). Our findings clarified the effect of friendship quality versus quantity for Chinese youth who experienced victimization. The findings highlighted the importance of fostering high-quality friendships and emotional resilience to support the well-being of students who experienced peer victimization.",

The study achieves this by employing latent profile analysis, regression, and structural equation modeling using data from a South Korean online panel survey (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 625). The results identify five distinct public profiles based on their relationship assessments, problem recognition, and general trust in AI: the Cautious, Balanced, Uninterested, Confident, and Enthusiastic. Notably, the Enthusiastic group—characterized by high trust and strong relationships with the service provider—showed the strongest interest in adopting AI, highlighting their potential as key publics for introducing new AI services in business contexts. Additionally, the article contributes to public segmentation theory through the use of the situational theory of problem-solving and enhances the applicability of established public relations frameworks to the evolving field of AI.",

This research investigates what homeopathy users believe about (a) whether and how homeopathy should be used to treat serious conditions like cancer, and (b) science and the relevance of scientific evidence regarding homeopathy. Using latent profile analysis (N = 225), we identify subgroups of homeopathy users that differ in their normative beliefs about the use of homeopathy in serious conditions: supporters of standalone use of homeopathy in serious conditions (~9%), those who are open toward standalone use (~43%), supporters of supplementary use (~35%), and supporters of both supplementary use and nonuse in serious conditions (~13%). Subgroups that supported or were open toward the standalone use of homeopathy in serious conditions held the most negative attitudes toward science. These findings are relevant for interventions aiming to prevent the risks associated with homeopathy use.",

To address this gap, we construct new measures of candidate ideology based on campaign contributions and roll‐call votes, and we use them to offer the first systematic study of the relationship between candidate ideology and electoral outcomes in primary and general elections in state legislatures, 2000–2022. We find that the set of people running for state legislature has polarized substantially in recent decades. More‐moderate candidates enjoy a meaningful advantage in contested general elections, but that advantage has declined somewhat in recent years. At the same time, more‐extreme candidates are favored in contested primary elections. These new measures and data will allow researchers to build on these basic findings to understand how elections function in lower information, lower salience environments like American state legislatures.",

Complex concepts such as ideology, identity, and legitimacy are difficult to measure; yet, without measurement that matches theoretical constructs, careful empirical studies may not be testing that which they had intended. Item response theory (IRT) models offer promise by producing transparent and improvable measures of latent factors thought to underlie behavior. Unfortunately, those factors have no intrinsic substantive interpretations. Prior solutions to the substantive interpretation problem require exogenous information about the units, such as legislators or survey respondents, which make up the data; limit analysis to one latent factor; and/or are difficult to generalize. We propose and validate a solution, IRT-M, that produces multiple, potentially correlated, generalizable, latent dimensions, each with substantive meaning that the analyst specifies before analysis to match theoretical concepts.

Challenger parties differ from dominant parties not only in their issue entrepreneurship and anti-establishment rhetoric, but also in how they approach social groups. Whereas dominant parties can and must use their policy record when appealing to groups rhetorically, challenger parties compensate for their lack of policy influence and long-lasting group ties by using more symbolic group-based appeals, creating affective affiliations with voters while avoiding accountability or dividing their potential base. Similarly, they are more inclined to use negative group-based appeals. Using a most-similar-systems design and a new dataset of 15,460 tweets from German subnational parties, our main finding is that dominant parties, particularly those having held the prime minister’s office, favour policy-based group appeals, while challengers rely more on symbolic appeals. However, differences in appeal strategies diminish during campaign times. Our findings underline the importance of group-based appeals for mainstream-challenger competition.",

Some work contends that Leavers and Remainers display great animus toward one another in ways similar to affective polarization (dislike of opposing partisans). However, it remains unclear whether the dislike is as deep as partisan affective polarization and whether these identities are still relevant several years after Brexit. Additionally, it is not known whether Brexit‐related animus is based more on in‐group favoritism or out‐group dislike. Using a survey experiment paradigm to assess different levels of prejudice (based on pre‐registered hypotheses), we find clear prejudice based on Brexit identity in 2019 that is almost unchanged in 2023. Both in‐group favoritism and out‐group animus appear to drive these tendencies, but out‐group animus's effects are more robust. Leavers and Remainers have different motivations for different manifestations of prejudice, but each displays both tendencies at times.",

Conflict narratives increased reactive threat and zero‐sum beliefs, leading to more anti‐trans and fewer pro‐trans actions. Additionally, a direct positive link was observed between feminist identification and support for pro‐trans actions, while a negative association was found with reactionary actions (opposite for ideological threat). Based on these findings, we propose a series of win‐win strategies to support trans rights and promote peacebuilding and inclusivity in Spanish universities without triggering threat or zero‐sum beliefs in ciswomen.",

    "abstract": "Social media has made it easier than ever for citizens to voice their opinion to their elected representatives. However, officials may infer that constituents who write to them via low-effort online mediums care less about the issues than those who communicate in person. To test how policymakers evaluate messages from constituents, we fielded a national survey of local US policymakers to examine responsiveness to different types of messages. Our findings indicate that online communication presents a double-edged sword: while it lowers the effort needed for constituents to communicate, officials discount information conveyed through social media. We examine this trade-off using an embedded conjoint experiment. Our results suggest that a social media message would have to be sent by more than 47 constituents for it to exceed the value of a single face-to-face meeting. These findings illustrate that, all else equal, in-person meetings likely remain the most persuasive form of grassroots communication. However, using social media can be an effective choice to the extent that it facilitates a large increase in overall levels of constituent engagement.",

The direction of that effect hinges on how the forecast is presented. Voters become more accurate and precise in their predictions of each candidate’s vote share when given forecast information in the form of projected vote share. Forecasts presented as numerical probabilities make such expectations less accurate and less precise. When combined, the effects of both forms on vote share expectations tend to cancel out, but jointly boost voters’ ability to identify likely winners.

    "authors": "Matthew H Graham, Omer Yair",
    "abstract": "Research suggests that partisanship interferes with people’s ability to distinguish between factually verifiable statements and opinion statements. We investigate the degree to which observed partisan bias in fact-opinion discernment is due to expressive responding: partisans may claim that congenial opinions are facts, and that uncongenial facts are opinions, because they want to express their partisan attitude toward the statement. Four experiments (total N = 10,614) show that expressive responding substantially inflates measured partisan differences in fact/opinion classifications, by more than 50 percent in the United States and about 30 percent in Israel. Despite this, we find little evidence that our treatments increased the proportion of correct classifications. In other words, although expressive responding makes people look more partisan than they really are, it does not lead surveys to underestimate the average person’s ability to distinguish fact from opinion. These results are compatible because of a rarely noted implication of expressive responding theory: when the correct answer is party congenial, expressive responding makes people look more competent than they really are. Notably, expressive responding emerged despite the survey instrument’s instructions not to respond in this manner. This suggests that approaches that rely on instructions or requests may be too weak to eliminate expressive responding.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing view among scholars has been that the preference for strong leaders is an idiosyncratic feature of right-wing individuals. However, it is unclear whether this inference is accurate given that prior research has largely overlooked the role of ethnicity. We analyzed data from the United States and Western Europe ( N = 34,443) and found that ethnic minorities (and right-wing individuals) preferred strong leaders to a greater extent than Whites (and left-wing individuals). Notably, ethnic minorities across diverse ethnic and political backgrounds were closer to right-wing Whites on strong-leader preference than to left-wing Whites. Our work also provides some evidence, using both measurement-of-mediation (Studies 1–4) and experimental mediation (preregistered Studies 5 and 6), that generalized trust helps explain group differences in strong-leader preference. In sum, our research illustrates the unique nature of left-wing Whites’ leadership preferences, and highlights the importance of testing social science theories using diverse participant samples.",

    "authors": "Simone Zhang, Janet Xu, AJ Alvero",
    "abstract": "The growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools presents new challenges for data quality in online surveys and experiments. This study examines participants’ use of large language models to answer open-ended survey questions and describes empirical tendencies in human versus large language model (LLM)-generated text responses. In an original survey of research participants recruited from a popular online platform for sourcing social science research subjects, 34 percent reported using LLMs to help them answer open-ended survey questions. Simulations comparing human-written responses from three pre-ChatGPT studies with LLM-generated text reveal that LLM responses are more homogeneous and positive, particularly when they describe social groups in sensitive questions. These homogenization patterns may mask important underlying social variation in attitudes and beliefs among human subjects, raising concerns about data validity. Our findings shed light on the scope and potential consequences of participants’ LLM use in online research.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where they interact with humans and other agents. We propose to use behavioural game theory to study LLMs’ cooperation and coordination behaviour. Here we let different LLMs play finitely repeated 2 × 2 games with each other, with human-like strategies, and actual human players. Our results show that LLMs perform particularly well at self-interested games such as the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma family. However, they behave suboptimally in games that require coordination, such as the Battle of the Sexes. We verify that these behavioural signatures are stable across robustness checks. We also show how GPT-4’s behaviour can be modulated by providing additional information about its opponent and by using a ‘social chain-of-thought’ strategy. This also leads to better scores and more successful coordination when interacting with human players. These results enrich our understanding of LLMs’ social behaviour and pave the way for a behavioural game theory for machines.",

    "authors": "Alexandra de Lagarde, Catherine Pelachaud, Louise P. Kirsch, Malika Auvray",
    "abstract": "Social touch is crucial for human well-being, as a lack of tactile interactions increases anxiety, loneliness, and need for social support. To address the detrimental effects of social isolation, we build on cutting-edge research on social touch and movement sonification to investigate whether social tactile gestures could be recognized through sounds, a sensory channel giving access to remote information. Four online experiments investigated participants’ perception of auditory stimuli that were recorded with our “audio-touch” sonification technique, which captures the sounds of touch. In the first experiment, participants correctly categorized sonified skin-on-skin tactile gestures (i.e., stroking, rubbing, tapping, hitting). In the second experiment, the audio-touch sample consisted of the sonification of six socio-emotional intentions conveyed through touch (i.e., anger, attention, fear, joy, love, sympathy). Participants categorized above chance the socio-emotional intentions of skin-on-skin touches converted into sounds and coherently rated their valence. In two additional experiments, the surface involved in the touches (either skin or plastic) was shown to influence participants’ recognition of sonified gestures and socio-emotional intentions. Thus, our research unveils that specific information about social touch (i.e., gesture, emotions, and surface) can be recognized through sounds, when they are obtained with our specific sonifying methodology. This shows significant promise for providing remote access, through the auditory channel, to meaningful social touch interactions.",

    "authors": "Mellissa Meisels",
    "abstract": "In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional protection of abortion rights established in Roe v. Wade . In doing so, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization moved status quo on abortion policy more into line with the Republican Party’s stance. Subsequent research has documented the decision’s impact on mass political behavior and opinion, yet less is known about its impact on the behavior of political elites. I provide evidence on congressional candidates’ strategic responses to the decision with original data on campaign platforms ( N = 4,703) from election cycles before and after Dobbs . After the decision, Democrats became significantly more likely to campaign on abortion and to do so using unambiguous language, while Republicans increasingly obfuscated their positions on the issue. Pre-post- Dobbs change in partisan divergence in campaign attention to abortion was driven most strongly by candidates in states with abortion bans set to take effect upon overturning of Roe (i.e., trigger laws and/or pre- Roe laws). Importantly, these shifting patterns of campaign attention were not present in other issue domains, consistent with changes in attention to abortion being driven by Dobbs rather than other contemporaneous factors.",
