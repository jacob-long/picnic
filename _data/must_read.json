    "abstract": "This article examines the social technology company Meta’s public communication on problematic content, via their official ‘Meta Newsroom’, within the context of growing regulatory scrutiny. For nearly a decade, the Meta Newsroom has been a major outlet for Meta company announcements, and since 2016, the Newsroom has increasingly become a key source for company responses to concerns regarding mis/disinformation and other kinds of problematic content on Meta’s platforms. Using a mixed-methods approach informed by discourse analysis, this article critically examines Newsrooms posts from 2016 to early 2021. It asks: how is Meta framing ‘problems’ on its platforms? How is Meta identifying ‘solutions’ to those problems? And is Meta ‘nudging’ policymakers in specific conceptual directions? Overall, we find that Meta is framing content moderation issues through four key frames – ‘authenticity’, ‘political advertising’, ‘technological solutions’, and ‘enforcement’ – that benefit Meta, as they shift responsibility while also demonstrating that Meta is an active and capable problem-solver."

    "abstract": "A plethora of studies have shown that parenting practices can lead to problematic Internet use. However, few studies have explored how parents foster positive online behavior in adolescents. This study addresses this gap by using self-determination theory to examine how supportive parenting practices, such as autonomy support and structure provision, can influence digital citizenship behaviors in adolescents. The study considered the mediating role of adolescents’ self-regulation, and examined how sex and adolescence stage moderate these relationships. The study included 570 Mexican adolescents (48% girls and 52% boys), and structural equation modeling and multigroup invariance statistics were conducted for analysis. The results showed that autonomy support was positively associated with all dimensions of digital citizenship, while structure provision was only positively associated with online civic engagement. Self-regulation was found to mediate the relationship between autonomy support, structure provision, and digital citizenship behaviors. The multigroup analysis confirmed that sex and adolescence stage did not affect the relationship between parenting practices and digital citizenship behaviors. Overall, the results suggest that supportive parenting practices can encourage positive digital citizenship behaviors among adolescents."

    "abstract": "Humans have a unique capacity to bond with others through shared experiences, even in the absence of explicit communication. Yet it is unknown whether this capacity is flexible enough to accommodate the different kinds of virtual environments on which we increasingly rely. In the current pre-registered study, we examined whether this capacity still operates effectively on shared screens during non-communicative video mediated interactions, in dyads and in groups. Participants (N = 144 US participants, 71 female, 72 male, 1 non-binary) either watched a video on a shared screen together with (pre-recorded) partners or watched individually while these partners attended to something else. Equivalence tests showed that self-reported social bonding scores were practically equivalent between conditions. Thus, in contrast to several in-person studies, there was no difference in social bonding between conditions. These results show that, in the absence of explicit communication, some of humans’ most fundamental social bonding mechanisms might not operate as effectively in video mediated social interactions. As such, without sufficient active social or emotional engagement, the social costs of increasingly relying on video mediated social interactions might be greater than previously thought."

    "abstract": "Counter-speech is considered a promising tool to address hate speech online, notably, by promoting bystander reactions that could attenuate the prevalence or further dissemination of hate. However, it remains unclear which types of counter-speech are most effective in attaining these goals and which might backfire. Advancing the literature, we examined the effect of four types of counter-speech (i.e., educating the perpetrator, calling on others to intervene, diverting the conversation, and abusing the perpetrator) on a range of bystander behavioral intentions in an experimental study (N = 250, UK-based adults). Overall, counter-speech did not affect bystanders’ subsequent responses to hate speech. Having said this, as expected, diversionary counter-speech increased intentions to ignore hate speech, which suggests unintended consequences. The study illustrates that counter-speech may not be sufficiently impactful in regulating bystanders’ reactions to hate speech online."

    "abstract": "This study presents the development and validation of the Adolescent Internet Adaptability Scale (AIAS), designed to assess adolescents’ adaptive capacities in Internet use. The scale development encompassed multiple phases with diverse sample sizes: item pool generation through interviews (n = 15), scale structure analysis via Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA, n = 553) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA, n = 4,637), along with reliability (n = 4,637) and validity (n = 4,637) analyses. The reliability phase included alpha, composite reliability, and retest reliability (n = 132), while the validity phase covered structural, convergent, discriminant, criterion-related validity, and measurement invariance tests. The AIAS, comprising eight dimensions—Internet curiosity, Internet self-efficacy, Internet learning ability, Internet socialization ability, Internet information search ability, Internet information protection ability, Internet self-control ability, and Internet positive coping ability—demonstrates strong reliability and validity. It shows positive correlations with Internet use—parental active help, well-being, and meaning in life, and negative correlations with Internet addiction and depression, with stronger associations observed with positive indicators. These findings highlight the Internet’s potential as a platform for strength acquisition. The AIAS, with its comprehensive nature, is promising for tailoring adolescent support from a positive psychology perspective, enabling holistic assessment and targeted interventions. It also advances understanding of youth development in the digital era, proving valuable for clinical and research applications. Ongoing evaluation, cross-cultural validation, and longitudinal research are essential for realizing its full potential. This multidimensional scale significantly advances the assessment of adolescent Internet use, equipping stakeholders to effectively address adolescents’ digital behaviors for enhancing well-being."

    "abstract": "Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has emerged as a significant public health concern, yet not enough is known about its prevalence among the general population as well as its relationship to well-being, mental health, specifically depression and anxiety, and gaming genres. This study aimed to address these questions. The research was conducted on a representative sample of the Croatian general population including 4,994 participants, aged between 15 and 64 years (M = 40.75, SD = 15.49). The Ten-Item Internet Gaming Disorder Test, Mental Health Inventory-5, Personal Well-being Index, Gaming time and Game Genres Preferences were used. The prevalence of the IGD in the general population of Croatia, aged 15-64 years, was estimated at 0.48%, 95% CI [0.30%, 1%], and among video game players (N = 1,239) at 1.63%, 95% CI [1.11%, 3%]. The highest prevalence was observed among young males. IGD showed the strongest relationship with depression, and weaker relationships with anxiety and well-being. Among the individual criteria, negative consequences for significant relationships, deception and escape had the strongest, while tolerance, loss of control and withdrawal had the weakest relationship to depression, anxiety and well-being, in a relative sense. Sports games and casual games players had lower risk for IGD, while other genres did not differ in their risk for IGD. Online and offline games did not differ in their risk for IGD. This study has shown that IGD has a relatively low prevalence among the general population and video game players, and that not all IGD criteria are equally relevant. Future longitudinal studies and studies on clinical samples are needed."

It uniquely considers the interaction between these chatbot characteristics and human users' dominant personality traits (conscientiousness and extraversion). Design/methodology/approach A mixed-factor design experiment involving 153 university students was employed. Participants interacted with four different chatbot conditions: a conscientious bot and an extroverted bot, each with and without emojis. Findings The inclusion of emojis negatively influenced users' intentions to use the chatbots but did not affect trust, perceived authenticity or intended engagement with the bots. Additionally, the students' personality traits played a role in evaluating the different chatbot types. Originality/value This research introduces a novel approach by integrating emoji use and human personality traits into chatbot communication, focusing on academic advising. It examines the interaction effects of emojis and personality traits (conscientiousness and extraversion) on user behavior, also considering the user’s personality traits. This work enriches the human-computer interaction field and guides future chatbot development."

Design/methodology/approach To ensure the quality of the data collected, participant recruitment was conducted using two panels: Qualtrics and Cloud Research. The sample comprised 262 participants who were USA residents aged between 18 and 87 years who use the Internet regularly. Additionally, the survey required a balance of participants across racial and educational levels. The survey was drawn from items for which reliability and validity indexes have been tested and confirmed in prior disparate studies. Findings Results show that digital citizenship is a significant moderator in the relationships between disposition to value web privacy, perceived online disinhibition and cyber harassment. Digital citizenship behavior mediates the relationship between perceived online disinhibition and cyber harassment but does not mediate the relationship between disposition to value privacy and cyber harassment. Originality/value The results of this study broaden the understanding of digital citizenship as a behavior modification for cyber harassment, specifically among adult Internet users. Further, we seek to bring together two streams of research that have previously been studied separately: the literature on the antecedents of perceived online disinhibition and disposition to value web privacy concerns."

    "abstract": "Syntactic priming is a linguistic phenomenon where the exposure to a specific grammatical structure increases the likelihood that the same structure will be used in subsequent language production. Previous research has shown that these syntactic processes are influenced by a broad range of linguistic, cognitive, and social factors. In the present research, we focused on the role of religious systems in shaping syntactic priming in dialog. Based on the observation that the Taoist concept of “moving with flow” encourages individuals to adapt to the natural flow of life and circumstances, we hypothesized that Taoists might modify their syntactic choices to foster better connections with their interlocutors. We conducted two studies to test our theoretical perspective. As predicted, Study 1 found that Taoists were more likely to mirror the syntax used by their interlocutors in dialog than their atheist counterparts. In Study 2, we compared the magnitude of syntactic priming effects between Taoists and Buddhists. The results showed that Taoists demonstrated a stronger preference for using the same syntactic structure as their conversational partners than Buddhists. In sum, our findings provide the first empirical evidence that beliefs and values associated with religious systems exert a significant influence on syntactic priming effects."

Two hypotheses have emerged which touch on these features, respectively that gossip supports exceptional levels of sociability, and that it operates as a form of social control ensuring exceptional levels of cooperation. Each of these hypotheses is critically examined before considering a third and relatively neglected possibility, namely that the principle significance of gossip in social life is that it supports prediction about the future behavior of others."

Sibling sharing and the older siblings’ management of the interaction was observed in a laboratory-based fishing game, and mothers and fathers reported on both the toddlers’ and older siblings’ conscience (affective discomfort, moral regulation) at each timepoint. There were significant increases in both siblings’ sharing and older siblings’ management from 18 to 24 months, whereas toddlers’ sharing increased and older siblings’ management decreased from 24 to 36 months. There were stable individual differences in toddlers’ and older siblings’ sharing, and older siblings’ management from 18 to 24 months, but not from 24 to 36 months, suggesting changes in the development of sibling sharing during the second and third years when toddlers become more autonomous contributors to the sharing dynamic and older siblings can step back from managing turn-taking. Reciprocity between older siblings’ and toddlers’ sharing was evident within each time point, but little evidence of bidirectional influence over time. Moral regulation and affective discomfort were highly stable from 18 to 36 months for both siblings, but only the older siblings’ moral regulation at 18 months predicted their sharing at 24 months. Results support a constructivist-interactionist perspective of moral development by showing that sharing develops gradually over time through a set progressive social interactions with a sibling."

Existing research has shown that individuals in interracial relationships experience greater jealousy than those in same-race relationships, but these studies were underpowered or relied on binary measures of jealousy. In a large sample of individuals in interracial ( N = 196) and same-race relationships ( N = 198) from the United States and Canada, we found that individuals in interracial relationships reported experiencing jealousy more frequently and intensely (general jealousy), had greater worries about potential romantic rivals (rival-directed cognitive jealousy), and felt more distrust and anger toward rivals (rival-directed emotional jealousy). However, there were no differences in the extent to which they derogated the rival and displayed their relationship in front of the rival (rival-directed behavioral jealousy), and the findings for general and cognitive jealousy became nonsignificant when controlling for attachment anxiety. Finally, having a stronger couple identity attenuated the negative effects of having higher general jealousy and cognitive jealousy on relationship satisfaction for individuals in interracial (but not same-race) relationships. Future research should explore the development of attachment anxiety in interracial relationships and explore strategies in addition to having a stronger couple identity that can help interracial couples navigate third-party threats more effectively."

A central question within attachment theory is how best to conceptualize the relationship between different attachment working models, such as how one’s attachment to parents may influence partner-specific working models and impact romantic relationship satisfaction. Despite the robust evidence that attachment theory can be appropriately applied across developmental and cultural contexts and the functional similarity of attachment in women and men, little research has examined attachment working models among nonbinary people. The current study tested competing hypotheses replicating the work by Dugan and Fraley (2022), extended to a large sample of nonbinary adults ( N = 2,811). Similar to previous findings, our results supported the mediation hypothesis, which suggests that parental (defined as mother and father) attachment working models indirectly relate to romantic relationship satisfaction through romantic partner attachment working models. We also report comparisons of attachment overall between nonbinary people, men, and women, which showed that there were smaller mean differences between nonbinary people and women, yet more similar correlations between nonbinary people and men. These findings highlight the generalizability of attachment theory to diverse, nonbinary gender identities."

Further, friends’ perceptions of whether someone is ready might constrain the opportunities afforded to individuals, and these perceptions may be shaped by how people navigate a romantic relationship, namely, attachment orientation. Hence, we examined the overlap of self and other perceptions of commitment readiness and whether those perceived as insecurely attached were also perceived as not ready for commitment. Persons in groups ( N = 193) consisting of four friends each ( N = 772) rated themselves and their friends on commitment readiness and attachment orientations. Using a bivariate social relations model, we found strong self-other agreement on commitment readiness. We also found that people perceived as higher in attachment avoidance and anxiety were seen as not as ready for commitment. Finally, people’s judgments of their own commitment readiness were associated with how they judged their friends’ commitment readiness (i.e., assumed similarity). Implications about the consequences of interpersonal judgments among friends are discussed."

    "abstract": "The process of discussing conflict can impact the quality and longevity of a couple’s relationship. Limited research has characterized the dynamic nature of conflict discussions, including how these discussions unfold and how an actor’s behaviour elicits particular responses from their partner over the course of the discussion. It is also important to consider how additional factors, such as alcohol intoxication, can influence this dynamic. A challenge in conducting this research is having sufficiently fine-grained data along with appropriate analytic methods to characterize the conversation dynamics. To address this gap, we utilized time-varying effect modeling (TVEM) to examine the correspondence of actor-partner behaviours as a function of time and alcohol consumption. We examined this using data from 139 heterosexual couples who were observed for 15 minutes while discussing a conflict. Couples were randomly assigned to have either one, both, or neither drink alcohol prior to the discussion. Using the Rapid Marital Interaction Coding System (RMICS), individuals’ behaviours were coded as either positive, negative, or neutral during each speaking turn. The results supported that positive behaviour tended to elicit positive behaviour and the strength of this relationship increased over the course of discussing conflict. While negative behaviours tended to elicit negative behaviours, the strength of this relationship was stable over time. Alcohol consumption did not alter the relations between actor-partner behaviours over time. Taken together, the findings support the dynamic nature of some aspects of actor-partner behaviours when discussing conflict. Future research could consider how these dynamics predict future relational outcomes or characterize how they unfold in naturalistic settings."
