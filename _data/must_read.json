    "abstract": "Unhealthy social media habits may foster procrastination, leading to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes. The rising prevalence of procrastinatory short-form video (SFV) use (e.g., on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) highlights the need to better understand how established predictors of problematic media use operate in this emerging media environment. To address this gap, this study investigated the motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its relationship with user well-being. Using an online survey of college students ( N = 549) from two U.S. universities, structural equation modeling revealed that individuals with lower self-control, stronger habitual SFV use, and greater involvement (enjoyment, escapism, and social connectedness) were more prone to procrastinatory SFV use, which in turn was associated with higher stress levels, poorer overall sleep quality, longer sleep latency, more sleep disturbances, and greater daytime dysfunction, but not with academic performance. This study contributes to the understanding of motivational factors underlying procrastinatory SFV use and its associations with user well-being. Theoretical contributions to the study of irrational media use, practical recommendations for mitigating procrastinatory SFV engagement, and directions for longitudinal and context-sensitive future research are discussed."

    "abstract": "This study examines how European media portrayed Syrian refugees in 2015 and Ukrainian refugees in 2022, across seven national contexts. Drawing on the GDELT database of news articles and its automated sentiment analysis, the study compares the tone and salience of coverage surrounding two highly symbolic mediatic events: the death of Syrian child Alan Kurdi in 2015 and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Results reveal stark disparities: Ukrainian refugees were consistently represented more positively than Syrian refugees and non-Syrian/non-Ukrainian refugees. These findings provide quantitative evidence of how cultural, racial, and geopolitical proximity shape refugee representations in European media, thereby confirming previous literature. While some prior scholarship has demonstrated these dynamics, this article contributes to existent literature by offering a large-scale, cross-national, and event-based comparative analysis."

Drawing on survey data from 1,340 Swiss–German participants, this study reveals that engagement with diverse political views is not solely shaped by stable personality traits but also by the characteristics of the informational context. Openness, for instance, shows a positive relationship with seeking controversial information in the media but not the interpersonal sphere, while extraversion is linked to a preference for controversial political discussions. Nevertheless, our results also point to a particular personality type, plasticity (i.e., shared variance of openness and extraversion), that seems to be more actively engaged in cross-cutting exposure across communication settings. In contrast, individuals high in stability (i.e., shared variance of conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness) tend to be somewhat less engaged."

It has received little scholarly attention, and most explanations of it are speculative or anecdotal. Drawing on the mere exposure effect, this preregistered laboratory experiment provides new evidence of framerate sensitivity and cinemagoing as explanatory factors of the soap opera effect. Undergraduate students ( N = 270) reported their cinemagoing and completed a novel task to measure their framerate sensitivity. They also completed a task indicating their framerate preferences. Those with a higher framerate sensitivity and more regular cinemagoing preferred the standard framerate in one scene and the high framerate in another scene. These divergent findings may be due to differences in camera movement and luminance between the scenes."

    "abstract": "Interpersonal sexual objectification is a pervasive phenomenon among women and has been increasingly recognized in men. Research suggests sexual objectification is associated with two contrasting psychological outcomes: self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Yet, little is known about how these outcomes vary by interpersonal context and gender, particularly in Asian contexts. To this end, two studies were conducted in the Chinese cultural context. In Study 1, a two-stage process was used to collect and screen objectifying comments towards women and men. In the first stage, 67 women and 41 men were recruited to generate a pool of comments. In the second stage, another 75 women and 50 men were recruited to evaluate these comments, resulting in eight representative comments for each gender. In Study 2, 239 women and 194 men participated in a 4 × 2 experiment examining how the perpetrator’s role (stranger, colleague, friend, or intimate partner) and the comment valence (positive or negative) affected self-objectification and enjoyment of sexualization. Results revealed distinct response patterns between genders. For women, positive objectifying comments led to lower self-objectification compared to negative comments in acquaintance contexts (i.e., colleagues, friends, and partners). However, no differences were found in the context with strangers. In contrast, men’s self-objectification remained stable across perpetrators and comment valences. Women’s enjoyment of sexualization was highest from intimate partners than from strangers, colleagues, and friends, whereas men’s enjoyment of sexualization was relatively high across perpetrators but lowest with colleagues. These findings extend objectification theory to the Chinese setting, highlighting gender-specific patterns in how interpersonal contexts shape psychological responses to sexual objectification."

However, little is known about how schema structures may impact couples in their daily lives. To address this gap, 260 couples were sampled at baseline to assess partner-schema structures, then surveyed for 14 days. Daily surveys captured relationship quality, relationship conflict severity, and relationship rumination; changes in relationship quality and relationship rumination on the day of a relational conflict; and depressed mood. Using multilevel modelling, guided by the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, significant actor and partner effects emerged. Generally, the results suggest that an individual’s partner-schema structures are significantly associated with their own daily relationship quality, relationship rumination, increased relationship rumination on the day of a relational conflict, and depressed mood. Two partner effects also emerged, indicating that one’s own partner-schema structures may shape one’s partner’s relationship rumination on the day of a conflict, as well as their partner’s depressed mood. Exploratory analyses also suggest that the linkages between conflict severity and daily relationship quality, daily relationship rumination, and daily depressed mood may be moderated by partner-schema structures. These findings extend previous cross-sectional research to the daily dyadic context. Implications for future research are discussed."

    "abstract": "Adolescents’ online habits may contribute to the spread of misinformation due to their preference for trusted peers as sources of information over credible sources. This propensity can also make adolescents a population more vulnerable to misinformation, particularly during crises when misinformation levels surge. In situations of uncertainty and risk, such as during public health crises, trust plays an important and influential role. This study explored whether adolescents’ trust in an individual sharing misinformation, and trust in their misinformation about Covid-19, differed based on adolescents’ perceived risk of harm from Covid-19 (risk vs reduced risk) and the age of the misinformer (peer vs adult). When shown misinformation about a hypothetical Covid-19 variant, adolescents (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 131; 14–17 years old) trusted a misinformer more when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents were also asked to provide open-ended justifications for their trust evaluations which were analysed in accordance with the elaboration likelihood model. We found that adolescents who reported to more regularly scrutinising information were more likely to consider information and source credibility when there was a perceived risk of harm to their age group. Adolescents who reported engaging in less information-scrutinising behaviours were more likely to consider their relationship with the misinformer when the misinformer was a peer. These findings suggest how the elaboration likelihood model can play an important role in risk communication amongst adolescents and emphasise the need for educating adolescents about the importance of scrutinising information, particularly during crises."

    "abstract": "Online hostility has become increasingly common in digital public spaces, often to the detriment of marginalized groups. While prior research distinguishes between incivility and intolerance, little is known about whether users can recognize these forms as conceptually distinct. Moreover, the roles of prior digital hate perpetration and national context in shaping such perceptions remain unclear. This cross-national survey ( N = 4041; Austria, France, Hungary, and Sweden) addresses these gaps. Participants rated uncivil anti-immigration content not only as more uncivil but also as more intolerant than explicitly intolerant content, indicating an alarming misreading of exclusionary messages. Recent perpetration was associated with weaker recognition of incivility and intolerance, as well as reduced differentiation between content types, suggesting desensitization and blurred perceptual boundaries. The findings were consistent across countries, indicating that these mechanisms transcend national contexts. Strengthening users’ ability to recognize subtle exclusionary rhetoric is essential to counter its normalization in public spheres."

Results show that media usage and sociodemographics influenced attitudes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower education and stronger religiosity correlated with reduced interest in or trust in science. Use of online legacy media showed rally-around-the-flag effects, but we found no clear differences between public and private broadcasters regarding their impact on science attitudes.

Visual-verbal overlap messages generated emotions and moral acceptability of the techniques, which then enhanced support for both products, and even intentions to buy and consume in some instances. However, verbal-only messages also generated similar outcomes for reduced-allergen peanuts, whereas for reduced-gluten wheat, the overlap alone was effective. Visual-verbal messages without overlap had no effect in both studies. Findings offer boundary conditions for visual-verbal overlap effects."

Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment—how well AI systems meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values. However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of AI-enabled systems in Germany ( n = 1800) and the United States ( n = 1756). We examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more normatively charged goals—like fairness and aspirational imaginaries—receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S. responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences."

Over two experiments, this research tests the role official government and elite sources play in message credibility judgments when compared to other, nongovernment and nonelite sources. Results suggest that messages attributed to elite and government sources are perceived as more credible and higher in information adequacy than other commonly cited sources used in news. Additionally, this research finds that information attributed to social media is perceived as less credible and lower in value. The results have implications for sourcing practices of journalists, suggesting that use of nonelite sources in news might lower people’s perceptions of the information."

While spatial models emphasise external factors driving party behaviour, less attention has been given to internal party choices. This article innovates by proposing that parties differentiate between and make distinct strategical decisions regarding their ideological core and peripheral policy areas. We argue that parties maintain continuity in their ideological core while exhibiting greater flexibility in modifying their periphery. Using the Manifesto Project Corpus and an XLM-RoBERTa-based language model, we analyse manifesto sections to distinguish core from peripheral segments. Our findings show that parties take clearer stances in their ideological core while adapting their periphery more flexibly, with niche parties displaying this pattern more strongly than mainstream parties. Electoral setbacks lead parties to adopt more extreme peripheries, while cores remain stable. These results highlight the strategic importance of the core–periphery distinction in party communication and suggest that studies of party competition should consider where policy shifts occur within parties’ electoral programmes."

We examine the effect of attacks placed in campaign leaflets on a candidate’s personal traits and policy positions in Great Britain. Unlike prior studies, our treatments are contrast ads and not purely negative ads. While the inclusion of positive messaging from the sponsor could increase voters’ parasocial relationship with the candidate, shielding them from backlash, the results from our experiment suggest that British voters view attacks on personal traits as too negative and lower their evaluation of the sponsor as a result."

We separate governmentalist-populist contestation from contestation between government and opposition, solving a longstanding theoretical and empirical problem. Analyzing one million tweets by politicians and their audiences, we fine-tune and employ supervised machine learning (transformer models) to classify populist and governmentalist communication. We find that populist tweets appeal more to anger and more to fear than governmentalist tweets.

However, due to their computational demands, cost, and often proprietary nature, these models are frequently at odds with open science standards. This article introduces the Political Domain Enhanced BERT-based Algorithm for Textual Entailment (DEBATE) language models: Foundation models for zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised classification of political documents. As zero-shot classifiers, the models are designed to be used for common, well-defined tasks, such as topic and opinion classification. When used in this context, the DEBATE models are not only as good as state-of-the-art LLMs at zero-shot classification, but are orders of magnitude more efficient and completely open source. We further demonstrate that the models are effective few-shot learners. With a simple random sample of 10–25 documents, they can outperform supervised classifiers trained on hundreds or thousands of documents and state-of-the-art generative models. Additionally, we release the PolNLI dataset used to train these models—a corpus of over 200,000 political documents with highly accurate labels across over 800 classification tasks."

Previous research on the design of such questions found that providing multiple small answer boxes yields more and richer answers than providing one larger answer box. Using a series of classifiers based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers language model, we empirically study how this design choice affects the classification of such answers. We design a 2 × 2 factorial experiment: (i) analysis with a multi-label versus single-label classifier and (ii) answers obtained from one larger answer box versus multiple smaller answer boxes. We find that the multi-label classifier gives more accurate results than the single-label classifier (1 percent versus 9 percent misclassification of individual labels), regardless of how the answers were obtained. Surprisingly, analysis with a multi-label classifier is preferable. We attribute this success to the classifier’s ability to use label correlations. We conclude that list-style open-ended questions should continue to provide multiple answer boxes due to better data quality. However, answer boxes should be concatenated for analysis to improve classification performance."

    "abstract": "Longitudinal studies with time-varying treatments or exposures make it hard to figure out “what effect” is being estimated. Drawing on causal inference, we clarify this by distinguishing between total, direct, and—centrally—joint effects, defined within the potential-outcomes framework and illustrated with directed acyclic graphs. Joint effects extend average treatment effects to repeated interventions, providing a practical measure of combined intervention effects over time. Using a worked example on smartphone use and sleep quality, we demonstrate how different estimands answer different questions, why single total effects can sometimes mislead in longitudinal settings, and how joint effects capture strategy-level consequences across time. A key practical takeaway is that joint effects can be estimated in both experimental and observational studies. In the latter, it typically suffices to adjust only for variables that govern treatment decisions at each time point rather than modeling the entire causal system. Building on this, we propose covariate-driven treatment assignment (information-restriction designs in which decisions depend only on observed covariates) as a practical route to causal inference in nonexperimental psychology, and we connect these designs to estimation via g-methods from epidemiology. We provide open materials, including R code, to support adoption."

    "abstract": "Naturalistic scenes are of key interest for visual perception, but controlling their perceptual and semantic properties is challenging. Previous work on naturalistic scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences between stimuli. However, it is often desirable to assess representations of naturalistic images that vary along a continuum. Traditionally, perceptually continuous variations of naturalistic stimuli have been obtained by morphing a source image into a target image. This produces transitions driven mainly by low-level physical features and can result in semantically ambiguous outcomes. More recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate continuous perceptual variations within a stimulus category. Here, we extend and generalize this approach using a different machine learning approach, a text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL), to generate a freely customizable stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions, with each image representing a unique exemplar within a prompted category. We demonstrate the approach by generating a set of 108 object scenes from six categories. For each object scene, we generate ten variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. This ordering was first estimated using a machine learning model of perceptual similarity (LPIPS) and then subsequently validated with a large online sample of human participants. In a subsequent experiment, we show that this ordering is also predictive of stimulus confusability in a working memory task. Our image set is suited for studies investigating the graded encoding of naturalistic stimuli in visual perception, attention, and memory."

    "abstract": "We present an item response model for ordinal public opinion data to understand individual-level variation in attitudes as a function of covariates. The approach allows investigating how individuals (or population subgroups) differ in substantive stances and attitude strength. It is a two-dimensional partial credit model that incorporates covariates linked to attitude direction and strength into the basic model. We exemplify the types of substantive insights into heterogeneity that can be obtained from the approach but not from existing models with two applications: attitudes toward gender equality (European Values Study) and the evaluation of presidential candidates (American National Election Study)."

    "abstract": "Large-scale, centrally funded measurement systems on the economy, education, the environment, and public health enable rapid scientific research and support robust policy feedback. They provide frameworks for assessing policy effectiveness, flagging emerging problems, and informing planning processes. The online information environment—a critical domain of human interaction—has not yet been similarly instrumented. This article first reviews key measurements in other domains and outlines why existing tools for studying online environments are insufficient. It then lays out the consequences of the measurement gap, identifies key data-collection tasks, discusses the scale of resources required to meet them, and addresses the implications of generative AI for the instrumentation task. I argue that modest but strategic investments in scaled measurement infrastructure could unlock transformative research capabilities and facilitate an evidence-driven approach to policymaking that could improve how we govern online spaces."

    "abstract": "Social media data have become a mainstay of social science research since the first application programming interfaces (APIs) debuted in the mid-2000s. Over time, platforms have radically altered their data offerings, substantially determining the kinds of research that can be conducted. This article presents historical and normative analyses of the current state of platform data precarity, defined by Freelon (2018) as the post-API age . We recount a periodized history of social media data access spanning nearly 20 years, characterize the data access options currently offered by six prominent platforms, and make recommendations for improving platform data access. Our primary aim is to help social media researchers understand how access to social media data has evolved over the years and consider how platforms might help them conduct more rigorous research moving forward."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) could enhance the accuracy of automated content moderation by integrating contextual information. This study examines how MLLMs evaluate hate speech through a series of conjoint experiments. Models are provided with a hate speech policy and shown simulated social media posts that systematically vary in slur usage, user demographics and other attributes. The decisions from MLLMs are benchmarked against judgements by human participants (n = 1,854). The results demonstrate that larger, more advanced models can make context-sensitive evaluations that are closely aligned with human judgement. However, pervasive demographic and lexical biases remain, particularly among smaller models. Further analyses show that context sensitivity can be amplified via prompting but not eliminated, and that some models are especially responsive to visual identity cues. These findings highlight the benefits and risks of using MLLMs for content moderation and demonstrate the utility of conjoint experiments for auditing artificial intelligence in complex, context-dependent applications."

    "abstract": "Online political discussions are often dominated by a small group of active users, while most remain silent. This visibility gap can distort perceptions of public opinion and fuel polarization. Using a collective field experiment on Reddit, we examined factors predicting self-selection into silent “lurker” and active “power-user” roles and tested whether participation differentials can be reduced with norm- or incentive-based interventions. We recruited 520 United States participants, randomly assigned them to conditions in six private communities, and asked them to discuss 20 political issues over 4 weeks while completing weekly surveys. Lurking (posting nothing) was most common among users who perceived discussions as toxic, disrespectful, or unconstructive; these same perceptions also predicted power usership (more posting, conditional on not lurking). Experimentally, financial incentives for commenting reduced participation differentials, whereas we did not find effects from a civility norm treatment. These findings support preference- and incentive-based accounts of participation but suggest that light-touch interventions are unlikely to bridge participation gaps, let alone polarization."
