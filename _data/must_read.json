    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of social media and communication apps among early adolescents, little is known about which psychological variables affect their comprehension of emojis, i.e., pictograms delivering emotional cues in digital messages. To fill this gap, the present study explores the role of Theory of Mind (ToM) in emoji comprehension at the boundary condition of low vs high Social Media Use (SMU), in a sample of 303 Italian early adolescents (134 females) aged between 10 and 14 years old. Participants completed an SMU scale, two ToM measures, namely the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test and Real/apparent Emotions task, and an emoji comprehension task. Results showed that both ToM measures positively predicted emoji comprehension. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the Real/apparent Emotions task and SMU, with stronger relationships between ToM and emoji comprehension for low SMU. Separate analyses with easy- and difficult-to-classify emojis as dependent variables showed the same interaction effect only on easy emojis, while we found no significant interaction effect on difficult emojis. Taken together, these results suggest that youngsters less familiar with social media rely on ToM to encode and decode emojis and interpret digital messages. Conversely, the more they use social media, the more automated this task becomes. In this sense, ToM training could be relevant to promote preparatory skills among early adolescents starting to approach digital communication."

    "abstract": "Purpose The pervasive spread of commercial misinformation on social media poses significant risks to businesses and brands, with potentially devastating consequences for their reputation and financial stability. Given its unique nature and far-reaching impact, it is imperative to investigate and develop effective strategies to counteract this growing threat. Based on inoculation theory, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms and long-term effects of different inoculation strategies in the context of commercial misinformation. Design/methodology/approach A randomized controlled trial and follow-up experiment were conducted with 569 valid participants over 2 waves in a 6-week longitudinal study. Hypotheses were tested using one-way ANOVA, post-hoc analysis and regression analysis. Findings Data analysis indicates that inoculation can effectively enhance individuals' resistance to misinformation. Affective inoculation, compared to cognitive inoculation, more significantly strengthens individuals' threat perceptions of misinformation, subsequently reducing the perceived credibility of misinformation upon exposure. In this process, individuals' self-efficacy in identifying misinformation plays a moderating role, reinforcing the negative impact of perceived threat on the credibility of misinformation. The resistance effect of inoculation against misinformation persists for more than six weeks. However, there is no significant difference between the long-term effects of affective and cognitive inoculation, nor is there a significant relationship between the frequency of inoculation and its long-term effectiveness. Research limitations/implications The study offers practical insights for governments, platforms, organizations and individuals in the preemptive intervention against misinformation. Originality/value This research significantly advances the field of misinformation governance by extending its application scenarios, expanding the theoretical landscape of inoculation studies and providing valuable insights into both immediate and enduring effects of psychological inoculation strategies."

Drawing on multiple disciplines and prior work from communication and social psychology, an interactionist perspective is reviewed and applied to computational settings to demonstrate how individual, interpersonal, social, and situational factors afford or constrain verbal behavior. Using examples of language complexity and processing fluency research, this paper demonstrates how contextual factors like instrumental goal activation can reverse seemingly established relationships between simple language features and behavioral outcomes. The paper concludes by advocating for methodological approaches that systematically integrate contextual variables into natural language processing research, enabling scholars to resolve contradictory findings, enhance replicability, and develop a more nuanced understanding of how language reveals psychological processes."

We propose that differences in emotional regulation strategies explain, at least partly, these varied responses to negative news. In a preregistered, longitudinal intensive diary study (7 days) with a diverse, predominantly Western European sample ( N = 120), we examine to what extent emotion regulation strategies are associated with negative affect, mental well-being, and news use frequency. Our findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal and selective attention effectively down-regulate negative emotions arising from news use. However, distraction and suppression showed no statistically significant effects on affect, well-being, or news consumption. This study provides initial evidence that emotion regulation strategies help explain individual differences in responses to negative news and lays the groundwork for a research agenda in communication science exploring the role of emotion regulation in media effects."

Existing research suggests that using GenAI may be regarded as inappropriate or undesirable in certain interpersonal contexts, but acceptable in others. Yet, few studies have articulated the reasons underlying such context-dependent preferences. Taking a functional approach, we conducted an online survey ( N = 542) to explore how GenAI use might depend on an individual’s goals in interpersonal communication and to unravel the reasons why an individual may or may not use GenAI in specific contexts. Among the participants who had used GenAI in their interpersonal communication with others ( n = 240), we found that GenAI was most often used for goals of information and resource exchange. When message production for a goal requires more of one’s subjective experience (e.g., providing emotional support, showing others who you are), individuals are less likely to use GenAI in such contexts. Other contextual factors, including whether message production for a goal is difficult and whether it requires objectivity or human knowledge, were not found to predict GenAI use. These findings contribute to the theories and research in human–AI interaction and message production, while also informing the future design of human-centered AI."

    "abstract": "The erosion of public trust in health information and government communication, particularly during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, highlights a critical challenge in how health policies are transmitted and received. This study examines the dramatic shift in public sentiment toward Covid-19 vaccination in South Africa during 2021, a period that saw a decline from initial high acceptance to significant hesitancy. We argue that a process of social media selection allowed extreme views to proliferate as official sources retreated. Our findings suggest that sustained or increased mainstream media engagement, particularly from official sources like government and health authorities, could have mitigated the dominance of anti-vaccine narratives and have crucial implications for government communication and public health policies in the digital age. We collected and classified 482,450 original tweets about vaccination. We show that, by the end of 2021, Twitter activity was characterized by a progressive surge in anti-vaccination tweets and a decline in pro-vaccination and factual information, particularly from mainstream media. This shift mirrors the decrease in actual vaccination rates. Employing agent-based modeling, we simulated counterfactual scenarios to assess the impact of media presence on vaccine discourse. The results indicate that sustained or increased media engagement could have mitigated the dominance of anti-vaccine narratives. Conversely, a simulated media downturn led to a steeper decline in pro-vaccination content. The findings suggest that mainstream news media play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of and support for health policies and that their disengagement creates an informational void exploited by misinformation."

This study investigates how anti-EU rhetoric was employed on Facebook by political actors in the Visegrád countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) during the 2024 European Parliament elections and how it relates to the populist style of communication. Drawing on a comparative content analysis of more than 6,000 posts, the study examines how messages that negatively target the EU incorporate elements of populist rhetoric and emotional tools, such as fear speech and patriotic symbols. The findings show that populist actors were the most frequent users of anti-EU messaging, with anti-elitist framing as the strongest and most consistent rhetorical strategy, often accompanied by other emotional tools. Despite political differences, anti-EU campaigning showed consistent regional patterns. This article contributes to research on political communication by offering a regional comparison, incorporating visual analysis, and challenging the idea that negative messaging is a reliable strategy for mobilising audiences online."

In this study, we attempt to provide a broad systemic analysis of fandom, using a survey of 4874 fans who use the fan fiction posting site, Archive of Our Own. Through our analysis, we examine the interplay of fan identity with their practices: what type of romantic content fans prefer and which platforms fans prefer to use. We find that both romantic content and platform preference are shaped by fans’ identities, which provides important insights into broad patterns of how identity impacts behavior among fan fiction writers and readers across fandoms."

However, despite the ability of new communication technologies to facilitate a change in perceived time via virtual time travel, there is scant empirical work testing the predictors and psychological and persuasive outcomes of temporal presence. To fill this gap, this study employed a single-factor experiment using an augmented reality (AR) filter with two conditions (virtual time travel with AR [ n = 63] vs without AR [ n = 77]) in the context of anti-aging sunscreen advertising. Results showed that temporal presence can be evoked by virtual time travel using AR through perceived interactivity and vividness. Temporal presence subsequently increased positive attitude toward the ad and brand, as well as purchase intentions through different psychological factors."

Regarding reporting on climate change mitigation, however, the question takes on new relevance. In that context, is balanced reporting still appropriate or being replaced due to a greater demand for evidence-based reporting? Is journalism responsible for taking a stance, politically mobilizing its audiences, and reporting activist? Can neutral dissemination and activist journalism even be expected to occur simultaneously? To answer those questions, we surveyed 2,577 German citizens and 391 political journalists regarding their expectations/role orientations and evaluations of balance, weight of evidence (WoE), and activist journalism in reporting on climate change mitigation. The results show that citizens expect balanced, evidence-based reporting on climate change mitigation. Journalists also see it as their role to report balanced and evidence-based in this context, even despite the risk of false balance. Meanwhile, though citizens tend to expect activist journalism, journalists reject it as part of their role. Moreover, our results show that WoE and activist journalism are not mutually exclusive but are expected to occur simultaneously. Last, citizens and journalists who favor stricter climate measures generally expect activist journalism in reporting on climate change mitigation."

    "abstract": "Prior research suggests that individuals not only prefer negative news over positive (negativity bias in news selection) but also favor information that aligns with their existing beliefs (confirmation bias). A likely consequence of these tendencies is that people will, on average, form beliefs that are biased toward perceiving reality as more negative, and that these dynamics will be mutually reinforcing over time. This study presents a preregistered longitudinal choice experiment designed to examine these dynamics in relation to negative and positive emphasis framing of news stories about Swedish schools. Contrary to the hypothesis of a general negativity bias in news selection, the results indicate a higher preference for positive news. However, the results support the expectation of a confirmation bias, as people with more negative (positive) beliefs were more like to choose negative (positive) news. Moreover, exposure to both positive and negative news led to more positive beliefs over time, suggesting that information effects were more influential than framing effects. Together, these findings challenge central claims within the literature on biases in news selection and their subsequent influence on societal beliefs."

While numerous experiments find that partisans adopt the stances of their leaders, these findings may not generalize easily to the context of real news, which often contains richer policy information and more subtle, ambiguous party cues than the artificial stimuli commonly employed. To investigate the impact of party cues as they naturally appear in news coverage—what I term real‐news party cues —I develop a new experimental paradigm. I first sample 70 articles covering political proposals from a large pool of real news and prepare two versions of each: one with and one without these cues. These articles then serve as stimuli in survey experiments among representative samples of Americans ( n  = 12,177). I find that real‐news party cues have mostly modest effects on policy opinions."

This study investigates how political memes on TikTok affected the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Using a mixed-methods design, we combined expert evaluations of meme content ( N = 121) and a survey experiment ( N = 240) to assess the roles of humor level, knowledge quality, and candidate focus in affecting political outcomes. Structural equation modeling revealed that humor level significantly increased political engagement intention but had a negative direct effect on attitude change, while knowledge quality directly promoted attitude change. We also found that political cynicism moderated these effects: among cynical individuals, highly humorous memes more strongly boosted political engagement intention. Polarization analysis highlights that in-party memes reinforce existing beliefs, and Trump-focused or high knowledge quality content sways independent audiences. This study explores the complex dynamics of video-based memes, contributing to the understanding of digital media’s role in political processes."

    "abstract": "Many networks in political and social research are bipartite, connecting two distinct node types. A common example is cosponsorship networks, where legislators are linked through the bills they support. However, most bipartite network analyses in political science rely on statistical models fitted to a “projected” unipartite network. This approach can lead to aggregation bias and an artificially high degree of clustering, invalidating the study of group roles in network formation. To address these issues, we develop a statistical model of bipartite networks theorized to arise from group interactions, extending the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. Our model identifies groups within each node type that exhibit common edge formation patterns and incorporates node and dyad-level covariates as predictors of group membership and observed dyadic relations. We derive an efficient computational algorithm to fit the model and apply it to cosponsorship data from the United States Senate. We show that senators who were perfectly split along party lines remained productive and pass major legislation by forming non-partisan, power-brokering coalitions that found common ground through low-stakes bills. We also find evidence of reciprocity norms and policy expertise impacting cosponsorships. An open-source software package is available for researchers to replicate these insights."

We search for evidence of SDB in measures of democratic attitudes in three studies. The first two leverage variations in survey mode (self-completion vs. face-to-face) in the European Social Survey’s Democracy module, drawing on evidence that interviewer absence encourages voicing socially undesirable opinions. The third uses a double-list experiment to estimate the prevalence of an anti-democratic attitude. Using data from as many as 24 European countries, we find no evidence that SDB inflates survey measures of democratic attitudes. These results contribute to our understanding of democratic attitudes and to methodological toolkit for interested scholars."

    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines 1 , it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour 2 . This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems 3,4 . Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models 5 . Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them."

    "abstract": "Social media platforms have become vital channels for businesses to reach consumers through advertising. But in the United States, the digital advertising market in which these platforms operate is dominated by a few major players, raising concerns for antitrust regulators. In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%. Shifts in demand were three times greater for larger advertisers relative to smaller ones, suggesting that Meta platforms and TikTok are closer substitutes for larger firms and that a TikTok ban would therefore impose greater challenges on smaller businesses."
