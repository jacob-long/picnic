    "abstract": "Social media activities do not occur in isolation, and it is possible that the well-being effects of an initial activity modify the effects of a subsequent one. This article examines this possibility by focusing on a specific, theoretically grounded sequence of social media activities: engaging with one’s own profile self-presentation (i.e., a self-affirmational activity) followed by browsing a superior peer’s profile (i.e., an activity eliciting upward social comparison). Two pre-registered experiments were conducted. Study 1 confirmed that both reviewing and crafting one’s own Instagram self-presentation provided self-affirmational benefits, reducing participants’ defensiveness and inducing positive affect. Study 2 showed that becoming self-affirmed by engaging with one’s own Instagram self-presentation diminished feelings of envy resulting from browsing a superior peer’s self-presentation. By conceptualizing and empirically testing the interdependence of social media activities, this research offers a framework for examining how sequences of social media activities jointly shape users’ psychological experiences."

    "abstract": "Abstract: The present study explores how moral and threat language in news media influences public opinion within the context of the US–China relationship. Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory, I employed a computational approach combining the dictionary method with Large Language Models to identify moral and threat language in coverage of China by six major US news outlets from 2005 to 2022. I then analyzed the relationship between distinct types of moral and threat language and longitudinal polling data on Americans’ attitudes toward China. The results reveal a unified pattern: both liberal- and conservative-leaning outlets employed more binding than individualizing moral language, and emphasized realistic threats over symbolic threats when covering China. However, it is symbolic threat language that more strongly correlates with negative attitudes toward China. Furthermore, realistic threat language only predicted negative attitudes when accompanied by sufficient levels of moral language, with this relationship intensifying as moral language increased. The findings offer insights into the moral and threat dimensions of foreign news and public opinion towards foreign countries, highlighting a critical and complex interplay between these elements in a global context."

    "abstract": "Nomophobia, characterized by anxiety when out of mobile phone contact, has emerged as a pervasive issue in this digital age, with negative consequences across various domains. Prior studies have been limited by reliance on cross-sectional designs that restrict causal inference and by insufficient exploration of the mechanisms linking nomophobia to developmental outcomes. This study addressed these gaps by employing longitudinal research designs to explore the effect of nomophobia on academic achievement and mental health, with a particular focus on the mediating effects of the I-self (e.g., self-control) and the Me-self (e.g., self-esteem). A sample of 499 secondary students completed the Nomophobia Questionnaire, Self-Control Scale, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale across three waves over 18 months. Structural equation modeling showed that after controlling for baseline levels, nomophobia negatively predicted self-control six months later, which in turn significantly predicted academic achievement another six months later. Similarly, nomophobia predicted subsequent self-esteem, which in turn predicted subsequent mental health. These findings provide longitudinal evidence of the detrimental effects of nomophobia and highlight the importance of the self-system processes. Altogether, this study underscores the need for interventions aimed at reducing nomophobia symptoms and strengthening self-system processes to support adolescents’ psychological development."

    "abstract": "What news spreads on social media equally depends on what news users do and do not share. However, prior research has predominantly focused on successful news sharing , overlooking the equally consequential behavior of deliberate news withholding. This study addresses that gap by proposing a self-presentation model of deliberate news withholding on social media, integrating three dominant approaches previously used to examine successful news sharing: (1) the informational approach focusing on the virality of news content, (2) the structural approach emphasizing social media network characteristics, and (3) the relational approach centered on users’ self-presentation and management of relationships with their audience. Specifically, this study combines two types of data: (1) survey data from 408 users and (2) a text analysis of news content they withheld in their three most active chatrooms. We examine how users selectively withhold news with varying levels of emotionality, argumentativeness, and hard or soft news value, depending on the characteristics of their audience networks – particularly network size and tie strength – and in relation to three self-presentational goals: self-construction, privacy protection, and audience-pleasing. Findings show that users strategically withhold varied types of news content across different user-audience networks to meet distinct self-presentational goals, thereby managing audience expectations and curating their online image. By shifting attention from news sharing to news withholding, this study offers a more complete account of how everyday users shape news flows and social discourse on social media."

This study examined anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate posts on X.com and the verbal replies, Likes, and reposts they acquired over the following month. It tests a theory explaining the propagation of hate messages in social media based on the social approval posters garner from other users. The analysis involved replies to 6388 anti-Muslim or anti-Jewish hate posts in terms of their semantic convergence or divergence with the content of original posts. No differences between patterns of anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim discourse arose. Convergent replies to one’s hate posts led individuals to post more hatefully in their next post, and more quickly. Likes also accelerated hate posting, while reposts decelerated them. Divergent replies led to less hateful and slower subsequent hate postings. Conclusions address implications for the social approval theory of online hate, and the relative influence of verbal replies due to their costliness."

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of climate news in shaping public engagement, little is known about how different types of media – mainstream and non-mainstream – relate to pro-climate behaviour, and what psychological processes condition these effects, particularly in cross-national contexts. This study addresses that gap by examining the emotional and evaluative mechanisms linking climate news use to pro-climate behavioural intentions (e.g., using less energy at home, flying less often, and repairing rather than replacing), and how these relationships vary across countries. Drawing on online survey data from 8,541 respondents across eight countries – Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and the United States – we test a multi-group structural equation model with climate anxiety as a mediator and media trust as a moderator. Results show that mainstream news use is consistently associated with stronger behavioural intent across all countries. Non-mainstream media use has positive but more context-dependent effects, especially in settings where digital platforms dominate climate information. Climate anxiety emerges as a robust and universal predictor of behavioural intention, though it is not consistently shaped by media use – indicating that emotional responses may stem from sources beyond the news. Media trust amplifies the direct effects of mainstream news use but does not moderate the indirect pathway via anxiety. Overall, the findings reveal a surprising degree of cross-national consistency in how news use, media trust, and emotional responses shape climate engagement."

The replication reinforces the conclusions of the original study: we found that higher news consumption predicted greater surveillance knowledge acquisition across the waves, as well as greater awareness of and belief in true news stories. News consumption also increased awareness of false news stories without increasing belief in false news stories. These findings strengthen the idea that news helps people become more informed and better at discerning truth from falsehoods."

We argue that undemocratic behavior affects perceived dominance, which citizens value in times of conflict. We fielded two conjoint experiments and a factorial vignette experiment in the United States to test this two-step argument. First, our conjoint experiments demonstrate a robust and strong relationship between undemocratic candidate behavior and dominance impressions. Second, our vignette experiment – manipulating undemocratic behavior by in-party presidential candidates and priming threats of conflict with China and Russia – shows that undemocratic candidates are evaluated more positively under conflict compared to peace. This is especially the case among Republican voters, although the pattern is also evident among Democrats and Independents. Our letter sheds light on the consequences of the escalation of wars with relevance to the United States around the globe, pointing to toleration of undemocratic behavior specifically."

In the US, legitimating rituals are most commonly observed when watching televised team sports. Using a pre-post panel study of the 2020 election, as well as an experimental design manipulating exposure to legitimating rituals in both sports and politics, I test the theory that exposure to legitimizing rituals of either kind increases perceptions that an election outcome was legitimate."

Researchers therefore have become increasingly interested in better understanding the factors that promote or hamper political exchange. The present research contributes to this goal by introducing WEDO, a new measure to assess the willingness to engage with differently minded others based on behavioral preferences in hypothetical scenarios. This measure integrates the advantages of topic‐specific assessment, fine‐grained response, and economical administration. Across four studies ( N = 1215) conducted in diverse sociopolitical contexts, we examine WEDO's associations with conceptually related variables. Our findings indicate that WEDO is linked to various individual characteristics (e.g., analytic thinking, intellectual humility) and further predicts behavior in a selective exposure task. Overall, WEDO offers a nuanced tool for understanding how personal characteristics, situational factors, and sociopolitical contexts influence individuals' openness to political discourse."

A comprehensive analysis of FCQs to enhance survey and question design is often impeded by high item nonresponse and low answer quality in the form of short and uninterpretable answers. In this article, we therefore investigate what respondent and FCQ characteristics influence the provision and quality of answers to FCQs. For this purpose, we conducted two web survey studies in two German online panels. The first study (N = 874) experimentally varied the visual design of the FCQ (“one multi-line answer box” vs. “ten single-line answer boxes”). The second study (N = 1,001) experimentally varied the answer format of the FCQ (“request for a text answer” vs. “request for a voice answer”). The results reveal that answer provision is influenced by respondent characteristics (e.g. age and survey interest), while answer quality is mostly influenced by FCQ characteristics (e.g. request for a voice answer). Overall, this article provides both survey researchers and practitioners with empirically informed FCQ design recommendations to improve the quality of future web surveys."

    "abstract": "Social Desirability Bias (SDB), providing a favorable image of oneself in self-reports, is a persistent problem in survey research on sensitive topics. However, face-saving approaches appear promising in discouraging SDB. Specifically, face-saving survey item formulations aim to reduce the threat of judgment for norm-violations, thereby fostering a safer context for self-disclosure. This experimental study examined the use of face-saving to elicit more truthful responses to yes/no questions using a quota sample representative of the Dutch population. We included face-saving preambles that excused for or normalized sensitive behaviors (e.g., “It can easily happen that the limit for legal driving is exceeded when consuming alcohol”). We also included face-saving response options using degrees of truth (“occasionally”) or justifications for norm transgressions (e.g., “only when there was no other option”). There were three objectives. First, the design included a replication of a face-saving study regarding COVID-19, where we assessed the efficacy of a condition that combined a face-saving preamble with face-saving answer options (N = 303) against a control condition without any face-saving elements (N = 284). Second, we extended the replication’s design by including conditions to measure the effects of offering face-saving preambles (N = 281) and offering face-saving answer options in isolation (N = 283). Third, we investigated the effectiveness of face-saving using novel operationalizations on additional topics, including sustainability and responsible driving. The replication confirmed the effectiveness of the combined face-saving strategy. The extension that included all conditions (Ntotal = 1,151) revealed that offering face-saving answer options reduced SDB significantly, up to 23 percent. There was no main effect of including a preamble, nor was there an interaction effect of the two manipulations. These findings highlight the critical role that face-saving response options might play in improving the accuracy of self-reported data, while calling into question the usefulness of including face-saving preambles."

Using a conjoint experiment, I investigate how the progressivity of social programs’ distributional outcomes and tax sources impacts Americans’ social policy support. I find differences and similarities in the effects of progressive social policy designs on different ideological subgroups. Compared to conservatives, liberals are more supportive of social programs having progressive distributional results or tax sources and less supportive of social policies featuring regressive distributional consequences or tax sources. However, both liberals and conservatives prefer progressive social programs over those with regressive designs. This study helps explain the public’s preferences for social policies with progressive designs."

Participants read abstracts with either a positive effect or a null effect. Beliefs about the effect of VVGs on aggression were measured before and after reading. Results in both studies (overall N = 1,576) showed that at low VVG exposure levels, participants in both conditions updated their beliefs to align with the research. However, at high VVG exposure levels, participants maintained their belief that VVGs do not increase aggression, and at very high VVG exposure levels, positive-effect studies led participants to believe the opposite: that VVGs reduce aggression. We interpret this pattern of response as suggesting a process of psychological distancing, whereby individuals defensively shift their beliefs away from threatening claims. These findings highlight the need to understand how scientific information is received and to develop strategies that prevent reinforcing misconceptions."

Yet most research studies a single platform—typically X/Twitter, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here, we shed light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: X/Twitter, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sample, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right-wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative news posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: Across all platforms examined, a given user’s lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement, even though higher-quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds when accounting for poster-level variation and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting that user preferences—not algorithmic bias—may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news."
