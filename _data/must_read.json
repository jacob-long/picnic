    "abstract": "With the recent development of debunking on social media as a dominant agenda, fact checkers have increasingly used machine learning (ML) to identify, verify and correct factual claims, as ML promises the scaling of fact checking practices. However, it also places a new actor in between the fact checkers and the fact checked users. In this paper, we conducted a contrasted analysis of how fact checkers and fact checked users understand, evaluate and act towards the algorithmic system and the data flows in Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program: We did ethnographic fieldwork in the fact checking newsroom and interviewed and did protocol analysis with the fact checked. For both professional users and end users, the algorithmic system is experienced as a black box in which they have limited insight, and their sense-making practices happen based on the data and metrics that are made visible to them. In the paper, we draw on and expanded theory on decoding algorithms by not only exploring how the two user groups engage in decoding the algorithmic system, but also actively engage in forms of recoding by attempting to adapt or modify the algorithmic system to better fit within their cultural and social context, which is characterised by both varying epistemic cultures and societal positions. While the fact checkers from their hegemonic (sometimes negotiated) position understand the program as a (sometimes stupid) tool and primarily engage in passive acts of recoding, fact checked users, from their oppositional position, understand the program as an unpredictable censoring machine and engage primarily in more active acts of recoding. Based on the analysis, we end the paper with a discussion in which we argued for understanding data reflexivity as highly relational and processual."

    "abstract": "Despite enjoying a series of advantages and privileges, including access to public funding and technical infrastructure, as well as a special regulatory framework allowing them to reach almost the entire population, public service media (PSM) have historically faced a number of challenges. These include opposition from privately held media and various political parties, mounting criticism from audiences, and incessant pressures from state authorities. Some have been more successful than others in defending themselves against these attacks. Some PSM institutions have gained a high level of trust as a result of their ability to maintain a balanced approach to political coverage. Some are recognised for the quality of their news content. However, some other organisations have lost credibility and audience share as a result of various pressures. The platformisation trend has had a particularly disruptive impact on public service media (PSM) organisations. The challenge of adapting to the new digital landscape has been significant, requiring careful navigation to maintain the core values that guide their operations, as defined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU): universality, independence, excellence, diversity, accountability and innovation. This article employs a recently developed framework for examining PSM and draws upon field research to analyse the transformation of PSM in response to platformisation-related pressures in four European countries: Austria, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom."

    "abstract": "The right to public life has been one of the most important achievements of modernity. It was a result of long and painful civil struggles for dignity in a democratic public sphere. While de jure we are all welcome in the public sphere, de facto rapid processes of fragmentation and numerous contexts of misinformation insulate the actual chances of meaningful contribution to public life. Platform users are aggressively approached as consumers of goods and services and continuously stimulated to produce large quantities of any content, just to feed the voracious platforms. The sobering truth is that many people on the private high-tech platforms do not act like true democrats, but like private individuals who pursue very personal aims. At the same time, a private person does not have a mandate to act in the public interest of the rest of the citizens. For these reasons, we turn to information as a public good and public responsibility in this special issue. It is about media as a public service that allows democracy to keep centre stage within a polity. When citizens interact with relevant public information, they build the capacity to control their political environment, to form informed opinions and act upon them. When this basic desideratum is not structurally at the core of society, one cannot even start to consider democracy as the first course of action for the generations to come. Information as a public good is not a thing of nature, but a purposeful action. We take this stance when we approach information as a public good, rather than some residual category of market failure. The scope of this special issue is to analyse and explore the resources and institutional settings that allow information to thrive as a public good in the European contemporary informational ecosystem."

Recent diverging strategic efforts from public service broadcasters in two European countries – Germany and Norway – serve as illustrations of how existing organizations attempt to manoeuvre the current online realm dominated by platforms. I discuss findings from qualitative studies of news use in Norway and draw on comparative survey data on news use. I propose that high levels of trust in public service media, and widespread use of the public service broadcaster's own sites and offers, are key prerequisites to consider when assessing the viability of a withdrawal from third-party platforms in different countries. By zooming in on one type of media organization (public service broadcasters), and looking at different such organizations’ characteristics and context, and the dynamics of their relations to online platforms, the paper contributes to our understanding of platform power."

    "abstract": "EU state aid rules are part of the EU’s competition policy, a form of soft law developed to nudge states away from public investments in many areas. Rules were used to impose that market competition holds a privileged position, and that enacting social, political, or economic benefits that might stifle competition requires a complicated legal and political negotiation process between the European Commission, Member States, and private companies. Nonetheless, many strategic projects or situations in recent years led to significant state aid. The Commission utilised a variety of means to encourage both private and public investments in EU based digital infrastructure that is critical for public media services and for unified European data space. Despite EU’s balancing act between the private and public interests, business interests are dangerously capturing the development in the media data space. To grasp the social and economic contribution of publicly financed productive activities, we approach public broadcasting systems as producers of public wealth of a peculiar kind whose activities and goals are defined by their public purpose, rather than the imperatives of capital and profitmaking. Unifying data spaces with too many design decisions conceded to capitalist production runs the risk of further neglecting social foundations of member states. We argue that the desired digital transformation would be more successful if it moved towards affirmative approaches to public services and public infrastructures, recognising the historical and contemporary contribution of the production of public wealth and public media in member states."

    "abstract": "Information as a public good is not a thing of nature, but a purposeful action. In my contribution, I explore an international association that got institutionalised around the idea of information as a public good by means of lucrative cooperation between public service broadcasters. It emerged after the Second World War, in a world where public services would become the norm rather than the exception, and has continued to a time when priorities switched fundamentally towards profit and liberalisation. The object of study is the European Broadcasting Union, the largest association of public service media providers in Europe and beyond, servicing more than one billion people as audiences via its members. In order to understand whether EBU's institutional practices still prioritise information as a public good or have moved towards a more neo-lib focus, I undertook an institutional analysis based on secondary data. The research shows that the combination of a neo-lib corporate layer with voluntary working groups from national PSMs makes EBU particularly successful; it looks like a new public management dream come true, except that EBU is not an accountable public organisation. Through the NGO structure, corporate management and voluntary work, it opens large avenues of cooperation for professionals to innovate together, at the end of the day enhancing information as a public good."

However, limited studies have examined how the affordances of social group system and social tagging system influence consumers’ social shopping behavior. The purpose of this study is to examine the formation of social shopping behavior in the social commerce platform. Design/methodology/approach Combining affordance theory with dual-congruity theory, we develop a model to examine how the affordances of social group system and social tagging system influence consumers’ social shopping behavior through the underlying self-congruity and functional-congruity processes. We empirically validate the research model using a multimethod approach, including an instrument development study and a field survey study. Findings Our empirical findings show that social support positively influences relational identity, while it has a nonsignificant effect on social identity. Social interactivity positively influences relational identity and social identity. Furthermore, social tagging quality and social endorser credibility positively affect perceived diagnosticity and perceived serendipity. Finally, relational identity, social identity, perceived diagnosticity and perceived serendipity collectively determine consumers’ social shopping intention. Originality/value This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of social shopping in social commerce and offers practical implications for designing an effective social group system and social tagging system to boost product sales."

    "abstract": "Purpose Social networking services (SNS) empower users with a robust capability to connect with others and manage their social relationships. However, as the size of users’ social networks increases, coupled with the inherent boundary-spanning technical features of SNS, users are faced with unprecedented role stresses. This, in turn, leads to maladaptive lurking decisions. This study delves into the mechanism of this technology-induced decision-making process among SNS users. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected from 491 Chinese WeChat Moment users. The model and hypotheses testing were conducted using SmartPLS 4.0. Findings Our findings indicate that both social network size and boundary spanning have a positive influence on role conflict and role overload. Both role conflict and role overload significantly contribute to SNS fatigue, which further intensifies users’ lurking intention. Furthermore, SNS fatigue fully mediated the relationship between role conflict and lurking intention, and partially mediated the relationship between role overload and lurking intention. Originality/value Our study offers a fresh viewpoint for comprehending lurking behaviors on SNS, furnishing practical insights for platform providers. Additionally, it paves the way for future research into the deeper mechanisms driving SNS lurking behaviors, by providing a novel construct (i.e. boundary spanning) to distinguish and measure the unique social environment of SNS."

An extensive review of the literature highlights a significant gap in empirical research regarding the adoption of MT and faculty adaptation when viewed through the lens of group dynamics. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an exploratory study conducted at two engineering universities in France. A qualitative method enabled a comprehensive examination of faculty members using multiple field-based observations and semi-directive interviews at both University A and University B. Findings While extant research tends to prioritize individual-level approaches, the integration of MT within higher education inherently involves social dynamics. Our results reveal that faculty’s perceived control and their initial perception over adoption of MT play an important role in shaping their adaptation behavior. The findings suggest that the adoption of MT among faculty members is influenced by various organizational factors. Specifically, the organizational logic of adoption affects their primary appraisal of MT, while group norms and social influence shape their adaptation acts. Furthermore, the organization’s continuous commitment to supporting faculty members also impacts their coping activities, ultimately influencing their overall adoption and utilization of MT. Originality/value This study builds upon the limited yet growing body of literature on a theme highly relevant for practitioners, scholars as well as MT users in a higher education environment. The paper extends the CMUA by exploring the relationship between MT adoption and continuous user adaptation at both group and organizational levels. Our proposed framework assists universities in articulating their MT adoption and implementation strategy in harmony with a clear vision of their users’ adaptation activities before, during and after the implementation."

Specifically, this research investigates how different AR characteristics (person–virtual environment (VE) interaction, novelty) impact reality congruence and immersion, which ultimately lead to satisfaction and WOM. Design/methodology/approach We tested the proposed model using a US consumer sample ( N  = 401) by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to reveal differences across the AR experiences regarding the mediating effects of immersion and reality congruence. Furthermore, we administered PLS-SEM multigroup analysis to identify differences for hedonic and utilitarian AR experiences. Findings This study provides important insights into the use of AR to create value-driven consumer experiences and outcome behaviors. Interacting with the virtual environment (VE) enhances immersion for hedonic AR experiences while it leads to higher levels of reality congruence for utilitarian AR experiences. While established relationships such as novelty to immersion continue to be significant, new constructs such as person–VE interaction and reality congruence immerge as stronger influences. Originality/value To date, most studies have implemented apps such as IKEA Place and have considered value as one comprehensive construct. However, limited research has examined differences in hedonic and utilitarian AR experiences. The current findings enhance the understanding of utilizing value-driven consumer experiences within the AR context to achieve desirable outcome behaviors."

Design/methodology/approach Following the CA model, this research introduces a theoretical framework that integrates the emotions of regret and guilt along with the principles of cognitive dissonance theory. The proposed theoretical framework was subjected to empirical validation, utilizing 453 responses gathered from Instagram users. Findings The results suggest that the emotions of regret and guilt have a favorable impact on users’ intention to decrease their SNS usage, with cognitive dissonance exerting an indirect positive influence through these emotions. Additionally, further examination unveils that fear moderates the connection between users’ SNS addiction and the CA components. Research limitations/implications Additional cognitive and affective responses may influence the intricate relation between SNS addiction and SNS use reduction intention. Originality/value This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the information system use lifecycle by examining shifts in user behavior, notably the transition from excessive use to the adoption of use reduction strategies. Furthermore, it sheds light on the intricate role of cognitive dissonance in elucidating the intention to reduce SNS use from the perspective of the CA model. Additionally, this study advances our current understanding of how the fear of negative consequences arising from excessive usage plays a role as a moderating factor in elucidating the underlying internal factors related to reducing SNS usage."

Design/methodology/approach Employing computational techniques, this research analyzed 10,145 protest-related threads from the HK Golden Forum, a prominent online discussion board in Hong Kong. Findings Our analysis revealed divergent effects of explicit and implicit incivility on their diffusion, influences on deliberative discussions, and user participation. Explicit incivility was found to impede deliberative conversations, while implicit incivility tended to provoke more responses. Explicit uncivil expressions encouraged the propagation of incivility but reduced the likelihood of individual involvement. In contrast, implicit incivility had a stronger dampening effect on further uncivil comments and achieved greater thread popularity. The results showed strong associations between uncivil expressions and the contextual norms surrounding social movements. Originality/value Theoretically, this research introduced a classification of incivility and underscored the importance of differentiating between implicit and explicit incivility by examining their effects on deliberation and engagement. Although previous studies have extensively covered explicit incivility, this study goes further by analyzing implicit incivility and comparing both forms of uncivil discourse in a less-studied context. Methodologically, the study developed a Cantonese dictionary to differentiate between two types of incivility, providing a practical reference for more nuanced analyses. By revealing how varying movement norms moderate the interplay between deliberative and uncivil expressions, the study drew attention to the highly situational nature of incivility."

We theorize that selective exposure, social influence, and the reinforcing spirals model offer three possible mechanisms that may underlie the association. These possibilities were studied using random intercept cross-lagged panel models and latent curve models on a four-wave panel data set (n = 3,540). For mainstream media, the results show an asymmetrical reinforcing spiral, in which the effect of mainstream media trust on use can be considered as one of yielding maintenance, while the impact of media use on mainstream media trust to a limited degree is in line with the notion of a spiral gradually (though inconsistently) increasing trust over time. We also find that use of right-wing alternative media consistently and sometimes robustly leads to decreasing mainstream media trust."

The study compares cooperative contact, where writers describe working with an outgroup character, with parasocial contact, where writers describe the character alone. It further examines whether the contact effects vary with linguistic authenticity. In two experiments, I manipulated the types of contact and measured authenticity through language patterns. Study 1 ( N = 719) found that having contact with an outgroup character elicited more positive affect toward the character, which reduced the desire for distance from the outgroup. Cooperative and parasocial contact showed similar effects, but their impacts varied with linguistic authenticity. Authentic language was associated with stronger impacts in cooperative contact but not in parasocial contact. Study 2 ( N = 287) replicated that linguistic authenticity moderated the effect of cooperative contact on affect toward the character. These findings highlight linguistic dynamics in intergroup contact."

    "abstract": "Literature suggests that when the image and text of news are congruent, it enhances news salience. However, when incongruent, people prioritize the viewpoint of the picture over the words. But what is congruency? This study experimentally investigates perceived image–text congruency in climate change online news, examining how newsreaders perceive and are influenced by congruency. It also explores the impacts of news format on perceptions of congruity, concerns about the climate crisis, and trust in the news outlet. Findings suggest congruency is partially subjective, highlighting that responsible visual discourse in the news may depend less on congruency than previously thought."

    "abstract": "Information overload in online environments leads individuals to be more likely to rely on heuristic cues to make decisions about (mis)information sharing. Drawing on dual-process models of information processing, namely the heuristic–systematic model and the elaboration likelihood model, we conducted a meta-analysis of 31 individual studies to examine the combined effects of five major heuristic cues on misinformation sharing. The results revealed that the affective heuristic of anxiety exerted the strongest impact on misinformation sharing ( r = .343), followed by three cognitive heuristics: the self-confirmation heuristic ( r = .249), endorsement heuristic ( r = .125), and fact-checking heuristic ( r = -.115)—but not the authority heuristic. The endorsement misinformation receives, consistency between misinformation and individuals’ prior attitudes or beliefs, anxiety people feel, and absence of fact-checking labels all make people more likely to share misinformation. Moderation analyses also highlight the importance of considering contextual and cultural factors in future research."

    "abstract": "Across Europe, Public Service Media (PSM) are increasingly subject to bias accusations in public debates. Excluding academic attention for actual bias in news content, research into the nature of bias accusations is limited. This article studies bias accusations against Dutch PSM in online discourse. Through a qualitative content analysis of tweets and blogs (2017–2022), our analysis develops a novel typology of bias accusations—positional, information, and framing bias—going beyond academic definitions. Bias accusations are diverse in nature, reflect strong perceived intentionality, and refer to heterogeneous social, political groups, yet are easily merged into singular political ideological divides."

    "abstract": "Popular entertainment remains one of the last places where Black history lives on despite the recent political erasure of U.S. Black struggles. The 2021 reboot of The Wonder Years, reframing Black masculinity through the young eyes of main character Dean Williams, rehistoricizes modern notions of Black families in the post-Civil Rights Movement. The purpose of this study is to explore Black masculinity media representations within reboot culture as a means to rehistoricize Black struggle and civil rights. Based on discourse analysis, the authors found the following three discourses: Reimagining Black Excellence, Recontextualizing Black Masculinity, and Revisiting Respectability Politics."
