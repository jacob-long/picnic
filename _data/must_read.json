    "abstract": "The emergence of authoritarian attitudes within contemporary democracy puzzles researchers. Under what circumstances do people develop authoritarian attitudes? Research suggests that circumstances of social disturbance have strong impact. There is evidence that predispositions for authoritarianism are activated under such circumstances. In this research, the role of the news media is generally ignored. This article contributes by presenting a theoretically grounded experimental study addressing hypotheses of news framing effects on authoritarian attitudes. Two panel experiments, on news about disturbance in school and public libraries, provide evidence of main effects of amplified framings of social disturbance, as well as an activation mechanism."

Findings revealed most of the characters featured were portrayed as White (68.3%) whereas BIPOC characters made up 31.7% of the total. Results suggest that BIPOC characters were significantly more likely to be featured in supporting character roles, with White characters featured in both the protagonist and antagonist roles. We further observed a limited integration of characters of varying races in a singular film."

However, when incongruent, people prioritize the viewpoint of the picture over the words. But what is congruency? This study experimentally investigates perceived image–text congruency in climate change online news, examining how newsreaders perceive and are influenced by congruency. It also explores the impacts of news format on perceptions of congruity, concerns about the climate crisis, and trust in the news outlet. Findings suggest congruency is partially subjective, highlighting that responsible visual discourse in the news may depend less on congruency than previously thought."

Through a qualitative content analysis of tweets and blogs (2017–2022), our analysis develops a novel typology of bias accusations—positional, information, and framing bias—going beyond academic definitions. Bias accusations are diverse in nature, reflect strong perceived intentionality, and refer to heterogeneous social, political groups, yet are easily merged into singular political ideological divides."

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Political microtargeting (PMT) is a popular campaign tool in elections worldwide. However, it is associated with democratic risks. Foremost, scholars and policymakers are concerned that citizens cannot cope with PMT and, thus, stand vulnerable to persuasion. To assess this risk, an in-depth understanding of how citizens make sense of and cope with PMT is required. However, empirical studies are scarce, partially inconclusive, and provide global rather than nuanced insights. This study contributes to this research by employing an innovative, qualitative gaze-cued retrospective think-aloud design to distinguish types of citizens who differ in their coping and, based on that, assess their vulnerability to persuasion via PMT (&lt;em&gt;N &lt;/em&gt;= 25). The results reveal similarities regarding conceptual persuasion knowledge activation (i.e., advertising and targeting awareness) but differences in attitudinal and behavioral coping, illustrated along five coping types. Only “the neutral observer” seems vulnerable to PMT. For “the partisan”, PMT might strengthen existing ties but backlash when employed by a non-preferred party. Other types seem less receptive to PMT (“the political nerd”, “the ad connoisseur”) and/or political advertising (“the avoider”). This study informs educators and policymakers about citizens’ coping mechanisms with PMT and their potential vulnerability, which may guide intervention and regulation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;"

By educating and empowering individuals, these organisations and their educational branches are identified as emerging components within MIL ecosystems, particularly focusing on engaging youth. Using qualitative research methods, our study analyses the activities of seven prominent fact-checking organisations and two university-affiliated projects across Spain, Catalonia, Poland, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Argentina, and Brazil. Thus, our study aims to understand why fact-checking organisations have become involved in MIL education and training for youth and what types of MIL, approaches, and subjects fact-checking organisations employ in their MIL education and training initiatives for this audience. Our findings reveal a shift in these organisations toward actively promoting MIL education through dedicated divisions and teams driven by mission-oriented action and peer collaboration. Various institutions and political and educational policies support or hinder this transformation. A significant issue observed is the limited availability of open-access materials and general opacity regarding their pedagogical approaches. Although these organisations have integrated educational components into their models, achieving financial sustainability remains challenging."

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Election campaigns during the pandemic showcased the increased use of costly digital campaigning by parties. While many studies focus on the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites (SNS) during elections, parties’ use of Google Ads remains widely opaque (exception Medina Serrano et al., 2020). This is surprising given the fact that parties do spend substantial amounts of their budget on Google Ads and Google reports on these spending and other details of the ads in its Transparency report (Fitzpatrick 2023). Based on the equalisation vs. normalisation thesis we identify party factors (size, age, government/opposition statutes and electoral strongholds) affecting parties use of this instrument to a different degree in their campaigns (Garcia Lupato &amp;amp; Meloni, 2023). This contribution intends to shed light on parties’ use of Google ads during the campaigns for the German Bundestag election 2021 relying on the official data provided via Googles Ad Library. It discusses both empirical work on the factors determine use of and conceptual work on the merit and perils of Google Ads in democratic elections and present exploratory findings of our deep dive into the archive of Google Ads.&lt;/p&gt;"

However, the advent of public ad libraries from Meta and Google provides an opportunity to measure the scope and variation in DDC practice in advertising across different types of sponsors and within sponsors across platforms. Using textual and audiovisual processing, we create a database of ads from the 2022 U.S. elections.  These data allow us to create an index that quantifies the extent of DDC at the level of the sponsor and platform.  This index takes into account both the number of unique creatives placed and the similarity across those creatives.  In addition, we explore the impact of sponsor resources, the office being sought, the competitiveness of the race, and the goal of the ad on the measure of DDC sophistication. Ultimately, our research establishes a measurement strategy for DDC that can be applied across ad sponsors, campaigns, parties and event countries.  Understanding the extent of DDC is vital for policy discussions surrounding the regulation of microtargeting and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "abstract": "Digital literacy is essential but doesn’t guarantee digital performance. Many researchers consider factors such as attitude, cultural environment, or institutional setting in their frameworks when researching digital literacy. Yet, their significance often gets lost in a catalog of required skills and knowledge. Here we develop a model outlining factors influencing university personnel’s digital performance across diverse tasks, and we discuss associated challenges. The model derives from literature and insights from 20 qualitative interviews with academic staff in teaching, research, or consulting roles. Results show that institutional settings and employee empowerment are pivotal in shaping openness to digital tools. Intentions fail due to resource constraints and lack of recognition, leading to limited experience with digital opportunities. Well-being significantly influences willingness to embrace digital resources amidst the balancing act of anticipating future efficiency against investing time and resources. Maintaining a team atmosphere often results in alignment with the least digitally competent. With appropriate conditions, time resources, and support, staff could efficiently utilize digital resources, even with only basic skills, which fosters the integration of all workforces. We argue for comprehensive assessments of university employees’ digital performances, considering context and holistic aspects beyond personal skills and knowledge. Our model encompasses digital literacy, openness to digital developments, digital culture, primary conditions, services/empowerment offerings, and mindfulness."

Recognizing a gap in understanding and empathy towards gender-queer communities, &lt;em&gt;Body of Mine&lt;/em&gt; employs an innovative full-body tracking solution to place users into the body of someone else, combined with first-person documentary interviews and interactive elements aimed at fostering a deeper connection and insight into the transgender experience. Initial feedback from users indicates a heightened awareness and emotional connection to the challenges faced by individuals with gender dysphoria, as well as an increase in self-body positivity, based on a study conducted in collaboration with the University of Tübingen’s Department of Psychology. This project underscores the power of immersive storytelling in fostering embodied understanding, while also acknowledging the ethical complexities and voyeuristic risks when sharing narratives from vulnerable communities, and explores innovative methods for tackling social issues through emerging technology. It concludes by contemplating the implications of immersive technologies for the concept of identity in a world that increasingly transcends the physical body, suggesting a future where the notion of self is not confined to physical form but is fluid, multifaceted, and continually redefined within boundless digital horizons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Research on data-driven campaigning has mostly focused on the strategies of central campaign teams. However, there is a lack of evidence explaining how parties and supporters use data-driven campaigning techniques to organise their social media campaigning. Do user engagement metrics influence the choice of campaign themes by encouraging political parties to concentrate their communication on issues that are most liked, commented on, and shared? Our study focuses on the use of Facebook by French political parties and their supporters during the 2022 presidential election campaign. We conducted a supervised content analysis based on machine learning to examine their Facebook posts (n = 17,060). We also conducted interviews with 26 page managers. Our results show that political parties did not address the political issues that generated the most user engagement, in particular because the engagement of followers is more likely to be stimulated by divisive issues. The parties' electoral communication is always organised at the intersection between their traditional issues, those that most distinguish them in the political landscape, and some divisive issues that emerged during the campaign. Finally, we argue that campaign strategies are not fundamentally changed by social media metrics. Rather, they differ significantly according to the status of the parties (governing VS opposition parties), which influences the way they manage their Facebook pages during the presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Much of the research on political microtargeting has focused on growing public concerns about its use in elections, fuelling calls for greater regulation or even an outright ban of the practice. We contend that a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes toward microtargeting is required before further regulatory measures are considered. Drawing on advertising psychology research, we argue that concern, and by corollary, acceptance of microtargeting will vary based on the type of personal data used. Specifically, we hypothesise that microtargeting that relies on observable or publicly accessible personal information will be more accepted by voters than that which uses unobserved and inferred traits. We test our expectations using comparative survey data from three countries - the US, Germany and Netherlands. Our hypotheses are broadly confirmed in each case, indicating that not all microtargeting is considered equally problematic, and what is of concern differs to a degree across countries. Our findings also challenge whether certain forms of ‘sensitive’ data should automatically be excluded from political microtargeting. We conclude by calling for a more contextualised debate about the benefits as well as costs of microtargeting prior to the expansion of current regulation.&lt;/p&gt;"

Our findings reveal that fact-checkers are often victims of online bullying and harassment and fear reprisal from governments. This pushes them to self-censor, avoiding working on sensitive topics, such as military issues in Mali. In addition, fact-checking organizations in both countries highlight the difficulty of accessing reliable sources. Consequently, they focus more on debunking viral social media content, thus effectively becoming content moderators who have turned away from the mission of holding leaders accountable, one of the primary functions of fact-checking. Regarding their role conception, fact-checkers in Ethiopia and Mali see themselves more as guides helping navigate the information disorder than “guardians of truth” or “truth keepers.”"

To do so, it relies upon interviews with party data staffers and textual analysis of news coverage to highlight the importance of the overlooked practices of data maintenance to answer questions about how the data-driven practices of parties versus campaigns differ, how parties are (and are not) covered, and what, in staffers views' contributes to such coverage. Ultimately, this research finds that parties are very under-covered in discussions of data-driven campaigning, and that the coverage that does exist conflates party and campaign actions and ignores key practices of maintenance work, which this work illuminates.  &lt;/p&gt;"

We are interested in understanding if and why political parties in Sweden adopt (or not) data-driven campaign methods, and the differences between them. Since this is a comparison of domestic parties, we test the importance of four party-level factors: resources, structure, attitudes toward data use and ideology using extensive interviews with key campaign managers in Sweden during the 2022 election year. Our results show that the differences among the eight parties studied are rather small, and that systemic factors are more important than party variables to explain the adoption of data-driven approaches. Zooming in on these finer differences we distinguish between top DDC adopters (Social Democrats, Center and Conservatives) and a lower tier with lower levels of DDC implementation. To explain the differences between the two tiers, we find that resources and attitudes to data are important, but only when taken together. Party structure and ideology do not affect the likelihood of a Swedish party using data analytics. Instead, we suggest party type (catch-all vs niche) as a potentially more useful party-level factor in explaining variation in DDC adoption.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of ghosting on the mobile dating app Tinder among Slovenia’s dating app users. Ghosting is defined as the unexpected unilateral termination of communication in interpersonal relationships exerted through digital platforms. Drawing upon data from the walkthrough of the mobile dating app Tinder and 26 semi-structured interviews with users living in Ljubljana (Slovenia), ghosting is conceptualized as an undesirable but normalized disconnection strategy on Tinder. We argue that choosing ghosting as a communication strategy emerges predominantly from two different contexts. Firstly, from the need to protect oneself from harassment and vulnerability, and secondly, as a reaction to the information overload in an environment that demands perpetual activity, availability, and interaction. Therefore, it manifests as a disconnection strategy on an interaction level or as a consequence of disconnecting from the platform itself. According to users, the desire to disconnect from others and exit the app is as high and ambiguous as the desire to connect and experience an ego boost or the excitement of interactions. Ghosting on Tinder, therefore, emerges as a response to general hyperconnectivity to navigate the increasing information overload and to a feeling of loss of the possibilities for safe and authentic connections in digital spaces."

This paper tests debunking’s effectiveness against an understudied but prominent form of online misinformation: misleading organizational claims of corporate social responsibility, or CSR-washing. British participants ( N = 657) took part in a preregistered experiment with a 2 (debunk: present, absent) x 3 (CSR-washing: greenwashing, bluewashing, purplewashing) between-subjects design. They saw an Instagram ad from a fictional clothing company that showcased its dedication to environmental sustainability, gender equality in the workplace, or the elimination of child labor. Half of the participants then received a debunk. Unlike most previous research which showed continued influence of misinformation after debunking, we found that the debunks were very effective: they reversed the persuasive effects of CSR-washing, resulting in negative brand attitudes and low purchase intentions. Several explanations for this finding are discussed, highlighting CSR-washing’s distinctiveness from many other forms of misinformation."

However, its effectiveness on social media has not been fully verified. In this study, drawing on construal level theory, we use temporal distance—the time interval between a rumor-combating post being released and receiving responses from social media users—to measure the effectiveness of rumor-combating. We also adopt elaboration likelihood model to explore the factors that could enhance this effectiveness. The empirical results show that perceptible (central route) factors, including the author’s authoritative combating methods, media richness, and positive emotions, are negatively related to temporal distance and are more effective for enhancing rumor-combating effectiveness than imperceptible (peripheral route) factors, such as the author’s influence and activeness. In addition, media richness exerts positive moderating effects on the relationship between perceptible route factors and rumor-combating effectiveness, implying that with the help of images or videos, rumor-combating effectiveness improves. This study addresses the need to enhance the effectiveness of rumor-combating and has practical implications for combating rumors in the social media."

    "abstract": "Political expression is a focal point for understanding how digital media have transformed political engagement. Privacy concerns tend to impede online political expression, but this relationship is still poorly understood. Based on the theory of reasoned action, this study focuses on the role of social influence and institutional privacy concerns in political expression on Facebook. We draw on research on the privacy calculus to examine how observing the behavior of Facebook friends moderates the relationship between privacy concerns and online political expression. We use survey data gathered in 2023 from Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States ( n = 5,936). Across all five countries, we find that observing Facebook friends posting political content bolsters political expression on Facebook, as per our preregistered analysis. In all countries except Germany, privacy concerns impede political expression on Facebook. Also, the importance of institutional privacy concerns for political expression depends on the observed posting behavior of Facebook friends. This moderated effect is only observed in three of the five examined countries, however. Our findings offer new insights into the factors that encourage and discourse political expression, particularly on Facebook which is a platform that has been widely criticized for failing to protect its users’ privacy."

    "abstract": "People report receiving ads on their mobile device that are seemingly related to previous offline conversations (i.e., conversation-related advertising). They may think that this is because their electronic devices are eavesdropping (i.e., e-eavesdropping). To gain insights into the scope and characteristics of conversation-related advertising and e-eavesdropping beliefs, we conducted a survey in the United States ( n = 300), the Netherlands ( n = 293), and Poland ( n = 293). These countries were chosen based on their differences in privacy regulations and history with state surveillance. We find that belief in conversation-related advertising is a widespread cross-country phenomenon, which is higher in the United States compared with European countries. In addition, between half and two-thirds of respondents believe e-eavesdropping is a likely explanation for it. We find that social media is a main contributing factor through which people hear about and most often see conversation-related advertising. Moreover, in response to such advertising, respondents experience more negative than positive affect. The results show that this is a prevalent and timely phenomenon that warrants more research. This carries implications for the (social) media industry and regulators, as it highlights the importance of transparency and (insufficient) individual understanding of data collection and processing."
