    "abstract": "This article examines the growing susceptibility of young Romanians to authoritarian leadership models in the aftermath of the 2024 European elections. While youth are often seen as champions of democratic renewal, recent data point to a significant erosion of democratic commitment, shaped by institutional distrust and emotionally charged media environments. This concern is heightened by Romania‚Äôs political developments in 2024, which saw the doubling of extremist representation in the European Parliament and the annulment of the first round of presidential elections due to alleged irregularities and social media interference. Drawing on a media‚Äêcentered theoretical framework and original survey data, the study finds that 74% of respondents support the idea of a strong leader unconcerned with parliamentary procedures. Socio‚Äêdemographic factors, such as gender, education, income, and urban‚Äìrural residence, significantly influence these attitudes, with lower education and income levels correlating with stronger authoritarian support. Media consumption patterns also emerge as critical determinants: reliance on social media and traditional media (TV and radio) is associated with heightened authoritarian inclinations, while online press consumption fosters greater democratic resilience. Platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp appear to amplify affective and symbolic political expression, even among those who primarily rely on traditional media sources. Furthermore, institutional trust proves to be domain‚Äêspecific; lower trust in security, religious, and educational institutions predicts higher support for authoritarian leadership. Rather than reflecting mere apathy, youth disengagement reveals complex interactions between media ecosystems, emotional political communication, and institutional skepticism. This study contributes to existing research by focusing on an understudied demographic (Romanian youth) during a volatile electoral moment. It combines nationally representative survey data with a media‚Äêcentered analytical lens to examine how platform‚Äêspecific information environments shape authoritarian attitudes."

Using a mixed‚Äêmethods approach, we analyze Facebook adoption patterns across 6,254 Czech municipalities by scanning their official websites for Facebook links, a questionnaire survey (ùëÅ = 330), and thematic analysis of posts from municipalities with extended powers. Results reveal a strong relationship between municipal size and Facebook adoption, with rates ranging from 14.1% in the smallest municipalities (fewer than 200 inhabitants) to 88.6% in the largest (10,000+). Primary adoption motivations include communication speed, ensuring citizen awareness, and meeting public expectations for a modern online presence, while resource constraints and fear of negativity constitute major barriers. Thematic analysis reveals dominance of practical information and community event promotion over dialogic engagement. The findings demonstrate how resource limitations create a digital divide in local government communication, with smaller municipalities facing structural barriers to social media adoption. This research contributes to understanding technology diffusion dynamics in fragmented administrative systems and the gap between social media‚Äôs dialogic potential and actual government communication practices."

In the first part, the article outlines the context of the analytical framework at the intersection of three main research fields: political communication, in particular the study of electoral campaigns via social media; visual culture and communication, precisely the analysis of the visual representation, self‚Äêrepresentation, and counter‚Äêrepresentation of political leaders; and computer science, in particular the application of machine learning techniques for computer vision to recognize and categorize visual political content. In the second part, the article offers an application of the analytical framework by sharing some empirical results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the visual content published by 21 Italian political actors on Facebook and Instagram during the campaign, focusing on their main visual formats, themes, and strategies of representation of political leadership. In the analysis, deep learning models are also employed to detect specific image characteristics by cross‚Äêreferencing their outputs with manual cataloguing performed on the same images and for the same attributes. In the end, on the basis of the research carried out, the article suggests possible paths for future interdisciplinary analysis of online visual political communication."

Mobile phones have become a driving force of dynamic news habits, especially among younger audiences. This study aims to bridge the gap between static perceptions of news consumption and the dynamic realities of daily mobile usage. To investigate this, we tracked news usage on the mobile phones of 384 young adults in Switzerland over three weeks in 2021, in a period surrounding a national referendum. These data were combined with two surveys at the beginning and end of the tracking period to examine how a political referendum, daily schedules, and browsing habits are related to the amount of mobile news consumption. Using a Bayesian time-lagged model, we found an increase in news consumption on the day of the referendum, and a slight decrease on weekends and during working hours. We also found that participants read more news when they first opened their phones than as a browsing session continued, and that higher news consumption was substantially associated with the use of X/Twitter and Instagram, but only slightly with TikTok."

The present study examined the longitudinal relationships between selfies (i.e. taking, manipulating, investing in and posting) and body dissatisfaction via sociocultural mediators; thin-ideal internalisation and comparisons. Adolescents ( N = 573; M age = 15.38, SD = 1.34; 68.2% female) completed online surveys twice over 4 months. A cross-lagged mediation model demonstrated unidirectional relationships, whereby body dissatisfaction predicted higher investment and lower posting 4 months later. Mediation was only found via one pathway; body dissatisfaction predicted greater selfie investment via upward comparisons. Gender did not moderate the relationships. These findings provide little support for sociocultural mechanisms, suggesting researchers pursue alternative frameworks."

    "abstract": "The transnationalization of political issues has led to a greater need for multinational solutions and has increased the relevance of public diplomacy (PD). Although scholars have identified different approaches to digital PD, comparative research is lacking. This study addresses this gap by examining whether United States (US) embassies vary in their reliance on various PD instruments. Furthermore, it explores whether such variation aligns with contextual target audience variables, specifically different facets of political and cultural proximity. Based on a dataset that includes all Twitter accounts operated by US embassies over a year-long period ( n = 176,372 posts), the results suggest that embassies vary in their use of PD instruments. Moreover, the prevalence of PD instruments and advocacy topics covary with some of the analyzed facets of political and cultural proximity. Consequentially, the study suggests that US embassies partially tailor their messages to the interests of target audiences."

Based on representative surveys in Denmark ( n = 1,958), Norway ( n = 2,009), and Sweden ( n = 1,991), we examine what characterises right-wing alternative media users in terms of political attitudes and political, media, and social trust. The analysis reveals that right-wing alternative media users in Scandinavia tend to affiliate with far-right parties, support far-right ideas, and express lower levels of trust in political institutions, traditional media, and unknown others. Among these, support for far-right ideas and a lack of trust in traditional media are the most important characteristics. While support for far-right ideas characterises right-wing alternative media users in all three countries, low trust in traditional media is a more important characteristic in Norway and Sweden than in Denmark. The study advances knowledge of the role of ideology vis-√†-vis various forms of (dis)trust among right-wing alternative media users, showing that while alternative media use across the Scandinavian countries displays a set of similarities, such use is also formed by national context."

Most forms‚Äîacross public and private sectors‚Äîstill lack a ‚ÄúMENA‚Äù category option. What are the political consequences of institutional invisibility? Across two survey experiments and in-depth interviews, I find that exclusion from official identity categories triggers the experience of categorization threat, a psychological response rarely linked to political behavior. When MENA Americans experience categorization threat, they respond by expressing opinions on politics in ways that attempt to signal and assert their MENA identity and, to a lesser extent, Person of Color (POC) identity. Such identity assertion demonstrates that bureaucratic categorization influences expressions of public opinion on politics, not simply how people self-categorize. Researching the effects of category exclusion on public opinions creates opportunities for more accurate and democratic scholarship."

Visual characteristics affect people‚Äôs preferences, but it is difficult to measure the extent of this effect precisely and concisely in surveys. We present a new adaptive design that measures the impact of visual characteristics on people‚Äôs preferences: The plot staircase. We apply it to graphs of time series data, identifying the effect of the slope of a sequence on evaluations of the sequence. The plot staircase replicates the existing finding that people have a strong preference for increasing trends. Using fewer survey questions than past approaches, it measures at the individual level how much overall welfare a survey respondent is willing to sacrifice for an increasing trend. We demonstrate the flexibility of the plot staircase across domains (economic growth, jobs creation, and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout) and across sequence characteristics. Survey measurement is more difficult for concepts that cannot be represented textually or numerically; our method enables researchers to measure preferences for graphical properties not reducible to the individual pieces of information."

    "abstract": "Do different economic shocks favor different types of political leadership? Using a survey experiment conducted on 3500 American respondents, we offer causal evidence for an unexpected relation between different types of economic shocks and a demand for a radical political response. First, we show that individuals believe politicians have a role in preventing layoffs due to both offshoring and automation, compared to run-of-the-mill bankruptcies. Second, we find strong evidence that economic shocks due to offshoring lead to greater demands for leaders who display authoritarian traits, with no equivalent effect for layoffs due to automation. When presented with news of an offshoring event, respondents favor leaders who claim to be more willing to flout the rule of law, to implement divisive policies, and to employ force. By contrast, traits commonly associated with populism, such as siding with ‚Äúthe people‚Äù or preferring political outsiders, see no association with either offshoring or automation shocks. Our findings support the view that some economic shocks provide a greater opportunity for political candidates willing to turn to radical political solutions."

    "abstract": "Initially conceived to describe a phenomenon between political parties, the concept of affective polarization is increasingly extrapolated to analyze relationships among other identity groups. This reflects a long-standing interest in intergroup relations within public opinion studies and calls for a broad theoretical framework that considers many ingroup/outgroup categorizations as potential disruptors of public sphere processes. By implementing a comprehensive and systematic review of peer-reviewed research on affective polarization (N = 458), we find that nearly one-third of publications extend the concept beyond political parties to encompass divides such as opinion-based, ideological, racial, territorial, and religious identities. After identifying key points of convergence and divergence between interparty and beyond-party research, we conducted a metatheoretical analysis of works that go beyond parties (N = 142) to classify the social groups potentially subject to affective polarization, the factors influencing the public salience of such identities, and the predominant observation methods and measurements. The results support a more dynamic understanding of identity salience in the public sphere and highlight challenges related to terminology and methodological compatibility across different approaches. Overall, the study reveals a growing interest in various forms of intergroup hostility that connects to broader contemporary concerns about democratic values."

To attain a comprehensive understanding of democracy perceptions, we utilized data from World Value Survey databases. The study encompassed the opinions of 113,929 respondents from 27 countries over three study waves (2005‚Äì2022). Through the k-means cluster analysis, we identified three primary perception types: (1) social liberals, (2) stabilizers, and (3) non-essentialists. We found that the social liberal perception was strongly associated with full-democratic regimes, while stabilizers and non-essentialist perceptions were more linked to flawed democracy, hybrid, and authoritarian regimes. Based on the obtained results, theoretical and methodological considerations were discussed for future public opinion studies."

Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as ‚Äúdigital behavioral data‚Äù (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks‚Äîsuch as the Total Survey Error framework‚Äîhave a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application."

Open-ended responses were analyzed with natural language processing, and quantitative survey data identified factors associated with these definitions. Results show that conceptions of AI differed by context: workers emphasized efficiency and automation in the workplace, while the general public linked AI to diverse everyday technologies. Across both groups, conceptions remained nuanced yet limited. Sociodemographic factors and personality traits were related to sentiments expressed in definitions, and greater trust in AI predicted more positive sentiments. These findings underscore the need for targeted training and education to foster a more comprehensive public understanding of what AI is and what it can do across different contexts."

We integrated two large databases obtained from the American Psychology Association that have been used to keep track of constructs, measures, and research in the psychological-science literature for the past 30 years. In our descriptive analyses, we found that (a) thousands of new constructs and measures are published each year, (b) most measures are used very few times, and (c) there is no trend toward consensus or standardization in the use of constructs and measures; in fact, there is a trend toward even greater fragmentation over time. That is, constructs and measures are proliferating. We conclude that measurement in the psychological-science literature is fragmented, creating problems such as redundancy and confusion and stifling cumulative scientific progress. We conclude by providing suggestions for what researchers can do about this problem."

    "abstract": "Social norms approaches have been widely applied in health promotion as a cost-effective behaviour-change strategy, but have been little evaluated as a whole. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using social norms messaging in developed countries targeted at changing health behaviours among 16+-year-olds to evaluate their effectiveness. Relevant studies were identified through searches in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, TRIP, Cochrane and grey literature sources. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis standardized effect sizes to Cohen‚Äôs d , assessed heterogeneity with I ¬≤ and applied robust Bayesian meta-analysis to adjust for publication bias. Searches resulted in 89 studies ( n = 85,759), which exhibited a small effect of social norms messaging on health behaviours (Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.19], P &lt; 0.001). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for publication bias. We conducted moderator analyses, finding no significant differences from the overall effect for different types of social norms message, delivery modalities, health domains or target populations. The review is limited by the lack of studies assessing whether normative information changed participant perceptions, inconsistent use of manipulation checks, and high heterogeneity across studies in terms of target behaviour, population and intervention delivery, affecting the robustness of conclusions. Our analysis suggests that when appropriately controlling for publication bias, social norms messages are not effective at improving health behaviours. Thus, future attempts at improving public health should focus on alternative approaches."

    "abstract": "Affective polarization is a corrosive force in American politics. While numerous studies have developed interventions to reduce it, their capacity for creating lasting, large-scale change is unclear. This study comprehensively evaluates existing interventions through a meta-analysis of 77 treatments from 25 published studies and two large-scale experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals that the average effect of treatments on animosity is modest (a 5.4-point shift on a 101-point scale), and decays within two weeks. We experimentally test whether stacking multiple treatments in one sitting or repeating them over time as ‚Äúbooster shots‚Äù enhances their impact. We find no evidence that multiple or repeated exposures produce substantially larger or more durable reductions in partisan animosity. This reveals the uneven utility of these interventions. They serve as valuable tools for testing the psychological mechanisms of polarization, but our findings indicate they are not, on their own, a scalable solution for reducing societal-level conflict. We conclude that achieving lasting depolarization will likely require a shift in focus, moving beyond individual-level treatments to address the elite behaviors and structural incentives that fuel partisan conflict."
