    "abstract": "Social media technologies have been criticized as ineffective sources of information because users seem to increase their subjective but not their objective knowledge. While different factors such as multitasking have been brought up as explanations, direct and fair comparisons of learning outcomes between social and traditional news media are missing. This two-wave field experiment (N1 = 902, N2 = 663) shows that whereas participants receiving information on social media did learn less than participants receiving the same information through an email newsletter, this difference disappeared when cognitive elaboration on social media was triggered through elaboration questions. Correlational analyses further suggest that multitasking is one factor which hinders successful knowledge acquisition on social media. Our findings suggest that learning through social media is possible if social media contents invite cognitively elaborate processing.",

    "abstract": "Unintended encounters with news on social media can foster a reliance on incidental news exposure and the perception that “news finds me.” Because the “news-finds-me” (NFM) perception has negative consequences for informed and engaged citizenship, explaining it has become a priority in recent years. This two-wave survey of adults in the USA incorporates scholarship on social media habits and social media mindsets for an expanded view of the antecedent psychological conditions of the “news-finds-me” perception. Path analyses indicate habitual use of social media to have direct effects and core beliefs about social media and algorithmic control to have indirect effects through habitual use. These patterns hold for two of the three sub-dimensions of the NFM perception, indicating habit and mindset to be fruitful theoretical directions for future research.",

Various definitions and measurements for online lurking have been employed but have often suggested “lurking” to be conflated with other behaviors. This study developed and tested a scale to measure consistent online lurking (COOL), addressing the need for a clear conceptualization and measurement of this behavior. Exploratory factor analysis explicated two dimensions of online lurking – online invisibility and preference for content consumption, and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure. The resulting scale demonstrated good reliability across two samples. The study differentiates consistent lurking from information-seeking and contextual factors, focusing on individuals who tend to lurk across platforms. This conceptualization provides a theoretical contribution by illuminating a subset of online users who are often underrepresented in research but are integral to online communities despite their invisibility.",

    "abstract": "Social media are key arenas for public opinion formation, but are susceptible to coordinated social media manipulation (CSMM), that is, the orchestrated activity of multiple accounts to increase content visibility and deceive audiences. Despite advances in detecting and characterizing CSMM, the attribution problem—identifying the principals behind CSMM campaigns—has received little scholarly attention. In this article, we address this gap by synthesizing existing research and developing a theoretical model for understanding CSMM. We propose a consolidated definition of CSMM, identify its key observable and hidden characteristics, and present a rational choice model for inferring principals’ strategic decisions from campaign features. In addition, we present a typology of CSMM campaigns, linking variations in scale, elaborateness, and disguise to principals’ resources, stakes, and influence strategies. Our contribution provides researchers with conceptual and heuristic tools for attribution and invites interdisciplinary and comparative research on CSMM campaigns.",

    "abstract": "Human trafficking, a grave human rights violation with far-reaching global consequences, serves as a compelling case study for analyzing multifaceted polarization dynamics in online discourse and the influence of social media on public perceptions and responses. Drawing on social identity theory and self-categorization theory, this article aims to elucidate both group polarization and opinion polarization surrounding human trafficking on social media. Through an integrated approach that combines clustering, social network analysis, text mining, and topic modeling, this study provides a comprehensive examination of community formation, influential actor identification, topic classification, and semantic analysis. The similarity between user-generated content from clustered groups and the topics identified is calculated to quantify the degree of multifaceted polarization. The findings reveal a robust community structure within the network and uncover divisions and structural characteristics across each subgroup. Utilizing the BERTopic model, thematic clusters such as vulnerable groups, persecution experiences, incident areas, law and politics, public awareness, contraband, and case events are identified, reflecting the primary public concerns regarding human trafficking. This research enhances our understanding of multifaceted polarization shaped by social identity in digital conversations about critical social issues and holds significant implications for policymakers, advocacy groups, and practitioners navigating public opinion regarding human trafficking in the digital realm.",

    "authors": "Anna Wickenkamp, Frederic R. Hopp, Michael Hameleers, Linda Bos",
    "abstract": "Social media have transformed political campaigning by enabling direct interaction between politicians and voters, becoming a key tool for shaping public opinion. Moral language is pivotal in this dynamic as it captures attention in an overly information-saturated social media environment and wields significant influence over political opinions. Populists thrive on social media by fostering distrust in elites, using emotional language, and reducing complex issues to simple “us vs. them” binaries. We argue these factors are rooted in moral underpinnings, which may play a significant role in the appeal of populist parties and have thus far received limited scholarly attention. Consequently, this paper addresses the research question: To what extent, and in what ways, do populist parties exhibit a distinct moral-rhetorical profile on social media that sets them apart from mainstream politicians? Using Moral Foundations Theory, natural language processing, and a computational semantic network approach, we analyzed 11,205 social media posts from Dutch political parties and leaders during the 2023 Dutch election campaign across X, Facebook, and Instagram. Our findings reveal that populist parties emphasize Care and Authority over other moral foundations, while mainstream parties exhibit a different moral foundation distribution. These results align with the part of populist communication logic that frames populist actors as defenders against corrupt elites and external threats, as well as representatives of the people’s demand for sovereignty. Moreover, we found populist parties exhibit less internal consistency in their moral rhetoric across platforms than mainstream parties, suggesting a potentially higher adeptness at tailoring messages to different platforms and their affordances.",

    "abstract": "Radical right behavior and support for radical right parties have increased across many countries in recent decades. A growing body of research has argued that, similar to the spread of other extremist behaviors, this is due to an erosion of political norms. This suggests that re-stigmatizing radical right parties might be an effective way of countering their growth. We use a survey experiment in Spain that compares the effectiveness of three theory-driven interventions aimed at increasing political stigma against a radical right party. Contrary to expectations, we fail to validate the efficacy of vignette-based attempts at stigmatization, instead identifying some backlash effects. Methodologically, our findings underscore the importance of validating treatments, as we show that simple attempts at re-stigmatization can produce null or opposing effects to their intended purpose. Theoretically, our results support the idea that normalization is a “one-way street,” in that re-stigmatizing parties is difficult after a party has become normalized.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting of armed conflicts is a critical area of research with the potential to save lives and mitigate suffering. While existing forecasting models offer valuable point predictions, they often lack individual-level uncertainty estimates, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. Several approaches exist to estimate uncertainty, such as parametric and Bayesian prediction intervals, bootstrapping, quantile regression, but these methods often rely on restrictive assumptions, struggle to provide well-calibrated intervals across the full range of outcomes, or are computationally intensive. Conformal prediction offers a model-agnostic alternative that guarantees a user-specified level of coverage but typically provides only marginal coverage, potentially resulting in non-uniform coverage across different regions of the outcome space. In this article, we introduce a novel extension called bin-conditional conformal prediction (BCCP), which enhances standard conformal prediction (SCP) by ensuring consistent coverage rates across user-defined subsets (bins) of the outcome variable. We apply BCCP to simulated data as well as the forecasting of fatalities from armed conflicts, and demonstrate that it provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across various ranges of the outcome. Compared to SCP, BCCP offers improved local coverage, though this comes at the cost of slightly wider prediction intervals.",

This letter describes a workflow process for structured text extraction using free models and software. I discuss the type of data best suited to this method, its usefulness within political science, and the steps required to convert the text into a usable dataset. Finally, I demonstrate the method by extracting agenda items from city council meeting minutes. I find the method can accurately extract subsections of text from a document and requires only a few hand labeled documents to adequately train.",

    "abstract": "Does exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ increasing use of deepfakes further increase polarization among partisans, and how does this impact vary among different evaluations of political coalitions, parties, and leaders? What role does approval for candidates’ usage of AI play as a moderator in this relationship? This paper examines these questions using data from a survey experiment ( N = 1627), in which each respondent exposed to a news story that varied in their coverage of the growing deployment of AI-powered deepfakes during the 2024 India’s national election campaigns. The findings indicate that exposure to news about out-party campaigns’ use of deepfakes did not polarize attitudes towards coalitions, parties, and leaders. In contrast, approval for candidates’ use of AI was negatively associated with polarization towards coalitions, parties, and leaders, but this did not moderate the experimental effects: respondents who approved of candidates’ AI usage and saw a news article about out-party use of deepfakes were not more polarized toward either coalitions, parties or leaders. This study not only extends the understanding of AI’s role in campaigns by examining its complex effects on affective polarization, but it also broadens empirical research into the impact of deepfakes by focusing on the non-Western context of India, thereby offering new theoretical insights into how technological advancements intersect with political behaviors and attitudes.",

    "abstract": "In studies using the increasingly popular experience-sampling method (ESM), design decisions are often guided by theoretical or practical considerations. Yet limited empirical evidence exists on how these choices affect data quantity (e.g., response probabilities), data quality (e.g., response latency), and potential biases in study outcomes (e.g., characteristics of study variables). In a preregistered, 4-week study ( N = 395), we experimentally manipulated two key ESM protocol characteristics for sending ESM surveys: timing (fixed vs. varying times) and contingency (directly vs. indirectly after unlocking the smartphone). We evaluated the ESM protocols resulting from the combination of these two characteristics regarding different criteria: As hypothesized for contingency, indirect protocols resulted in higher response probabilities (increased data quantity). But they also led to higher response latencies (reduced data quality). Contrary to our expectations, the combined effect of contingency and timing did not significantly influence response probability. We also did not observe other effects of timing or contingency on data quality. In exploratory follow-up analyses, we discovered that timing significantly affected response probability and smartphone-usage behaviors, as measured by screen logs; however, these effects were likely attributable to time-of-day effects. Self-reported states showed no differences based on the chosen ESM protocol, and similar trends were found when correlating primary outcomes with external criteria, such as trait affect and well-being. Based on the study’s findings, we discuss the trade-offs that researchers should consider when choosing their ESM protocols to optimize data quantity, data quality, and biases in study outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Word embeddings are language models that represent words as positions in an abstract many-dimensional meaning space. Despite a growing range of applications demonstrating their utility for sociology, there is little conceptual clarity regarding what exactly embeddings measure and whether this matches what we need them to measure. Here, we fill this theoretical gap by clarifying how cultural meaning can be understood in spatial terms. We argue that embeddings operationalize context spaces, where words’ positions can reflect any regularity in usage. We then examine sociologists' embeddings-based measurements to argue that most sociologists are instead implicitly interested in capturing concept spaces, where positions strictly indicate meaningful conceptual features (e.g., femininity or status). Because meaningful features yield regularities in usage, context spaces can proxy for concept spaces. However, context spaces also reflect surface regularities in language—e.g., syntax, morphology, dialect, and phraseology—which are irrelevant to most sociological investigations and can bias cultural measurement. We draw on our framework to propose best practices for measuring meaning with embeddings.",

    "authors": "Pablo A. Mitnik",
    "abstract": "Although there is an extensive methodological literature on the measurement of intergenerational income mobility, there has been limited research on the conceptual interpretation of mobility measures and the methodological implications of those interpretations. In this article, I focus on the three measures of mobility most frequently used in the literature—the intergenerational elasticity (IGE), the intergenerational correlation (IGC), and the rank-rank slope (RRS)—as well as a recently introduced measure, the intergenerational elasticity of expected income (IGEE). I make two main contributions, both related to the conceptual interpretation of mobility measures. First, I specify the formal relationships between those four mobility measures and the measures of inequality of opportunity developed in the luck egalitarian empirical literature on the topic, and determine the methodological implications of the analyses. I show that (a) the IGC is a measure of relative inequality of opportunity for monetary income, (b) the RRS is both a measure of relative inequality of opportunity for income rank and a rescaled measure of absolute inequality of opportunity for income rank, and (c) the products of parental income inequality by the IGEE and IGE are both measures of absolute inequality of opportunity for monetary income that differ in how they measure the value of opportunity sets. Second, relying on a conceptual distinction that has been influential in the field of public finance, the IGE and IGEE have been characterized as “person-weighted” and “dollar-weighted” elasticities, respectively, thus raising doubts about the desirability of a recent proposal to replace the IGE by the IGEE as the workhorse elasticity of the mobility field. I show that this contrasting characterization of the two intergenerational elasticities is the joint result of a category mistake—equating quantile-specific elasticities to person-specific elasticities—and of misconstruing the nature of the IGE and the epistemic goal it has been meant to serve. Based on this analysis, I conclude that the case for replacing the IGE with the IGEE remains well-founded.",

We reveal the subjective value-judgments in them: they are represented by weighted-sums (or aggregators) over heterogeneous groups, with controversial economic properties. Log-level regressions tend to overrepresent the experiences of middle-class children while underrepresenting those from disadvantaged families. We propose a general construction of IGM measures that can incorporate any transparent economic preferences. They are interpreted as the marginal effect of parental normalized social welfare on children’s normalized welfare. Conventional regressions are special cases with implicit economic preferences that fail inequality-aversion and the Pigou–Dalton principle of transfers. Empirically, a variety of economic preferences, with varying inequality aversion, demonstrate a nuanced view of mobility, and perspectives on geographic-differences and dynamics of it.",

    "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

    "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and observers infer shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three preregistered experiments ( N = 1 , 254 ) and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework that captures and explains these inferences and their interactions quantitatively and parsimoniously. When people have different priors about norms or authorities, the model predicted and we experimentally confirmed that observing punishment by the authority can sustain polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

    "authors": "Walter Laurito, Benjamin Davis, Peli Grietzer, Tomáš Gavenčiak, Ada Böhm, Jan Kulveit",
    "abstract": "Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.",
