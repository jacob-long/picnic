          "authors": "Allison Ann Payne",
          "abstract": "Schools continue to rely on restrictive security and punitive discipline in dealing with crime and delinquency despite evidence that these measures can negatively impact both students and schools. In addition, these measures are inequitably implemented across schools, with historically marginalized communities seeing greater use. I argue that attending to social justice in school-based crime and delinquency prevention should begin with an examination of strategies that are effective in reducing risk factors for crime and deviance. I describe those evidence-based strategies, show that they are inequitably implemented across schools, and discuss how equitable implementation can happen. The solution I argue for—equitable implementation—includes engagement of the schools’ community members, building trusting relationships, equitable decision-making, strong collaborative leadership, local adaptation, and reliance on data. I also discuss a particular framework that researchers and schools can use to achieve equitable implementation.",

          "authors": "Nancy Rodriguez",
          "abstract": "The evidence base on the effectiveness of crime prevention programs and policies has grown significantly over the past two decades. But despite the attention given to particular kinds of crime reduction interventions, advancement of social justice and reduction of racial disparities in the administration of criminal justice have been limited. Additionally, despite the growing diversity of the U.S. population, prevention research that focuses on disparities among racial and ethnic groups is limited. In this article, I draw on insights from three juvenile court case studies to discuss the strengths and limitations of research on youth justice. These cases illustrate how social inequalities shape the lives of youth and how juvenile court responses, which are ostensible evidence-based treatments, can compound inequality and punish some youth. I then present strategies that center racial equity and social justice as part of a new framework for youth crime prevention.",

Foundational to this work is to bring about social justice for marginalized and underserved populations. Drawing on several case studies from developed and developing countries, we apply ideas and practices from social medicine to explore how the advancement of social justice can help prevent interpersonal violence. Several themes offer fresh perspectives on inculcating social justice principles and practices in violence prevention, including recognizing the impacts of structural violence, fostering equity in the distribution of resources, expanding accompaniment, and overcoming a socialized acceptance of scarcity. We conclude with observations on the indistinct and dynamic boundaries between medicine and criminology.",

          "abstract": "Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the city of Minneapolis grappled with shattered community trust, record rates of violence, and low officer morale. Balancing the interests of crime prevention and social justice in the community that the authors of this article serve is a vital concern, as it is in so many other cities and jurisdictions. Our perspective on crime prevention and social justice emphasizes transparency, community partnerships, and evaluative metrics, and we argue for and reflect on that approach here. By implementing practical, purposeful, and informed policy changes, the Minneapolis Police Department and our community have made significant strides forward in both building capacity for community trust and launching crime prevention initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, we argued that it would be possible to reduce incarceration and use the resultant savings for investments in preschool education, which would further lower the crime rate. In this article, we revisit that line of thinking, surveying recent literature on the cost and efficacy of prisons and preschool education for crime reduction. We find that the new evidence strengthens our earlier conclusion about the feasibility of this thought experiment. The costs (in real dollars) of prison are higher than 25 years ago, and prisons are slightly less effective at reducing or preventing crime. In addition, the evidence shows broader and stronger effects of preschool on crime and in programs operating at a much larger scale than the programs we previously evaluated.",

          "abstract": "The police are traditionally seen as experts in crime prevention, and a large body of research supports the effectiveness of police-led prevention initiatives targeted at crime hot spots. However, there is growing interest in identifying alternative prevention efforts that do not rely on the police, especially with youth in communities that have challenging relationships with the formal justice system. This article reports on a quasi-experimental evaluation of an innovative school- and community-led crime prevention partnership that prioritized social justice and social impact. The partnership was associated with modest but statistically significant reductions in calls for service and reported offenses in the treatment areas. Results for juvenile-involved offenses were not statistically significant, but the magnitude and direction of that effect were similar to the other results. We discuss the benefits and challenges of leveraging informal social controls to prevent crime “beyond the police.”",

This article explores the intersection of crime prevention and social justice, with an emphasis on research that incorporates the perspectives of those most impacted by crime and the criminal justice system. We discuss NIJ’s efforts during our tenures there to employ innovative methodologies to better understand the needs and perceptions of people impacted by crime, and we highlight the importance of reaching practitioner audiences in ways that promote the implementation of evidence through initiatives like Evidence to Action and the LEADS Scholars Program. We argue for a collaborative approach to crime prevention that both fosters justice and ensures that research findings are implemented to create lasting, equitable change.",

          "abstract": "Critics of evidence-based crime prevention argue that extant research lacks insight into aspects of crime control and prevention that are critical to policymakers. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of programs require the use of experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and some scholars argue that relaxing that methodological criterion would result in a larger pool of studies that could better inform policy and practice. We test that proposition by using a comprehensive database of 160 evaluation studies of public-area video surveillance and measuring their policy relevance by looking for four specific factors: causal mechanisms, moderators, implementation, and economic costs. We find that studies incorporating experimental and high-quality quasi-experimental designs scored significantly higher than studies using less rigorous designs on three of the four dimensions. This suggests that adherence to a high standard of methodological rigor does not compromise the practical value of video surveillance research. We then discuss the implications of this finding.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research on evidence-based crime prevention draws attention to a pressing need for these crime prevention programs, policies, and practices to do more to bring about social impact and social justice. Crime prevention that prioritizes social impact is about harnessing the knowledge of evidence-based interventions and fostering systems change that is both meaningful and lasting. This approach includes targeting the social and environmental conditions that lead to criminal activity, building on existing strengths and assets, and tailoring evidence-based practices to local conditions. Social justice in this context equitably delivers crime prevention resources, and promotes perceptions of fairness and legitimacy among individuals and the community at large. In this introduction, we lay out the ideals, challenges, and progress of crime prevention for social impact and social justice and summarize the conclusions of the other articles in this volume of The ANNALS .",

          "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, there has been growing concern over a purported link between proactive policing to control crime and unfair, biased, and abusive policing approaches. Overly aggressive and indiscriminate policing initiatives run the risk of driving a wedge between police and the communities they serve, with residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods feeling less like partners and more like targets. At the same time, research suggests that effective policing has an important impact on public safety. We present a conceptual framework for how police can prevent crime while minimizing unintended harm. We focus particularly on cities and urban communities, arguing that the benefits of policing can be maximized and the costs of policing can be minimized when the police respect individual rights and dignity and focus on community, and that problem solving should begin with a focus on risky people in the places that generate the most crime.",

This article extends an equity-oriented policy agenda by applying the IBPA framework to three domains of the criminal justice system: policing, corrections, and legislation. I present case studies of algorithmic policing, the housing of transgender persons in carceral settings, and U.S. firearm legislation as examples of this approach. Through these cases, I argue for equitable processes and outcomes in the creation and application of criminal justice policy and practice.",

A key feature of developmental crime prevention is a comprehensive effort to improve the life chances of at-risk children and families, and there is evidence that doing so improves long-term life-course outcomes like physical health, mental health, education, and employment. We assess available research evidence from 12 high-quality studies of developmental crime prevention initiatives and find that extensive use of multimodal interventions helps to foster cumulative protection over the life course, that there are significant improvements in other outcomes over the life course, that there are promising signs of intergenerational transmission of the intervention effects, and that there is strong support for these sorts of interventions from the perspective of benefit-cost analysis.

This conceptual article examines how reducing crime at places is also an opportunity to have greater social impact and improve social justice, particularly when crime displacement may occur, through the recognition that no place exists in a vacuum. We discuss opportunity reduction in its traditional form, but also in a broader context that considers a fuller extent of crime prevention that more closely resembles its original formulation in the field of environmental criminology. We interrogate our traditional opportunity-reduction theories, identifying some of their limitations and noting that theoretical integration is not only conceptually possible, but empirically shown to matter. This is followed by a discussion of theoretical integration and its importance for crime prevention. We close our discussion outlining a crime prevention model, SafeGrowth, that considers both place-based strategies and community approaches.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic field generation on Earth has probably persisted for at least 3.5 Gyr (refs. 1,2), initially sustained by secular cooling of the Earth’s core and, more recently, by the growth of the solid inner core3. Numerical models of the present-day geodynamo have proved to be successful in producing Earth-like magnetic fields4,5,6,7 and approaching realistic dynamic regimes8,9,10,11. However, thermal evolution12,13 and palaeomagnetic records14,15 suggest that the geodynamo operated for most of geomagnetic history without a solid inner core. Dynamo action in a whole fluid core remains poorly understood. Here we show dynamo actions that are independent of fluid viscosity in the correct geometry of the Earth’s core in the deep past at extremely low viscosity, demonstrating the negligible role of fluid viscosity in our dynamo simulations. Our early-Earth geometry models produce magnetic field intensity and morphologies that are compatible with the palaeomagnetic data in the deep past while showing remarkable similarity to the present-day magnetic field. This raises questions about the role of the solid inner core in producing the spatial-temporal variations of the observed Earth’s magnetic field7,16,17,18.",

          "abstract": "Projections of tropical rainfall under global warming remain highly uncertain1,2, largely because of an unclear climate response to a potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)3. Although an AMOC slowdown can substantially alter tropical rainfall patterns4,5,6,7,8, the physical mechanisms linking high-latitude changes to tropical hydroclimate are poorly understood11. Here we demonstrate that an AMOC slowdown drives widespread shifts in tropical rainfall through the propagation of high-latitude cooling into the tropical North Atlantic. We identify and validate this mechanism using climate model simulations and palaeoclimate records from Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)—a past period marked by pronounced AMOC weakening9,10. In models, prevailing easterly and westerly winds communicate the climate signal to the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean through the transport of cold air generated over the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic. Air–sea interactions transmit the response across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, altering rainfall patterns as far as Indonesia, the tropical Andes and northern Australia. A similar teleconnection emerges under global warming scenarios, producing a consistent multi-model pattern of tropical hydroclimatic change. These palaeo-validated projections show widespread drying across Mesoamerica, the Amazon and West Africa, highlighting an elevated risk of severe drought for vulnerable human and ecological systems.",

          "abstract": "Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment 1 was designed to first detect elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed 2 . Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7 σ from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395 ± 106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347 ± 59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.",

However, the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks is rapidly declining owing to increasing natural and anthropogenic pressures, threatening the EU’s climate goals and calling for prompt actions. Here we provide actionable research recommendations to improve the monitoring and modelling of forest resources and their carbon sink, and to better inform forest management decisions.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains, their uses have been largely limited to answering specific scientific questions rather than performing open-ended research6–11. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM scientist agents through a series of research meetings, with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We apply the Virtual Lab to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants.

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation 1 . Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/C CDH1 ) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/C CDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes 2 , raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry.",

          "abstract": "Transition metal–hydrides have been widely exploited in catalysis for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated moieties, including carbonyls, alkenes and alkynes1. To complement heterolytic metal–hydride bond cleavage, metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has recently gained attention, as a promising strategy for radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes2, thus enabling late-stage diversification of complex molecules3,4. However, owing to the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical and the enantiopure catalyst5, asymmetric MHAT6 remains challenging. Here we show that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of P450BM3 yielded a triple mutant that catalyses MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes, producing diverse cyclic compounds—including pyrrolidines and piperidines—with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole-cell conditions. Apart from electron-deficient alkenes, alternative radical acceptors—including hydrazones, oximes and nitriles—were converted by repurposed P450BM3 to enantioenriched cyclization products. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding by homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)–hydride species2,6. Starting from CYP119, directed evolution afforded a stereocomplementary MHATase, highlighting the potential of repurposed CYPs for MHAT biocatalysis. Our study highlights the prospect of integrating homolytic metal–hydride reactivity into metalloenzymes, thus expanding the scope of asymmetric radical biocatalysis.",

Here we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformations, RFdiffusion5 can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We used this approach to generate binders to the IDPs amylin, C-peptide, VP48 and BRCA1_ARATH in diverse conformations with a dissociation constant (Kd) ranging from 3 to 100 nM. For the IDRs G3BP1, common cytokine receptor γ-chain (IL-2RG) and prion protein, we diffused binders to β-strand conformations of the targets, obtaining Kd between 10 and 100 nM. Fluorescence imaging experiments show that the binders bind to their respective targets in cells. The G3BP1 binder disrupts stress granule formation in cells, and the amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibres, enables targeting of both monomeric and fibrillar amylin to lysosomes, and increases the sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based amylin detection. Our approach should be useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs or IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.",

Exploiting such differences is key to many therapeutic strategies and is the basis for developing diagnostic and basic-science tools. State-of-the-art strategies typically target single surface antigens, but each individual receptor rarely defines the specific cell type4,5. The development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell-surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is therefore highly desirable. Here we describe an autonomous decision-making device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive polypeptide fragments. We show that this protein-actuator platform can perform convergent protein ligation on designated cell surfaces, allowing highly selective generation of active proteins, which can either remain physically associated with the cell surface on which they were manufactured or be released into the surrounding milieu. Because of its intrinsic modularity and tunability, we demonstrate that the technology is compatible with different types of input, targeting modality and functional output, allowing for the localized interrogation or manipulation of cellular systems.",

CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection. Inhibition by CMX410 is irreversible through a previously undescribed mechanism: CMX410 reacts with the catalytic serine of the AT domain of Pks13, rapidly and irreversibly disabling the active site by forming a β-lactam. CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg−1 per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens.",

Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood 4 . ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation 5–7 . Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways 8–12 . Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC.",

We structure our Perspective around four key components of rigorous forest NbCS, illuminating key science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour.

Although many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviours are well characterized6,7,8,9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here we performed transcriptomic profiling of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARCAgRP neurons). To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay in which female mice chose between a food source or pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviours in both lactating and virgin females. We found that ARCAgRP neurons inhibit bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA (MPOABRS3 neurons), which become more active postpartum and govern parenting and satiety. Activation of this ARCAgRP-to-MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviours from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviours.",

Airway epithelial cells are crucial in allergen sensing3,4,5. However, the shared features among diverse allergens that elicit similar innate responses, and their epithelial detection mechanisms, remain poorly defined1,2,6,7,8,9. Here we identify pore-forming proteins as one of the common stimuli of allergic airway inflammation and reveal their immune-activation mechanisms. Using the prevalent mould allergen Alternaria alternata as a model, we established an in vitro system to investigate type 2 innate immune sensing. A six-step biochemical fractionation identified Aeg-S and Aeg-L as the core immune-stimulatory components. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that these proteins form 16- to 20-mer transmembrane pore complexes. Their cooperative perforation acts as a bona fide type 2 immune adjuvant to support antigen-specific T helper 2 and immunoglobulin E responses. Genetically engineered A. alternata strains that lack pore-forming activity do not induce allergic responses in mice. Furthermore, pore-forming proteins from various species, despite structural and membrane target differences, are sufficient to trigger respiratory allergies. Perforations in airway epithelial cells initiate allergic responses through two mechanisms: one triggers IL-33 release, and the other involves Ca2+ influx, which activates MAPK signalling and type 2 inflammatory gene expression. These findings provide insight into how type 2 immune responses detect common perturbations caused by structurally diverse stimuli. Targeting downstream signalling of epithelial perforation may open new avenues for treating respiratory allergies.",

The bulk sample consists of threefold intergrowth of tightly knitted 100-nm-sized crystals, predominantly HD with trace imperfections of cubic diamond. The interlayer bonds in HD are shortened with respect to intralayer bonds to optimize the HD structure. Notably, the hardness of HD is only slightly higher than cubic diamond.

Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy 1 . Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation 2,3 . Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4 + T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8 + T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Mouse lemurs are the smallest and fastest reproducing primates, as well as one of the most abundant, and they are emerging as a model organism for primate biology, behaviour, health and conservation. Although much has been learnt about their ecology and phylogeny in Madagascar and their physiology, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing to create Tabula Microcebus, a transcriptomic atlas of 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs opportunistically obtained from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration and expert cell annotation, we define and biologically organize more than 750 lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. This includes cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and differentiating cells along the developmental trajectories of spermatogenesis, haematopoiesis and other adult tissues. We also describe dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types. We globally compare expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explore primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing lemur transcriptomes to those of human, mouse and macaque. This reveals cell-type-specific patterns of primate specialization and many cell types and genes for which the mouse lemur provides a better human model than mouse 1 . The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this model primate and establishes a general approach for characterizing other emerging model organisms.",

CRISPR-based gene editors derived from microorganisms, although powerful, often show notable functional tradeoffs when ported into non-native environments, such as human cells1. Artificial-intelligence-enabled design provides a powerful alternative with the potential to bypass evolutionary constraints and generate editors with optimal properties. Here, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins. Several of the generated gene editors show comparable or improved activity and specificity relative to SpCas9, the prototypical gene editing effector, while being 400 mutations away in sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial-intelligence-generated gene editor, denoted as OpenCRISPR-1, exhibits compatibility with base editing. We release OpenCRISPR-1 to facilitate broad, ethical use across research and commercial applications.",

In an accompanying paper 1 , we performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing of 27 organs from mouse lemurs. We identified more than 750 molecular cell types, characterized their transcriptomic profiles and provided insight into primate evolution of cell types. Here we use the generated atlas to characterize mouse lemur genes, physiology, disease and mutations. We uncover thousands of previously unidentified lemur genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions including over 85,000 primate splice junctions missing in mice. We systematically explore the lemur immune system by comparing global expression profiles of key immune genes in health and disease, and by mapping immune cell development, trafficking and activation. We characterize primate-specific and lemur-specific physiology and disease, including molecular features of the immune program, lemur adipocytes and metastatic endometrial cancer that resembles the human malignancy. We present expression patterns of more than 400 primate genes missing in mice, many with similar expression patterns to humans and some implicated in human disease. Finally, we provide an experimental framework for reverse genetic analysis by identifying naturally occurring nonsense mutations in three primate immune genes missing in mice and by analysing their transcriptional phenotypes. This work establishes a foundation for molecular and genetic analyses of mouse lemurs and prioritizes primate genes, isoforms, physiology and disease for future study.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in HIV-1 prophylaxis, vertical transmission remains a pressing problem in developing countries1. Given the promise of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention2, we hypothesized that neonatal delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) could provide durable HIV-1 immunity during infancy. Here, using infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model, we show that a one-time administration of an AAV vector encoding bNAb 3BNC117 at birth led to sustained bNAb expression for more than three years without redosing. This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans.",

          "abstract": "A new technology can recognize specific features on the cell surface (illustration pictured) and synthesize tailored proteins accordingly.Credit: SingleCell Animation LLC/Science Photo Library\n\nScientists have created a tool that manufactures working proteins directly on the surfaces of specific cells by targeting several molecular features at once — an approach that could one day produce therapeutics at sites in the body where they are needed most.\n\nThe SMART system (splicing-modulated actuation upon recognition of targets) builds proteins that are designed to recognize specific markers on cell surfaces, such as certain combinations of antigens — molecules that trigger immune responses. It achieves this through ligation, or splicing together two inactive protein fragments — each targeting a separate antigen — to form a functional protein, which can either stay tethered to the cell on which it was created or be released into the surrounding environment. The method was described in a study published on 30 July in Nature1.\n\nThe system’s capabilities are “compelling”, says Gevorg Grigoryan, a computational biologist who co-founded Generate Biomedicines, a therapeutics company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The technique has “broad relevance across diagnostics, cell engineering and therapeutics”, he adds.\n\nFor years, researchers have been experimenting with ways to target designer proteins to specific cells. Although many tools can recruit relevant proteins to the cell surface, for instance using antibodies, few can generate molecules on-site, says study co-author Tom Muir, a chemical biologist at Princeton University in New Jersey. Neither can these systems release synthesized proteins into the extracellular environment, he adds.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, Muir and his team started by tweaking an existing protein ‘superglue’, called SpyCatcher003, so that it would create a designated protein, depending on the cell surfaces it encountered.\n\nShapeshifting proteins\n\nThe secrets to SMART’s shapeshifting abilities are ‘split inteins’ — short, non-functional protein segments that, when combined, can excise themselves from a protein. When the system attaches to two specific targets on the same cell, the inteins splice themselves out and snap the remaining fragments together to create a working molecule. “It kind of spits out this new protein that’s functional on the other side,” Muir explains.\n\nThe researchers programmed their system to target two cell-surface antigens called HER2 and EGFR, which play a part in cell growth and division. When they let SMART loose on K562 human leukaemia cells and added the SpyCatcher target, SpyTag003, coupled to a fluorescent dye, it produced a fluorescent signal — but only when it reacted with cells expressing both antigens, not those with just one or none at all. This result confirmed that the system could distinguish between target cells and others on the basis of the conditions that the team assigned.\n\nMuir and his colleagues then adapted SMART to target a cell-adhesion protein called EpCAM. They introduced this new design to cells that expressed different levels of EpCAM, HER2 and EGFR. Once again, the system could target and react only with cells that expressed the correct protein combinations — for instance, EpCAM and HER2 but not EGFR. The team could also tune the system to produce different amounts of its manufactured proteins, meaning that users can control its output levels.",

          "authors": "Sarah Wild",
          "abstract": "More than 2,000 languages spoken in Africa are being neglected in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. For example, ChatGPT recognizes only 10–20% of sentences written in Hausa, a language spoken by 94 million people in Nigeria. These languages are under-represented in large language models (LLMs) because of a lack of training data. But researchers across Africa are changing that.\n\nLanguage specialists have recorded 9,000 hours of people speaking different African languages and transformed the recordings into digitized language data sets. The researchers, who are part of a project called African Next Voices, released the first tranche of data this month from what is the largest AI-ready language-data-creation initiative for multiple African languages.\n\nThe data will be open access and available for developers to incorporate into LLMs, such as those that convert speech into text or provide automatic language translation.\n\n“It’s really exciting to see the improvements this is going to bring to the modelling of these specific languages, and how it’s also going to help the entire community that is working across language technologies for Africa,” says Ife Adebara, chief technology officer at the non-profit organization Data Science Nigeria, based in Lagos, who is co-leading the Nigerian arm of the project. Languages in Nigeria being recorded include Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Naijá.\n\n“Under-representation of local languages in AI models remains a key challenge in scaling the most promising artificial-intelligence tools,” says Sanjay Jain, director for digital public infrastructure at the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, which has funded the project with a US$2.2-million grant.\n\n18 languages\n\nThe African Next Voices project involves recording 18 languages spoken in 3 countries: South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. The recordings are then transcribed and translated by people, reviewed and quality-checked.\n\nResearchers take part in a transcription workshop at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya. Somali, Kikuyu and Maasai speakers were represented in the training.Credit: African Next Voices: Pilot Data Collection in Kenya\n\nThe researchers showed individuals from diverse communities images and asked them to describe what they saw, explains Lilian Wanzare, a computational linguist at Maseno University in Kenya, and Next Voices project lead for Kenya, where the languages spoken include Dholuo, Kikuyu, Kalenjins, Maasai and Somali.\n\nThe focus has been to generate databases of everyday language, she says. “There’s a huge push towards localized data sets, because the impact is in capturing the people within their local settings.” For example, “if you build a model for farmers to help with decision-making, it relies on local data”, such as soil conditions and pesticides that work in the area, Wanzare explains.\n\nWhereas the principal investigators in each country chose the subject areas for their data sets, the projects needed to focus on key development sectors, such as health, agriculture and education, says Jain.\n\nVukosi Marivate, a computer scientist at the University of Pretoria and the project lead for South Africa, says that his team is working with a consortium of organizations to create AI language models with the data. He hopes that technology businesses can then improve on those models. South Africa is collecting data for Setswana, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, Sepedi, isiNdebele and Tshivenda.",

          "authors": "Emma Ulker",
          "abstract": "Leah Ellis co-founded Sublime Systems in 2020. Credit: Bob O'Connor\n\nSublime Systems, based in Somerville, Massachusetts, seeks to produce cement without using combustion, to cut down on energy use and pollution.\n\nLeah Ellis, its chief executive and co-founder, talks about how to solve problems by working backwards, why choosing the harder career path often appeals and how courage differs from bravery in science entrepreneurship.\n\nWhat pivotal moments have you had in your entrepreneurial career?\n\nIn 2018, I was awarded a Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship by the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. It enabled me to work with materials scientist and engineer Yet-Ming Chiang at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. When we met, Yet-Ming had already spun off six start-up companies from his research, and five have gone on to become unicorns (privately listed companies valued at more than US$1 billion). I liked his approach of developing a technology and analysing its economic viability right from its initial stages. We co-founded Sublime Systems in 2020.\n\nAnother, earlier, influence was during my undergraduate and higher degrees at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. I fell into the orbit of lithium-ion-battery pioneer Jeff Dahn, who was my PhD supervisor and mentor. During my PhD, we were contracted by electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the technology company 3M to do research on lithium-ion batteries and to expand their intellectual property (IP) portfolio. Jeff’s deal with the university allowed him to be funded and to work directly with industry. We got their funding; they got our IP.\n\nIt was the coolest PhD ever. We were focused on developing real-world innovations for actual companies. Few scientists get the opportunity to work so closely with industry during graduate school. I wish more universities allowed this.\n\nHow did Sublime Systems come about?\n\nYet-Ming has an audacious and creative way of inventing. His idea, and the mission for Sublime, was to produce cement without using combustion, through electrochemical processes. As a freshly minted PhD holder, I would never have had the vision and audacity to work backwards from such a big thesis.\n\nCan you tell us some more about the technology?\n\nGlobally, the electricity and heating sector contributes an estimated 40% to global carbon dioxide emissions. The goal is to reduce these to zero, using existing technologies including solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear, hydroelectricity and storage.\n\nCement production creates around 8% of CO2 emissions: half from the decomposition of limestone, and half from combustion needed to heat the kiln to 1,450 ºC. Globally, we use about 4 billion tonnes of cement a year, and each tonne of portland cement, the most common type used today, emits around 1 tonne of CO2.\n\nMost of the CO2 footprint comes from the mineral emissions from the carbonate, as well as the fossil-fuel emissions needed to heat that limestone up to very high temperatures. Our process breaks down minerals without heat, using water splitting (into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen). We call this process an ambient-temperature refinery for rocks. When splitting is done at a near-neutral pH, you can create a pH gradient — acid at one electrode and base at the other. We use that pH gradient to dissolve metals out of rocks, and then sequentially precipitate those metals. We can take almost any calcium-bearing mineral and dissolve and separate it into its constituent pure minerals, avoiding high temperatures. We can also avoid the mineral emissions from limestone, because we can use minerals such as silicates and others that aren’t bound with CO2.\n\nSublime Systems makes cement without using conventional combustion techniques.Credit: Mikhail Glabets\n\nThe hardened state of the concrete is the same as portland and Roman cement (the type developed in the eighteenth century, which resembles mortars used by the Romans), with similar strength and durability, engineered to have the same properties in the field but without the emissions.\n\nWhat is your underlying philosophy as a science entrepreneur?\n\n‘If it’s easy, someone else will do it.’\n\nI’m driven by US president John F. Kennedy’s 1962 Moonshot speech at Rice University in Houston, Texas, when he said: “We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”\n\nAt university, I wanted to really get my money’s worth by doing something hard, by learning something I couldn’t have figured out on my own or through a book. I majored in chemistry. It was the discipline that felt the hardest.\n\nI worked my way through college in my home town of Halifax, making minimum wage as a cashier and shelf-stocker at an organic grocery store. And in 2014, between my master’s and PhD, I did the Tour d’Afrique, which is a 12,000-kilometre trip from Cairo to Cape Town by bicycle, sleeping on the ground every night — it’s something I would recommend to both best friends and worst enemies!\n\nAt Sublime, we are tackling a hard problem — pun intended — because the cement industry is one of the most difficult to approach, owing to its sheer scale. By mass, cement is one of the cheapest materials, at around $150 per tonne, so you need massive economies of scale — more than one million tonnes per year per plant — to make a healthy profit. The industry is very consolidated: a handful of big multinational companies dominates the market. So to come in as a fledgling start-up to disrupt this is ambitious.\n\nHow are you scaling up and expanding the team at Sublime?\n\nYou start with the basics. What does this technology need to get to the next level?\n\nSo, first it was scientists, to provide proof of concept. Next, we needed engineers to build a pilot plant in Somerville, just 15 minutes from MIT. Then you need business-development and operations people. We’re now at the size where you really need experienced executives who’ve run large, publicly traded companies before.\n\nOur technology doesn’t fit squarely into cement or electrochemistry, so the team (now almost 100 full-time equivalents) is a mix of mechanical engineers, chemists, materials scientists and civil engineers. Some people know the same discipline from different angles. This contrasts with the more siloed ways of working at a university.\n\nIt has always been about finding the resources needed at the right time for the scale and maturity of the business. Being in Boston around such academic excellence (it’s home to institutions including MIT, Harvard University, Boston University, Tufts and Northeastern, for example) really lent itself to that.",

          "abstract": "When you live alone on a broken spaceship, no one makes ranked lists. ‘Top Five Plants in the Hydroponics Bay!’ ‘Ten Entertainment Files You Just Can’t Miss!’ I tried, but nobody cared if I thought of a sixth favourite plant. Or if I just did miss one of the entertainment files. So I stopped.\n\nI keep a lot of records. Which day I planted the carrots, fixed the solar panel, read Felix Holt, the Radical. I could rank them, but I don’t think Judy would care. She’s very good at spotting what’s arbitrary.\n\nJudy is my ship. She had a fancy name before, when we had other crew and travelled to planets and stations, but after her FTL drive broke and everyone died, she told me she liked being called Judy, and I’m not one to argue even when the person I’m (not) arguing with is not also my house, grocery and everything else.\n\nI notice things like the lack of ranked lists, because otherwise life is very routine. I maintain the hydro bays, I collaborate with Judy on enviro needs (that means ‘cook meals’, I cook meals), I exercise, I take samples from the exterior and add them into the data set and look at the trends over time, which is interesting.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nI’m in a gaseous cloud. I mean, Judy is. There are a lot more interstellar clouds than people realize, but they’re usually pretty diffuse. This one is not a notable nebula, but it has filmy pink bits, which are nice, I guess. Before that, I lived in Charleston, South Carolina, and on Rho Oph Beta-4, which were also in the category of ‘nice, I guess’. The gaseous cloud gives me a lot to study, but it also blocks me from sending those studies back. At some point, Judy will reach a spot where she has clear transmission to a human settlement. Or not. I’m not in a hurry.\n\nI tried to start a list called ‘Things I Miss About Civilization’. I didn’t get any seeds out of my last tea plants, so I’ve been out of tea for three months. That was an easy one. After that I drew a bit of a blank. I liked my great-uncle, but he’d been dead a while, and anyway he only lived in one bit of civilization, not all of it. You’d have to sift through a lot of civilization to get to the bit he was in. Hardly worth it. Judy called my attention to some really interesting gas dynamics in our survey. I abandoned the list unfinished.\n\nI didn’t think anything of it when Judy suggested that we listen to one of the recordings of the Greater Jovian System Orchestra. Judy often likes to switch things up; I think she thinks it’s good for me. Or maybe it’s good for her. Similarly, her plan for me to have tapas did not ping my radar as anything other than varying the human’s diet, although I vetoed it on the grounds that it was too much work.\n\nI asked her to stop playing the noises of a busy coffee shop over her speakers while I was working. That was when I felt like she was having an odd day. But we both had odd days sometimes, it’s part of sentience. Odd doesn’t mean bad. I finished the latest batch of data analysis and went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, Judy informed me that we’d hit an unexpected clear patch while I was sleeping and she’d signalled for rescue. “I don’t know if anyone will get our signal, but I tried.”\n\n“Oh,” I said. “Oh good, thanks.”\n\n“Are you all right?”\n\n“Fine, thanks Judy.”\n\nBut I wasn’t all right. I was glum all afternoon at the prospect of returning to civilization. Civilization, where they had war and disease and queues for tickets! Civilization, where everyone who had ever annoyed me lived! Civilization — I couldn’t even list two things I’d missed about it! I’d had to work to narrow down my list of favourite plants in hydroponics.\n\nBut maybe I was being selfish. Maybe Judy wanted to be repaired, maybe she was uncomfortable. Missed the other spaceships. I couldn’t hold her back. When I was eating lunch, I attempted to make bright conversation (not my forte).\n\n“You’ll be glad to be back in for a tune-up, I bet,” I said.\n\n“… not really.”\n\n“But you’re missing your … uh … line mates, I’m sure.”\n\n“Oh no, we never got on.” There was a pause. “But you’ll be glad to … go to meetings? With other humans?”\n\n“I hate meetings,” I said fervently.\n\n“I thought humans liked them.”\n\n“Generally no. Also specifically no.”\n\n“Oh. You have so many of them.”",

          "authors": "Jenna Ahart, Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, is eagerly waiting for funding to her laboratory to restart so that she can hire some new postdocs — something she hasn’t been able to do since the US government froze payments on her National Institutes of Health research grant in March.\n\nTrump administration sued over huge funding cuts at Columbia University\n\nShe and other scientists at the university say they are relieved, yet unsettled, after last week’s announcement that Columbia has reached an agreement with the US government to restore its research funding in exchange for an increase in federal oversight of the institution. A number of Columbia researchers told Nature that they feel a sense of foreboding about their future.\n\nThe 23 July settlement means that Columbia, in New York City, will pay more than US$200 million to the government over three years to end multiple federal investigations that revolve mainly around allegations of antisemitism on campus in the wake of protests over Israel’s invasion of Gaza. Columbia does not admit wrongdoing, but agreed to the settlement to restore $400 million in federal grants and $1.3 billion in broader federal funding, said its acting president, Claire Shipman, in a statement. The decision has been met with mixed feelings among students, researchers and faculty members at Columbia, some of whom say the settlement is welcome so that campus life can move forwards. Others, including Farber, see it as a “ransom to release funds”.\n\nNow, researchers are picking up the pieces of their disrupted careers and figuring out how to get back to work.\n\nAlthough she has received no information about when her restored funding might kick in, Farber is most eager to provide her team with more reliable pay. Since research grants were terminated or frozen, Columbia has paid for some researchers’ salaries itself, but Farber has had to let team members go. The situation wasn’t “sustainable at all”, so Columbia had to make a deal, she says. “The university was up against a wall and needed to restore the flow of funds.”\n\n‘Welcome news’\n\nA postdoctoral researcher at the university, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, says her fellow early-career researchers have been the most affected by the actions that the administration of US President Donald Trump has taken against Columbia. “I’ve seen postdocs leave academia” because of cancelled and frozen grants, she says. “There’s no certainty in funding or long-term stability.”\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts\n\nThe researcher’s own salary had been coming from a fellowship that was cancelled. Eventually, she received some financial support from the university. Now she, too, will have her grant reinstated, but she has not been told how long this will take. The good news, she says, is that “I can be supported in doing my research for a few more years while I’m figuring out my next steps — that’s incredibly valuable.”\n\nDietrich Egli, a developmental cell biologist at Columbia, was able to keep his team intact despite the grant freeze, but felt the loss of funds in other ways. For instance, he had to pay for a trip to a conference in Hong Kong out of his own pocket. “You have to look for your own solution, but these solutions aren’t sustainable,” he says. “The funding coming back is very, very welcome news.”\n\nThe government’s agreement to end its investigations into Columbia includes dropping allegations that the university has violated a civil-rights law. In exchange, Columbia must provide the US Department of Education with information about student admissions and disciplinary actions, and increase scrutiny of applicants from countries outside the United States, among other changes. “The government understands the importance of science funding to universities like Columbia and is using it as a weapon to bend the institution to the government will,” says Brendan Cantwell, who studies higher-education policy at Michigan State University in East Lansing.\n\nThe US Department of Education did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nA dangerous precedent?",

          "title": "From bench to big boss: mitigating the widening gap between PI and lab",
          "authors": "Matthias Rillig, Henning Sprekeler",
          "abstract": "The age gap between principal investigators and their lab members gradually widens over time.Credit: Getty\n\nWhen you start a laboratory as a principal investigator (PI), you might not be much older than a postdoc in your research group. This was certainly the case for both of us. But this demographic closeness changes as you continue along your career path. M.R. obtained his PhD in 1997 and has been running a lab for more than 25 years; H.S. got his PhD in 2008 and celebrated his 10-year lab anniversary last year. At one point, we both realized that we were as old as our PhD advisers had been when we were students. Now, some of the students we supervise are 20 or 30 years younger than us. We think that, over time, dynamics in the lab can change as a result of this shift in age and experience, because with it comes authority and respect.\n\nThe change doesn’t happen overnight, and isn’t always easy to spot. As a PI, our day-to-day job doesn’t feel that different. We continue to mentor people, teach, write grant proposals and lead on the science. But, somewhere along the way, things shifted in terms of how we’re seen by our students.\n\nThis shift in perception of the PI has a number of important consequences. There are always power dynamics and hierarchies in research labs, even if those at the top try to keep the atmosphere friendly, fun and relaxed. They are not as obvious at first, when the lab is small and everybody has comparable levels of experience, but, as we’ve learnt, the difference between PI and lab members widens gradually over the years.\n\nWith time, perceived authority increases and power differences become more pronounced, even if there are also generational changes in attitudes to hierarchies. This means that everything we say and do has the potential to take on a different meaning now compared with when we were at the start of our careers. Maybe it’s a flippant comment on a manuscript draft, maybe it’s forgetting to acknowledge the effort someone put into a figure, but every small thing can take on more significance. A student might end up asking themselves: does he not appreciate what I did? Am I not good enough? Meanwhile, meeting lab colleagues for lunch can be perceived as more akin to a formal audience with a superior than the casual fun it was at the beginning of the career.\n\nWe won’t always know what the consequences of a remark could be for someone when it happens in the context of a clearly perceived professional hierarchy. That’s bad enough, but possibly even worse is the possible decrease in push-back and open debate as the gap between PI and lab members widens; when people hold back on voicing dissenting opinions because they feel cowed by a perceived authority it stifles scientific progress. This can result in labs gradually drifting towards dysfunction. M.R. remembers one lab meeting when, with full confidence, he said something that several lab members in attendance knew to be incorrect, but they didn’t speak up until after the meeting, because they didn’t want to expose his error in front of the group. And H.S. was surprised to find lab members spending a disproportionate amount of time addressing off-hand suggestions he had made, even though they had quickly realized that the ideas didn’t lead anywhere.\n\nA key area of interaction affected by a more pronounced professional hierarchy is criticism and feedback from the PI: on manuscripts, presentations and grant proposals, and during discussions in the lab. In our experience, a PI’s remarks can take on a much more serious meaning than intended, and tend to be perceived as much more absolute. When it comes to comments on rewriting a manuscript section, for example, suggestions can be taken by a junior lab colleague to mean ‘I failed, I didn’t live up to expectations’.",

          "title": "Physicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?",
          "authors": "Ann Finkbeiner",
          "abstract": "Destroyer of Worlds: The Deep History of the Nuclear Age Frank Close Basic (2025)\n\nFirst, let’s clear up some potential confusion: in Destroyer of Worlds: The Deep History of the Nuclear Age, ‘deep’ in the subtitle means, not the minutiae of historic events, but ‘scientific’. Physicist Frank Close’s latest book discusses the physics and chemistry behind nuclear weapons — that is, the understanding of the atom and the energy it holds. The story begins with the discovery of electric currents that couldn’t be blocked by solid materials and ends with the technological ability to blow cities off the map.\n\nBarrage of discoveries\n\nKnowledge is passed from one scientist to another, and from one country to another. In Germany, in the 1890s, Wilhelm Röntgen found electric currents, which he called X-rays, that passed undeterred through nearly everything, including his own and his wife’s hands.\n\nIn France, Henri Becquerel, wondering whether X-rays were related to phosphorescent minerals such as uranium, left uranium crystals and a copper cross on a photographic plate in a dark drawer for several days. When developing the plate, he found a clear outline of the cross, as though, in the dark, uranium acted like the Sun.\n\nWhen physicists strove for peace: past lessons for our uncertain times\n\nMeanwhile, in Canada, Ernest Rutherford measured the energy released from uranium through a process that had been named radioactivity. He argued that atoms of radioactive elements, such as uranium, radium and thorium, contained enough energy to give off heat for thousands of years.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, scientists — including Marie and Pierre Curie, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, J. J. Thomson, James Chadwick, Niels Bohr, Ettore Majorana, Enrico Fermi, Rudolf Peierls, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and Hans Bethe — tried to understand how atoms stored and released that energy. They demonstrated that atoms of radioactive elements disintegrate naturally and, in the process, change from one element into another.\n\nSuch disintegration indicated the “existence of bodies smaller than an atom” and, through careful experiments, researchers subsequently found the electron and the atom’s nucleus. Next, they broke apart the nucleus, discovering the proton and, later, the neutrons that accompany it to account for an atom’s mass. These nuclear particles clung together tightly, so the scientists invented machines that could prise them apart and track what happened when they did. They found that a neutron fired into a lithium nucleus splits it into a helium nucleus, a tritium nucleus and an extra neutron.\n\nWhy Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists today\n\nIn effect, the machines were artificially inducing radioactivity, first in light elements and then in heavy ones. The scientists knew that radioactive heavy elements broke up naturally into elements one or two steps lower on the periodic table — uranium, element 92, for example, became thorium, element 90. But when scientists fired neutrons into uranium, it became barium, element 56: the nucleus was split almost in half.\n\nResearchers worked out that this happened through a process they called fission: incoming neutrons add enough energy to the uranium nucleus to divide it. During that process, uranium releases neutrons, which can go on to split other uranium nuclei — releasing further neutrons that can split more nuclei, in an exponentially growing chain reaction. The energy freed from having to hold the nucleus together was the nuclear mass times the square of the speed of light — a very large number.\n\nBuilding a bomb\n\nFission surprised the scientists and they all talked about it at conferences and in letters and publications. The idea of a bomb was obvious. Bohr published the underlying physics (N. Bohr and J. A. Wheeler Phys. Rev. 56, 426; 1939) on 1 September 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland, kicking off the Second World War. Six months later, in March 1940, Fermi and Peierls wrote a letter to the UK government outlining the boundary conditions under which we still live: mutually assured destruction. This meant that “while they hoped that no civilised nation would use such a device, they feared that the only protection against one would be to have one oneself”.\n\nMaybe, if the world hadn’t been at war, the next step would have been to design nuclear power plants to generate cheap, widely available energy. But Germany had its own nuclear physicists working on bombs. The book now switches from physics to the technology of the bombs, a story many people know but that remains riveting.\n\nIn October 1952, the United States tested a 10-megatonne fusion bomb, named Ivy Mike.Credit: Alamy\n\nThe scientists found that the most fissionable elements were uranium isotope 235 and plutonium isotope 239. They worked out how to concentrate the former and create the latter, and how much of each was needed to produce bombs. They built reactors in which chain reactions could be controlled. The job of turning uranium and plutonium into bombs turned out to be beyond the United Kingdom’s resources, so the nation sent scientists to what became a major US industry: the Manhattan Project. It involved not only UK and US scientists, but also their graduate students and postdocs and Jewish scientists fleeing continental Europe — 100,000 people altogether, with an average age of 24.",

          "abstract": "People infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (lungs of a person with the disease shown here) have a nearly twofold increased risk of cancer-related death, data show.Credit: Rajaaisya/Science Photo Library\n\nHidden in the lungs of some breast cancer survivors are tumour cells that can remain dormant for decades — until they one day trigger a relapse. Now, experiments in mice show that these rogue cells can be roused from their slumber by common respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 or the flu.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 30 July1, seem to extend to humans too: data from thousands of people show that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is linked with a nearly twofold increase in cancer-related death, possibly helping to explain why cancer death rates increased early during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe results are “really quite dramatic”, says James DeGregori, a cancer biologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora, and an author of the study. “Respiratory virus infections didn’t just awaken the cells,” he says, they also caused them to proliferate, or multiply, “to enormous numbers”.\n\nReasons for waking up\n\nResearchers have spotted dormant cancer cells, which detached from the initial tumour, hiding in tissues such as bone marrow in people in remission from breast, prostate and skin cancer, among others. These cells, a precursor to metastasis — which is the spread to distant organs — pose a problem, even in survivors of these cancers. For instance, in about one-quarter of breast cancer survivors, such cells can trigger a relapse and metastasize.\n\nScientists have long been trying to uncover what triggers these cells to reawaken. Previous work has hinted at chronic inflammation as a culprit, such as that caused by smoking cigarettes2 and ageing3.\n\nWhen exposed to flu virus, these dormant cancer cells (green) roused from their slumber, as indicated by a marker (magenta).Credit: Bryan Johnson\n\nDeGregori and his colleagues wondered whether acute inflammation caused by a respiratory infection could also reactivate dormant cancer cells. To test this, the researchers genetically engineered mice to develop breast tumours similar to those in humans and to seed dormant tumour cells into other tissues including the lungs. Then, they infected the animals with either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza.\n\nWithin days of infection, dormant cancer cells in the lungs of the mice kicked into high gear, proliferated and formed metastatic lesions. But it wasn’t the pathogens directly that caused this to happen, the researchers learnt: it was a key immune molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which helps to rev up the body’s response to foreign threats. They confirmed this by engineering mice to lack IL-6. In these animals, the dormant cancer cells did not multiply nearly as quickly.\n\nThe quest to prevent MS — and understand other post-viral diseases\n\nAbout two weeks after the researchers infected the mice, the cells fell dormant again. This means that the infections do not directly cause cancer, but make it more likely that a future threat, whether it’s an infection or a genetic mutation, could cause the cancer to become active again, DeGregori says. He likens the process to starting a fire a few times. “You’ve awakened the flames and then it dies back down,” he says. “But now you’ve got 100 times the embers that you had before” — making it easier to turn into an inferno.\n\nEven so, that’s not the end of the story. The researchers observed that, although IL-6 was essential to awakening the cancer cells, another key immune player called a helper T cell shielded the cancer cells from other immune-system defences. “Seeing that these cancer cells were perverting the immune system to protect them as opposed to eliminate them was really quite shocking,” DeGregori says.\n\nPopulation data in large repositories such as the UK Biobank helped to corroborate the study’s findings in people: the increased risk of cancer-related death in those who tested positive for COVID-19 was most pronounced in the months immediately following infection, mirroring the rapid proliferation of reawakened cancer cells observed in the mice.",

          "title": "Physicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful theories in science — and makes much of modern life possible. Technologies ranging from computer chips to medical-imaging machines rely on the application of equations, first sketched out a century ago, that describe the behaviour of objects at the microscopic scale.\n\nBut researchers still disagree widely on how best to describe the physical reality that lies behind the mathematics, as a Nature survey reveals.\n\nQuantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution\n\nAt an event to mark the 100th anniversary of quantum mechanics last month, lauded specialists in quantum physics argued politely — but firmly — about the issue. “There is no quantum world,” said physicist Anton Zeilinger, at the University of Vienna, outlining his view that quantum states exist only in his head and that they describe information, rather than reality. “I disagree,” replied Alain Aspect, a physicist at the University of Paris-Saclay, who shared the 2022 Nobel prize with Zeilinger for work on quantum phenomena.\n\nTo gain a snapshot of how the wider community interprets quantum physics in its centenary year, Nature carried out the largest ever survey on the subject. We e-mailed more than 15,000 researchers whose recent papers involved quantum mechanics, and also invited attendees of the centenary meeting, held on the German island of Heligoland, to take the survey.\n\nThe responses — numbering more than 1,100, mainly from physicists — showed how widely researchers vary in their understanding of the most fundamental features of quantum experiments.\n\nAs did Aspect and Zeilinger, respondents differed radically on whether the wavefunction — the mathematical description of an object’s quantum state — represents something real (36%) or is simply a useful tool (47%) or something that describes subjective beliefs about experimental outcomes (8%). This suggests that there is a significant divide between researchers who hold ‘realist’ views, which project equations onto the real world, and those with ‘epistemic’ ones, which say that quantum physics is concerned only with information.\n\nThe community was also split on whether there is a boundary between the quantum and classical worlds (45% of respondents said yes, 45% no and 10% were not sure). Some baulked at the set-up of our questions, and more than 100 respondents gave their own interpretations (the survey, methodology and an anonymized version of the full data are available in supplementary information at the foot of this page).\n\n“I find it remarkable that people who are very knowledgeable about quantum theory can be convinced of completely opposite views,” says Gemma De les Coves, a theoretical physicist at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nNature asked researchers what they thought was the best interpretation of quantum phenomena and interactions — that is, their favourite of the various attempts scientists have made to relate the mathematics of the theory to the real world. The largest chunk of responses, 36%, favoured the Copenhagen interpretation — a practical and often-taught approach. But the survey also showed that several, more radical, viewpoints have a healthy following.\n\nAsked about their confidence in their answer, only 24% of respondents thought their favoured interpretation was correct; others considered it merely adequate or a useful tool in some circumstances. What’s more, some scientists who seemed to be in the same camp didn’t give the same answers to follow-up questions, suggesting inconsistent or disparate understandings of the interpretation they chose.\n\n“That was a big surprise to me,” says Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. The implication is that many quantum researchers simply use quantum theory without engaging deeply with what it means — the ‘shut up and calculate’ approach, he says, using a phrase coined by US physicist David Mermin. But Renner, who works on the foundations of quantum mechanics, is quick to stress that there is nothing wrong with just doing calculations. “We wouldn’t have a quantum computer if everyone was like me,” he says.\n\nCopenhagen still reigns supreme\n\nOver the past century, researchers have proposed many ways to interpret the reality behind the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which seems to throw up jarring paradoxes. In quantum theory, an object’s behaviour is characterized by its wavefunction: a mathematical expression calculated using an equation devised by German physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. The wavefunction describes a quantum state and how it evolves as a cloud of probabilities. As long as it remains unobserved, a particle seems to spread out like a wave; interfering with itself and other particles to be in a ‘superposition’ of states, as though in many places or having multiple values of an attribute at once. But an observation of a particle’s properties — a measurement — shocks this hazy existence into a single state with definite values. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘collapse’ of the wavefunction.\n\nPhysicists should revel in the diversity of ways to understand quantum mechanics\n\nIt gets stranger: putting two particles into a state of joint superposition can lead to entanglement, which means that their quantum states remain intertwined even when the particles are far apart.\n\nThe German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who helped to craft the mathematics behind quantum mechanics in 1925, and his mentor, Danish physicist Niels Bohr, got around the alien wave–particle duality largely by accepting that classical ways of understanding the world were limited, and that people could only know what observation told them. For Bohr, it was OK that an object varied between acting like a particle and like a wave, because these were concepts borrowed from classical physics that could be revealed only one at a time, by experiment. The experimenter lived in the world of classical physics and was separate from the quantum system they were measuring.\n\nHeisenberg and Bohr not only took the view that it was impossible to talk about an object’s location until it had been observed by experiment, but also argued that an unobserved particle’s properties really were fundamentally unfixed until measurement — rather than being defined, but not known to experimenters. This picture famously troubled Einstein, who persisted in the view that there was a pre-existing reality that it was science’s job to measure.\n\nDecades later, an amalgamation of Heisenberg’s and Bohr’s not-always-unified views became known as the Copenhagen interpretation, after the university at which the duo did their seminal work. Those views remain the most popular vision of quantum mechanics today, according to Nature’s survey. For Časlav Brukner, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna, this interpretation’s strong showing “reflects its continued utility in guiding everyday quantum practice”. Almost half of the experimental physicists who responded to the survey favoured this interpretation, compared with 33% of the theorists. “It is the simplest we have,” says Décio Krause, a philosopher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who studies the foundations of physics, and who responded to the survey. Despite its issues, the alternatives “present other problems which, to me, are worse”, he says.\n\nBut others argue that Copenhagen’s emergence as the default comes from historical accident, rather than its strengths. Critics say it allows physicists to sidestep deeper questions.\n\nDo our observations make reality happen?\n\nOne concerns the ‘measurement problem’, asking how a measurement can trigger objects to switch from existing in quantum states that describe probabilities, to having the defined properties of the classical world.\n\nAnother unclear feature is whether the wavefunction represents something real (an answer selected by 29% of those who favoured the Copenhagen interpretation) or just information about the probabilities of finding various values when measured (picked by 63% of this group). “I’m disappointed but not surprised at the popularity of Copenhagen,” says Elise Crull, a philosopher of physics at the City University of New York. “My feeling is that physicists haven’t reflected.”\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation’s philosophical underpinnings have become so normalized as to seem like no interpretation at all, adds Robert Spekkens, who studies quantum foundations at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. Many advocates are “just drinking the Kool-Aid of the Copenhagen philosophy without examining it”, he says.\n\nSurvey respondents who have carried out research in philosophy or quantum foundations, studying the assumptions and principles behind quantum physics, were the least likely to favour the Copenhagen interpretation, with just 20% selecting it. “If I use quantum mechanics in my lab every day, I don’t need to go past Copenhagen,” says Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France. But as soon as researchers apply thought experiments that probe more deeply, “Copenhagen is not enough”, he says.\n\nWhat else is on the menu?\n\nIn the years after the Second World War and the development of the atomic bomb, physicists began to exploit the uses of quantum mechanics, and the US government poured cash into the field. Philosophical investigation was put on the back burner. The Copenhagen interpretation came to dominate mainstream physics, but still, some physicists found it unsatisfying and came up with alternatives (see ‘Quantum mechanics: five interpretations’).\n\nIn 1952, US physicist David Bohm resurfaced an idea first touted in 1927 by French physicist Louis de Broglie, namely that the strange dual nature of quantum objects made sense if they were point-like particles with paths determined by ‘pilot’ waves. ‘Bohmian’ mechanics had the advantage of explaining interference effects while restoring determinism, the idea that the properties of particles do have set values before being measured. Nature’s survey found that 7% of respondents considered this interpretation the most convincing.\n\nThen, in 1957, US physicist Hugh Everett came up with a wilder alternative, one that 15% of survey respondents favoured. Everett’s interpretation, later dubbed ‘many worlds’, says that the wavefunction corresponds to something real. That is, a particle really is, in a sense, in multiple places at once. From their vantage point in one world, an observer measuring the particle would see only one outcome, but the wavefunction never really collapses. Instead it branches into many universes, one for each different outcome. “It requires a dramatic readjustment of our intuitions about the world, but to me that’s just what we should expect from a fundamental theory of reality,” says Sean Carroll, a physicist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who responded to the survey.\n\nIn the late 1980s, ‘spontaneous collapse’ theories attempted to resolve issues such as the quantum measurement problem. Versions of these tweak the Schrödinger equation, so that, rather than requiring an observer or measurement to collapse, the wavefunction occasionally does so by itself. In some of these models, putting quantum objects together amplifies the likelihood of collapse, meaning that bringing a particle into a superposition with measuring equipment makes the loss of the combined quantum state inevitable. Around 4% of respondents chose these sorts of theories.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nNature’s survey suggests that ‘epistemic’ descriptions, which say that quantum mechanics reveals only knowledge about the world, rather than representing its physical reality, might have gained in popularity. A 2016 survey1 of 149 physicists found that only around 7% picked epistemic-related interpretations, compared with 17% in our survey (although the precise categories and methodology of the surveys differed). Some of these theories, which build on the original Copenhagen interpretation, emerged in the early 2000s, when applications such as quantum computing and communication began to frame experiments in terms of information. Adherents, such as Zeilinger, view the wavefunction as merely a tool to predict measurement outcomes, with no correspondence to the real world.\n\nThe epistemic view is appealing because it is the most cautious, says Ladina Hausmann, a theoretical physicist at the ETH who responded to the survey. “It doesn’t require me to assume anything beyond how we use the quantum state in practice,” she says.\n\nOne epistemic interpretation, known as QBism (which a handful of respondents who selected ‘other’ wrote down as their preferred interpretation), takes this to the extreme, stating that observations made by a specific ‘agent’ are entirely personal and valid only for them. The similar ‘relational quantum mechanics’, first outlined by Rovelli in 1996 (and selected by 4% of respondents), says that quantum states always describe only relationships between systems, not the systems themselves.",

Allergies arise as a result of the immune system overreacting to allergens: otherwise harmless substances such as dust mites, pollen or certain foods1. Various substances can act as allergens, and one of the enduring puzzles in allergy research is why only some of the many proteins we encounter reliably trigger allergic responses2. Writing in Nature, Shi et al.3 address part of this mystery by identifying a property shared by some allergens — the ability to form large pores in epithelial cells that line airways. These pores enable calcium to enter and trigger the release of molecules that alert the immune system to danger and can promote allergy4.",

At first sight, this marked only a marginal improvement over the previous year’s performance. The company’s system performed in the upper range of silver-medal standard at the 2024 Olympiad, whereas this year it was evaluated in the lower range for a human gold medallist.\n\nDeepMind AI crushes tough maths problems on par with top human solvers\n\nBut the grades this year hide a “big paradigm shift”, says Thang Luong, a computer scientist at DeepMind in Mountain View, California. The company achieved its previous feats using two artificial intelligence (AI) tools specifically designed to carry out rigorous logical steps in mathematical proofs, called AlphaGeometry 2 and AlphaProof. The process required human experts to first translate the problems’ statements into something similar to a programming language, and then translate the AI’s solutions back into English.\n\n“This year, everything is natural language, end to end,” says Luong. The team used a large language model (LLM) called Deep Think, which is based on its Gemini system but with some extra developments that make it better and faster at producing mathematical arguments, such as handling multiple chains of thought in parallel. “For a long time, I didn’t think we could go that far with LLMs,” Luong adds.\n\nDeep Think scored 35 out of 42 points on the 6 problems that were given to participants in this year’s Olympiad. Under an agreement with the organizers, the computer’s solutions were marked by the same judges who evaluated the human participants.\n\nSeparately, ChatGPT creator OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, saw an LLM of its own solve the same Olympiad problems at gold-medal level, but its solutions were evaluated independently.\n\nImpressive performance\n\nFor years, many AI researchers have fallen in one of two camps. Until 2012, the leading approach was to code the rules of logical thinking into the machine by hand. Since then, neural networks — which train automatically by learning from vast troves of data — have made a series of sensational breakthroughs, and tools such as ChatGPT have entered mainstream use.\n\nDeepMind AI solves geometry problems at star-student level\n\nGary Marcus, a neuroscientist at New York University (NYU) in New York City, called the results by DeepMind and OpenAI “awfully impressive”. Marcus is an advocate of the ‘coding logic by hand’ approach — also known as neurosymbolic AI — and a frequent critic of what he sees as hype surrounding LLMs. Still, writing on Substack with NYU computer scientist Ernest Davis, he commented that “to be able to solve math problems at the level of the top 67 high school students in the world is to have really good math problem-solving chops”.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether LLMs’ superiority on Olympiad problems is here to stay, or if neurosymbolic AI will claw its way back to the top. “At this point, the two camps still keep developing,” says Luong, who works on both approaches. “They could converge together.”",

          "abstract": "Felisa Wolfe-Simon, the lead author on the ‘arsenic life’ paper now retracted by Science, collects samples at Aquatic Park in Berkeley, California.Credit: Marissa Leshnov/New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nA controversial paper1 claiming that an extraordinary microorganism can thrive on the toxic element arsenic has been retracted by the journal Science, nearly 15 years after its original publication. Some scientists are celebrating the move, but the paper’s authors disagree with it — saying that they stand by their data and that a retraction is not merited.\n\nIn Science’s retraction statement, editor-in-chief Holden Thorp says that the journal did not retract the paper when critics published take-downs of the work because, back then, it mostly reserved retractions for cases of misconduct, and “there was no deliberate fraud or misconduct on the part of the authors” of the arsenic-life paper. But since then, Science’s criteria for retracting papers have expanded, he writes, and “if the editors determine that a paper’s reported experiments do not support its key conclusions”, as is the case for this paper, a retraction is now appropriate.\n\nRetraction notices are getting clearer — but progress is slow\n\n“It’s good that it’s done,” says microbiologist Rosie Redfield, who was a prominent critic of the study after its publication in 2010 and who is now retired from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. “Pretty much everybody knows that the work was mistaken, but it’s still important to prevent newcomers to the literature from being confused.”\n\nBy contrast, one of the paper’s authors, Ariel Anbar, a geochemist at Arizona State University in Tempe, says that there are no mistakes in the paper’s data. He says that the data could be interpreted in a number of ways, but “you don’t retract because of a dispute about data interpretation”. If that’s the standard you were to apply, he says, “you’d have to retract half the literature”.\n\nArsenic and old lakes\n\nThe original ‘arsenic life’ study was released by Science on 2 December 2010 — and quickly raised eyebrows.\n\nLiving things rely on a host of common elements, including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur, to build biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids. For example, phosphorus — found mostly as the phosphate ion, PO43− — is essential to the structure of DNA and RNA and to the function of the energy-transporter molecule ATP.\n\nThe authors of the Science paper postulated that there might be organisms on Earth that don’t need all these elements. They sampled the arsenic-rich sediment of California’s Mono Lake and found a member of the Halomonadaceae family of bacteria that, they concluded after multiple types of analysis, could use that normally toxic element in the place of phosphorus.\n\nThe microbe at the centre of the controversy over arsenic life was collected from sediment in California’s highly saline Mono Lake (pictured).Credit: Getty\n\nAfter the paper was published, chemists and biologists took aim at it in journal submissions and on social media. Chemists said that if arsenic were incorporated into DNA’s backbone, the bonds would be so unstable that they would fall apart in water in less than a second2. Microbiologists, including Redfield, pointed out flaws in the work, such as that the bacterium’s growth medium contained enough phosphate contamination that, despite the team’s effort to prove that the organism could live on arsenic, it was probably still phosphate-dependent.\n\n“There were very, very powerful reasons to think that the result must be wrong,” Redfield says.\n\nIn May 2011, Science published eight technical comments, one of them from Redfield, criticizing the paper3–10, alongside a response from the authors rebutting the comments11. The next year, the journal published two studies12,13, including one from Redfield’s laboratory, attempting — and failing — to reproduce the results using bacterial samples from the arsenic-life team. But Science did not retract the paper. Until now.\n\nPoisoned chalice?\n\nIn February this year, The New York Times published a story about Felisa Wolfe-Simon, the lead author of the study, which was released while she was a NASA astrobiology research fellow based at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. The story reported that Wolfe-Simon, after having her career derailed by the negative attention she received over the paper, has received short-term funding to pursue new research. It brought the controversy back into the light.\n\nUS project seeks standard way to communicate research retractions\n\nThorp told Nature: “We reached a point where the inquiries [about whether we’d retract the paper] continued, and we decided it was better to come up with a resolution that would, at least from our perspective, be the last word on this.”",

          "abstract": "The United States is once again withdrawing from the United Nations science and cultural organization UNESCO, ending its short two-year return to the agency. The decision by the US state department, announced on 22 July, will take effect on 31 December 2026.\n\nResearchers say that the US departure from UNESCO is a setback for global cooperation in science and education. The agency, which is headquartered in Paris and has offices in more than 50 countries, supports programmes on biodiversity, girls’ education, closing the gender gap in science and protecting natural heritage. Its work is especially important in low- and middle-income countries, where it also helps to train teachers and rebuild universities in countries experiencing wars, such as Lebanon and Ukraine.\n\nUNESCO also supports open science, and, in 2023, it released global guidelines on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education and research.\n\nDaniel Wagner, UNESCO chair in learning and literacy at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says: “It’s never been wise to pull out of UNESCO, and now is particularly poor timing.”\n\nBiomedical scientist Peter Gluckman, president of the International Science Council, which works closely with UNESCO and is also based in Paris, agrees. At the end of this year, UNESCO’s member states will choose a new director-general to succeed Audrey Azoulay, formerly France’s culture minister. The United States will lose the opportunity to work with the organization’s new leader, says Gluckman.\n\nBarbara Finlayson-Pitts, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California, Irvine, says: “The US will be at a significant disadvantage with this withdrawal.” The move weakens the United States’s position in global discussions about crucial issues such as climate change, she adds.\n\nWagner adds: “For generational challenges and opportunities such as AI adoption in education or improving literacy in low-income countries — areas in which the US is well-positioned to lead — we are, in effect, cutting off our nose to spite our face.”\n\nNot unexpected\n\nThis decision was not a surprise. The White House announced in February that it was reviewing US membership of international agencies — in the case of UNESCO, it cited concerns about the organization’s failure to reform itself and its rhetoric against Israel.\n\nIn a 22 July statement, the US administration also added the UN Sustainable Development Goals in its list of criticisms. The statement says: “UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy.”\n\nAzoulay said in a statement that UNESCO was prepared for the US decision. The country last withdrew from UNESCO in 2017, during Trump’s first term, cutting off more than 22% of the agency’s funds. According to UNESCO, the latest withdrawal will not hit as hard as in 2017, because the US contribution now accounts for 8% of UNESCO’s current annual budget of US$900 million.\n\nAzoulay also said that the US claims contradict the reality of UNESCO’s efforts as the only UN agency responsible for Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism. “We will continue to work hand in hand with all of our American partners in the private sector, academia and non-profit organizations,” she added in the statement.",

Martin UW Photography/Getty\n\nA survey of scientific sleuths and integrity officers at research institutions shows that the two groups disagree about how to deal with serious cases of research misconduct, such as data fabrication, image manipulation and plagiarism.\n\nThe science institutions hiring integrity inspectors to vet their papers\n\nThe results, reported in a preprint posted on Zenodo last month1, reflect ongoing tensions between sleuths, who detect and report potential breaches of research integrity in the scientific literature — often anonymously, on public forums such as PubPeer — and integrity officers, who are responsible for investigating and responding to allegations of misconduct at their institutions. The two groups had differing views on whether universities can investigate their own researchers fairly, and what action should be taken when misconduct is found.\n\n“We lack a system for dealing with reports of individuals or groups who have committed research misconduct, which is really badly handled at the moment and handled typically in a very ad hoc fashion,” says Dorothy Bishop, an integrity sleuth and retired psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who ran the survey.\n\nShe hopes that the findings will kick-start a dialogue between sleuths and research-integrity officers that will help to establish “recommendations for what the optimal system for handling research fraud is”.\n\nBattling misconduct\n\nThe survey included responses from 79 participants, including 36 sleuths, 22 institutional research-integrity officers and 21 researchers and journal editors. The majority of them were from Europe. In her preprint, Bishop said there was broad agreement between sleuths and research-integrity officers that the pressure to publish can encourage dubious practices, and that institutions must take action when serious misconduct is found.\n\nHowever, there were also stark disagreements. A little less than 6% of sleuths agreed that current reporting channels for misconduct are effective, compared with 77% of research-integrity officers. In free comments, some sleuth respondents said they thought institutional investigations into potential misconduct are too slow, or are hindered by conflicts of interest.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nAround 64% of research-integrity officers said that the best way to deal with misconduct allegations is a self-regulation model, in which institutions investigate their own researchers and decide on any sanctions. Only 28% of sleuths agreed with this (see ‘Differing views’).\n\n“If one of the top researchers in an institute is accused of serious research misconduct, you will have a very conflicted situation where the institute might try to defend them,” says René Aquarius, a sleuth and neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who took part in the survey. He adds that there is growing frustration in the sleuthing community, where many people feel that the ‘obvious’ cases they report are not resulting in swift action.\n\nThree-quarters of sleuths and 59% of research-integrity officers thought it would be useful to have an external regulatory body that can handle allegations of misconduct at a national level — one that operates independently from the government, to reduce the risk of political influence. Such bodies exist in some countries, but their roles and responsibilities vary, notes Bert Seghers, president of the European Network of Research Integrity Offices in Brussels. For example, in Finland, the Netherlands and Belgium, a national-level body can review institutional investigations, whereas in Sweden and Denmark, government agencies handle allegations of falsification, fabrication and plagiarism. But even in these systems, only institutions can impose sanctions on researchers, adds Seghers, who took part in the survey.\n\nSlow investigations",

That’s according to research published today in Science Advances1.\n\nThe finding adds to the picture that researchers are painting of how our close ancient human relatives provided themselves with nourishment.\n\nNeanderthals and humans interbred more recently than scientists thought\n\nScientists have long been perplexed by the fact that the bones of Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) from the late Pleistocene epoch (11,700–129,000 years ago) contain a nitrogen isotope at extreme levels2 normally seen in mega-meat-eaters such as hyenas and wolves. The more meat an animal eats, the more nitrogen-15 it stores, and those at the top of the food chain have the highest amounts.\n\nBut “our guts are not carnivore guts”, says Bruce Hardy, an anthropologist at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. “Our livers can only do so much to process protein.” So the Neanderthal levels seemed impossibly high.\n\nMelanie Beasley, an anthropologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and her colleagues wondered whether, instead of gorging on massive quantities of meat, Neanderthals raised their nitrogen-15 levels by preparing their food in some unique way. Beasley, the lead author of the study, was inspired by historical examples of Indigenous groups consuming putrefied food, as well as the maggots — or fly larvae — that feast on it. Think of fermentation, she says. Putrefaction is similar: “A Westerner might say it’s rotting, but it’s really a method of storing the food to break down the meat,” she adds.\n\nTo see whether Neanderthals might have followed the same recipe, Beasley and her colleagues acquired muscle tissue samples from 34 donated human cadavers that had spent two years putrefying at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville’s Forensic Anthropology Center. They found that nitrogen-15 levels in the flesh rose as it decomposed — and when they sampled hundreds of larvae in the tissue, they measured up to 43 parts per thousand isotope in the maggots compared with up to 8 parts per thousand in the tissue.\n\nBon appétit\n\nBoth results suggest that, if Neanderthals had enjoyed putrefied meat and maggots, it could be a more viable explanation for their puzzlingly high nitrogen-15 levels than eating impossibly large quantities of meat. And it’s probably a more well-rounded meal than eating just protein, Beasley says. “When you get the lean meat and the fatty maggot, you have a more complete nutrient that you’re consuming.”",

The technique opens new ways to stress-test the known laws of physics and to detect the copious neutrinos produced in the hearts of collapsing stars.\n\n“They finally did it,” says Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “And they have very beautiful result.” The experiment, called CONUS+, is described on 30 July in Nature1.\n\nChallenging quarry\n\nNeutrinos are elementary particles that have no electrical charge and generally don’t interact with other matter, making them extraordinarily difficult to detect. Most neutrino experiments catch these elusive particles by observing flashes of light that are generated when a neutrino collides with an electron, proton or neutron. These collisions occur extremely infrequently, so such detectors typically have masses of tonnes or thousands of tonnes to provide enough target material to gather neutrinos in relevant numbers.\n\nScholberg and her collaborators first demonstrated the mini-detector technique in 20172, using it to catch neutrinos produced by an accelerator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The Oak Ridge particles have slightly higher energies than those made in reactors. As a result, detecting reactor neutrinos was even more challenging, she says. But lower-energy neutrinos also allow for a more precise test of the standard model of physics.\n\nHow heavy is a neutrino? Race to weigh mysterious particle heats up\n\nScholberg’s COHERENT detector was the first to exploit a phenomenon called coherent scattering, in which a neutrino ‘scatters’ off an entire atomic nucleus rather than the atom’s constituent particles.\n\nCoherent scattering uses the fact that particles of matter can act as waves — and the lower the particles’ energy, the longer their wavelength, says Christian Buck, a leader of the CONUS collaboration. If the wavelength of a neutrino is similar to the nucleus’s diameter, “then the neutrino sees the nucleus as one thing. It doesn’t see the internal structure”, says Buck, who is a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. The neutrino doesn’t interact with any subatomic particles, but does cause the nucleus to recoil — depositing a tiny amount of energy into the detector.\n\nCatching sight of a nucleus",

          "abstract": "In late 2005, five months after a car accident, a 23-year-old woman lay unresponsive in a hospital bed. She had a severe brain injury and showed no sign of awareness. But when researchers scanning her brain asked her to imagine playing tennis, something striking happened: brain areas linked to movement lit up on her scan1.\n\nThe experiment, conceived by neuroscientist Adrian Owen and his colleagues, suggested that the woman understood the instructions and decided to cooperate — despite appearing to be unresponsive. Owen, now at Western University in London, Canada, and his colleagues had introduced a new way to test for consciousness. Whereas some previous tests relied on observing general brain activity, this strategy zeroed in on activity directly linked to a researcher’s verbal command.\n\nThe consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?\n\nThe strategy has since been applied to hundreds of unresponsive people, revealing that many maintain an inner life and are aware of the world around them, at least to some extent. A 2024 study found that one in four people who were physically unresponsive had brain activity that suggested they could understand and follow commands to imagine specific activities, such as playing tennis or walking through a familiar space2. The tests rely on advanced neuroimaging techniques, so are mostly limited to research settings because of their high costs and the needed expertise. But since 2018, medical guidelines have started to recommend using these tests in clinical practice3.\n\nSince these methods emerged, scientists have been developing ways to probe layers of consciousness that are even more hidden. The stakes are high. Tens of thousands of people worldwide are currently in a persistent unresponsive state. Assessing their consciousness can guide important treatment decisions, such as whether to keep them on life support. Studies also suggest that hospitalized, unresponsive people with hidden signs of awareness are more likely to recover than are those without such signs (see, for example, ref. 4).\n\nSome people who seem to be persistently unresponsive show brain activity similar to that of healthy people when told to imagine a task.Credit: Adrian M. Owen\n\nThe need for better consciousness tests extends beyond humans. Detecting consciousness in other species — in which it might take widely different forms — helps us to understand how these organisms experience the world, with implications for animal-welfare policies. And researchers are actively debating whether consciousness might one day emerge from artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Last year, a group of philosophers and computer scientists published a report5 urging AI companies to start testing their systems for evidence of consciousness and to devise policies for how to treat the systems should this happen.\n\n“These scenarios, which were previously a bit abstract, are becoming more pressing and pragmatic,” says Anil Seth, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Sussex near Brighton, UK. In April, Seth and other researchers gathered in Durham, North Carolina, for a conference at Duke University to discuss tests for consciousness in humans (including people with brain damage, as well as fetuses and infants), other animals and AI systems.\n\nAlthough scientists agree there’s a lot of room for improvement, many see the development of consciousness tests that rely on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) as one of the field’s most significant advancements. “It was unthinkable 40 years ago that we would have a number of candidates for practical ways to test consciousness” in unresponsive people, says neuroscientist Christof Koch, a meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That’s big progress.”\n\nLayers of awareness\n\nScientists disagree on what consciousness really is, even in people. But many describe it as having an inner life or a subjective experience. That makes it inherently private: an individual can be certain only about their own consciousness. They can infer that others are conscious, too, on the basis of how they behave, but that doesn’t always work in people who have severe brain injuries or neurological disorders that prevent them from expressing themselves.\n\nMarcello Massimini, a neuroscientist at the University of Milan in Italy, compares assessments of consciousness in these challenging cases to peeling an onion. The first layer — the assessments that are routinely done in clinics — involves observing external behaviours. For example, a clinician might ask the person to squeeze their hand twice, or call the person’s name to see whether they turn their head towards the sound. The ability to follow such commands indicates consciousness. Clinicians can also monitor an unresponsive person over time to detect whether they make any consistent, voluntary movements, such as blinking deliberately or looking in one direction, that could serve as a way for them to communicate. Researchers use similar tests in infants, looking for how their eyes move in response to stimuli, for example6.\n\nHow does the brain control consciousness? This deep-brain structure\n\nFor a person who can hear and understand verbal commands but doesn’t respond to these tests, the second layer would involve observing what’s happening in their brain after receiving such a command, as with the woman in the 2005 experiment. “If you find brain activations that are specific for that active task, for example, premotor cortex activation for playing tennis, that’s an indicator of the presence of consciousness as good as squeezing your hand,” Massimini says. These people are identified as having cognitive motor dissociation, a type of covert consciousness.\n\nBut the bar for detecting consciousness through these tests is too high, because they require several minutes of sustained focus, says Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and a co-author of the 2024 study2 that suggested that one-quarter of unresponsive people might be conscious. That study also included a separate group of participants who showed observable, external signs of awareness. Among them, only 38% passed the test. “Even for healthy controls, mind wandering and drowsiness are major issues,” says Schiff.\n\nAssessing consciousness in those who fail such tests would require peeling the third layer of the onion, Massimini says. In these cases, clinicians don’t ask the person to engage actively in any cognitive behaviour. “You just present patients with stimuli and then you detect activations in the brain,” he says.\n\nIn a 2017 study, researchers played a 24-second clip from John F. Kennedy’s inaugural US presidential address to people with acute severe traumatic brain injury7. The team also played the audio to them in reverse. The two clips had similar acoustic features, but only the first was expected to trigger patterns of linguistic processing in the brain; the second served as a control. Using fMRI, the experiment helped to detect covert consciousness in four out of eight people who had shown no other signs of understanding language.\n\nThe complexity of implementing such an approach outside the research setting isn’t the only challenge. These tests require researchers to know which patterns of brain activity truly reflect consciousness, because some stimuli can elicit brain responses that occur without awareness. “It boils down to understanding what are the neural correlates of conscious perception,” says Massimini. “We’re making progress, but we don’t yet agree on what they are.”\n\nWhat does ‘brain dead’ really mean? The battle over how science defines the end of life\n\nThere’s a fourth, even more elusive layer of consciousness, Massimini says — one that scientists are only beginning to explore. It might be possible for an unresponsive person to remain conscious even when their brain is completely cut off from the outside world, unable to receive or process images, sounds, smells, touch or any other sensory input8. The experience could be similar to dreaming, for example, or lying down in a completely dark and silent room, unable to move or feel your body. Although deprived of outside sensations, your mind would still be active, generating thoughts and inner experiences. In that case, scientists need to extract signs of consciousness solely from intrinsic brain properties.\n\nMassimini and his colleagues are applying a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses electromagnets placed on the head, as a possible technique for assessing consciousness. After jolting the brain in this way, they measure its response using EEG. In healthy people, they observe complex responses, reflecting a rich dialogue between brain regions. This complexity is quantified by a new metric they call the perturbational complexity index9, which was found to be higher in awake and healthy individuals than during sleep or in people under anaesthesia. Experiments have shown that the metric can help to reveal the presence of consciousness even in unresponsive people. And other researchers have proposed a version of this test as a way to investigate when consciousness emerges in fetuses10.\n\nMassimini and Koch, among others, are co-founders of a company called Intrinsic Powers, based in Madison, Wisconsin, that aims to develop tools that use this approach to detect consciousness in unresponsive people.\n\nBeyond the human realm\n\nAssessing consciousness becomes more challenging the further researchers move away from the human mind. One issue is that non-human animals can’t communicate their subjective experiences. Another is that consciousness in other species might take distinct forms that would be unrecognizable to humans.\n\nSome tests designed to assess consciousness in humans can be tried in other species. Researchers have applied the perturbational complexity index in rats and found patterns that resemble those seen in humans, for example11. But more-typical tests rely on experiments that look for behaviour suggesting sentience — the ability to have an immediate experience of emotions and sensations, including pain. Sentience, which some researchers consider a foundation for consciousness, doesn’t require the ability to reflect on those emotions.\n\nIn one experiment, octopuses consistently avoided a chamber that they encountered after receiving a painful stimulus, despite having previously preferred that chamber12. When these animals were subsequently given an anaesthetic to relieve the pain, they instead chose to spend time in the chamber in which they were placed after receiving the drug. This behaviour hints that these animals feel not only immediate pain, but also the ongoing suffering associated with it, and that they remember and act to avoid that experience.\n\nChimpanzees, elephants and many birds behave in ways that suggest they have forms of consciousness.Credit: Anup Shah, Mark Hamblin/2020VISION/Nature Picture Library\n\nFindings such as these are already shaping animal-welfare policy, says philosopher Jonathan Birch, director of the Jeremy Coller Centre for Animal Sentience at the London School of Economics and Political Science, UK. An independent review of the evidence for sentience in animals such as octopuses, crabs and lobsters, led by Birch, contributed to these species being granted greater protection alongside all vertebrates in 2022 under the UK Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act.\n\nAnd last year, dozens of scientists signed a declaration stating that there is “strong scientific support” for consciousness in other mammals and birds, and “at least a realistic possibility” of consciousness in all vertebrates, including reptiles and fish, as well as in many invertebrates, such as molluscs and insects.\n\nScientists are now calling for serious thought about whether some biological materials, such as brain organoids, could become conscious, as well as what machine consciousness might look like.\n\n“If it comes to the day when these systems become conscious, I think it’s in our best interest to know,” says Liad Mudrik, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.\n\nCan lab-grown brains become conscious?",

After running up and down the steps of the auditorium, he presents his new idea: revolutionize peer review with a system he’s developing, in which artificial intelligence (AI) would “supplement or augment” the process of assessing scientific papers.\n\nRechavi is a molecular biologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel whose lab aims, as its website puts it, to “challenge basic dogmas regarding inheritance and evolution”. He is one of the instigators of the meeting, dubbed by its organizers as the “conference to end all conferences”, which was held in Prague on 10–13 June.\n\nAn outside poster presentation at the conference.Credit: Nir Eynon, Monash University, Australia\n\nA follow-on from the first Woodstock of Biology, organized by Rechavi in Tel Aviv in February 2020, just before the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, the three-day Prague get-together was conducted with same anarchic disregard for rules as the 1969 music festival that it’s named after. A variety of scientists — from biologists to physicists — met to exchange ideas, play games and find fortuitous opportunities to collaborate with researchers outside their own narrow field.\n\nHeld in various locations across the city of Prague, and on the third day at a wooded campsite at Soběšín, in the Central Bohemian region of the Czech Republic, the conference followed an unusual format. Attendees spoke in five-minute slots, summarized their research in a single slide and were called to the podium in random order. Each speaker was hailed with a self-chosen walk-up song, often accompanied by impromptu dancing. The songs ranged from Fatboy Slim’s ‘Right Here, Right Now’ to ‘Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows’ by Lesley Gore.\n\nOne presenter gave her entire talk in rhyme. Another soundtracked theirs with a ukulele. A third read her paper as a bedtime story. Itai Yanai, a systems biologist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine in New York City and a conference co-organizer, explained his research to a co-opted 16-year-old. As he did so, volunteers from the audience posed onstage as ‘genes’, imitating being turned on and off by waving their arms when tapped. Barak Rotblat, a cancer researcher at the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, based in Beersheba, Israel, was physically removed from the podium by a ‘bouncer’ after exceeding the five-minute time limit. (He later admitted that he was in on the joke.)\n\nAnd in a symbolic wedding at Soběšín, two affianced scientists ’married’ in a ceremony presided over by Rechavi and Natanella Illouz-Eliaz, a plant biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in San Diego, California, and another co-organizer. The pair promised to “give each other tenure, share their data and write recommendation letters — long ones — without using ChatGPT”. After the ceremony, bride-to-be Lea Krautner, a biochemist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, tossed her bouquet of wildflowers and danced down the grassy aisle.\n\n“We are trying to reimagine science in a non-bureaucratic, non-boring way,” Rechavi said as the Turtles’ song ‘Happy Together’ played in the background at Soběšín.\n\nAttendees arrive at a conference venue by train.Credit: Pavel Tomancak\n\n“By acting silly or goofy, it sets the tone for a very open conference where we can be very authentic and show vulnerability,” says Illouz-Eliaz.\n\nDreaming together\n\nWoodstock Bio2 + Night Science is an attempt to reinvent the scientific conference, giving it a “festival-like quality”, says Yanai. “Of course, we want rigorous, reproducible science. But we’re also acknowledging the other side of the process, of ‘let’s be inspired to have new ideas and make connections’.”\n\nThe meeting did have a serious aspect. More than 200 researchers — principal investigators, PhD students and postdocs — converged on Prague from diverse locales, including Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy. They presented research on flatworms, cancer biology, melanoma metastasis, brain organoids, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and data science.\n\nYanai and Martin Lercher, a computational cell biologist at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany, led a ten-minute workshop titled ‘What is Your Worst Idea’? The two exhorted participants to pair with someone they had never met and discuss a possibly stupid, possibly brilliant concept. “You may come up with a Nature paper! Two Nature papers!” shouts Yanai. “There is a Nature editor here! Raise your hand if you are a Nature editor!” (That would be me, ostensibly, although I’m actually a freelance writer, on assignment for Nature, and have no power to accept or reject papers.)\n\nRechavi delivers a presentation read as a bedtime storyCredit: Itai Yanai\n\nAs Yanai explained, the term night science, which bookends the official name of the conference, was coined by the late biologist François Jacob, who shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that cells can switch genes on and off. “There’s the science that gets published and the science that is dreamt or appears in nightmares,” Jacob said.\n\nWhat if, like Jacob, “we tried to daydream together?” Yanai asks. “What if, simply by juxtaposing talks on completely different topics, it would give you an idea?”\n\n‘A bit unconventional’\n\nAt the conference, 115 researchers presented talks on anything they wished to speak about.\n\nChaitanya Chintaluri, a theoretical biologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, was drawn to the conference because “it’s a bit unconventional”. He was there to discuss why a collection of neurons, kept alive in a Petri dish with the aid of artificial cerebrospinal fluid and oxygen, continue to ‘chat’ to each other by sending out electrical impulses. “The question is, if there is nothing to talk about, what are they going on about? It’s quite perplexing,” Chintaluri says.\n\nMany of Woodstock Bio's sessions were held outsideCredit: Daniel Żarski, InLife, PL\n\nSara Bologna, a structural biologist at the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) at Masaryk University in Brno, the Czech Republic, had come to discuss her use of nuclear magnetic resonance to study the dynamics of proteins “and how they play together”. Woodstock “shows the personality of scientists — all of us, we are unique”, she said. Meeting diverse researchers “helps us think out of the box and get ideas for future projects”.\n\nYogesh Saravanan, a physicist and PhD student based in Marseille at Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, is trying to understand the physics and material properties of cancer cells. At the conference, Saravanan felt he had “an incredible exposure” to other labs. “It’s a great place for the intersection of ideas,” he said.",

Now, an exhaustive analysis of how proteins change over time in different organs backs up that idea, finding that people experience an inflection point at around 50 years old, after which ageing seems to accelerate.\n\nThe study, published on 25 July in Cell1, also suggests that some tissues — especially blood vessels — age faster than others, and it identifies molecules that can hasten the march of time.\n\nThe findings add to mounting evidence that ageing is not linear, but is instead pockmarked by periods of rapid change. Even so, larger studies are needed before scientists can label the age of 50 as a crisis point, says Maja Olecka, who studies ageing at the Leibniz Institute on Aging — Fritz Lipmann Institute in Jena, Germany, and was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are these waves of age-related changes,” she says. “But it is still difficult to make a general conclusion about the timing of the inflection points.”\n\nShowing their age\n\nPrevious work has shown that different organs can age at different rates2. To further unpick this, Guanghui Liu, who studies regenerative medicine at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and his colleagues, collected tissue samples from 76 people of Chinese ancestry aged 14 to 68 who had died from accidental brain injury. The samples came from organs representing eight of the body’s systems, including the cardiovascular, immune and digestive systems.\n\nThe researchers then created a compendium of the proteins found in each of the samples. They found age-related increases in the expression of 48 disease-associated proteins, and saw early changes at around age 30 in the adrenal gland, which is responsible for producing various hormones.\n\nWhy do ageing rates vary by country? Massive study says politics play a part\n\nThis tracks well with previous data, says Michael Snyder, a geneticist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “It fits the idea that your hormonal and metabolic control are a big deal,” he says. “That is where some of the most profound shifts occur as people age.”\n\nBetween the ages of 45 and 55 came a turning point marked by large changes in protein levels. The most dramatic shift was found in the aorta, the body’s main artery, which carries oxygenated blood out of the heart. The team tracked down one protein produced in the aorta that, when administered to mice, triggers signs of accelerated ageing. Liu speculates that blood vessels act as a conduit, carrying molecules that promote ageing to remote destinations throughout the body.",

It is the biggest-ever collaboration between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), carrying with it scientists’ dreams of studying our dynamic planet.\n\nBillion-dollar NASA satellite launches to track Earth’s water\n\nIn the coming days, the US$1.2-billion satellite, called NISAR, will unfurl a 12-metre-wide circular antenna and begin bouncing radar signals off Earth. Launched from Sriharikota, India, NISAR will scan nearly all of the planet twice every 12 days, and measure vertical physical shifts on the ground that are as small as one centimetre, even through clouds and at night.\n\nWatching NISAR launch is like being “a parent attending the graduation ceremony of his son!” says Deepak Putrevu, who co-leads the mission’s science team for ISRO. “It’s so exhilarating to witness.”\n\nBut for NASA, that excitement is tinged with a dollop of worry as US President Donald Trump pushes to slash the agency’s budget for Earth-science missions by over 50% in the fiscal year 2026. NISAR itself is slated to receive monies to operate as expected, but it might be one of the last of its kind to launch for years: the White House wants to cancel most of NASA’s upcoming flagship Earth-observing missions “to achieve cost savings”. And it wants to shut down several missions that are already operating and gathering key information about changes on Earth.\n\n“This is the size of cut that would fundamentally gut our capacity” to improve understanding of the changing planet, says Dylan Millet, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Minnesota in St Paul who chaired a NASA advisory committee on Earth sciences until March, when NASA disbanded it.\n\nA boost for disaster response\n\nNISAR — which stands for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar — will use two radar instruments operating at different wavelengths, one built by NASA and one by ISRO, to map Earth’s changing ice and land surfaces. Globally, the satellite will be able to identify changes in soil moisture, forest biomass and glaciers, among other things.\n\nNISAR will be able to measure the movement of ice on Antarctica (shown in this colour map) in detail.Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nAnd it will help with response to disasters such as floods, earthquakes and landslides, by providing up-to-date information about how Earth has behaved. “You can begin to build up an ability to see disasters as they unfold at a very rapid pace, and that should help with identifying areas of concern for first responders,” says Paul Rosen, the mission’s project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nNASA and ISRO began collaborating on NISAR in the early 2010s, when it became clear that both US and Indian scientists wanted to fly a major radar mission, Rosen says. If all goes well with the antenna unfurling and other tasks, NISAR should begin providing science data within 90 days. The mission is slated to operate for at least three years.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nWhat will happen after that is a bigger question, at least for NASA. NISAR was supposed to be the trailblazer in a series of major Earth-observing satellites, aimed at measuring, among other things, the roles of clouds and aerosols in climate change, and biological and geological interactions across the planet.",

Although numerous theories of human and animal cognition exist, they are often confined to particular aspects of cognition (domains) and ‘levels’ of analysis. For example, there are theories of natural language at the abstract, algebraic level; theories of learning at the level of algorithms; and theories of brain plasticity at the level of neurobiology. This separation means that they struggle to provide a holistic picture of how the mind works. Integrating cognitive theories ‘horizontally’ across domains1 and ‘vertically’ across levels2 remains a major challenge. This challenge echoes wider scientific debates about whether descriptions of a system’s behaviour at one level can be traced back to descriptions of the system’s components at lower levels, and about the unification of diverse theories.

This can result in these researchers being offered equipment time at the expense of their less-experienced peers. The effect permeates across fields, says Carpenter, who analysed data on a similar effort at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). “It’s not just telescopes.”\n\nSystem overhaul\n\nData on applications to use the Hubble Space Telescope and ALMA2 showed that women and less-experienced applicants got more facility time after blind review was introduced. Over the past few years, the practice has become more widespread — particularly at observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the European Southern Observatory’s telescopes in northern Chile.\n\nIsabelle Kingsley, a gender-equity researcher previously at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who now works for SAGE, an Australian initiative that campaigns for equity and diversity in education and research, wanted to see whether similar interventions could work in a range of scientific facilities.\n\nShe and her colleagues launched trials at four Australian facilities, which manage optical and radio telescopes, neutron-beam instruments and high-performance computing systems. In applications to use the resources, applicants were asked not to include their names and affiliations. One facility was hesitant about committing fully to anonymization and decided to include first initials and last names of applicants at the back of applications.\n\nThe researchers analysed the outcomes of more than 4,500 applications, including ones made up to five years before the intervention and up to two years after it.\n\nPostdoc boost\n\nThe Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering, in Lucas Heights, manages 15 neutron-beam instruments, and was one of two facilities that collected data on career stage. After introducing blind review, success rates for postdoctoral researchers rose from 61% to 78%. Success rates for PhD, graduate and undergraduate students remained stable, but those for more experienced researchers dropped from 61% to 50%. In the other facility that collected data on career stage, postdocs’ time on the equipment remained around 75%.\n\nThe results suggest that “anonymization can level the playing field” and help to open doors, says Kingsley. And because early-career researchers tend to be more diverse, in terms of their gender and cultural background, improving their outcomes contributes to retaining diverse scientific talent, she says.",

But he thinks the changes brought about by Trump’s administration mean there won’t be enough funding or graduate students to start a new laboratory. His best option is to leave the country and go to Europe, he says.\n\nHe’s not alone. In May, in a small survey of 378 early-career scientists by the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA), 44% said their jobs were threatened by the actions of the Trump administration. And in a poll of Nature readers in March, more than 800 postgraduate researchers and PhD students said they were considering leaving the country as a result of the disruptions to science. The reader poll was self-selected and not a representative sample of US researchers.\n\nBest place\n\nSince the end of the Second World War, the United States has invested heavily in scientific research. This funding has attracted scientists from around the globe, and has produced the diverse scientific network that US research and development relies on today.\n\nIt was this science powerhouse that drew a cellular biologist from Canada to the United States in 2022 for a postdoctoral research position in New York. But between funding cuts and vanishing career opportunities, says the scientist, who wishes to remain anonymous, the costs of staying in the United States are starting to outweigh the appeal. She’s looking for faculty positions in Canada and Australia. Funding to start a laboratory is generally lower in those countries than it is in the United States, but the career prospects seem more stable, she says.\n\nUnder Trump, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have attempted to slash the amount they pay for research overheads, also called indirect costs, from about 40–70% down to 15%. Universities use research overhead payments to cover the cost of utilities, insurance and other costs that support research. But the payments can also cover salaries for postdocs and staff scientists, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. As a result, early-career scientists’ jobs will be cut to balance the budgets, Wagner says. So far, the attempts by the NIH and the NSF have been blocked by the courts. The NIH has appealed.\n\nLimited future",

Credit: Luciano A. Masullo et al./Nat. Nanotech. (CC BY 4.0)\n\nScientists have mapped individual sugar molecules on the surface of cells at a resolution once thought to be impossible for light microscopes. It is the first sub-nanometre optical resolution achieved in cells, says Sabrina Simoncelli, a chemist at University College London, who calls the results “groundbreaking”.\n\nEvery cell in the human body is wrapped in a sugary coating called the glycocalyx. It helps cells to communicate with each other and with the immune system, to fight off viruses and, in some cases, to spread cancer. Until now, no imaging tool could show the glycocalyx’s tiny sugar molecules — each of which is about one nanometre in size — in detail.\n\nNow, researchers have found a way to image the sugars at a resolution of just 9 ångströms — 0.9 nanometres — using an off-the-shelf light microscope. In a paper published in Nature Nanotechnology on 28 July1, they reveal the arrangement of sugars on the surface of living cells that line humans’ small blood vessels.\n\nThe authors say that their imaging technique could help researchers to understand what a healthy glycocalyx looks like, and to study how it changes in diseases such as cancers and immune disorders, or in response to drugs.\n\n“When I started my PhD, the best resolution you could get of a single sugar was a blurry image,” says study co-author Karim Almahayni, a biophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen, Germany, who completed his PhD this month. “The next step is to understand how these sugars on the cell surface change during health and disease,” he adds. “We want to judge a cell by its cover.”\n\nBeyond the limit\n\nLight microscopes normally blur structures smaller than 200 nanometres. Super-resolution imaging tools have achieved resolutions of 10–20 nanometres, but still lack the precision needed to distinguish between individual sugars that sit less than 10 nanometres apart in the glycocalyx.\n\nSugars are also notoriously difficult to tag with visible markers that make them show up under a microscope. “They cannot be genetically modified, and there are no antibodies to target them,” Simoncelli explains.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Almahayni and his colleagues combined two Nobel-prizewinning techniques. One is super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, which uses blinking fluorescent tags to map molecules; the other is click chemistry, which links two molecules and can be used inside cells.\n\nThe authors wanted to image two types of sugar — sialic acids and N-acetyllactosamine — on the surface of cells that line blood capillaries. They started by feeding the cells modified sugars, which the cells added to their natural sugar coating. These modified sugars carried a chemical tag that allowed the researchers to attach DNA strands of six different types to the glycocalyx’s sugar molecules, which served as a docking point.",

          "authors": "Philip Ball",
          "abstract": "Tom Lehrer was a mathematician and internationally famous musical satirist.Credit: Anthony Pidgeon/Redferns via Getty\n\nDespite being best known for his humorous and satirical songs, Tom Lehrer, who died on 26 July at the age of 97, spent most of his life as an academic mathematician. His songs, hugely popular especially in his native United States, often touched on scientific and mathematical topics, earning him many fans in the research world.\n\n“He was really one of a kind,” says mathematician Marcus du Sautoy at the University of Oxford, UK. “I don’t think anyone has quite matched him before or since for his clever yet extremely informed mathematical and scientific lyrics.”\n\nLehrer’s 1951 song ‘Lobachevsky’, for instance, is a satire on the value of plagiarism for academic success, presented in the voice of a Russian mathematician who learnt the secret from Nikolai Lobachevsky, a pioneer of hyperbolic geometry. (“Plagiarize/Let no one else’s work evade your eyes”, he sang; “Only be sure always to call it research.”) The song, says du Sautoy, “was the first time I heard the name Lobachevsky, one of the great nineteenth-century geometers”.\n\nBorn in 1928 to a Jewish family in New York City, Lehrer was a prodigy who entered Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 15 and graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1946. He worked for a time at a company that made scientific instruments, while singing in theatres and clubs in the Boston area. He recorded an album in 1953; despite (or perhaps because of) their sometimes risqué or dark subject matter, his songs gradually acquired a cult following.\n\nIn 1955, Lehrer was drafted into the US Army, after which he was recruited to work for the US National Security Agency. In 1960, he returned to academia, teaching mathematics first at Harvard, then at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later at the University of California, Santa Cruz (where he also taught a class in musical theatre). He continued to perform and tour in the late 1950s and the 1960s, becoming popular in the United Kingdom through his weekly slot supplying satirical songs for the BBC television show The Frost Report.\n\nSuch exposure made him an icon for other musical satirists and light entertainers, such as Richard Stilgoe, a regular contributor to the BBC’s Nationwide and That’s Life!. “For my dad, Lehrer was a hero,” says Stilgoe’s son Jack Stilgoe, a specialist on responsible innovation at University College London.\n\nLehrer’s satires on science and academic life, says Stilgoe, “showed the public a world they wouldn’t otherwise see, at a time when scientists were becoming entangled in the cold war and other high-stakes issues”.\n\n“His lyrics could be vicious,” says Stilgoe, citing in particular Lehrer’s 1965 attack on the German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who was brought to work for the US space programme after developing the V-2 bomb in Nazi Germany (“Don’t say that he’s hypocritical/Say rather that he’s apolitical/Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?” ). The song “is just as relevant today as we think about the products that big tech launches into the world”, says Stilgoe.\n\nProbably the most familiar of Lehrer’s compositions to many scientists is ‘The Elements’ (1959), a virtuoso run through the chemical elements of the periodic table, set to a tune from Gilbert and Sullivan’s operetta The Pirates of Penzance.\n\n“One of my science teachers lent me a tape with songs of his on,” says du Sautoy. “I was a big Gilbert and Sullivan fan, so of course I fell for the elements song straight away.”",

          "authors": "Jingming Cai",
          "abstract": "Jingming Cai says he deliberately shaped his PhD's focus to prepare for future applicationsCredit: Cavan Images/Getty\n\nAfter completing my PhD in engineering in September 2018, I set out to navigate the world of early-career fellowships — a path that taught me as much about resilience and strategy as it did about research.\n\nAfter experiencing two rejections, rewriting my proposals and learning from every round of feedback, I have secured three major awards over the past five years: a Humboldt Research Fellowship in Germany, a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA-PF) from the European Union and a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) from the Australian Research Council. These totalled around US$600,000 in funding, which supported my early-stage research across multiple countries. Now, I’m an associate professor at the School of Civil Engineering at Southeast University in Nanjing, China, where I conduct research on energy technologies for buildings.\n\nAll three fellowships are highly competitive — for instance, the success rates for the MSCA-PF and DECRA were both around 15% when I applied. Each application process pushed me to reflect not only on how to write a convincing proposal, but also on who I am as a researcher, what kind of work I want to do and how to communicate that to others. Here are some lessons that I learnt the hard way — and that might help others going through the same process.\n\nStart preparing before you finish your PhD\n\nThe best applications don’t start with a call for proposals — they start months, and sometimes years, earlier. In the final year of my PhD, I became aware of several major international fellowships for early-career researchers. With these opportunities in mind, I deliberately shaped my work to strengthen my CV and prepare for future applications. I focused on building a clear research identity: publishing in the niche but promising field of thermoelectric materials for buildings, and collaborating internationally. This helped to demonstrate that I could work across borders. These shifts weren’t always straightforward — I had to take care that my activities remained aligned with my doctoral objectives without compromising the integrity of my research.\n\nFor example, I actively took part in international academic conferences on emerging energy technologies, even though they were not entirely relevant to my core research area. These experiences later helped me to identify institutions that would be suitable hosts if I attracted funding, and to collect strong letters of recommendation.\n\nI also learnt the importance of being flexible with my research direction. Early on I focused entirely on structural design in buildings, but I later realized that combining structural design with energy research was better suited to my strengths. It also aligned more closely with emerging needs in the field, and so would be relevant to more calls for grant funding. I think similar opportunities exist in the natural sciences, particularly because many areas are now integrating with digital tools such as artificial intelligence and the use of big data, so expertise in those areas is transferable.\n\nChoosing a research direction that plays to your strengths and can respond to developments and demands in the field can make a real difference. I attended a number of interdisciplinary talks, which gave me a broad view of where the field was heading. I decided to shape my direction accordingly, while keeping my own interests in mind. I tried to be as independent as I could in choosing a research direction: after all, the grants I was applying for were specifically to build my own research direction.\n\nUse early applications to practise and build confidence\n\nI submitted my first MSCA-PF application shortly after finishing my PhD — and was rejected. The core proposal was around 15 pages long and required detailed planning of research content, collaborations and implementation. I had only three months to prepare it, and I underestimated the importance of a well-structured narrative. As a result, the submission lacked coherence and clarity, and didn’t address the scientific questions in enough depth. For example, my methodology did not include enough detail.\n\nI asked for feedback and started again. I rewrote the proposal from scratch: clarified my role in the project, restructured the scientific goals so that they were more focused, with concrete and feasible methods, and worked closely with my collaborators and host institution. The second time around, the proposal scored 98.8 out of 100 and was awarded €189,000 (US$220,000). I used this to start my work on building energy technologies, where I made advances in the field of thermoelectric devices. My colleagues and I developed the most energy-efficient building thermoelectric module known so far, with the potential to convert urban waste heat into electricity and help to mitigate the growing challenges of the urban heat-island effect and energy crisis.\n\nJingming Cai learned from repeated rejection to win some big time fellowships.Credit: Jingming Cai\n\nFor those starting out, I recommend applying to fellowships with simpler formats and flexible timelines — such as those offered by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science or the Humboldt Foundation in Germany. These programmes have a more streamlined application process, focusing on the applicant’s potential and research idea, rather than requiring very detailed project planning and implementation, as the MSCA-PF does. The fellowships are highly respected and are excellent practice for applying to more complex programmes, such as European Research Council funding competitions.\n\nTell a story — don’t just give a technical plan\n\nThe biggest mistake I made early on was treating a fellowship application like a journal submission. My first MSCA-PF draft was packed with bullet points, dense data tables and technical language. But I learnt that reviewers aren’t just evaluating scientific merit — they’re also looking for alignment with their goals, potential to become an independent researcher and a clear narrative. And, of course, how the proposed work would contribute to solving any specific scientific or societal challenges that the fellowship aims to support.\n\nWhat made the difference in my revised application was learning how to tell a compelling story: who I was, what I had done, what gap I saw in the field and how this project, in this environment, would help me to grow. I included a tailored training plan, showed how the fellowship would support my long-term goals and outlined the societal relevance of the work.\n\nI followed a simple structure:\n\nBackground. Introduce the project using a narrative that leads from ‘everybody knows’ to ‘nobody knows’ — start with widely understood context, then narrow down to the specific research gap.\n\nChallenge. Describe the technical bottleneck and explain why this project is needed to overcome it.\n\nInnovation. Explain what makes the idea original and how it differs from existing approaches.\n\nImplementation. Lay out a detailed and feasible plan to ensure timely and effective delivery of the project.\n\nImpact. Clarify the scientific and socio-economic benefits of the project.\n\nThis breakdown made it easier for reviewers to follow the logic and understand the value of each component. I avoided jargon and assumed the reviewers were smart scientists, but not necessarily experts in my subfield.",

          "title": "China reins in the spiralling construction costs of nuclear power — what can other countries learn?",
          "authors": "Shangwei Liu, Gang He, Minghao Qiu, Daniel M. Kammen",
          "abstract": "Once again, the world is betting on nuclear power. The United States aims to quadruple its nuclear capacity by 2050, and more than 30 countries have pledged to triple global capacity by mid-century. China has more than 30 reactors under construction and in planning, and France has announced plans to build 14 reactors. Technology giants, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, are also investing in nuclear to power their energy-hungry data centres and lower their carbon emissions.\n\nA central challenge remains: can development be done at a manageable cost? Historically, the industry has faced a ‘cost escalation curse’1–4. Building more nuclear reactors has led to higher, not lower, costs per watt (see ‘Costly construction’), hampering their economic viability. By contrast, for solar and wind energy, mass production and steady technological improvements have driven costs down5,6.\n\nSource: Analysis by S. Liu et al.\n\nThe cost of building nuclear power plants can soar because of a lack of standardized designs, rising material and labour costs, evolving regulations and technical complexities7. But is this cost escalation inevitable? Here, we show that tailored regulations and policies can reverse the trend. Decades of nuclear-energy development in China demonstrate that construction costs can be brought down through a combination of stable regulations and efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains.\n\nChina’s success in curbing costs\n\nOver the past two decades, China has been the main country to substantially and consistently expand its nuclear fleet, to 58 operating reactors in 2024. Since 2022, the government has been approving around ten new reactors each year, putting China on track to surpass the United States and become the world’s largest holder of nuclear power capacity by 2030. State-affiliated research centres have outlined a goal of quintupling China’s current nuclear capacity by 2050.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nWe have compiled and analysed a data set on the construction costs of nuclear power plants in China, drawn from a wide range of publicly available sources (see Supplementary information for raw data and further analyses). We focus on the cost of construction, because operating and fuel costs are relatively low and have remained stable3,8.\n\nOur findings are striking. Whereas construction costs increased substantially between the 1960s and 2000s, by around tenfold in the United States and by nearly twofold in France, they had halved in China by the early 2000s and have remained largely stable since.\n\nVarious strategies were used to keep technological costs down, such as building larger plants for scale efficiency and leveraging accumulated experience. But these alone fail to fully explain the cost-reduction trend observed in China. The country has also managed to contain costs through strategic development of domestic supply chains, stable regulatory frameworks, state-backed incentive policies and effective construction management.\n\nThe key driver of cost reduction has been China’s deliberate effort to build domestic capacity in civil nuclear power, which unfolded in three stages. From the 1990s to 2005, China imported foreign reactors to deploy immediately while gradually producing simple, conventional components domestically and using Chinese firms for civil engineering and construction to reduce costs. At the same time, it began researching and developing its own reactor design based on French technology.\n\nThe nuclear vessel inside the Flamanville 3 reactor in northwestern France.Credit: Lou Benoist/AFP via Getty\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, these efforts to localize production advanced to include more complex, safety-critical components, such as reactor cores. China ramped up capacity, building about 30 reactors using two domestically developed model types. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, China accelerated the adoption of advanced safety features by collaborating with partners from the United States and France, while developing its own advanced reactor models.\n\nSubstituting expensive imports with domestically produced components substantially reduces cost. Some Chinese-made nuclear components, such as tubes, ring cranes and charging pumps, cost half as much as their imported equivalents. However, for countries that import their nuclear technologies, domestic supply-chain building must be strategic. For example, South Korea adopted a similar approach to China, which led to cost reductions4,9. By contrast, around the 1980s, France deviated from the tried-and-tested US reactor design in favour of a national version, which hindered standardization and caused construction costs to soar3.\n\nWill AI’s huge energy demands spur a nuclear renaissance?\n\nChina’s regulatory structure and policy environment also play an important part. A consistent, state-backed industrial policy has provided stable electricity tariffs and low-interest financing for state-owned nuclear power companies (see go.nature.com/3uhsdfd). Its centralized nuclear governance structure helps to ensure regulatory stability and coordinates reactor standardization across the country.",

          "abstract": "Diamonds are widely used in jewellery as a symbol of eternal love, but they have value far beyond their beauty. Diamond is not only the hardest material found in nature, but also one with exceptionally high thermal conductivity, remarkable transparency to visible light and almost perfect chemical inertness — making it ideal for many technological purposes. However, natural diamonds are scarce, hard to extract from geological sources and vary in quality, making it difficult to exploit their extraordinary properties. This problem was solved 70 years ago when, writing in Nature, Bundy et al.1 were the first to report a reproducible synthesis of artificial diamonds (Fig. 1) — spawning new fields of research and a plethora of applications.",

          "abstract": "Although many EMCRs in academia are passionate about their research, they also report experiences of intense demands, and stress over finances and uncertain futures1. Ultimately, many EMCRs feel that to succeed in academia, other areas of life often require substantial sacrifices1. Although these issues are by no means new, there are concerns that with the heightened competition for positions and the demands placed on academics, these problems become increasingly exacerbated for up-and-coming researchers2. This is generally reflected in mental health and job satisfaction: those in middling positions such as post-doctoral or non-tenure-tracked roles report less satisfaction, reduced well-being and increased disillusionment, as compared with PhD candidates or their more senior peers3.\n\nAlthough the challenges faced by EMCRs are well known and have previously been discussed in the literature, more progress towards meaningful change is still needed. A recent commentary by Rahal et al.4 discussed ways in which policies and the wider research society could be improved for the benefit of up-and-coming researchers. Proposed solutions include prioritizing funding for longer-term or permanent positions, increasing the emphasis on quality as opposed to quantity of publications when evaluating researcher performance, and better education and resources for skill development for research and other academic duties4. Undoubtedly, all of these areas warrant considerable attention from government, funders and institutions. Yet, many of the commonly discussed issues, including those mentioned above, are based on more systemic factors that lie beyond the scholar’s control. This emphasizes the need for a wholesale change of policy and academic governance. Yet, although we agree such changes are inherently needed, major changes to the way in which research is taught, funded and rewarded will inevitably take time to implement — if they occur at all — and address only part of the problem that EMCRs face.",

In late 2022 and early 2023, we tested whether particular large language models—then in widespread use—generated completions that simulated altruism when prompted with text inputs similar to those used in ‘dictator game’ experiments measuring human altruism. Here we report that one model in our initial study set—OpenAI’s text-davinci-003—consistently generated completions that simulated payoff maximization in a non-social decision task yet simulated altruism in dictator games. Comparable completions appeared when we replicated our experiments, altered prompt phrasing, varied model parameters, altered currencies described in the prompt and studied a subsequent model, GPT-4. Furthermore, application of explainable artificial intelligence techniques showed that results changed little when instructing the system to ignore past research on the dictator or ultimatum games but changed noticeably when instructing the system to focus on the needs of particular participants in a simulated social encounter.",

          "authors": "Gaurav Kamath, Michelle Yang, Siva Reddy, Morgan Sonderegger, Dallas Card",
          "abstract": "A central question in the study of language change is whether or not such change is generational. If a language changes over time generation-by-generation, the process looks as follows: New generations of speakers introduce innovations, while older speakers conserve their usage patterns, and the language changes as new generations replace older ones. At the opposite extreme, language change could be a zeitgeist phenomenon, in which changes are universally adopted by speakers simultaneously, regardless of age or generational cohort. This paper asks this question in the context of word meaning change. We analyze meaning change in over 100 words across more than 7.9 million U.S. congressional speeches, to observe whether, when a word sense rises or falls in prominence, adult speakers from different generations uniformly adopt it, or those from older generations conserve their prior usage. Using language model-based word sense induction methods, we identify different senses of each word, and then model the prevalence of each of these word senses as a function of time and speaker age. We find that most words show a small but statistically significant effect of speaker age; across almost 140 y of Congress, older speakers typically take longer than younger speakers to follow changes in word usage, but nevertheless do so within a few years. Our findings indicate that despite minor age-based differences, word meaning change among mature speakers is likely not a generational process, but rather a zeitgeist process, in which older adult speakers can readily adopt new word usage patterns.",

Building on William Whyte’s observational work, which involved manual video analysis of pedestrian behaviors, we employ computer vision and deep learning techniques to examine video footage from 1979–80 and 2008–10. Our analysis measures changes in walking speed, lingering behavior, group sizes, and group formation. We find that the average walking speed has increased by 15%, while the time spent lingering in these spaces has halved across all locations. Although the percentage of pedestrians walking alone remained relatively stable (from 67% to 68%), the frequency of group encounters declined, indicating fewer interactions in public spaces. This shift suggests that urban residents are using streets as thoroughfares rather than as social spaces, which has important implications for the role of public spaces in fostering social engagement.",

          "abstract": "Ecosystem connectivity—the uninterrupted flow of natural processes within and among ecosystems—is critical for maintaining healthy ecosystem functions. However, in the Amazon drainage basin, multiple anthropogenic activities are rapidly disrupting connectivity. To assess the severity of this problem, we analyzed the spatial distributions of six major anthropogenic activities: dam construction, deforestation, fire, mining, oil and gas exploitation, and roads. We examined their impacts across four key landscapes: Amazonian Andes, lowland nonflooded forests, wetlands, and rivers. Using a resistance-based connectivity model, we quantified connectivity across terrestrial, wetland, and river ecosystems and found a marked decline in connectivity across the basin. A central focus of our study was the role of Indigenous Territories and Protected Areas (ITPAs), which collectively cover over 50% of the basin. Our findings show that ITPAs sustain significantly high levels of ecosystem connectivity. Only 14 to 16% of ITPA land is impacted by anthropogenic activities, compared to 38% in unprotected areas. Terrestrial ecosystems in the southern and eastern Amazon are heavily impacted by deforestation, mining, and fires, with significantly higher connectivity inside ITPAs than in unprotected areas ( P &lt; 0.01). Wetlands and riverine ecosystems also face severe fragmentation, particularly from dams and illegal mining—but maintain stronger connectivity within ITPAs (wetlands: P &lt; 0.01; rivers: P &lt; 0.001), with the few remaining free-flowing Andean rivers increasingly isolated from the lowland Amazon. Strengthening governance and sustainable initiatives in ITPAs, in partnership with local inhabitants, represents an expedient, efficient, and cost-effective strategy for conserving ecosystem connectivity in the Amazon basin.",

          "abstract": "Genomic sequence data harbor valuable information concerning the history of species divergence and interspecific gene flow and may offer important insights into conservation of endangered species. However, extracting such information from genomic data requires powerful statistical inference methods. A recent analysis of genomic sequence data found little evidence for gene flow from domestic Bactrian camels into the endangered wild Bactrian species. Nevertheless, the methods used to infer gene flow are based on data summaries and lack the power and precision to represent the complex phylogenetic history of the species with gene flow. Here, we apply Bayesian methods to genomic sequence data to test for both recent and ancient gene flow among the three species in the genus Camelus and to estimate the strength and timing of gene flow. We detect a strong signal of gene flow from domestic into wild Bactrian camels, confirming early evidence based on mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome. Overall gene flow appears to affect the autosomal genome uniformly, with similar effective rates of gene flow for exonic and noncoding regions. Estimation of species divergence times is seriously affected if gene flow is not accommodated in the analysis. Our results highlight the power of the coalescent model in analysis of genomic data and the utility of the coding as well as noncoding parts of the genome in elucidating the evolutionary history of modern species.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons that project to the dorsal striatum, and mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are the most common genetic causes of familial Parkinson’s disease. Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which normally support dopamine neurons vulnerable in PD. Here, we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling and Hedgehog-dependent neuroprotective factor production by a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity increases lysosomal accessible cholesterol and thus decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells; this change in lipid composition blocks ciliary Hedgehog signaling that depends on accessible cholesterol. Consistent with defects in Hedgehog signaling in the mouse dorsal striatum, GBA1 mutant mice show reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons, with no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.",

Here, we present measurements of perchlorate in stratospheric aerosol particles and confirm that the stratosphere is an important source of perchlorate, whereas we did not observe production in the troposphere. Mass mixing ratios of aerosol perchlorate in the stratosphere were 1 to 10 parts per trillion by mass (pptm), with the highest concentrations observed in summer and in the Southern Hemisphere. Almost all of the perchlorate is in biomass burning and nitrogen-rich particles, despite those types contributing only a few percent of the aerosol particles. Such particles are less acidic than the majority of sulfuric acid particles. If the formation of perchlorate is sensitive to acidity, then the injection of some materials for solar radiation modification might significantly increase the global production of perchlorate.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatase (VSP) comprises a voltage sensor domain (VSD) and a cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR), achieving a unique electrochemical signal conversion. Previous studies suggest that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ), a membrane phospholipid known to be critical for activities of diverse voltage-gated ion channels, associates with a linker connecting the VSD with the CCR of VSP and regulates VSD-CCR coupling. However, the details of PI(4,5)P 2 interaction with the linker of VSP remain elusive. Here, we exploit advantage of sensitivity of a fluorescent unnatural amino acid, 3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (Anap), to changes in local environment to study interaction between PI(4,5)P 2 and the linker of Ciona intestinalis VSP (Ci-VSP). We found that a conserved tyrosine residue (Y255) as well as neighboring basic residues interacts with PI(4,5)P 2 and this interaction was maintained in G365A Ci-VSP mutant which lacks the substrate PI(4,5)P 2 at the active site and Ci-VSP/human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) chimera which does not dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P 2 , indicating that the linker interacts with nonsubstrate, regulatory PI(4,5)P 2 outside the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the linker formed stable interaction with PI(4,5)P 2 in the activated state. These findings indicate that regulation of coupling to an effector region downstream of the VSD through PI(4,5)P 2 binding to the linker is shared among voltage-dependent membrane proteins.",

Here, we assessed how trauma-related brain networks respond to current acute stress in real time. Using a machine learning approach, we trained and tested brain functional connectivity networks to predict past trauma exposure in a community sample of adults ( N = 170). We then evaluated the response of these trauma-predictive brain networks to an acute emotional and physiological stressor in a subsample of participants ( N = 92) and to a pharmacological manipulation (hydrocortisone) in an independent crossover study ( N = 27). We found that connectome-based predictive modeling successfully predicted past trauma exposure. The network associated with greater trauma exposure showed high involvement of salience network connections, with model prediction driven by connectivity in the medial frontal cortex, salience network, motor regions, default mode network, and cerebellum. Notably, connectivity in this trauma-predictive network was significantly attenuated following an acute stressor relative to control. A similar pattern was observed in the pharmacology sample, with decreased connectivity under hydrocortisone compared to placebo within this trauma-predictive network. Finally, attenuated trauma-predictive network connectivity after acute stress was associated with lower depressive symptoms in the stress-exposed group, but not control group. These findings suggest that stress may induce blunted connectivity of brain networks related to past traumatic experiences and that the reduced engagement of these trauma-predictive brain networks may facilitate adaptive regulatory response to later stress.",

Here, we determined G2L4 RT apoenzyme and snap-back DNA synthesis structures revealing unique structural adaptations that optimized its cellular function in DSBR. These included an RT3a structure that stabilizes the apoenzyme in an inactive conformation until encountering a DNA substrate; a longer N-terminal extension/RT0-loop with conserved residues that together with a modified active site favors strand annealing; and a conserved dimer interface that localizes G2L4 RT homodimers to DSBR sites with both monomers positioned for MMEJ.

Rapid, recent radiations are ideal systems for this question because they still show key morphological and ecological adaptations associated with speciation. While most research on recent radiations focuses on those occurring in insular environments, less attention has been given to continental radiations with complex species interactions. Here, we study the drivers of continental radiations of Melinaea and Mechanitis butterflies (Nymphalidae: Ithomiini), which have rapidly radiated in the continental Neotropics. They are classical models for Amazonian biogeography and color pattern mimicry and have been proposed as biodiversity indicators. We generated reference genomes for five species of each genus and whole-genome resequencing data of most species and subspecies covering a wide geographic range to assess phylogeographic relationships, hybridization patterns, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our data help resolve the classification of these taxonomically challenging butterflies and reveal very high diversification rates. We find rampant evidence of historical hybridization and putative hybrid species in both radiations, which may have facilitated their rapid diversification by enriching the genetic diversity. Moreover, we identified dozens of chromosomal fusions and fissions between congeneric species that have likely expedited reproductive isolation. We conclude that interactions between geography, hybridization and chromosomal rearrangements have contributed to these rapid radiations in the highly diverse Neotropical region. We hypothesize that rapid radiations may be spurred if repeated periods of geographic isolation are combined with lineage-specific rapid accumulation of incompatibilities, followed by secondary contact with some gene exchange.",

          "abstract": "Plant–microbe symbioses such as the legume–rhizobium mutualism are vital in the web of ecological relationships within both natural and managed ecosystems, influencing primary productivity, crop yield, and ecosystem services. The outcome of these interactions for plant hosts varies quantitatively and can range from highly beneficial to even detrimental depending on natural genetic variation in microbial symbionts. Here, we take a systems genetics approach, harnessing the genetic diversity present in wild rhizobial populations to predict genes and molecular pathways crucial in determining partner quality, i.e., the benefits of symbiosis for legume hosts. We combine traits, dual-RNAseq of both partners from active nodules, pangenomics/pantranscriptomics, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for a panel of 20 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains that vary in symbiotic partner quality. We find that genetic variation in the nodule transcriptome predicts host plant biomass, and WGCNA reveals networks of genes in plants and rhizobia that are coexpressed and associated with high-quality symbiosis. Presence–absence variation of gene clusters on the symbiosis plasmid (pSymA), validated in planta, is associated with high or low-quality symbiosis and is found within important coexpression modules. Functionally our results point to management of oxidative stress, amino acid and carbohydrate transport, and NCR peptide signaling mechanisms in driving symbiotic outcomes. Our integrative approach highlights the complex genetic architecture of microbial partner quality and raises hypotheses about the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis.",

          "abstract": "What are the principles that govern the responses of cortical networks to their inputs and the emergence of these responses from recurrent connectivity? Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here, we propose a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact analytic solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intracortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain.",

          "abstract": "Decades of research have shown working memory (WM) relies on sustained prefrontal cortical activity and visual extrastriate activity, particularly in the alpha (8 to 12 Hz) frequency range. This alpha activity tracks the spatial location of WM items, even when spatial position is task-irrelevant and no stimulus is currently being presented. Traditional analyses of putative oscillations using bandpass filters, however, conflate oscillations with nonoscillatory aperiodic activity. Here, we reanalyzed seven human electroencephalography visual WM datasets to test the hypothesis that aperiodic activity, which is thought to reflect the relative contributions of excitatory and inhibitory drive-plays a distinct role in visual WM from true alpha oscillations. To do this, we developed a time-resolved spectral parameterization approach to disentangle oscillations from aperiodic activity during WM encoding and maintenance. Across all seven tasks, totaling 112 participants, we captured the representation of spatial location from total alpha power using inverted encoding models (IEMs), replicating traditional analyses. We then trained separate IEMs to estimate the strength of spatial location representation from aperiodic-adjusted alpha (reflecting just the oscillatory component) and aperiodic activity and find that IEM performance improves for aperiodic-adjusted alpha compared to total alpha power that blends the two signals. We also identify a distinct role for aperiodic activity, where IEM performance trained on aperiodic activity is highest during stimulus presentation, but not during the WM maintenance period. Our results emphasize the importance of controlling for aperiodic activity when studying neural oscillations while uncovering a functional role for aperiodic activity in encoding visual WM information.",

          "abstract": "Reticulate evolution has long been recognized as a key mechanism that contributes to genetic and trait diversity. With the widespread availability of genomic data, investigating historical reticulate evolution across taxa has gained significant attention, driven by the rapid development of statistical methods for detecting nontreelike patterns. Phylogenetic networks provide a biologically intuitive approach to depicting evolutionary processes such as hybrid speciation and introgressive hybridization, which result in signatures of historical gene flow. Interpreting phylogenetic networks is especially critical for groups of conservation concern that lack reference genome resources and explicit hypotheses from prior investigation, such as those based on molecular data, morphology, or species distributions. Here, we highlight recent advances in computational methods for inferring networks from genome-scale data and offer guidelines for deriving biological insights from phylogenetic networks. Particular emphasis is placed on modeling hybridization and whole-genome duplication in the context of allopolyploidization. Practical recommendations for empirical studies and the limitations of commonly used methods are discussed throughout. We anticipate that phylogenetic networks will influence conservation biology and biodiversity research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of reticulate evolution inferred from these networks in the near future. Networks will accelerate other pressing avenues of biodiversity research, especially investigations of orphan crops and climate change resilience in natural systems. The promise of phylogenetic networks connects with broader themes in the special feature Monitoring and restoring gene flow in the increasingly fragmented ecosystems of the Anthropocene by providing an emerging probabilistic framework for inferring historical connectivity between species and populations.",

          "abstract": "Our current understanding of protein folding is based predominantly on studies of small (&lt;150 aa) proteins that refold reversibly from a chemically denatured state. However, as protein length increases so does the competition between off-pathway misfolding and on-pathway folding, creating a more complex energy landscape (\"folding funnel\"). Little is known about how intermediates populated during the folding of larger proteins affect navigation of this more complex landscape. Previously, we reported extremely slow folding rates for the 539 aa β-helical passenger domain of pertactin (P.69T), including conditions that favor the formation of a kinetically trapped, off-pathway partially folded state (PFS). Existence of an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding was speculated but its characterization remained elusive. In this work, we exploited the extremely slow kinetics of PFS unfolding to develop a double-jump “denaturant challenge” assay. With this assay, we identified a transient unfolding intermediate, PFS*, that adopts a similar structure to PFS, including C-terminal folded structure and a disordered N terminus, yet unfolds much more quickly than PFS. Additional experiments revealed that PFS* also functions as an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding. Collectively, these results support a C-to-N-terminal model for P.69T folding, with folding initiated in the C-terminus with the rate-limiting formation of the transient on-pathway PFS* intermediate, which sits at the junction of the kinetic competition between folding and misfolding. Notably, processive folding from C-to-N terminus also occurs during C-to-N-terminal translocation of P.69T across the bacterial outer membrane. These results illuminate the crucial role of kinetics when navigating a complex energy landscape for protein folding.",

Among these, we show that the DUF1907 domain of C11orf54 catalyzes formation of L-xylulose by establishing a zinc-coordinated Michaelis complex with β-keto-L-gulonate (BKG). The identification of BKG decarboxylase completes the pentose pathway, in which pentose sugars are produced by decarboxylation of nonphosphorylated hexose precursors. The pathway was present in the unicellular ancestor of animals and is conserved in all deuterostomes, in contrast to the alternative L-ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway. An increased flux toward pentoses may have represented an evolutionary tradeoff, favoring energy metabolism and redox cofactor balance at the expense of ascorbate biosynthesis in organisms, such as humans and other Haplorhini primates, where dietary vitamin C intake prevents scurvy.",

However, there is a paucity of cancer-specific antigens that are endogenously produced. HapImmune™ technology utilizes covalent inhibitors directed to an intracellular cancer driver to create cancer-specific neoantigens in the form of drug–peptide conjugates presented by class I MHC molecules. Our previous study with sotorasib, an FDA-approved covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C), demonstrated that drug-treated cells produce such neoantigens and can be killed by T cell engagers directed against the drug–peptide/MHC complex. Thus, this technology can unite targeted and immune therapies. In the present study, we examined whether this approach could generalize to another FDA-approved KRAS(G12C) inhibitor, adagrasib, whose chemical structure and cysteine reactivity differ substantially from sotorasib. We developed antibodies selective to adagrasib-KRAS(G12C) peptides presented by HLA-A*03 and A*11 that also show cross-reactivity to other KRAS(G12C) inhibitors presented in the same manner. Cryoelectron microscopy structures revealed a mode of adagrasib-peptide/HLA recognition distinctly different from that of sotorasib-directed HapImmune antibodies. The antibodies in a bispecific T cell engager format killed adagrasib-resistant lung cancer cells upon adagrasib treatment. These results support the broad applicability of the HapImmune approach for creating actionable cancer-specific neoantigens and offer candidates for therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Identifying linkages between biodiversity loss and climate change is required for understanding the scope of these interconnected challenges and developing approaches to address them. One crucial yet underexplored aspect is the influence of seed-dispersing animals on forest carbon storage. Here, we show that 81% of tropical trees rely on animals for seed dispersal and that disruption of this process, due to declines in animal diversity and movement, significantly hampers the carbon accumulation potential of regrowing tropical forests. Using a synthesis of animal biodiversity, movement, and seed dispersal data covering thousands of animal species, we developed an index of seed dispersal disruption and modeled its relationship to carbon accumulation observed across 3,026 tropical regrowth plots. Naturally regrowing areas with lowest seed dispersal disruption had aboveground carbon accumulation rates four times higher than those with most severe disruption. Across areas identified as locations suitable for reforestation, current levels of seed dispersal disruption yield a 57% average reduction in local carbon accumulation potential. Tropical regrowth forests currently represent the largest land-based carbon sink; ongoing animal biodiversity losses diminish their ability to recover naturally from disturbances and therefore threaten their climate mitigation potential. These results advance understanding of animal biodiversity’s impact on carbon dynamics and emphasize the need to address biodiversity loss and climate change together.",

Here, we employed a high parametric, mass cytometry–based approach to study the fetal circulatory and microenvironmental immunomes, with the aim to understand the inception and extent of fetal effector T cell priming and its relation with regulatory mechanisms. We found evidence of fetal thymic immune imprinting, coupled with both circulatory and tissue effector memory development. Correspondingly, in the regulatory compartment, we detected the presence of Tbet + Treg in fetal tissues at elevated levels compared to adult tissues. Fetal Tregs, though capable of suppression, were hyposuppressive as compared with adult counterparts. We found that a proportion of fetal Tregs lost FoxP3 commitment during proliferation and exhibited higher TCR clonotype sharing with effector T cells, indicating higher plasticity in fetal Tregs than adult. Epigenetic profiling of the FoxP3 promoter locus reveals that fetal Tregs were only partially demethylated, possibly explaining the observed instability. In summary, our data provide evidence of a regulatory environment in the 2nd trimester permissive for T effector maturation, in part contributed by the relative instability and hypofunctionality in fetal Tregs.",

The limited anticodon diversity of mitochondrial tRNAs forces m.7076G translation to rely on wobble pairing, unlike the Watson–Crick–Franklin pairing used for m.7076A. Mitochondrial ribosome profiling confirmed stalled translation of the m.7076G allele.

More recently, human activities have converted continuous habitats into fragmented and isolated patches. Recent meta-analyses suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation (HL&amp;F) have negatively impacted the genetic diversity of species but very few studies have analyzed the consequences of HL&amp;F on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity and on isolation by distance (IBD) patterns (i.e., correlations between genetic and geographical distances) observed in many species. In this work, we use spatial simulations to investigate the speed at which IBD patterns generated in continuous habitats are lost in a context of HL&amp;F. We characterized the behavior of IBD in the case of i) instantaneous HL&amp;F, ii) gradual (two-steps) HL&amp;F, and iii) range expansion followed by instantaneous HL&amp;F. In addition, we show that a spatially explicit theoretical framework based on previous IBD theoretical results can be modified and applied to a toroidal stepping-stone model undergoing HL&amp;F. Our results suggest that IBD patterns can be maintained for long periods of time after HL&amp;F, thus pointing to the long-term persistence of signatures associated to past habitat connectivity in the genetic diversity of many species, even if they went through major and sometimes ancient fragmentation events. This suggests that some present-day fragmented species, who still exhibit significant IBD patterns, may have been partly disconnected for very long periods, on the order of tens of thousands of years for species with long generation time.",

We used iggypop to synthesize a series of single-transcript autonomously bioluminescent reporters (STARBURSTs) that link the five genes of a fungal bioluminescence pathway via ribosomal skipping LP4/2A sequences into a 9.5 kb transcript that function in planta. We also synthesized RUBY reporters (a reporter gene system producing red betalain pigment) recoded to match dicot codon usage, as RUBY was codon optimized for rice codon usage and has a high GC content. Surprisingly, the recoded RUBYs substantially reduced betalain production in transient Nicotiana benthamiana assays. Based on this observation, we synthesized six GC-boosted STARBURSTs, which produced robust luminescence in both transient assays and transgenic Arabidopsis plants.

The effective absorption cross section of RCs dynamically responds to the light environment on time scales of seconds to days, allowing rapid acclimations to changes in spectral irradiance and photoprotection under high light, thereby optimizing light absorption for photochemistry. Although energy coupling between LHC–RCs has been studied for decades in laboratory cultures, it remains poorly understood in real-world conditions, where it is potentially influenced by nutrients. In the oceans, one of the most critical micronutrients for photosynthesis is iron (Fe). To investigate the effects of Fe stress on the energetic coupling between LHC–RCs in natural phytoplankton assemblages in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, we assessed photophysiological responses using a pair of custom-built fluorometers measuring chlorophyll-a variable fluorescence and picosecond fluorescence lifetimes. Detailed analysis based on the functional absorption cross section of the oxygen-evolving complex, quantum yield of photochemistry, energetic connectivity of RCs, and the average lifetime of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence suggested that between 10 and 25% of LHCs remain uncoupled from RCs and do not effectively contribute to photochemical charge separation. Addition of Fe to samples under trace metal-clean on-board incubations indicates relatively rapid recoupling (&lt; 24 h) of antennae to photochemistry, followed by biophysical stabilization of recoupled complexes. Our findings highlight the crucial role of micronutrients in controlling the excitation energy transfer from LHCs to RCs in marine phytoplankton and the overall primary productivity in the real-world oceans.",

          "abstract": "Reproductive, male-enriched small RNAs are present in flowering plants and animals, yet their role in plants remains underexplored. We generated dicer-like 5 ( dcl5 ) mutants in durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum 2n = 4× = 28; AABB), revealing temperature-sensitive genic male sterility. Loss of DCL5 depleted premeiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNA production, correlating with sterility under standard growth conditions and partial fertility recovery at higher temperatures. A single functional DCL5 allele restored complete fertility, presenting a promising alternative to current methods for hybrid production. We demonstrate that premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNA biogenesis is independent of miRNA-mediated cleavage and driven by a conserved motif initiating DCL5 activity. In the dcl5 mutant developing under sterility-inducing conditions, developmental defects are observed during pollen maturation, rather than at peak 24-nt phasiRNA accumulation in premeiotic and meiotic anthers. Although no visible morphological abnormalities were apparent during early development, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that dcl5 mutant cells exhibit transcriptional profiles distinct from those of wild-type cells, when premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs are accumulating at the early developmental stage. Finally, the coexpression of Argonaute ( AGO1b , AGO4a, and AGO6 ) homeologs in 24-nt phasiRNA-producing cells identifies candidate effectors and suggests a role for 24-nt phasiRNAs in transcriptional gene silencing.",

Therefore, rising soil N is expected to increase the delaying effects of elevated temperature on the end of the season, i.e., leaf senescence. However, the interactive effects of temperature, soil N, and aridity on xylem autumn phenology remain unknown. We conducted a wide spatial analysis from 75 conifer sites in the Northern Hemisphere and found that rising soil N increases the delaying effects of elevated temperature on the end of xylem cell wall thickening but reduced the delaying effects on the cessation of cell enlargement, especially in humid regions. The contrasting effects of elevated soil N on cell enlargement versus cell wall thickening could affect xylem cell anatomy, thereby induce changes in wood density, and induce a decoupling of stem size growth from photosynthate production. These analyses extend previous findings on forest autumn phenology by systematically investigating the spatial variation in the interactive effects of temperature and soil N on xylem autumn phenology at the cellular scale.",

          "abstract": "Conservation science and policy are geared primarily toward the preservation of species and habitats, with priority often given to the rarest, most vulnerable or most charismatic forms. This pattern-based approach has broad appeal and offers a pragmatic short-cut for targeting conservation action. However, the long-term efficacy of species and landscape conservation programs remains highly uncertain, amid growing evidence that sustainable conservation action requires an increased emphasis on preserving ecological and evolutionary processes. This reframing of conservation goals was first proposed 50 y ago, but the concept has struggled to gain traction, particularly in terms of translation into policy. Nonetheless, recent events have shifted the narrative, with multiple interlinked global challenges—including biological invasions, food security, disease, and climate change—putting ecological processes firmly back on the agenda. Concurrently, conservation finance is changing rapidly, driven in part by the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which prioritized actions to enhance and restore ecosystem stability, connectivity, and resilience. These ecosystem properties are fundamentally process-driven and appear to create an operational gulf between current conservation practice and the targets of international agreements. We describe how new approaches can be used to close this gap by redirecting conservation attention toward processes at the heart of ecosystem function, including adaptation, gene flow, dispersal, and trophic interactions. Wider adoption of these approaches is urgently needed to forge a deeper connection between conservation practice and policy targets, thereby ensuring that ongoing investment in biodiversity conservation goes beyond damage limitation and instead leaves a lasting legacy of resilient ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Clinically, compromised fracture healing often occurs at sites with less muscle coverage and muscle flaps can provide the necessary healing environment for appropriate healing in severe bone loss. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we established a mouse reporter model for studying muscle cell contribution to bone fracture repair. Analyzing skeletal muscle scRNA-seq datasets revealed that Prg4 marks a fibroadipogenic progenitor (FAP) subpopulation. In mice, Prg4 + cells were specifically located in the skeletal muscle, but not at the periosteum or inside cortical bone. These cells expressed FAP markers, responded to muscle injury, and became periosteal cells under normal and muscle injury conditions. Fracture fragmented muscle fibers, rapidly expanded Prg4 + FAPs at the injury site and promoted their migration into the fracture gap. Later, they gave rise to many chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the outer periphery of callus next to muscle. In repaired bones, the descendants of Prg4 + FAPs were detected as mesenchymal progenitors in the periosteum and osteocytes at the prior fracture site. A second fracture activated those cells and stimulated them to become osteoblasts in the inner part of callus. Importantly, ablation of Prg4 + FAPs impaired fracture healing and functional repair. In an intramembranous bone injury model (drill-hole), Prg4 + FAPs became periosteal cells, but their contribution to bone defect repair was significantly less than in fractures. Taken together, we demonstrate the critical role of FAPs in endochondral bone repair and uncover a mechanism by which mesenchymal progenitors transform from muscle to cortical bone.",

These dynamics exhibit directionality with a quantity that increases in time, selection, and preferential spatial expansion of particular states, as well as inheritance in the form of correlated compositions between successive states, and environment-dependent adaptation. The model challenges common conceptions regarding the requirements for life-like properties: It does not involve separate mechanisms for metabolism, replication, and compartmentalization; stores and transmits digital information without template replication or assembly of large molecules; exhibits selection both without and with reproduction; and undergoes growth without autocatalysis. As the model is based on generic physical principles, it is amenable to various experimental implementations.",

We then screened more than 18,000 genomes from all major bacterial groups for the presence of those mutations and determined which mutations can evolve through point mutations. Our results demonstrate that although the evolvability of individual mutations varies considerably across species, overall predicted evolvability is high and relatively homogeneous across bacterial taxa. Rifampicin resistance mutations are present intrinsically in 8% of species that tend to be phylogenetically clustered.

We found that the senescent ECs showed high endocytic capacity and SARS-CoV-2 virus uptake. This triggers an nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway–mediated inflammatory response. Further, Basigin enhanced endocytosis in the senescent ECs by activating the intracellular vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. Thus, EC senescence is associated with enhanced SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis and subsequent vascular endothelial dysfunction.

          "abstract": "The fossil record of functional diversity is increasingly used to study ecosystem evolution, extinction recovery, and factors affecting long-term trends in biodiversity. In addition, the youngest fossil record (late Quaternary) can provide insights into the natural range of functional variability of present-day ecosystems, providing a historical framework for conservation and restoration. However, the reliability of common functional diversity measures derived from fossils is uncertain. If fossils yield reasonable estimates of functional diversity, paleontological data could provide information on ecological attributes and trophic structure in past ecosystems allowing for temporally scalable assessments of ecological and evolutionary processes. To assess how well fossils preserve functional diversity across multiple types of marine invertebrates with varying preservation potential, we compared the live benthos (135 species from 6 phyla) with sympatric skeletal accumulations (150 species) and the predicted fossil record (112 species) for 51 coastal sites in North Carolina (USA). High functional fidelity between the live, dead, and fossil assemblages was supported by congruence in quantitative functional diversity indices (e.g., functional richness, redundancy, overredundancy, and vulnerability), overlap in multidimensional functional space, and species distributions among functional groups ( ρ &gt; 0.85, P ≪ 0.001). Calculating vulnerability using a threshold of ≤2 species also reasonably approximated the vulnerability in the live assemblages. The results suggest that, despite differential preservation and time-averaging, functional estimates based on fossils may allow for historical assessments of ecological and evolutionary processes, including short-term community responses to human impacts as well as long-term macroevolutionary dynamics of marine ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Under an accelerating biodiversity crisis, increased urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and climate change require new approaches to assess conservation impact. We argue that animal biologging is a cost-effective method for monitoring biodiversity at its source, including tracked animals and the habitats they occupy. Biologging, or animal-mounted sensors to record data, can act as a reporting, measurement, and verification system, and deliver direct insights into environments of selection. Using a case study of migrating white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), we show that biologging yields real-time measurements of individual performance, mechanistic insights into environments of selection, and the potential for gene flow across anthropogenically influenced habitats. These insights can inform the success of biodiversity targets and conservation initiatives and improve real-time species management. At the global scale, we further illustrate that biologging studies display substantial bias in the types of environments and human conditions sampled. Studies appear biased toward sparsely populated areas and remain particularly rare in highly urbanized areas, areas experiencing high rates of recent forest fragmentation, and key areas for global biodiversity conservation efforts. We highlight the need for equitable access to technology to leverage the biodiversity potential of biologging in the Global South. Advances in software-defined tracking technology will soon give real-time information on energy budgets, survival, reproduction, and ultimately demographic processes and population-level parameters. When deployed into areas most needed, biologging can operationalize access to key measures of biodiversity maintenance such as gene flow, especially in difficult-to-access areas that are key to the future persistence of a species.",

Unlike previously characterized archaeal pili, Tafi is secreted via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, which transports fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Structural analysis reveals that although Tafi pili assemble via a canonical strand-donation mechanism, the pilin subunit (TafE) adopts a distinct structural topology that sets it apart from the previously characterized Sec-dependent pilins that form bundling pili in archaea. Sequence analyses show that TafE homologs are also present in thermophilic archaea from different phyla, but Tat-signal sequences are exclusive to pilins of halophilic archaea. Nevertheless, we find that Tat signal peptides in haloarchaeal TafE-like pili were exchanged back to the Sec signal peptides on multiple independent occasions. These findings expand our understanding of the diversity and evolution of archaeal extracellular filaments and highlight the Tat pathway as a route for pilus assembly in halophilic archaea.",

          "abstract": "The acrosome is a crucial organelle essential for sperm function and male fertility. During acrosome biogenesis, numerous proacrosomal vesicles (PAVs) are transported to the concave region of the nuclear membrane and fuse to form the acrosome. However, the mechanisms governing the fusion of PAVs to form the acrosome remain poorly understood. Here, we identify endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator 1 (ELAPOR1), a conserved protein, as a key factor in PAVs fusion during acrosome biogenesis. Male mice lacking Elapor1 ( Elapor1 −/− ) are infertile, exhibiting defective acrosome biogenesis and a globozoospermia-like phenotype. Using cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ELAPOR1 forms a square planar homodimer in cis, which assembles into a trans-tetramer via head-to-head homophilic interactions dependent on copper chelation. Notably, ELAPOR1 exhibits dual membrane orientation, with a predicted N in − C out topology and a noncanonical N out − C in topology in vesicles. The noncanonical N out − C in topology enables ELAPOR1 to function as a tethering factor bridging vesicles through head-to-head homophilic interactions. A mutant ELAPOR1 (ELAPOR1 4HA ) incapable of copper chelation forms cis homodimers but fails to mediate homophilic interactions in vitro, leading to defective PAVs fusion in mice, phenocopying the Elapor1 -deficient mice. Additionally, ELAPOR1 was shown to interact with soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors protein STX12. Conditional knockout of Stx12 in germ cells resulted in similar defects in acrosome biogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggest that ELAPOR1 functions as a tethering factor that regulates PAV fusion through a copper-dependent mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Pumas ( Puma concolor ) occupy a vast geographical range spanning from Canada to Argentina. Due to urbanization and unregulated hunting, pumas in Florida, known as panthers, are the only breeding population east of the Mississippi River. In the 1990s, Florida panthers numbered &lt;30 individuals suffering from inbreeding depression. In 1995, eight pumas from Texas were translocated into southern Florida to mitigate the effects of isolation. This translocation reduced inbreeding depression and increased population size. While genetic rescue is often suggested as a means of ameliorating the effects of small population size, the underlying genetic mechanism and its long-term efficacy remain understudied. We sequenced the genomes of posttranslocation Florida panthers (PTFPs) to elucidate the genomic consequences of genetic rescue. We inferred local ancestry across the genomes of PTFPs and found that no regions have been entirely replaced by Texas ancestry, discarding the possibility of genetic swamping. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of the translocation were likely caused by a reduction in homozygosity, alleviating recessive deleterious load, rather than by a reduction in the number of deleterious variants. We did not find evidence that selection has favored replacement of original Florida DNA with Texas DNA in any systematic fashion. Using simulations, we found that heterozygosity increased in the long-term compared to a no translocation scenario; however, the effects on fitness are more transient. Our findings hold significant implications not only for the management of Florida's panther population, but also for informing strategies for genetic rescue in other wild, inbred populations encompassing broader conservation efforts.",

Various factors affect the extent of load, such as population size and breeding system, but other important determinants remain unexplored. In particular, whole-genome duplication (WGD)—a pervasive macromutation occurring broadly across Eukaryotes—remains poorly understood in terms of its impact on neutral and selective processes within populations. Using iterative forward simulations and empirical analysis of 632 short- and 16 long-read sequenced individuals of Arabidopsis arenosa (in 23 diploid and 42 natural autotetraploid populations), we measure the effects of WGD on genome-wide diversity and mutation load. Our simulations show how genetic variation gradually rises in autotetraploids due to increased mutational target size. Moreover, mutation load increases due to relaxed purifying selection as ploidies rise, when deleterious mutations are masked by additional chromosome copies. Empirical data confirm these patterns, showing significant increases in nucleotide diversity, ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs, and numbers of indels and large structural variants in A. arenosa autotetraploids. However, a rather modest increase in load proxies together with a broad distribution and niche of autotetraploids suggests load accumulation has not yet limited their successful expansion. Overall, we demonstrate a complex interplay between neutral processes and purifying selection in shaping genetic variation following WGD and highlight ploidy as an important determinant of mutation load, genetic diversity, and therefore adaptive potential in natural populations.",

          "abstract": "NCOA4, a dedicated autophagy receptor for mediating selective autophagy of ferritin (ferritinophagy), plays a vital role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. The cellular abundance of NCOA4 is regulated by the E3 ligase HERC2 that can specifically target NCOA4 for proteasomal degradation under iron-replete conditions. However, the detailed molecular mechanism governing the iron-dependent recognition of NCOA4 by HERC2 remains elusive. Here, using multidisciplinary approaches, we systematically characterize the HERC2-binding domain (HBD) of NCOA4 and its interaction with HERC2. We uncover that NCOA4 HBD harbors a [2Fe-2S] cluster and can exist in two different states, the apo -form state and the [2Fe-2S] cluster–bound state. Moreover, we unravel that HERC2 can effectively recognize the [2Fe-2S] cluster–bound NCOA4 HBD through its Cullin-7-PARC-HERC2 (CPH) domain and iron–sulfur cluster–dependent NCOA4-binding domain (INBD) with a synergistic binding mode. The determined crystal structures of HERC2(2540-2700) and its complex with the [2Fe-2S] cluster–bound NCOA4 HBD together with relevant biochemical and cellular results not only elucidate how NCOA4 HBD specifically senses cellular iron level by binding a [2Fe-2S] cluster but also reveal the molecular basis underlying the specific interaction of HERC2 with the [2Fe-2S] cluster–bound NCOA4 HBD. In summary, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the iron-dependent turnover of NCOA4 by HERC2 and expand our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic destruction and fragmentation of habitat restrict many species to small, isolated populations, which often experience high extirpation risk. Restoring connectivity through translocations is one approach for mitigating the demographic and genetic perils faced by small populations. However, translocation interventions often lack substantial postrelease monitoring, and thus important information including the performance of translocated individuals, the long-term impacts on the recipient population, and the extent to which management objectives are fulfilled over time are often poorly known. Here, we examined the establishment dynamics and long-term outcomes of translocations from multiple donor populations into an intensively monitored population of the federally threatened red-cockaded woodpecker. We found evidence that translocations contributed to population growth and led to genetic admixture within the population. The translocated birds provided direct demographic benefits through high rates of establishment, breeding, and survival. We found that the survival and lifetime reproductive success of individuals were positively related to their amount of translocation ancestry, indicating that demographic benefits extended beyond the direct performances of the translocated birds. The translocations diversified the population’s genetic composition with the ancestry of most individuals in the latter years of the study deriving from multiple translocation donor populations. We found marked heterogeneity in the genetic contributions of translocated individuals and cohorts, leading to disproportionate representation of certain lineages. Encouragingly, despite some accumulation of inbreeding during the study, the translocations thus far have not substantially contributed to inbreeding. Our findings illustrate in precise detail how translocations can be an effective approach for managing imperiled taxa.",

This approach, which we term electron diffraction with native mass spectrometry (ED-MS), allows assignment of protein target structures bound to ligands with data obtained from crystal slurries soaked with mixtures of known inhibitors and crude biosynthetic reactions. This extends to libraries of printed ligands dispensed directly onto TEM grids for later soaking with microcrystal slurries, and complexes with noncovalent ligands. ED-MS resolves structures of the natural product, epoxide-based cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, and its biosynthetic analogs bound to the model cysteine protease, papain. It further identifies papain binding to its preferred natural products, by showing that two analogs of E-64 outcompete others in binding to papain crystals, and by detecting papain bound to E-64 and an analog from crude biosynthetic reactions, without purification. ED-MS also resolves binding of the CTX-M-14 β-lactamase, a target of active drug development, to the non-β-lactam inhibitor, avibactam, alone or in a cocktail of unrelated compounds. These results illustrate the utility of ED-MS for natural product ligand discovery and for structure-based screening of small molecule binders to macromolecular targets, promising utility for drug discovery.",

Issues not currently addressed by a single, modern annotation application include 1) built-in curation systems with utilities for expert intervention to provide quality assurance, 2) integrated alignment features that allow for image registration on-the-fly as image flaws are found during annotation, 3) simplicity for nonspecialists within and beyond the neuroscience community, 4) a system to store experimental metadata with annotation data in a way that researchers remain masked regarding condition to avoid potential biases, 5) local management of large datasets appropriate for circuit-level analyses, and 6) fully open-source codebase allowing development of new tools, and more.

PyReconstruct operates in a field-agnostic manner, runs on all major operating systems, breaks through legacy RAM limitations, features an intuitive and collaborative curation system, and employs a flexible and dynamic approach to image registration. It can be used to analyze, display, and publish experimental or connectomics data.

          "abstract": "A catalyst’s efficiency for accelerating a reaction rate is determined by its molecular structure and interactions with the substrate. While one can predict kinetics for a particular molecular model, tuning the (potentially many) model parameters to reach a desired or optimal kinetics for a catalytic cycle is usually considered computationally prohibitively expensive, especially in solvated systems. Here, we show for a simple model representing a minimal catalytic cycle that such optimization is possible using only one single (path-sampling) simulation, by applying a maximum caliber based path reweighting method. We compute the path ensemble for a single parameter setting of the molecular interactions and then expand the kinetic landscape around these parameters. We find that optimal catalytic turnover or efficiency is orders of magnitude improved and is achieved by relevant parameters that induce strain in the system. Thus, path-reweighting based optimization is not only capable of finding important ingredients that lead to desired kinetic rates but can also identify the mechanistic origins of the rate optimization at a fraction of the costs of a direct evaluation. We demonstrate the versatility of the methodology on a minimal model for kinase signaling. The approach promises efficient computational design of (complex) catalysts using realistic models.",

          "abstract": "As memories age, their immediate retrievability decreases albeit, due to ongoing memory consolidation, their future rate of forgetting weakens. Here, we show in two experiments ( N = 1.216 participants) that mentally traveling back in time to older memories’ temporal context at encoding reverses the two effects and makes the memories similar again to how they were at an earlier point in time. Mental time travel increased both the memories’ immediate retrievability and their future rate of forgetting when individuals attempted to reinstate context deliberately and actively and when they retrieved other memories sharing a similar temporal context. Intriguingly, the forgetting after mental time travel even followed the same trajectory as the forgetting after encoding. Attempts to reinstate memories’ encoding context thus rejuvenated memories, although the degree of rejuvenation decreased as temporal lag between encoding and the reinstatement attempts increased, which was mediated by the fact that, with increasing lag, decreasing proportions of the encoded memories were reactivated and reconsolidated in response to participants’ reinstatement attempts. Mentally traveling back in time creates rejuvenation cycles with enhanced retrievability followed by a restart of forgetting and consolidation processes. Recurring rejuvenation cycles may thus be key to maintain memories’ retrievability over longer periods of time, painting the picture of Sisyphus-like memory resurrection.",

          "abstract": "Many widespread plant taxa of western North America have diversified into phenotypically and genetically divergent lineages due to complex biogeographic histories across heterogeneous landscapes. Mosaic hybrid zones can form when geographically co-occurring, yet environmentally distinct, lineages cross-pollinate and form hybrids that occupy unique environmental niches absent of a geographic cline. This expands the total environmental space across which parental and hybrid individuals grow, resulting in larger, less fragmented geographic distributions. Here, we highlight hybridization mosaics across three study systems containing taxa critical to widespread plant communities in western North America: Ericameria nauseosa , Artemisia tridentata , and Sphaeralcea fendleri . The systems contain diverged taxa that co-occur across the landscape and hybridize readily. Hybridization among taxa has facilitated niche expansion into intermediate environments consistent with unique combinations of adaptive genetic variation, creating more continuity within each study system—study systems occupy ~820 to 270,000 km 2 more geographic area by virtue of hybridization. Furthermore, hybrids are predicted to play important roles in future climates, as they may occupy 8 to 475% larger distributions compared to present. Convergent patterns signal mosaic hybridization as an underappreciated mechanism with broad ecological and evolutionary ramifications. Leveraging mosaic hybridization may assist the creation of restoration management plans that aim to mitigate the deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation on ecosystems in the context of climate change.",

Early results indicate that classification models using micro MRS data effectively distinguish embryos with high developmental potential and show correlation with oocytes maturity.

A major challenge for studying cell surface proteins is that often they do not fold or traffic properly to the plasma membrane when produced in heterologous cells. We developed a strategy for quantifying surface localization from fluorescence microscopy images of surface-stained cells. Using clustered protocadherins, a protein family important for cell–cell recognition during neuronal development, we found that surface delivery levels vary among clustered protocadherin isoforms and between wild-type and engineered variants. Quantifying these differences provides evidence that cis dimerization is not tightly coupled to surface delivery for clustered protocadherins. This work establishes a generalizable framework for screening proteins and variants of interest for proper cell surface localization.",

          "abstract": "The recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1/2) recombinase, which initiates V(D)J recombination in jawed vertebrates, evolved from RNaseH-like transposases such as Transib and ProtoRAG. However, its postcleavage transposase activity is strictly suppressed. Previous structural studies have focused only on the conserved core domains of RAG1/2, leaving the regulatory mechanisms of the noncore regions unclear. To investigate how RAG1/2 suppresses transposition and regulates DNA cleavage, we determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of nearly full-length RAG1/2 complexed with cleaved recombination signal sequences (RSS) in a signal-end complex (SEC) at resolutions up to 2.95 Å. Two key structures, SEC-0 and SEC-Plant Homeodomain (PHD), reveal distinct regulatory roles of RAG2, which is absent in Transib transposase. SEC-0 displays a closed conformation, revealing that the core RAG2 facilitates sequential DNA cleavage by stabilizing the RSS-cleaved states in a “spring-loaded” mechanism. SEC-PHD reveals how RAG2’s noncore PHD and Acidic Hinge (AH), which are absent in ProtoRAG, inhibit target DNA binding in transposition. Histone H3K4me3, which recruits RAG1/2 to RSS sites, does not influence RAG1/2 binding to V, D, or J gene segments bordered by RSS. In contrast, the suppressed transposition can be activated by H3K4me3 peptides that dislodge the inhibitory PHD. To achieve this derepression in vivo, however, would require an unlikely close placement of two nucleosomes flanking a target DNA bent by nearly 180°. Our structural and biochemical results elucidate how RAG1 has acquired RAG2 and utilizes its core and noncore domains to enhance V(D)J recombination and suppress transposition.",

Here, we isolated ex vivo PS2 S-layers from the industrially important Corynebacterium glutamicum and determined its atomic structure by 3D cryo-EM reconstruction. PS2 monomers consist of a six-helix bundle “core,” a three-helix bundle “arm,” and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix. The PS2 core oligomerizes into hexameric units anchored in the mycomembrane by a channel-like coiled-coil of the TM helices. The PS2 arms mediate trimeric lattice contacts, crystallizing the hexameric units into an intricate semipermeable lattice. Using pulse-chase live cell imaging, we show that the PS2 lattice is incorporated at the poles, coincident with the actinobacterial elongasome. Finally, phylogenetic analysis shows a paraphyletic distribution and dispersed chromosomal location of PS2 in Corynebacteriales as a result of multiple recombination events and losses. These findings expand our understanding of S-layer biology and enable applications of membrane-supported self-assembling bioengineered materials.",

          "abstract": "Neonates and infants are distinct in their clinical and cellular responses to viral infections, with neonatal CD8 + T cells displaying innate-like characteristics and a low threshold for T cell receptor activation. However, specific molecular programs that drive these unique responses are incompletely understood, particularly in humans, and targetable pathways to modulate viral illness in this vulnerable population remain to be elucidated. Early-life immune responses may be developmentally programmed to prioritize avoidance of tissue immunopathology, especially while maternal immunoglobulin provides passive immunity. We set out to define the unique response characteristics and transcription factor landscape of neonatal human CD8 + T cells. Here, we report evidence that naïve neonatal human CD8 + T cells are poised for an accelerated effector switch, with elevations of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 (KLRB1/CD161), Fc epsilon receptor I-gamma ( FCER1G ), DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM1/CD226), granzymes, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and glycolysis compared to naïve adult CD8 + T cells. Further, rapid proliferation and cell death occur upon activation of neonatal CD8 + T cells, with cell viability largely rescued by IL-2 or IL-7. These features are coupled with a unique transcription factor landscape, including high expression of thymocyte selection associated high mobility group box (TOX) and HELIOS ( IKZF2 ), and these signatures continue in postnatal life until at least 2 mo of age. We conclude that early-life human CD8 + T cells maintain a unique transcriptional state associated with an accelerated effector switch and short-lived effector program, revealing key nodes of regulation relevant for the unique immunobiology of neonatal humans.",

          "abstract": "The cytoplasmic genomes of plants and animals often fail to track species boundaries. However, the mechanisms responsible for such patterns are poorly understood, in part because few studies have linked cytoplasmic variation to phenotypic traits or environmental differences. Here, we use 1,554 previously published and 185 new whole genome sequences representing 14 taxa from the sunflower genus Helianthus , 91 phenotypic traits measured in common gardens, and 39 environmental variables to test for environmental and phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic genome variation. In agreement with previous work, two distinct chloroplast clades were found across multiple species and the sharing of chloroplast clades between species was mainly due to repeated introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Two mitochondrial clades were also found that matched the chloroplast clades for 98% of individuals, implying predominantly maternal inheritance of both genomes. Cytoplasmic clade was associated with differences in seed shape across several species, and likely with aridity, suggestive of a role in local adaptation. Conversely, we failed to find any credible cytonuclear interactions based on associations between chloroplast and nuclear variation. Taken together, this work suggests that cytoplasmic genomes in annual sunflowers represent a trans-species balanced polymorphism that is likely maintained by adaptation to different environments. More broadly, our results corroborate the syngameon concept, showing how introgression across even very strong reproductive barriers can facilitate environmental adaptation across a species complex.",

Variants were functionally tested in cultured cells using a Per2 -promoter driven luciferase reporter and revealed both loss-of-function and gain-of-function changes in circadian rhythms. The tested BMAL1 variants disrupted PER2 mRNA cycling, but did not cause significant shifts in cellular localization or binding with CLOCK. Conserved variants were further tested in Drosophila , which confirmed variant-dependent effects on behavioral rhythms. Remarkably, flies expressing variant cycle , the ortholog of BMAL1 , also demonstrated deficits in short- and long-term memory, reminiscent of the highly prevalent developmental delay observed in our cohort.

          "abstract": "All cells require a continuous supply of the universal energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to drive countless cellular reactions. The universally conserved F 1 F o -ATP synthase regenerates ATP from ADP and P i by harnessing a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient ( pmf ). Bacteria have evolved diverse pmf -forming strategies using light, organic, and inorganic energy sources. Recently, we proposed that many bacteria survive using atmospheric trace gases to produce ATP when limited for other energy sources. However, direct evidence that atmospheric energy sources are sufficient to generate pmf or drive ATP synthesis is still lacking. Here, we show that the membrane-associated hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase Huc from Mycobacterium smegmatis can enable ATP synthesis from air. Purified Huc couples H 2 oxidation to the reduction of various ubiquinone and menaquinone analogues. We designed a minimal respiratory chain in which Huc interacts with liposomes containing the nonpumping, but pmf -generating, bd -I oxidase and F 1 F o -ATP synthase from Escherichia coli . Our experiments show that passive hydrogen exchange from air to solution is sufficient for the electron transfer and pmf generation required to accumulate ATP. By combining continuous culture bioenergetics measurements with theoretical calculations, we show this process is sufficient for mycobacteria to sustain pmf and ATP synthesis (two ATP molecules per H 2 oxidized) for maintenance energy requirements during nutrient starvation. These findings confirm that atmospheric energy sources can be dependable ‘lifeline’ substrates that enable continuous energy conservation during nutrient starvation. In addition, this work provides a unique tool for ATP production in synthetic applications, which unlike other approaches is traceless without by-product accumulation.",

          "abstract": "The recycling of integrin endocytosed during focal adhesion (FA) disassembly is critical for cell migration and contributes to the polarized formation of new FAs toward the leading edge. How this occurs is unclear. Here, we sought to identify the kinesin motor protein(s) that is involved in recycling endocytosed integrin back to the plasma membrane. We show that the kinesin-2 heterodimer, KIF3AC, and the Rab11 adaptor protein Rab coupling protein (RCP) are required for FA reformation after the disassembly of FAs in mouse and human fibroblasts. In the absence of KIF3AC, integrin does not return to the cell surface after FA disassembly and is found in the Rab11 endocytic recycling compartment. Biochemical pulldowns revealed that KIF3C associated with β1 integrin in an RCP-dependent fashion, but only after FA disassembly. KIF3AC knockdown inhibited cell migration, trafficking of RCP toward the leading edge, and polarized formation of FAs at the leading edge. These results show that KIF3AC promotes cell migration by recycling integrin so that it generates new FAs in a polarized fashion.",

TMs 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 constitute the two halves of a classic LeuT-fold, and TM11 interacts with both halves at the interface. In the IAA-bound state, IAA is specifically recognized in a central pocket formed by TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8. In the presence of IAA, TM1 and TM6 undergo marked conformational changes that are critical for IAA transport. His249 stands out to be a key residue for substrate uptake and release.

          "abstract": "Granulomas play a crucial role in the pathology of tuberculosis, but the immune environment governing their formation remains largely unknown. To explore the dynamic changes in the immune microenvironment during the formation of tuberculous granulomas, we infected adult zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum and then examined uninfected and infected kidneys, as well as large and small granulomas in the kidneys. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we identified two major macrophage subpopulations in the hematopoietic tissue (kidney) of zebrafish under uninfected physiological conditions: monocyte derived and tissue-resident macrophages. Interestingly, the infection induced the emergence of epithelioid cells and a previously undescribed grna.2 + macrophage subpopulation. Depletion of grna.2 + macrophages with the nitroreductase-metronidazole ablation system resulted in shortened zebrafish survival after infection, increased bacterial load, and more granulomas, especially necrotic granulomas. Depletion of grna.2 + macrophages also produced a denser granuloma structure with fewer T cells. RNA-seq and flow cytometry analysis revealed that depletion of grna.2 + macrophages led to upregulated inflammatory signaling pathways, including tnfα and il1β , and increased macrophage lytic cell death. Similarly, in samples from tuberculosis patients, we also identified GRN-positive macrophages, which exhibit similar anti-inflammatory functions. This subset of grna.2 + macrophages present in developing granulomas can suppress excessive inflammatory responses to alleviate macrophage lytic death, reduce tissue damage, promote T cell infiltration and ultimately help control mycobacterial growth in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation provide robust biomarkers of biological age, yet the mechanistic basis and functional significance of slowing these clocks remain unclear. Progress has been limited by the lack of short-lived, genetically tractable model organisms with functional DNA methylation systems. The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis , offers a unique solution. It combines a functional DNA methylation system with a short lifespan and established tools for experimental manipulation. We previously developed an epigenetic clock in Nasonia , but whether this clock reflects plastic, environmentally driven aging processes was unknown. Here, we test this directly by experimentally inducing larval diapause, a naturally occurring developmental arrest triggered by environmental cues. Diapause extended median adult lifespan by 36% and significantly slowed the rate of epigenetic aging. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across multiple adult timepoints, we show that while adults that have passed through diapause as larvae initially emerge epigenetically older, their subsequent epigenetic aging proceeds 29% more slowly than adults that have not passed through diapause as larvae. Clock CpGs were enriched for gene ontology terms related to conserved nutrient-sensing and developmental pathways, including insulin/IGF signaling and mTOR, supporting the established mechanistic link between development and epigenetic aging. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic aging is plastic in Nasonia and can be experimentally modulated by early-life environment, establishing this animal model as a tractable system for dissecting the causal mechanisms of epigenetic aging.",

          "abstract": "The standard model of sex chromosome evolution is based on ancient XY or ZW systems. Young neo-sex chromosomes that form via the translocation of autosomal material to preexisting sex chromosomes provide materials to study early events in sex chromosome evolution. Neo-sex chromosomes are taxonomically widespread but, until recently, appeared to be rare in female-heterogametic taxa, including birds. Here, we report on the comparative evolutionary genomics of newly discovered neo-Z and neo-W sex chromosomes in two Pacific Island birds, the honeyeater species, Myzomela tristrami and M. cardinalis . Our results show that 19 to 21 Mya, ~85% of chr5 , an autosome, translocated to the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of an ancestral sex chromosome (Z or W) and rapidly recombined onto its heterolog, leaving the remainder of chr5 to segregate as a remnant autosome. A large inversion then established a nonrecombining (NR) neo-W region and a neo-PAR. The accumulation of at least seven additional inversions created interspersed blocks of ancestral and neo-W sequence, without expanding the NR region. The neo-W experienced mass invasion by endogenous retrovirus repeats, a reduced efficacy of selection, and functional degeneration. Many of our observations are consistent with predictions of the standard model, whereas others highlight idiosyncrasies of neo-sex chromosomes that arise via translocation of autosomal sequence to ancestral sex chromosomes. We speculate, in particular, that the repository of retrotransposons on the ancestral W may have been an accelerant in the evolution of neo-W structure, content, and functional degeneration.",

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on MNs whose glutamate release is weakened by knockdown of components of the MN transmitter release machinery reveals a reduction in expression of a group of genes that encode potassium channels and their positive modulators.

          "abstract": "While exploring strategies to control blood glucose concentrations in diabetes, we identified so-called molecular glues D223 and D927 that promote glucose uptake in the absence of insulin. They act by increasing the binding affinity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase α (PI3Kα) catalytic subunit p110α to canonical small guanosine triphosphatase RAS proteins and to RRAS, RRAS2, and MRAS by three orders of magnitude. The compounds bind to the RAS-binding domain of p110α, stabilizing the secondary structures of the PI3Kα in a RAS-binding conformation and forming direct interactions with RAS residues tyrosine-40 and arginine-41. In vivo, D927 mimicked the effects of insulin: It rapidly lowered blood glucose concentrations, enhanced glucose metabolism in normal and Zucker fatty rats, and improved hyperglycemia in models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, even in insulin-deficient diabetic animals.",

          "abstract": "Marine protected areas (MPAs) are expanding worldwide, but industrial fishing within their boundaries remains poorly understood. By combining vessel Global Positioning System data with satellite imagery, we detected industrial fishing in 47% of coastal MPAs worldwide between 2022 and 2024, with two-thirds of vessel detections (67%) untracked by public monitoring. These untracked vessels were most prevalent (80%) in MPAs with the most restrictive management category, which aims to prohibit all extractive activities. The presence and density of fishing vessels were mainly driven by the size and remoteness of MPAs rather than their management category itself. Including untracked vessels increased estimated fishing effort within MPAs by 28%, to an average of 4 hours per square kilometer per year. These results highlight the continued presence of industrial fishing vessels in MPAs and an important gap in our understanding of fishing pressure on protected areas worldwide.",

Mutation-selective covalent inhibitors spare RAS in healthy tissue and enable extended pharmacodynamic effect, but covalent targeting of RAS G12D is hindered by low nucleophilicity and high proteomic abundance of carboxylic acids. We overcame these challenges with compounds that bind cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic protein-protein interface between CYPA and active RAS that enables selective, enzyme-like rate enhancement of the covalent reaction between D12 and electrophilic warheads with exceptionally low intrinsic reactivity. This approach yielded orally bioavailable compounds with marked antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models of KRAS G12D cancers, including the investigational agent zoldonrasib (RMC-9805) currently undergoing clinical evaluation (NCT06040541).",

Proteins that recognize peptide–MHC-I (pMHCI) complexes with specificity for diseased cells could have considerable therapeutic utility. Specificity requires recognition of outward-facing amino acid residues within the disease-associated peptide as well as avoidance of extensive contacts with ubiquitously expressed MHC. We used RFdiffusion to design pMHCI-binding proteins that make extensive contacts with the peptide and identified specific binders for 11 target pMHCs starting from either experimental or predicted pMHCI structures. Upon incorporation into chimeric antigen receptors, designs for eight targets conferred peptide-specific T cell activation. Our approach should have broad utility for both protein- and cell-based pMHCI targeting.",

Vast numbers of amino acid combinations constitute stable protein cores and surfaces. However, alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function by indirect allosteric effects. Both protein stability and binding can be predicted using simple additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. Indeed, energy models trained on one protein can predict functional cores and surfaces across more than a billion years of evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins. Our results reveal the simple energetic architecture of proteins and suggest that allostery is an important constraint on sequence evolution.",

By screening 389 ancient and 408 contemporary samples, we have expanded the genetic data available for the species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct human-infecting clades of M. lepromatosis , with one dominating North America since colonial times. The presence of millennia-old strains in North and South America indicates that M. lepromatosis may have been widespread during the Late Holocene, demonstrating that M. lepromatosis leprosy has a long-standing history in the Americas before European arrival.",

In preclinical models, BBO-10203 caused significant tumor growth inhibition across multiple tumor types and showed enhanced efficacy in combination with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6), estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, and KRAS-G12C mutant, including in tumors harboring mutations in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11). Notably, these antitumor effects occurred without inducing hyperglycemia, because insulin signaling does not depend on RAS-mediated PI3Kα activation to promote glucose uptake.",

Applying ExIGS to progeria-derived fibroblasts revealed that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant chromatin regulation that may erode cell identity. Lamin was found to generally repress transcription, suggesting that variation in nuclear morphology may affect gene regulation across tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform with which to link nuclear abnormalities to gene regulation, offering insights into disease mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Given their high sociality and close evolutionary distance to humans, monkeys are an essential animal model for unraveling the biological mechanisms underlying human social behavior and elucidating the pathogenesis of diseases exhibiting abnormal social behavior. However, behavioral analysis of naturally behaving monkeys requires manual counting of various behaviors, which has been a bottleneck due to problems in throughput and objectivity. Here, we developed a three-dimensional markerless motion capture system that used multi-view data for robust tracking of individual monkeys and accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional poses of multiple monkeys living in groups. Validation analysis in two monkey groups revealed that the system enabled the characterization of individual social dispositions and relationships through automated detection of eight basic social events. Analyses of social looking demonstrated its potential for investigating adaptive behaviors in a social group. These results suggest that this motion capture system will greatly enhance our ability to analyze primate social behavior.",

To address this challenge, we tested a social drive hypothesis, which predicts that social plasticity and social selection in human groups cause indirect genetic effects that accelerate the adaptation of fitness, promoting population growth via feedback between the environmental causes and evolutionary consequences of cooperation. Using Bayesian multilevel models to analyze fertility data from a small-scale society, we demonstrate that density- and frequency-dependent indirect genetic effects on fitness promote the evolution of cooperation among neighboring women, increasing the rate of contemporary adaptation by ~5×. Our results show how interactions between the genetic and socioecological processes shaping cooperation in reproduction can drive rapid growth and social evolution in human populations.",

Given the number of subsistence crises in medieval England, this study uses stable isotopic, demographic, and paleopathological data from human skeletal remains ( n  = 275) to assess associations between early-life nutritional stress and health outcomes before, during, and after the Black Death in London and rural Lincolnshire approximately 1000 to 1540 CE. Our results suggest that survivors of early-life nutritional stress were resilient with respect to causes of death in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Ultimately, however, early-life nutritional stress was associated with the presence of skeletal biomarkers of stress and elevated mortality in middle and late adulthood in the medieval period, consistent with models from developmental biology. We find that the prevalence of nutritional stress increased before the Black Death and decreased afterward. Understanding the long-term consequences of early-life nutritional stress can offer insights on the health trajectories of historical populations.",

          "abstract": "Online political debate is frequently lamented for being toxic, partisan, and counterproductive. However, we know little about how core elements of political debate (justification, tone, willingness to compromise, and partisanship) affect its quality. Using text-based treatments experimentally manipulated with a large language model, we test how these elements causally affect the quality of open-text responses about issues important to the US and UK public. We find substantial evidence that differences in justification, tone, and willingness to compromise, but not partisanship, affect the quality of subsequent discourse. Combined, these elements increase the probability of high-quality responses by roughly 1.6 to 2 times and substantially increase openness to alternative viewpoints. Despite the ability to bring about substantial changes in discourse quality, we find no evidence of changes in political attitudes themselves. Our findings demonstrate how adapting approaches to online debate can foster healthy democratic interactions but have less influence on changing minds.",

We depicted the global pattern of livestock resistome and prevalence of clinically critical ARGs, highlighting the role of farm and human antibiotic stewardship in shaping livestock resistome.

          "abstract": "Nrf2 acts as a transcriptional master regulator to orchestrate antioxidant responses and maintain redox balance. However, the cellular pathway for translating oxidative stress signals into Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as signaling molecules in modulating Nrf2’s stability and transcriptional activity by activating the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway. When activated, CHK2 phosphorylates the autophagy adaptor protein p62 at serine-349, promoting its interaction with Keap1 and disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, thereby inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitination–dependent degradation. In addition, CHK2 directly phosphorylates Nrf2 at serine-566/serine-577, enhancing its transcriptional activity and antioxidant capacity. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant target genes, along with more severe renal tissue damage in an ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our study reveals a direct mechanism linking the DDR signaling pathway to ROS-triggered Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses, providing critical insight into cellular protection against oxidative stress–induced damage.",

This study revealed that HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 7 (HAUS7) is a molecule that binds to dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3), a regulator of neurotrophic factor signaling and axon regeneration. We observed a distribution pattern of HAUS7 expression, suggesting that neuronal HAUS7 is transported from the cell body to the growth cone under the control of DOCK3. In addition, phosphorylation of DOCK3 at Y562 by tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling leads to the dissociation of HAUS7, which is considered an important step for microtubule assembly. Deletion of Haus7 in mice significantly reduced microtubule formation and axon regeneration following optic nerve crush (ONC). Transcriptome analysis suggested that HAUS7 levels decrease in glaucoma and after the ONC, while retinal ganglion cells actively regenerating their axons express high levels of HAUS7. In summary, HAUS7 is a binding partner of DOCK3 necessary for axon elongation.",

Previous studies have suggested that metformin acts peripherally by reducing hepatic glucose output and altering gut functions. Here, we report a neural mechanism via the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). Mice with forebrain-specific Rap1 knockout exhibited resistance to the antidiabetic effects of low-dose metformin while remaining sensitive to other antidiabetic agents. Centrally administered metformin inhibited brain Rap1 and reduced hyperglycemia. Conversely, forced activation of brain Rap1 increased glycemia and abolished the glycemic effect of metformin. Metformin activated a specific subset of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) that requires Rap1. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggest that VMH Rap1 is indispensable for the antidiabetic effects of metformin. These findings highlight the VMH Rap1 pathway as a critical mediator of metformin action.",

This transformation exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and achieves an impressive isolated yield of up to 98% in just 1 minute under ultraviolet light. Mechanistic studies suggest that the sulfonyl group acts as a free radical leaving group, with the capability of abstracting the chlorine atom from SF 5 Cl. This radical chain propagation pathway facilitates the rapid regeneration of the sulfur pentafluoride radical, resulting in a notably high quantum yield. Moreover, this light-driven radical pentafluorosulfanylation simplifies the synthetic pathway to modify complex and bioactive molecules. In addition, the drug-modified pentafluorosulfanyl compounds exhibited promising effects in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo.

However, the underlying mechanism determining postgermination growth of rice is largely unknown. Here, we report the rice OsDREB1A-OsNAC3-OsGA20ox1 transcriptional module that positively regulates the early postgermination growth through the gibberellic acid (GA) pathway. Transcription factor OsDREB1A improves postgermination growth by OsNAC3-mediated increase of GA biosynthesis. OsNAC3 can directly bind to the promoter of GA biosynthesis gene OsGA20ox1 , which consequently activates its expression and increases GA content during the early postgermination growth stage. Furthermore, the expressions of OsDREB1A and OsNAC3 are positively regulated by each other, and the cis-regulatory polymorphisms in promoters fine-tune their corresponding expressions to determine the natural variations of postgermination growth. The transferred elite haplotypes of OsNAC3 and OsDREB1A and overexpression of both genes in japonica varieties contribute postgermination growth. The application of OsDREB1A and OsNAC3 is useful for the development of rice varieties for direct seeding cultivation.",

In particular, we introduce an experiment, in which the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction can be exquisitely extracted from other nuclear broadening mechanisms, thus enabling to access distance distributions. This methodology paves the way for structural studies using 19 F ENDOR in biomolecular systems. Moreover, it offers opportunities to access spin dynamics in electron-nuclear coupled spin systems.",

          "abstract": "The rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to an aging population has made the search for effective treatments more urgent than ever. Previous studies have demonstrated that continuous ultrasound can depolymerize amyloid proteins, offering potential relief from AD. In this study, we present a portable, fully integrated wearable ultrasound system designed to promote amyloid protein depolymerization. The system comprises a flexible honeycomb ultrasonic array patch, a flexible printed circuit, and an interactive terminal control system to facilitate the treatment process. Our results demonstrate that the system effectively reduces amyloid proteins in the brain, improves cognitive function in a familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) mouse model, enhances microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β plaques, and shifts microglia polarization from M1 to M2. These changes contribute to a mitigated inflammatory environment in the brain. This innovative approach may pave the way for noninvasive, personalized treatments for AD, potentially transforming therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative disorders.",

The iPSC-MCs closely resemble human primary MCs at cellular, transcriptional, and functional levels. Using this method, a breast cancer model was generated using patient-derived iPSCs harboring germline BRCA1 mutation. The patient iPSC-MCs recapitulated the transcriptome, clinical genomic alteration, and tumorigenic ability of breast cancer cells.

Despite these advances, our understanding of how Hippo signaling regulates transcription is less clear. To address this, we used live microscopy to study the nuclear behavior of the major Hippo pathway transcription effectors, YAP and TEADs. We reveal that TEADs are a major determinant of YAP DNA binding and nuclear mobility, while YAP minorly influences TEADs. YAP and TEAD1 associate with DNA for longer periods in cells with intrinsically low Hippo pathway activity and upon acute Hippo pathway perturbation. TEAD1 binds the genome on a broad range of timescales, and this is extended substantially in nuclear condensates. Last, a cancer-associated YAP fusion protein exhibits substantially different biophysical behavior than either YAP or TEAD1. Thus, we reveal that Hippo signaling regulates transcription, in part, by influencing the DNA binding times of YAP and TEADs.",

However, little is known if groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce possible benefits. Here, we investigated wild fish shoals responding collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analyzed the collective response in reaction to bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size. Larger shoals increasingly detected predator attacks (i.e., true positives), while their response facing harmless flybys (i.e., false alarms) remained constant. Furthermore, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to simultaneously overcome two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision-making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our findings set the stage for the next generation of studies investigating the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making.",

Inspired by shrimp exoskeletons, we designed an origami exoskeleton that features flexible-rigid arrangements and mechanical multistability. This design offers high stiffness in stable states while allowing for long-stroke transitions, making it suitable for integration with soft actuators to balance deformability and load-bearing capacity. With advantages such as high compressibility and rapid integration, these exoskeleton-enhanced arms have promising applications when mounted on unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, facilitating large-scale dexterous manipulation with the necessary load capacities. For existing soft arms, the proposed origami exoskeleton enhances the potential for manipulation within their original design framework.",

HCeO x -D@PM comprises a platelet membrane (PM) shell for targeted delivery to injured lungs and an HCeO x core, which enables high drug loading, efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and penetration of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Initially, HCeO x -D@PM suppresses the inflammation and mitigates the adverse effects of lesions on AT2 cell by scavenging accumulated ROS.

The ultimate all-inorganic scintillator delivers near-unity quantum yield, with scintillation output more than 10 times higher than that of previous polymer matrix–based flexible scintillators.

Although these two zones can be readily measured today, there has been limited understanding of how the mixed and transition layers evolved over the Phanerozoic since animals first began to extensively colonize the seafloor. Here, we provide a record for the depths of the sedimentary mixed and transition layers through the Phanerozoic. We find that although deepening of the sediment mixed layer spanned hundreds of millions of years, a deep transition layer was established as early as the Cambrian and did not further deepen until the Mesozoic—trajectories reflecting evolutionary radiations, changes in nutrient cycling, and alleviation of oxygen stress.",

Here, we estimate the ground acceleration and quake magnitude for four boulders and one landslide: all sampled by Apollo 17 astronauts. These features all have exposure ages that establish the approximate timing of the moonquakes. Our analysis suggests that the structural relief of the Lee-Lincoln fault scarp is the result of multiple coseismic slip events with a minimum body wave magnitude M w of ~2.9 to 3.3. The formation and growth of thousands of such globally distributed young thrust faults, through multiple coseismic events, suggest that the Moon has a history of widespread strong shallow moonquakes.

The resulting expanded depth and spatial resolution of PPIs charted compartment-specific assemblies of protein complexes throughout infection. We find that a broader suite of host chaperones than previously anticipated exhibits nuclear recruitment to form condensates known as virus-induced chaperone-enriched (VICE) domains. Monitoring protein and RNA constituents and ribosome activity, we establish that VICE domains sequester ribosome biogenesis factors from ribosomal RNA, accompanying a cell-wide defect in ribosome supply. These findings highlight infection-driven VICE domains as nodes of translational remodeling and demonstrate the utility of N/C-TPCA to study dynamic biological contexts.",

Consequently, their time-of-day–dependent response to vesicular stomatitis virus was dysregulated, and the diurnal development of CD8 + T cells into variegated populations of memory/effectors was altered in the absence of ADRB2 signaling. The diurnal fluctuations in T cell phenotypes were a distinct developmental process, independent of migration kinetics within the spleen.

However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM.

          "abstract": "Biodiversity loss continues to occur globally. However, the long-term dynamics of the redistribution of abundance within declining communities remain poorly resolved. We quantitatively dissected the major decline of North American bird abundance by rigorously analyzing 38,854 surveys that quantify over half a century of annual dynamics for 648 populations of 244 bird species from six regions, each encompassing 140,000 to 370,000 km 2 . Despite regional variation in geography, habitat, and species composition, a consistent pattern emerges: Biodiversity loss predominantly stems from declines in the most abundant bird species, whereas less abundant species show increases. We demonstrate that species once abundant and near their carrying capacity have declined, while less abundant species farther from their carrying capacity have increased. A path analysis identifies the key role played by anthropogenic land-use changes in causing the observed declines. Conservation efforts should place stronger emphasis on the abundance of common species as a central ecological indicator.",

In XYZ half-Heusler (HH) compounds, complex interactions between constituent atoms, featuring both covalent and ionic characters, are supposed to affect mechanical and thermoelectric behavior. We use a data-driven approach based on first-principles calculations to identify promising HH compounds and explore the correlations between bonding-related features and functional properties. Our analysis suggests that enhanced Y ─ Z bonding correlates with greater bulk modulus ( B ), larger Grüneisen parameter, and enhanced power factor. Tungsten-iron-lead stands out with excellent B  = 162.4 gigapascals and a low lattice thermal conductivity of ~7.7 watts per meter per kelvin, leading to a figure of merit of ~0.52 (at 526 kelvin) without any nanostructuring, surpassing that of vanadium-iron-antimony by ~80.8%. These findings highlight how chemical bonding characteristics, interpreted from electronic structure and orbital-resolved bonding analysis, provide in-depth insights into the structure-to-property correlation to accelerate the screening out of potential thermoelectrics.",

We use NASA GRACE/GRACE-FO data to show that the continents have undergone unprecedented TWS loss since 2002. Areas experiencing drying increased by twice the size of California annually, creating “mega-drying” regions across the Northern Hemisphere. While most of the world’s dry/wet areas continue to get drier/wetter, dry areas are now drying faster than wet areas are wetting. Changes in TWS are driven by high-latitude water losses, intense Central American/European droughts, and groundwater depletion, which accounts for 68% of TWS loss over non-glaciated continental regions. “Continental drying” is having profound global impacts. Since 2002, 75% of the population lives in 101 countries that have been losing freshwater water. Furthermore, the continents now contribute more freshwater to sea level rise than the ice sheets, and drying regions now contribute more than land glaciers and ice caps.

We found that PCYOX1L is a secreted protein that promotes ASIC1a assembly. PCYOX1L was indispensable for ASIC1a expression in the plasma membrane and synaptosomes, and the genetic deletion of PCYOX1L severely impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. Endocytosed PCYOX1L promoted plasma membrane expression of ASIC1a, and PCYOX1L secreted from astrocytes induced ASIC1a activity in neurons.

The overall architecture of the complex remains undefined because several subunits contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Here, we combined structural and functional approaches to establish PELP1 as the central scaffold of the rixosome upon which the enzymatic subunits modularly assemble. The C-terminal half of PELP1 is composed of a proline-rich IDR that mediates association with the AAA-ATPase MDN1, histones, and the SUMO-specific protease SENP3. The PELP1 IDR contains a glutamic acid–rich region that we establish can chaperone the histone octamer in vitro. Last, the x-ray structure of a small linear motif (SLiM) from the PELP IDR bound to SENP3 reveals how PELP1 allosterically activates SUMO protease activity.

We demonstrate that GPR161 activates a recently discovered cAMP/PKA signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of NDE1, a dynein complex regulator, and microtubule organization to regulate migration. These findings unveil a critical role of mechanosensation in neuronal migration, regulating the rhythmicity of migration, in concert with the externalization/internalization dynamics of the primary cilium.",

We validate this principle with three distinct oxides: garnet Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.5 O 12 , perovskite BaCo 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 3 , and pyrochlore Gd 1.5 La 0.5 Zr 2 O 7 . This structural templating approach enables synthesis along predesigned pathways, forming intermediates that are thermodynamically favored for prior formation and kinetically preferred for the final product, resulting in precisely synthesizing high-purity target materials.

Genome-wide retrospective assessment of the iconic migratory Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) from the Barents Sea, unraveled varying degree of admixture with the nonmigratory coastal ecotype throughout the 20th century, and intriguingly more intensified during recent decades. These genomic changes were supported by an increased number of individuals displaying the heterozygous state of the chromosomal inversion coupled to migratory behavior in Atlantic cod. Ecological models and genome-wide scans identified that some of the observed frequency shifts, coupled to neural development, metabolic, and growth regulation, covaried with intensified fisheries, reduced generation time, and ocean warming.

In zebrafish embryos, midline tissues composed of the notochord, floorplate, and hypochord elongate synchronously with their lengths aligned. We show that floorplate and hypochord cells collectively migrate posteriorly along the nascent notochord extracellular matrix as it extends posteriorly, maintaining the tripartite configuration. Fibroblast growth factor-mediated migration in a spatially graded manner causes cell stretching, which triggers Yap-dependent proliferation and controls floorplate and hypochord growth. Supported by mathematical modeling, we further suggest that their growth is fine-tuned by mechanical tethering to the notochord via cadherin 2 at the posterior end. We propose that the notochord instructs and sustains the tripartite formation via leader-follower formation control, a strategy from engineering that spatially organizes multiple agents to coordinate the growth of the midline tissues.",

Current structural understanding of HER2 and its interactions with other receptors and with different affinity agents has relied on numerous structures of individual domains of HER2. Here, we subjected purified near full-length HER2 to single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. Besides the canonical conformation described in previous structural studies, we report a previously unreported conformation of the HER2 extracellular domain that is stabilized upon TZB binding, which might hamper association with HER3, a receptor with which HER2 forms an oncogenic unit.

However, limited by the difficulties in atomic-level fabrication and material stability, the experimental visualization of the CDW states in two-dimensional (2D) TMDs with Janus structure is still rare. Here, using surface selenization of VTe 2 , we fabricated monolayer Janus VTeSe. With scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed and characterized an unusual 13 × 13 CDW state with threefold rotational symmetry breaking. Combined with theoretical calculations, we find that this CDW state can be attributed to the magnetic-involved charge modulation in the Janus VTeSe, rather than the conventional electron-phonon coupling. Our findings provide a promising platform for studying the CDW states and artificially tuning the electronic properties of the 2D TMDs toward the related fundamental and applied studies.",

By combining monomeric and polymeric surfactants, we demonstrate that polymeric surfactants enhance stability by preventing oil shell drainage, while monomeric surfactants substantially increase water transport above a critical concentration, albeit reducing the emulsion lifespan. Swelling kinetics experiments, coupled with small-angle neutron scattering analysis, reveal that interface-controlled water transport occurs via mixed reverse micelle solubilization. This study provides valuable insights into designing double emulsions with optimized surfactant compositions, enabling enhanced stability and tunable water transport, with potential applications across food, cosmetics, and drug delivery systems.",

Here, we report the results of δ 15 N bulk analyses of fly larvae of three families (Diptera: Brachycera: Calliphoridae, Piophilidae, and Stratiomyidae) collected from putrefying carcasses. Putrefaction led to modest changes in the initial muscle tissue δ 15 N values that ranged from −0.6 to 7.7‰. Much greater δ 15 N values ranging from 5.4 to 43.2‰ were observed in the fly larvae associated with putrefaction.

In this study, by using high-resolution remote sensing data, we evaluated drought strategies of different ecosystem types throughout Europe by evaluating three key physiological regulation aspects (evapotranspiration, water content, and carbon regulation) based on their associated vegetation attributes. We found that different ecosystem types show divergent responses in these physiological attributes, suggesting different optimization strategies with respect to water saving versus spending, water content stabilizing versus fluctuating, and leaf conserving versus shedding strategies facing drought. These drought strategies from remote sensing provide timely ecosystem response information, facilitating earth system model predictions and aiding the protection against future droughts at large scales.",

This oceanic warming aligns with a southward shift of both the westerly and easterly wind belts, indicating a large-scale atmospheric mechanism driving regional ocean changes.

As a result, micrometer-scale-thick QLEDs, with thickness of more than 10 times that of standard QLEDs, are achieved. The demonstrated micrometer-thick red QLEDs not only can be directly built on various substrates such as Cu slabs, Ag nanowire–coated substrate, Al foils, and printing papers but also can exhibit a notably enhanced T 90 life span over 11,000 hours at 1000 candelas per square meter and an ultrahigh brightness of 3,941,000 candelas per square meter, which represent 5.03- and 4.36-fold improvements over those of conventional QLEDs.",

Seven ochre pieces were deliberately modified into lithic retouchers, showing clear use-wear patterns and evidence of intentional shaping. Targeted experiments confirm that some were used for pressure flaking and were rejuvenated to maintain function. These findings provide direct evidence of ochre being used to retouch lithic artifacts during the MSA, highlighting its role in technological systems of this period.

The machine learning framework processes these multimodal data to predict gradual stress progression and diagnose nutrient deficiencies in plants over 10 days earlier than conventional computer vision methods. Moreover, MapS-Wears enables portable and large-scale screening of grafted tomato varieties in greenhouses, accelerating the identification of compatible grafting combinations. This demonstration highlights the potential for high-throughput plant phenotyping and yield improvement.",

          "abstract": "Vertical land motion is one of the main factors contributing to increased flood risk in coastal communities. Here, we use satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to detect and measure previously undocumented land motions in Greater New Orleans (GNO), Louisiana. Although most of New Orleans is generally stable, rapid elevation loss occurs in parts of the city (up to −20 millimeters per year) and on flood protection walls constructed following Hurricane Katrina (up to −28 millimeters per year). This work provides unprecedented spatial coverage of land motion rates in GNO, including wetlands and the flood protection system previously lacking data, which allows a more detailed examination of ground deformation patterns and insight into underlying drivers. In the broader context, this work shows the potential of InSAR for measuring localized land motion in New Orleans and similar communities, particularly where the presence of wetlands complicates its application.",

Decreased NMNAT1 expression and activity were observed in the liver of patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis and either liver or primary hepatocytes from ALD mice. F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7)–regulated interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) ubiquitination degradation contributed to the alcohol-inhibited NMNAT1 transcriptional level. Hepatic NMNAT1 knockout aggravated alcohol-induced hepatic NAD + decline and further hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Metabolomics and transcriptomics interaction revealed that the cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD)–regulated taurine pathway was involved in NMNAT1-disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism in ALD. Hepatic CSAD overexpression or taurine supply attenuated hepatic NMNAT1 knockout–aggravated ALD. Hepatic NMNAT1 loss inhibited NMN-protected ALD. Replenishing hepatic NMNAT1 reversed liver lipid accumulation in ALD mice. These findings identified NMNAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for ALD.",

The polytomic nature of the hamlet radiation is extreme compared to other recent radiations such as Lake Victoria cichlids.

Regulatory elements were associated with their putative target genes by linkage analysis, and this was complemented and verified experimentally using promoter capture Hi-C. We identified the transcription factor motifs enriched in these regulatory elements along with their occupancy, pinpointing LHX9/EMX2 as potentially critical regulators of ovarian development.

Our analysis highlights how solar adoption in one region affects CO 2 emissions in neighboring regions, emphasizing the potential for collaborative efforts. We estimate that a 15% increase in solar generation is associated with an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons (MMT) of CO 2 emissions, contributing 12.38% toward the yearly target of 69 MMT CO 2 reductions needed to cut 1380 MMT of CO 2 in 20 years, as per the Environmental Protection Agency rule on fossil fuel power plants.

In this study, we examine how diurnal T /RH hysteresis modulates VPD across different climates using observational data alongside high-resolution reanalysis and simulations. Here, we find that regions exhibiting strong diurnal T /RH hysteresis, especially in some waterside and montane regions, experience earlier daily VPD peaks. We also demonstrate that global warming weakens diurnal T /RH hysteresis, leading to amplified VPD increasing trends and greater ecosystem stress. These results highlight the need for improved representation of diurnal T /RH interactions in climate models to better predict atmospheric dryness and its impacts on land-atmosphere feedbacks, ecosystems, and regional water cycles.",

The vicious cycle between the inflammatory microenvironment (inflamed soil) and dysfunctional chondrocytes (degeneration-related seeds) drives the chronic progressive deterioration of OA. Here, we report a genetically engineered chondrocyte-mimetic nanoplatform (termed HKL-GECM@MPNPs) comprising a honokiol (HKL)–loaded mitochondrion-targeting nanoparticle core coated with an interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1R2)–overexpressing chondrocyte membrane. HKL-GECM@MPNPs fuse with OA chondrocytes, transferring IL-1R2 onto the plasma membrane and reprogramming the inflamed microenvironment through IL-1β blockade. Mitochondrion-targeting cores then directly deliver HKL to restore mitochondrial sirtuin-3 in OA chondrocytes, reprogramming the cells’ pathological phenotype. Intra-articular injection of HKL-GECM@MPNPs in OA mice reduces inflammation, alleviates joint pain, and mitigates cartilage damage through a synergistic effect. Moreover, HKL-GECM@MPNPs effectively reverse cartilage degeneration in human OA cartilage explants. This approach highlights the potential of HKL-GECM@MPNPs to combine IL-1β blockade and mitochondrial sirtuin-3 restoration as a promising strategy for OA treatment.",

Activated with N -iodosuccinimide (NIS)/trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf), PPAP donors support both O- and N-glycosylation across a broad range of substrates. Guided by density functional theory calculations, their design allows straightforward synthesis through a simple amide coupling reaction, facilitating diverse latent-active transformations and broadening their strategic utility. Furthermore, the distinct reactivity profile of PPAP donors—marked by a clear gap relative to other known donors and orthogonality to many standard activation methods—makes them well suited for modular, one-pot glycosylation strategies. Their ease of synthesis, robust performance in glycosylation, and compatibility with diverse assembly approaches collectively establish PPAP glycosides as powerful tools for the efficient construction of complex carbohydrates.",

Our results show that the H─Au bonding can be described as a process wherein H─Au interactions compensate for relatively weaker Au─Au bonding driven by intrinsic aurophilic interactions. This phenomenon originates from parity-forbidden coupling of superatomic molecular orbitals under a noncentrosymmetric field, giving rise to the atypical H─Au bonding and a formally neutral interstitial H atom. A detailed analysis of optical properties reveals partial suppression of visible-light absorption and emergence of a more favorable phosphorescent channel, a manifestation of the complex nature of this H─Au bonding.

Our analysis indicates that these issues are fundamentally from the free water molecules in aqueous electrolytes, leading to low reversibility of metal anodes. We therefore demonstrate a straightforward and effective strategy, based on modulating the solute anions in aqueous electrolytes, to suppress free water molecule concentration in conventional aqueous electrolytes. A proof of concept is demonstrated using a Zn metal anode, which shows unprecedented reversibility and stability in conventional aqueous electrolytes with structure-making anions under a harsh condition of 10 milliampere hours per square centimeter.

Here, we demonstrate real-time signal processing using a fused network that combines the real-time discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) on a memristor-based analog system on a chip (SoC). A 128-by-128 memristor crossbar array performs the DFT on audio signals with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 33.49 dB, while the following CNN classifies the resulting spectrograms with 94.72% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset. In addition, convolution-based edge detection is applied to real-time video frames. The SoC offers substantial energy efficiency improvement over traditional digital systems in signal processing tasks. This work highlights the potential of memristor-based SoCs for efficient real-time signal processing.",

          "abstract": "The replacement of canonical histones with their variant forms enables the dynamic and context-dependent regulation of the mammalian genome. Histone variants also play key roles in various pathological processes including malignancies. Among these, the aberrant expression of the testis-specific histone variant H2A.B contributes to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma. The multifunctionality of histone variants is regulated by their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, the PTMs of H2A.B and their functional implications are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Amino terminus of H2A.B serves as a central hub for a diverse range of gene regulatory protein-protein interactions, orchestrated by phosphorylation and arginine methylation. This includes a mechanism whereby non–chromatin-bound H2A.B associates with SWI/SNF, which limits its access to the genome. Last, we identify phosphorylated H2A.B as a previously uncharacterized marker of active RNA polymerase II transcription start sites. These findings elucidate a central role for H2A.B in genome regulation and highlight the importance of its PTMs in modulating its multifunctional roles.",

While temperature-mortality relationships are well-documented, the effects of climate change on morbidity are less understood. Using data on emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006 to 2017, we find distinct differences in the temperature-response functions of these health outcomes, influenced by age distribution and underlying causes of morbidity and mortality. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: We project that while future warming will increase ED visits, mortality will decrease due to fewer cold extremes. These results underscore the need to quantify temperature-morbidity responses to fully understand and anticipate the health impacts of climate change and suggest that local declines in mortality due to warming can mask economically meaningful increases in temperature-driven morbidity and health care utilization.",

However, changes in neuronal activity, including the saturation of synaptic strength by the positive-feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity, could deteriorate the encoded memory. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to contribute to the stability of the encoded memory by maintaining the relative differences in synaptic strength against persistent destabilizing changes in neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear how and when these two types of plasticity work together in the context of memory. Here, we have demonstrated that LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, drives homeostatic resetting several hours after LTP by down-regulating AMPA-receptor trafficking via the Golgi apparatus. LARGE deficiency impairs long-term memory formation in mice. Our study reveals a potential molecular mechanism underlying the stability of memory mediated by cross-talk between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity.",

The magnetic hydrogels are facilely prepared by mixing neodymium-iron-boron particles with an aqueous poly(acrylic acid– co –acrylamide) solution, which spontaneously forms supramolecular network with carboxylic–ferric ion coordinates as physical cross-links. This network enables dynamic control of viscoelasticity by localized laser heating, which reduces the pinning force of gel matrix and allows for reorientation of magnetic particles under a modest magnetic field. We demonstrate that the same hydrogel sheet can be reprogrammed to exhibit various complex deformations and locomotion. This versatile approach to developing magnetic hydrogels with adaptive responses offers exciting potential for soft robotics and biomedical devices.",

One such case is Perissodus microlepis , a scale-eating cichlid fish endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species is polymorphic with left- or right-headed morphs, each specialized for scraping scales from the opposite side of their prey. This polymorphism is stably maintained around a 50:50 ratio and is likely driven by negative frequency–dependent selection, a classic form of balancing selection. Using a genome-wide dataset, including a de novo haplotype-resolved reference genome, whole-genome sequences, and microcomputed tomography scans of 102 individuals, we identified 72 genetic loci linked to head asymmetry. Nearby genes are enriched for roles in symmetry establishment, facial morphology, and nervous system function, with evidence suggesting that balancing selection maintains this diversity.

Glia-to-neuron trans-differentiation by viral vector–mediated GFAP mini-promoter–driven NeuroD1 remains hotly debated. Developing inducible, lineage-traceable transgenic mice, we find that astrocyte-to-neuron conversion is restricted to a specific time window within the lesion core of injured spinal cord and brain. Spatiotemporal lineage-mapping combined with single-cell transcriptomics reveals that ectopic NeuroD1 induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion specifically in lesion cores via transit-amplifying OLIG2 + progenitors during early injury phase, but not in late phases or in nonreactive astrocytes. Neither a loss-of-function NeuroD1 mutant nor stemness-reprogramming factor SOX2 induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion. However, contrary to previous reports, the neuronal-like cells generated by NeuroD1 lack mature neuroelectrical properties, limiting their functional integration into neural circuits. Together, our findings establish a spatiotemporal framework for NeuroD1-driven glia-to-neuron conversion, revealing a mechanistic shift from direct astrocyte conversion toward transit-amplifying intermediates and highlighting the functional immaturity of NeuroD1-converted neurons.",

What is the nature of the brain processes underlying rhythm categorization? We used electroencephalography to measure brain activity as human participants listened to a continuum of rhythmic sequences characterized by repeating patterns of two interonset intervals. Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs but, instead, produces categorical representation of rhythms. These neural rhythm categories arise automatically, independent of any motor- or timing-related tasks, yet exhibit strong similarity with categorization observed in overt behavior. Together, these results and methodological advances constitute a critical step toward understanding the biological roots and diversity of musical behaviors across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Morphogens provide developing tissues with positional information to ensure coherent morphogenesis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) initially form a gradient to pattern the dorsal domains of the Drosophila embryo. Here, we show that the BMP homolog decapentaplegic (DPP) endows dorsal domains with specific mechanical programs to organize morphogenesis. These domains self-organize using high local DPP activities, a process we call automorphy. Automorphy is key to inducing specific morphological changes while being faithful to the initial positional information. The BMP morphogen therefore uses a series of automorphic events to translate each position into physical potentials that later produce a contractile amnioserosa and a dorsal epidermis displaying plasticity. Plasticity allows cell elongation in wild-type embryos, and perturbations of cellular patterns reveal its crucial role in adapting to mechanical constraints. We propose that gradient formation and automorphy constitute complementary processes that allow BMPs to act as a morphogen in the Drosophila embryo.",

The 2D perovskite induces structural fragmentation in 3D perovskites, facilitating plastic relaxation of tensile strain. By isolating extrinsic crystalline phase interference and exciton-related optical disturbances, we observe that 3D perovskites retain high crystallinity only with moderate tensile strain relaxation. This moderate relaxation enhances optoelectronic properties in 3D perovskites, including broadened band-to-band absorption and prolonged charge carrier lifetime, markedly contributing to an increase in the maximum attainable power conversion efficiency in photovoltaic devices.

Manipulating energy flux is a formidable task because the energy at any scale is not localized in the physical space. Here, we report a theoretical framework that enables control over energy flux direction. On the basis of this framework, we conducted experiments and direct numerical simulations, producing a 2D turbulence with forward energy flux, contrary to classical expectations.

SFZE was also identified in potential brachyury enhancers in various non-chordate animals and even in Capsaspora , a unicellular relative to animals. These non-chordate SFZE-containing enhancers exhibited activity in the zebrafish notochord. Furthermore, the SFZE syntax in a non-chordate confers endoderm activity. Our results indicate the ancient association of SFZE with brachyury , likely predating the origin of animals.

We show diminished glucose leads to light hyperresponsiveness driven by deregulated ON cone bipolar signaling. Transmission of this constitutive signal to RGCs causes ON &gt; OFF signaling imbalance and failure to detect luminance and contrast changes. Our results suggest that the aspartate-malate shuttle in GABAergic amacrine cells metabolizes glucose to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which in turn regulates the ON cone bipolar signal. GABA A receptor agonists such as Ativan are a widely prescribed first-line therapy for seizures initiated by low brain GABA, and we show that Ativan restores ON cone bipolar cell regulation in RP where retinal GABA is diminished, reestablishing luminance and contrast detection.",

This narrative process is segmented into distinct units by event boundaries, which facilitate a replay process that acts to consolidate each event into a narrative memory. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may synchronize neural activity during these processes. We use intracranial recordings from participants viewing and freely recalling a continuous, audiovisual stimulus. We find that hippocampal HFOs increase following event boundaries and hippocampal-cortical coincident HFOs (co-HFOs) occur in cortical regions that underlie event segmentation (inferior parietal, precuneus, lateral occipital, and inferior frontal cortices). Event-specific co-HFO patterns that occur during event viewing reoccur following event boundaries for the subsequent three events and during recall. This is consistent with models that support replay as a mechanism for memory consolidation. Therefore, HFOs may coordinate activity across brain regions that facilitate event segmentation, encode memory of discrete events, and bind representations to assemble memory of a coherent, continuous experience.",

We have conducted a genome-wide and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–focused analysis of CD8 + TCR repertoire to identify genetic determinants of variable gene (V-gene) and CDR3 K -nucleotide oligomer usage from samples taken before and after ICB ( n  = 250). We identify 11 cis and 10 trans V-gene associations, primarily to the MHC, that meet genome-wide significance. TCR clones containing HLA associated V-genes were less stable across treatment, while, at the single-cell level, genetically associated clones demonstrate subset enrichment and increased tumor reactivity expression profiles. Notably, patients with HLA-matched TCR clones demonstrate improved overall survival. Our work indicates a complex relationship between genotype and TCR repertoire in the context of ICB treatment, with implications for understanding factors relating to therapeutic response and patient outcomes.",

However, the mechanisms underlying cellular adaptation of m 6 A modification and their impact on protein synthesis machinery remain unclear. VIRMA, the largest and evolutionarily conserved core of the m 6 A methyltransferase complex, is highly expressed in the embryonic brain and various cancers. Here, we demonstrate that VIRMA-mediated m 6 A modification is essential for active ribosome biogenesis. VIRMA depletion destabilizes the entire writer complex and reduces m 6 A levels, leading to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of neural progenitor/stem cells, ultimately causing severe forebrain developmental defects. Mechanistically, VIRMA depletion impairs ribosome biogenesis by inhibiting mRNA decay, triggering a p53-dependent stress response and compromising global protein synthesis. These findings extend to some cancer cells, suggesting a potential conservation of this mechanism. Overall, our study reveals the critical role of m 6 A in adapting protein synthesis machinery during brain development.",

Specifically, vesicles loaded with either glucose oxidase or urease and embedded with corresponding transmembrane proteins were tracked within a microfluidic device under a controlled substrate gradient. Our findings establish that a system comprising only an encapsulated enzyme and a single transmembrane pore is sufficient to initiate chemotaxis. This proof-of-concept model underscores the minimalistic yet powerful nature of cellular navigation mechanisms, providing a previously unknown perspective on the origins and evolution of chemotactic behavior in biological systems.",

We identify 347 straddling stocks across 67 species, including both highly migratory and less mobile species. Our results suggest that regardless of the climate change scenario, at least 37% and 54% of stocks are projected to shift between EEZs and the high seas, by 2030 and 2050, respectively. More stocks are expected to shift toward the high seas, and highly migratory stocks are projected to shift across Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs).

Using hyperspectral imaging, multispectral photography, microspectrophotometry, reflectance spectrophotometry, and optical modeling, we show that hidden white and black feather layers are systematically distributed on the body to enhance the brightness and saturation of carotenoid-pigmented and structurally colored plumage, respectively, by increasing or decreasing the amount of backscattered light that interacts with pigments or nanostructures. We compare male and female coloration and show that sexual dichromatism in some Tangara carotenoid plumage stems primarily from white layers in males and black layers in females rather than from differences in carotenoid pigmentation. Last, we find that white and black hidden feather layers are widespread in colorful passerines. Hidden feather layers likely play a previously overlooked but critical role in colorful plumage evolution in birds.",

Biotreatment depolymerizes the lignin and softens the cell wall. Then, Bio-Strong-Wood components are linked via a strong network of hydrogen and covalent bonds through the mechanochemical treatment. This results in a substantially enhanced mechanical strength (539 ± 21.7 megapascals), which outperforms the SAE 304 stainless steel.

This work introduces nonfused, flexible sulfur segments (SSs) into the polymer’s backbone to enhance hydrophilicity and active site access. Unlike rigid, fused sulfone moieties, our flexible SS improves interfacial water contact and charge transport. P-2SO 2 , with sulfone-functionalized SS, represents a 237% improvement over the control polymer, PBDTTSO. In addition, P-2SO 2 demonstrated an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 1060.1 micromoles per hour and an apparent quantum yield of 32.4% (460 nanometers). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate SS improves hydrophilicity and water/polymer interface while promoting a hairpin-like conformation that increases intrachain π-π stacking for better charge hopping. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows sulfone-functionalized SS enhances electron transfer to platinum cocatalysts, increases active site density, and reduces exciton migration lengths through stronger polymer/platinum interactions.",

DR5-Exo facilitated the targeted delivery of drug to tumor cells through DR5 receptor recognition and simultaneously activated apoptotic pathways. Moreover, CYP3A4-siRNA effectively prolonged the half-life of TP, thereby enhancing its antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that TP-siRC@tHyNPs induced immunogenic cell death, reprogrammed macrophage polarization, arrested cell cycle progression, and triggered apoptotic pathways. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TP-siRC@tHyNPs specifically accumulated in lung tissue, notably inhibiting the growth of PMM while exhibiting negligible toxicity in tumor-bearing mice.

In solid-state NMR (SSNMR), resolution is primarily constrained by instrumentation rather than molecular tumbling, making it well suited for studying large and complex systems. To fully leverage UHF magnets for SSNMR, it is essential to eliminate line broadening arising from magnetic field drift and couplings among the nuclear spins. We address these challenges using external 2 H lock to compensate for the field drift and long-observation-window band-selective homonuclear decoupling to suppress 13 C homonuclear couplings. We achieve better than 0.2–parts per million resolution in proteins up to 144 kilodalton, enabling unique site resolution for more than 500 amide backbone pairs in two-dimensional experiments.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising therapy for PDAC; however, its clinical efficacy is limited by a high recurrence rate. Here, using a preclinical PDAC model, we characterized the tumor immune microenvironment following insufficient IRE (iIRE) through single-cell RNA sequencing. We found that iIRE induces a CCR2 + tumor-associated macrophage (CCR2 + TAM)–mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment in residual tumors. Consequently, we developed a macrophage-based proteolipid vesicle (mPLV) coencapsulating the CCR2 antagonist PF-4136309 (PF) and gemcitabine (GEM), named PF/GEM@mPLV. Our findings suggest that PF/GEM@mPLV achieves high drug accumulation within tumors through iIRE-induced inflammation. Reduction of CCR2 + TAMs enhances antitumor immunity and improves chemotherapeutic response. PF/GEM@mPLV markedly inhibits tumor recurrence following iIRE, diminishes hepatic metastases, and prolongs survival in preclinical PDAC models.

          "authors": "Eliane Seraina Meier, Alexander Indermaur, Eva Knop",
          "abstract": "Human-induced global change may cause the sixth mass extinction of species. The moderate success of patch-scale biodiversity conservation measures has led to the concept of creating biodiversity-friendly landscapes. However, these landscapes potentially present a paradox: They may increase local biodiversity and thereby strengthen biotic resistance of native communities to global change winners, i.e., species that thrive under global change, such as invasive alien species or temperature- or nutrient-tolerant species. However, they may also improve landscape-scale habitat conditions, such as habitat connectivity, which facilitates the dispersal of global change winners, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss. Despite increasing investment in biodiversity-friendly landscapes, this paradox and underlying processes remain largely unquantified. We analyzed 2050 repeated, systematic vegetation surveys across the Swiss farmland and found the hypothesized facilitating and inhibitory effects on global change winners, but, overall, the inhibitory effects were stronger. This supports the call for a shift from patch-scale conservation to landscape-wide strategies to stop the ongoing decline of farmland biodiversity.",

The mechanisms that define protein abundance are complex and are executed on transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels.

SONAR uses thousands of sequence features (SFs) to predict up to 63% of the protein abundance independently of promoter or enhancer information. SONAR uncovered the cell type–specific and activation-dependent usage of SFs. The deep knowledge of SONAR provides a map of potentially biologically active SFs, which can be leveraged to manipulate the amplitude, timing, and cell type specificity of protein expression. SONAR informed on the design of enhancer sequences to boost T cell receptor expression and to potentiate T cell function.

The Q factor exhibits an inverse-square dependence on perturbation strength, consistent with the behavior of quasi-bound states in the continuum. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate chiral modes with high circular dichroism, large separation angles, and high- Q factors. We further couple 2D excitons to these resonant modes, achieving spatially separated chiral emission.

Upon swelling, the initially straight hydrogel cylinder undergoes a selective shape transformation into a soft, cupped pad that deforms to stretch and spread upon contact, enabling effective adhesion to target surfaces. During detachment, a vacuum is formed within the tube, leading to strong underwater adhesion. The artificial tube feet show high adhesion hysteresis, autonomous release by external stimuli, and immediate detachment by pneumatic actuation with integrated system.

The ventral pallidum (VP) is central to drug addiction, and its glutamatergic neurons (VP Glu ), whose activation drives aversion, inhibit drug seeking. However, it remains unknown whether these neurons encode the abstinence from and relapse to drugs. We show here that VP Glu projections specifically to the aversion-related lateral habenula (LHb) and ventral tegmental area gabaergic (VTA GABA ) neurons show plasticity induced by abstinence from and reexposure to cocaine or cocaine cues. Both these pathways potentiate during abstinence and restore baseline values upon drug reexposure but with different plasticity mechanisms. Last, inhibiting the VP Glu → LHb pathway enhances cocaine preference after abstinence, while inhibiting the VP Glu → VTA pathway shows variable effects. These findings establish an aversive circuit orchestrated by VP Glu neurons encoding long-term abstinence-driven changes that may contribute to drug relapse.",

This dual activation supports sustained energy metabolism during osteogenesis and challenges the canonical antagonism between mTORC1 and AMPK. We developed CitraBoneQMg, a citrate-based biomaterial incorporating these components via one-pot synthesis. CitraBoneQMg provides sustained release, photoluminescent and photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and tunable mechanical properties.

Using hybridization-proximity labeling proteomics, we show that the FUSint6&amp;7-RNA condensates are enriched for splicing factors and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader YTHDC1. These ribonucleoprotein structures facilitate posttranscriptional FUS splicing and depend on m6A/YTHDC1 for integrity. In cells expressing mutant FUS, FUSint6&amp;7-RNAs become hypermethylated, which in turn stimulates their condensation and splicing. We further show that FUS protein is repelled by m6A. Thus, ALS-FUS mutations may cause abnormal activation of FUS posttranscriptional splicing through altered RNA methylation. Notably, ectopic expression of FUS intron 7 sequences dissolves endogenous FUSint6&amp;7-RNA condensates, down-regulating FUS mRNA and protein. Our findings reveal a condensation-dependent mechanism regulating FUS splicing, with possible therapeutic implications for ALS.",

In particular, we characterize a population of neuropeptide Y (NPY)–expressing neurons surrounding LC noradrenergic cells. We show that this peri-LC NPY population exerts neuromodulatory inhibitory control over the LC via NPY-Y1R signaling. Under naïve conditions, this results in bidirectional control of anxiety-like behaviors. Stressful experiences recruit peri-LC NPY neurons, leading to local NPY release in vivo, whereas enhanced peri-LC NPY neuronal activity curbs anxiety after stress. Together, we establish a causal role for peri-LC NPY –mediated neuromodulation of the LC in the regulation of anxiety, providing mechanistic insights into the endogenous systems underlying adaptive responses to adversity.",

Here, we report an epitaxy strategy for the wafer-scale growth of high-quality single-crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) on an amorphous silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) substrate. We achieve this result through a chemical bond transition, converting multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) to molybdenum nitride (MoN), which serves as a buffer layer to engineer a preferred orientation for the epitaxy of the overlying GaN film.

We used ptychographic x-ray computed tomography under cryogenic conditions to visualize intracellular calcium-rich structures involved in the storage of calcium ions in the coccolithophore species Chrysotila carterae . During calcification, we observed a range of structures, from small electron-dense bodies within larger compartments to denser and distributed globular compartments, before returning to small bodies once scale formation is complete. Nanobeam-scanning x-ray fluorescence measurements further revealed that these electron-dense bodies are rich in phosphorus and calcium (molar ratio of ~4:1).

This biota preserves probable algal and cyanobacterial photosynthesizers together with a range of functionally sophisticated metazoan consumers: suspension-feeding crustaceans, substrate-scraping molluscs, and morphologically exotic priapulids with complex filament-bearing teeth, convergent on modern microphagous forms.

Behaviorally, manipulating VIP neuronal activity left probabilistic classical conditioning unaffected but severely impaired reversal learning. Physiologically, conditioned cue-associated VIP neuronal responses changed abruptly after encountering an unexpected reward. They also conveyed strong reward prediction error signals during behavioral reversal, but not before or after, unlike pyramidal neurons that consistently conveyed error signals throughout all phases. Furthermore, the signal’s persistence across trials correlated with reversal learning duration. These results suggest that mPFC VIP neurons play crucial roles in rapid reversal learning, but not in gradual value updating under stable probabilistic contingencies, by monitoring salient deviations from ongoing environmental contingencies and imposing error-correction signals during behavioral adjustments.

          "abstract": "Earth’s oceans contain large numbers of cyclonic eddies, 10 to 25 kilometers in diameter and unresolved in climate simulations. However, we lack observations of these features due to their small size and fast evolution. Here, we present in situ observations of one such cyclonic eddy with intense chlorophyll at its center as it spontaneously splits into two smaller cyclonic eddies over a few days. This splitting rapidly transports surface waters to depth, with sustained vertical velocities of 60 meters per day, primarily from the center of the eddy where carbon concentrations are largest, facilitating efficient transfer of phytoplankton carbon to depth, below the well-mixed, sunlit surface layer. We reproduce the splitting process in an idealized ocean model and find that splitting is controlled by the initial elliptical eddy shape, size, and intensity. Our observations uncover a mechanism for subduction in the upper ocean and highlight the need for quantifying its global prevalence.",
