          "abstract": "The doughnut-shaped framework of social and planetary boundaries (the ‘Doughnut’) provides a concise visual assessment of progress towards the goal of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet 1–3 . Here we present a renewed Doughnut framework with a revised set of 35 indicators that monitor trends in social deprivation and ecological overshoot over the 2000–2022 period. Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall. These trends and inequalities reaffirm the case for overcoming the dependence of nations on perpetual GDP growth 4,5 and reorienting towards regenerative and distributive economic activity—within and between nations—that assigns priority to human needs and planetary integrity.",

          "abstract": "The primary driver of type I diabetes is the autoimmune T cells that destroy insulin-producing β-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas1. Pancreatic islet macrophages have also been variably linked to disease onset and progression. As macrophage-mediated removal of dying cells through efferocytosis regulates tissue homeostasis and immune responses2, here we investigated how efferocytosis by intra-islet macrophages influences the immune environment of pancreatic islets. Using a series of complementary omics-based and functional approaches, we identify a subset of anti-inflammatory intra-islet efferocytic macrophages (e-Mac) within the pancreas of mice and humans. When limited β-cell apoptosis is induced in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and diabetic-prone NOD mice, islet macrophages adopt this e-Mac phenotype without an apparent increase in the total numbers of intra-islet macrophages. Such limited β-cell apoptosis and increase in e-Mac numbers led to long-term suppression of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. This e-Mac phenotype could also be recapitulated ex vivo by co-culturing macrophages with apoptotic β-cells. Mechanistically, the e-Mac-enriched populations imparted an anergic-like state on CD4+ T cells ex vivo and promoted accumulation of such anergic-like CD4+ T cells in vivo within the islets. Analysing macrophage–T cell interactions within pancreatic islets using NicheNet and targeted experimental validation, we identify the IGF-1–IGF1R axis as a contributor to the anergic-like T cell phenotype in the islets. Collectively, these data advance a concept that efferocytosis-associated reprogramming of the islet macrophages and the subsequent influence on the adaptive immune response could be beneficial in modulating diabetic autoimmunity.",

          "abstract": "Chronic infections and cancer cause T cell dysfunction known as exhaustion. This cell state is caused by persistent antigen exposure, suboptimal co-stimulation and a plethora of hostile factors that dampen protective immunity and limit the efficacy of immunotherapies1,2,3,4. The mechanisms that underlie T cell exhaustion remain poorly understood. Here we analyse the proteome of CD8+ exhausted T (Tex) cells across multiple states of exhaustion in the context of both chronic viral infections and cancer. We show that there is a non-stochastic pathway-specific discordance between mRNA and protein dynamics between T effector (Teff) and Tex cells. We identify a distinct proteotoxic stress response (PSR) in Tex cells, which we term Tex-PSR. Contrary to canonical stress responses that induce a reduction in protein synthesis5,6, Tex-PSR involves an increase in global translation activity and an upregulation of specialized chaperone proteins. Tex-PSR is further characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and stress granules and an increase in autophagy-dominant protein catabolism. We establish that disruption of proteostasis alone can convert Teff cells to Tex cells, and we link Tex-PSR mechanistically to persistent AKT signalling. Finally, disruption of Tex-PSR-associated chaperones in CD8+ T cells improves cancer immunotherapy in preclinical models. Moreover, a high Tex-PSR in T cells from patients with cancer confers poor responses to clinical immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings indicate that Tex-PSR is a hallmark and a mechanistic driver of T cell exhaustion, which raises the possibility of targeting proteostasis pathways as an approach for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Microbial and viral co-evolution has created immunity mechanisms involving oligonucleotide signalling that share mechanistic features with human antiviral systems 1 . In these pathways, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling systems (CBASSs) and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response 2–4 . Here, in an unexpected inversion of this process, we show that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that represses a toxic effector. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing the spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TMβ. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TMβ-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful defence strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of the role of oligonucleotides in immunity.",

Here we program discs to deform into stably falling parachutes as they deploy under fluid–structure interaction. Parachutes are expensive and delicate to manufacture, which limits their use for humanitarian airdrops or drone delivery. Laser cutting a closed-loop kirigami pattern18 in a disc induces porosity and flexibility into an easily fabricated parachute. By performing wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations using a custom flow-induced reconfiguration model19, we develop a design tool to realize kirigami-inspired parachutes. Guided by these results, we fabricate parachutes from the centimetre to the metre scale and test them in realistic conditions. We show that at low load-to-area ratios, kirigami-inspired parachutes exhibit a comparable terminal velocity to conventional ones. However, unlike conventional parachutes that require a gliding angle for vertical stability20 and fall at random far from a target, our kirigami-inspired parachutes always fall near the target, regardless of their initial release angle. These kinds of parachutes could limit material losses during airdropping as well as decrease manufacturing costs and complexity.",

At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits8 but can also potentially enhance9 sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor. Our approach uses time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering10 in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. We observe that optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo11,12. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opportunities for practical entanglement-enhanced quantum sensing.",

          "abstract": "Emergence of drug resistance is the main cause of therapeutic failure in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)1. To study drug resistance in patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome sequencing2 with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers, enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis. Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data3 indicated pre-existing and clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome. Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria combat phage infection using antiphage systems and many systems generate nucleotide-derived second messengers upon infection that activate effector proteins to mediate immunity 1 . Phages respond with counter-defences that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE , wherein OptS is predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide products, including 2′,3′-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-c-di-AMP), which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ‘sponge’ that antagonizes second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.",

          "abstract": "The ‘silent pandemic’ caused by antimicrobial resistance requires innovative therapeutic approaches. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the most transformative and safe drugs in oncology1 and autoimmunity2, are rarely used for infectious diseases and not yet used for antimicrobial resistance3. Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and pandrug-resistant lineage that is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the KL64 capsule and the O-antigen. However, although mAbs displayed bactericidal activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were protective against fulminant bloodstream infection by ST147 and two geographically and genetically distant carbapenem-resistant KL64-bearing K. pneumoniae. Protection observed in vivo correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study thus describes a mAb that protects against pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and provides a strategy to isolate mAbs and identify mAbs that confer protection against bacteria with antimicrobial resistance.",

          "abstract": "Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges in early childhood 1,2 , many autistic people are diagnosed later in life 3–5 . It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated ( r g = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism.",

          "abstract": "The application of biocatalysis in synthesis has the potential to offer streamlined routes towards target molecules1, tunable catalyst-controlled selectivity2, as well as processes with improved sustainability3. Despite these advantages, biocatalysis is often a high-risk strategy to implement, as identifying an enzyme capable of performing chemistry on a specific intermediate required for a synthesis can be a roadblock that requires extensive screening of enzymes and protein engineering to overcome4. Strategies for predicting which enzyme and small molecule are compatible have been hindered by the lack of well-studied biocatalytic reaction datasets5. The underexploration of connections between chemical and protein sequence space constrains navigation between these two landscapes. Here we report a two-phase effort relying on high-throughput experimentation to populate connections between productive substrate and enzyme pairs and the subsequent development of a tool, CATNIP, for predicting compatible α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)/Fe(ii)-dependent enzymes for a given substrate or, conversely, for ranking potential substrates for a given α-KG/Fe(ii)-dependent enzyme sequence. We anticipate that our approach can be readily expanded to further enzyme and transformation classes and will derisk the investigation and application of biocatalytic methods.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter their cellular composition in response to dietary cues1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The mammalian small intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ+ T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22 signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the response, and mice with CD8αβ+ T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ+ T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8+ T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.",

These squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. Here we report the experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly interacting ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (−0.50 ± 0.13 dB) below the noise of uncorrelated spins is generated by the native magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between nitrogen–vacancy centres. To generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome several challenges. First, we develop an approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.",

This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum. For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota.",

A major challenge for artificial molecular machines is to find a universal energy source akin to ATP for biological organisms and electricity for electromechanical machines. More than 20 years ago, DNA was first used as fuel to drive nanomechanical devices1,2 and catalytic reactions3. However, each system requires distinct fuel sequences, preventing DNA alone from becoming a universal energy source. Despite extensive efforts4, we still lack an ATP-like or electricity-like power supply to sustain diverse molecular machines. Here we show that heat can restore enzyme-free DNA circuits from equilibrium to out-of-equilibrium states. During heating and cooling, nucleic acids with strong secondary structures reach kinetically trapped states5,6, providing energy for subsequent computation. We demonstrate that complex logic circuits and neural networks, involving more than 200 distinct molecular species, can respond to a temperature ramp and recharge within minutes, allowing at least 16 rounds of computation with varying sequential inputs. Our strategy enables diverse systems to be powered by the same energy source without problematic waste build-up, thereby ensuring consistent performance over time.

Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism.

Here we present Breugnathair elgolensis gen. et sp. nov., based on a new skeleton from the Middle Jurassic epoch (167 million years ago) of Scotland, which is among the oldest relatively complete fossil squamates.

It displays a mosaic of anatomical traits that is not present in living groups, with head and body proportions similar to varanids (monitor lizards) and snake-like features of the teeth and jaws, alongside primitive traits shared with early-diverging groups such as gekkotans. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple datasets return conflicting results, with parviraptorids either as early toxicoferans (and potentially stem snakes) or as stem squamates that convergently evolved snake-like dental and mandibular traits related to feeding.

Neuroinflammation is apparent in affected tissues, including increased T cell infiltration and activation of microglia, particularly in the spinal cord1,2. Autoimmune responses are thought to have a key role in ALS pathology, and it is hypothesized that T cells contribute to the rapid loss of neurons during disease progression3,4. However, until now there has been no reported target for such an autoimmune response. Here we show that ALS is associated with recognition of the C9orf72 antigen, and we map the specific epitopes that are recognized. We show that these responses are mediated by CD4+ T cells that preferentially release IL-5 and IL-10, and that IL-10-mediated T cell responses are significantly greater in donors who have a longer predicted survival time. Our results reinforce the previous hypothesis that neuroinflammation has an important role in ALS disease progression, possibly because of a disrupted balance of inflammatory and counter-inflammatory T cell responses4.

The results, published in Nature Human Behaviour in April, showed that “around 45.9% of authors left their publishing careers around the time of retraction”.\n\nThe study found that early-career researchers were more likely than others to stop publishing after a retraction, as were authors whose papers were pulled for misconduct or plagiarism, and those whose retracted works attracted attention online.\n\nResearchers who continued publishing after a retraction tended to build larger networks than did those without retractions, the study found. They generally retain “less senior and less productive co-authors, but gain more impactful co-authors post-retraction”, Memon and his colleagues state. In this case, research impact was determined by how many citations the co-author attracted.\n\nFurther analysis is needed to determine why this happens, but Memon is urging publishers and institutions to not treat retracted authors as a homogeneous group, and to instead look at individual cases and give support when needed.\n\nThe retraction experience\n\nRetractions can occur for several reasons, only one of which is misconduct, such as fraud or plagiarism. Other culprits are honest mistakes or a lack of reproducibility. Another is the fact that complex research can sometimes yield unintended errors that cannot always be easily or definitively corrected. In such cases, retraction followed by rigorous revision and republication is an option, as was the case in 2019 when Nature accepted a formerly retracted paper.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\n“Context matters,” says Memon. “Institutions should carefully consider the circumstances behind each retraction.”\n\nMemon’s study was inspired by the first-hand experience of his co-authors, Bedoor AlShebli and Kinga Makovi at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, whose 2020 Nature Communications paper was retracted. AlShebli and Makovi’s study suggested that female scientists fare better when mentored by men, rather than by women.

          "abstract": "DNA can store information for millions of years without any energy input, but scientists have lacked reliable energy sources to enable DNA computations. Credit: Kateryna Kon/SPL\n\nResearchers have found a new way to power DNA computers — tiny biological devices that perform calculations using biochemical properties of DNA bases rather than conventional silicone chips, which use electricity to carry out computation.\n\nThese molecular machines could one day be used to store data, solve difficult mathematical problems and analyse biological data. But researchers have struggled to find an energy source for them that is as reliable as the ATP used in living cells or the electricity that powers everyday devices.\n\nNow, a study published in Nature on 1 October1 has demonstrated that heat could be an option. The authors created DNA circuits that they could charge and recharge by cycling the temperature of the system.\n\nThe work “suggests a future where artificial molecular machines can recharge themselves and remain active over long periods of time”, says study co-author Lulu Qian, a bioengineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “It’s like self-driving cars pulling into charging stations on their own: molecules could one day recharge themselves at heat stations.”\n\nHeat-powered DNA computing\n\nDNA computers were first described in 1994 and have been suggested as a sustainable replacement for standard electronic storage options. In the quest to find new power sources for DNA computers, researchers have explored using molecules such as the cellular energy-carrying molecule ATP, as well as methods of thermal cycling2. However, the efficiency of the systems are sensitive to molecular changes, so Qian and her colleagues set out to develop a different method that uses heat as an energy source. The authors say that their idea was inspired by proposals that early evolution could have been driven by natural occurring temperature cycles, in which hot volcanic rocks supply energy to allow chemical reactions to take place in cold seawater.\n\n“Heat is everywhere, and it’s easy to access, and with the right designs, it can recharge molecular machines again and again, letting them sustain activity and keep interacting with their environment,” says Qian.\n\nThe researchers aimed to do this by developing a molecular circuit that gets stuck in a state of thermal non-equilibrium. In such a state, the DNA molecules act as energy stores, absorbing energy created as the circuit tries to push back towards equilibrium.\n\nThe researchers did this by creating unstable links between DNA molecules. By varying the temperature of the reaction, the authors could change the energy storage inside these systems. At high temperatures, the molecules became single-stranded, but when the system cools, the circuit resets to its original state. Heating and cooling the system could switch molecular systems between equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium states within minutes, like recharging a battery.\n\n“Unlike chemical batteries, this recharge leaves behind virtually no waste[d energy],” says Qian.\n\nThe authors tested the ability of their method to power a set of computations in a DNA computer involving more than 200 different molecules and found that it was sufficient to carry out at least 16 rounds of computation.",

          "title": "How to get the best night’s sleep: what the science says",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "From TikTok videos touting mouth tape and weighted blankets, to magazines ranking insomnia-curbing pillows, sleep advice is everywhere. And it’s no wonder. People all over the world complain of insomnia and not getting enough sleep, driving a market for sleep aids worth more than US$100 billion annually.\n\nBut scientists warn that online hacks and pricey tools aren’t always effective. And failed attempts to remedy the situation could have negative effects, says Andrew McHill, a circadian scientist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “It could discourage people from finding help, and things could get worse,” he says.\n\nHow the brain wakes up from sleep — and produces that morning feeling\n\nInstead, researchers point to the lessons coming from circadian science, which over the past five decades has exposed a network of biological clocks throughout the body. This timekeeping machinery ensures that physiological systems are primed to do the right things at the right times — such as defend against pathogens, digest food and sleep. But circadian clocks don’t cycle precisely on their own. To stay in sync and function optimally, they need regular calibration from sunlight, daily routines and other cues.\n\nModern life doesn’t often cooperate. People spend much of their time indoors. They eat late into the night. They shift sleep schedules between workdays and weekends, effectively jet-lagging themselves. The toll is steep. In the short term, circadian disruption and insufficient sleep can reduce cognition, mood and reaction time. In the long term, they can increase risks of infections, diabetes, depression, dementia, cancer, heart disease and premature death.\n\nFor better sleep and overall health, McHill and other scientists emphasize three basics: contrasting light and dark, consolidating mealtimes and keeping sleep times consistent. “Simply taking a walk outside during the day and reducing our light exposure in the evening could have great effect,” says McHill.\n\nSeek contrasts\n\nLight provides the most powerful signal to the circadian system. Blue wavelengths are especially potent. That is not a coincidence. Humans evolved outdoors, under the sky. And the midday sky is rich in blue light. Still, common advice about avoiding blue light at night captures only part of the story.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, a string of discoveries proved the existence of light-sensitive cells in the eye that are not directly involved in seeing1. Rather, these cells synchronize body clocks. They detect both intensity and wavelength, with input from rods and cones, and relay those data to a circadian pacemaker in the brain.\n\nThe circadian system requires bright light to operate properly. “But we’re pretty bad at determining how much light we’re getting,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep and circadian scientist at Stanford University in California. Typical home lighting of 100–250 lux might feel like a lot to the eye. But the blue-rich daylight that the circadian system is primed to detect shines orders of magnitude brighter — upwards of 10,000 lux even on an overcast day.\n\nTiming matters, too. Bright blue light during the daytime synchronizes circadian rhythms and supports the nightly surge of melatonin — the hormone signal that tells the body it’s time to sleep. It can also directly boost alertness and cognitive performance. The same illumination at night, from artificial lights and glowing screens, confuses the circadian system.\n\nUnlocking the secrets of sleep\n\nBlue light is the strongest disruptor, but enough photons of any colour at night can shift rhythms, suppress melatonin levels and hinder sleep. Exposure in the middle of the night, such as with a flip of a toilet light switch, is most disruptive, says Zeitzer. The circadian system’s sensitivity peaks near the midpoint of sleep, when it least expects light. Studies show that even dim light, such as a hallway bulb, can raise overnight heart rate and impair sleep2.\n\nUltimately, scientists say, what matters most is contrast: bright days and dark nights. In fact, light during the day can buffer against the potential harms of light at night, says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Mounting research links greater daytime light exposure with stronger circadian rhythms and higher sleep quality. One study of college students found that their total hours of light exposure during the day better predicted their bedtimes and wake times than did light exposure after dusk3. “The more light you get during the day, the better you’ll sleep at night,” says Figueiro.\n\nToo little daylight and too much night light could even shorten life expectancy. A UK study of nearly 90,000 people found that the 20% with the poorest light-exposure patterns were predicted to die around five years earlier than were the 20% with the healthiest habits, even after accounting for factors such as income and physical activity4.\n\nAndrew Phillips, a sleep health scientist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and an author of the study, pins the explanation on circadian rhythms: “They regulate every aspect of your physiology.”\n\nUnfortunately, achieving this daily contrast is difficult in the modern world. Indoor lighting leans on green wavelengths that serve vision but not circadian signalling. Energy-usage codes limit how bright those fixtures shine. Daylight entering through windows gets quickly diluted. And energy-efficient window glass and blue-light-blocking spectacle-lens coatings further reduce how many circadian-stimulating photons reach the eyes. Ageing compounds the problem; people’s lenses become more yellow over time and filter out more blue light.\n\nCircadian science’s prescription: spend more time outdoors, sit near windows and use daylight-mimicking light-emitting-diode lamps during the day. In the evening, lower the brightness of lamps and power down screens — or use apps that dim or shift screens to a warmer spectrum. And consider a low-intensity amber night light for the toilet.\n\nScientists note that the precise prescription is personal. Even people of the same age can vary considerably in how they respond to the same light, possibly because of characteristics such as sex or eye colour. And when light comes from screens, the content can matter as much as the light itself. “If you’re on an iPad at 11 at night, then the light exposure might have some effect,” says Zeitzer. “But if you are doing something relaxing, that might outweigh the effect.”\n\nConsolidate calories\n\nCalorie intake is also intricately linked with circadian rhythms and sleep. The human liver at 10 a.m. and the human liver at 10 p.m. are very different organs. The same can be said for other parts of the body that process food. Hunger hormones, digestive enzymes and glucose-regulating insulin have rhythms, too.\n\nHumans are simply not equipped to deal with food at all hours, says Emily Manoogian, a circadian scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California. Late morning to early afternoon is when the body is usually most prepared for incoming calories. Eating late in the evening disrupts clocks and leaves key steps of digestion incomplete. It can also disrupt the gut microbiome, which could contribute to insomnia5. What’s more, late meals send blood to the gut and raise core body temperature, countering the natural night-time dip that promotes sleep. And they elevate glucose levels and uncouple liver and kidney clocks from the core clock in the brain, raising the chance of midnight toilet trips.\n\nManoogian and others suggest reviving the old adage: eat like a king in the morning, a prince at noon and a peasant at dinner. That last meal, they say, should fall at least three hours before bedtime, ideally with no subsequent snacks or caloric drinks.\n\nRevealed: how the brain turns stress into a bad night’s sleep\n\nFood quality matters, too. Diets high in sugar and saturated fat lighten and fragment sleep. Caffeine lingers for hours. And alcohol is deceptively disruptive: “You might fall asleep, but the quality of your sleep will be quite poor,” says Manoogian. On the flip side, eating some plant-based foods during the day could improve sleep. Research shows that walnuts boost melatonin levels and sleep quality6.

          "abstract": "Nature’s 2025 PhD survey\n\nThis article is the first in a series discussing the results of Nature’s 2025 PhD survey. The next will look at what doctoral candidates wish they’d known when they set out on their degrees. The survey, created in partnership with Thinks Insight & Strategy, a research consultancy based in London, launched in May and was advertised on nature.com, in Springer Nature digital products and through e-mail campaigns. It had 3,785 self-selecting respondents across 107 countries, with 44% describing themselves as female, 25% as belonging to an ethnic minority in their country of study and 33% as studying outside their country of origin. The full survey data sets are available at go.nature.com/4ncsuo1.\n\nIn May and June, Nature surveyed 3,785 PhD candidates from around the globe, exploring everything from supervision practices to workplace concerns. The results, published today, offer a window into how today’s doctoral researchers are adapting to the rapidly changing circumstances in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It’s a mixed bag: candidates report feeling happier overall, but serious problems persist.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nThe good news? PhD satisfaction levels have bounced back from their pandemic lows (Nature’s most-recent global PhD careers survey took place in 2022). The sobering reality? Nearly half of respondents worldwide say that they still face discrimination or harassment, and many report seeing their supervisors for less than an hour each week. Beyond these challenges, doctoral candidates consistently cite poor compensation and inadequate career guidance as major sources of dissatisfaction.\n\nAs new technologies transform how doctoral students work, one thing hasn’t changed: academia continues to hold the crown as their preferred career destination.\n\nHere’s what the data reveal about the state of the doctorate in 2025.\n\nPost-COVID recovery\n\nSome 75% of the PhD candidates surveyed feel satisfied with their doctoral studies. This is a bounce back from 62% in 2022, and a rebound to pre-COVID levels: satisfaction levels were 71% in Nature’s 2019 survey and 78% in 2017.\n\nThe dip in satisfaction during the pandemic makes sense to Pil Maria Saugmann, outgoing president of Eurodoc, an organization based in Brussels that represents early-career researchers in Europe. “I had a year when all my supervision was online, all interactions with my group were online,” says the Danish researcher, who finished her theoretical-physics PhD at Stockholm University in 2022. “I’m not surprised that the numbers have gone up, because it reflects that we are in a more normal state where there is a collegial environment.”\n\nSome 78% of doctoral candidates in the survey feel most satisfied with the independence and flexibility that their PhD gives them (see ‘How PhD students rate their experiences’). “No other job has the independence, constant challenges, flexibility and stimulating environment that a PhD offers,” says Miguel González Martín, a mechanobiology PhD candidate at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. He says that his PhD allows him to keep learning new things at a high pace, and he feels privileged that his job gives him the opportunity to help solve global problems.\n\nRoughly 73% of respondents are satisfied with their relationship with their supervisor and 66% report satisfaction with the guidance they receive about their research. “My supervisor gives me the freedom to explore my research ideas while providing constructive feedback whenever I need it. This balance helps me grow as an independent researcher,” says a fourth-year PhD student in Iran who took the survey.\n\nFewer respondents are satisfied with their compensation and benefits: only 47%. Women are more dissatisfied with their PhDs than men are — 19% feel moderately, very or extremely dissatisfied, compared with 15% of men. Those who identify as members of ethnic minority groups show a similar trend (20%, compared with 17%). Saugmann says that there are certain survey findings that point to other areas of dissatisfaction, too, such as high levels of harassment and discrimination, which are higher than in some other employment sectors, she says.\n\nHow many PhDs does the world need? Doctoral graduates vastly outnumber jobs in academia\n\nSpending long hours on a PhD — 60 or more a week — also significantly correlates with lower satisfaction. This probably contributes to only 60% of PhD students in China reporting being satisfied, says Yanbo Wang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. PhD researchers there often work seven days a week, he says. And because many enrol for PhDs not because they want to do research, but to gain an advantage in China’s cut-throat labour market, they might lack the passion to makes all that hard work feel worthwhile. Wang says. “That mismatch is a huge part of the problem.”\n\nAbout 55% of respondents say that their PhD experience matches what they expected, whereas 34% feel their expectations aren’t being met. That dissatisfaction rises to 39% in India, where Shubha Tole, dean of graduate studies at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, says that a boom in the number of undergraduate students has increased competition for summer research placements and internships. As a result, most incoming graduate students lack such experiences and know little about how to conduct research and the research culture, she says.\n\nMo money, mo politics\n\nWhen asked about broad concerns, the two most common were financial pressures (42% chose this option) and the need to get published (41%; see ‘Major concerns of PhD candidates’). “I wish we got paid a living wage. It’s hard to focus on research when I’m worried about my next meal,” said a female second-year PhD candidate in the United States.\n\nMental health is a concern for 31% of the global sample, and 25% worry about balancing their studies with family and caring responsibilities.\n\nAsked about specific concerns, rising living costs worry 86% of the respondents, up from 85% in 2022, and 55% agree that increases in inflation will negatively affect their decisions to continue their studies. These financial concerns are “alarming”, says Mohammed Shaaban, a recent PhD graduate from the Francis Crick Institute and Imperial College London. “If this continues, we will see more students either quitting their programmes early or opting out of academic careers.”\n\nThese nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties\n\nThe political landscape is a key concern for just 21% of respondents. However, this jumps to 64% in respondents in the United States — their biggest concern by far. Teddy Warner, president of the graduate-student council at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, traces this to upheavals in the US science system under US President Donald Trump’s administration since January. “I’ve seen how things were before and after Trump’s inauguration, and mostly this year’s been much more chaotic and uncertain,” Warner says.\n\nFunding cuts have been a major source of anxiety for US graduate students, especially those early in their programmes, who worry that they might not be able to start. Crackdowns on immigration have also taken a toll, Warner says, and “there is an overall atmosphere of fear”, with some international students avoiding international travel, afraid that they might be stopped at the border.\n\nThe political turmoil in the United States spills beyond PhD candidates there, says Wang. “Given what’s going on, more and more Chinese researchers are coming back to China,” cranking up competition for post-PhD positions at home, he says.\n\nAI’s (wary) adopters\n\nThis year’s survey is the first to ask PhD candidates about their views on and use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Some 53% say that they use AI tools at least weekly, in service of their PhD studies, whereas merely 16% have never used them (see ‘AI use by PhD students differs’). Roughly 75% they think that AI can help them work more efficiently and 71% think that it is acceptable for them to use AI as part of their PhDs.\n\nMost PhD candidates feel comfortable with using AI for tasks such as preparing job applications or summarizing or tracking the scientific literature. They feel less comfortable using AI for near-research tasks such as collecting and analysing data, designing experiments, writing articles and peer reviewing. Some 81% ‘don’t fully trust’ AI. Meanwhile, 82% are concerned about the quality and integrity of AI outputs, and 65% worry that AI weakens their critical thinking and research and writing skills; 64% are concerned about the reproducibility of AI outputs.\n\nThe total sample is split on whether AI will replace core skills (43% agree and 40% disagree) and roles (42% agree and 39% disagree). Survey-takers warn about the dangers of AI dependency. “You become too overly reliant on AI tools and it ends up affecting critical thinking and self-confidence,” writes a male PhD candidate studying in India. A fourth-year female student, also in India, writes that she feels ChatGPT “spoiled the thinking power of my brain”.\n\nSome 64% say they want more guidance from their institutions about how best to use AI in their work. Shaaban, who was encouraged to use AI responsibly during his PhD in London, agrees: “This is a revolution. We need to put a lot of effort into training people how to use it responsibly, not just leave it up to trial and error.”\n\nHarassment and prejudice abound\n\nA notable 43% of respondents say that they have experienced discrimination or harassment as part of their studies, with the most common types being bullying and sexism (see ‘Problematic behaviours plague many PhD students’). This is an increase from the 20% in Nature’s 2022 PhD survey, although there, a separate question dealt with bullying, which 18% said they had experienced. This year’s survey gave respondents more-specific types of discrimination and harassment to choose from, including those based on religion, sexual orientation and disability, which makes comparisons with previous surveys difficult. In any case, with more than two in five PhD candidates in 2025 reporting experiencing discrimination and harassment, problematic workplace cultures persist, with direct effects on well-being.\n\n“If you ask whether there is a mental-health crisis in doctoral training, the answer is yes,” says Saugmann. She says that Nature’s findings echo those of other surveys looking at mental health in European universities.\n\nThese harassment experiences shoot up to 47% in international students and 55% among those who identify as belonging to ethnic minorities. “It’s deeply concerning that half of the international students experience discrimination,” says Shaaban, who experienced discrimination related to his Egyptian nationality, both in the United States, where he studied from 2018 to 2020, and during his PhD in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, this came mainly from broader society and not his workplace, he says. Nevertheless, he says, “it makes you feel unappreciated, like you don’t belong”.",

The ‘Central Nourishment Furnace’ (stove) emits comforting smells of nutrient orbs (potatoes). The dwelling is orderly. The ‘Domestic Harmony Aura’ is at its peak. Surely, nothing bad will happen.\n\nTULAR (The Reliable Earth Husband-Type Figure) is stirring a food substance while RIEEN (The Devoted Earth Spouse Companion) sets out Eating Instruments (as humans insist on using, for reasons unknown). Their movements are synchronized, rhythmic and harmonious, as per Earth Custom.\n\nAcross from them, VEYL (The Charming Yet Suspicious Guest Friend) lounges idly, fulfilling his role as ‘The Witty Freeloader’, as all Earth homes are required to contain.\n\nVEYL (with exaggerated Earth-style overconfidence): “You two are spoiling me again! This meal smells amazing. I hardly do anything around here, and yet I get treated like an Earth Monarch!”\n\n(Zeckan scholars have noted that all human conversations must contain at least one instance of the phrase “This smells amazing”.)\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nTULAR (laughs in the hearty, abrupt way all Earth Males do): “Hardly do anything?! You provide entertainment! That counts for something.”\n\n(Note: As per the sacred teachings of I Love Lucy, all Earth domestic units contain one designated humorous character whose job is to create mild chaos and serve no practical function.)\n\nVEYL (laughing too long, as is Earth custom): “Ah-ha-ha-ha! Oh, I must accept my role with grace! I am the reason you two are not boring and stale, like the Classic American Marrieds of old!”\n\n(Zeckan research indicates that ‘boring’ is the ultimate insult among humans, second only to ‘unfashionable’.)\n\nRIEEN (softly, dramatically): “And I wouldn’t have you any other way.”\n\n[BRIEF PAUSE FOR EARTH AUDIENCE TO SWOON]\n\n(Zeckan research indicates that human ‘eating’ is not merely a biological function but a sacred ritual of dominance and submission. The individual who prepares the food exerts temporary control over the others, a power dynamic often disrupted by ‘witty freeloader’ figures such as VEYL. This ongoing battle for social equilibrium seems to be the foundation of all Earthly relationships.)\n\nEverything is perfect. The home aura swells with warmth. Surely, nothing can go wrong.\n\nBUT THEN —\n\nA SMALL CLICK. A FLICKER. A HUM OF FAILING MECHANICS.\n\n(Research suggests that all Earth tragedies begin with a small but ominous sound. See: every show from the 1980s.)\n\nSuddenly —\n\nVEYL IS NO LONGER EARTHLY.\n\nHis form contorts grotesquely, just as human ‘monsters’ always must (see: The Twilight Zone and all werewolf episodes of the 1990s).\n\nHis face is now a horrible, writhing mass of wet, sensory tendrils. His limbs bend at unnatural angles.\n\n[DRAMATIC ZOOM-IN, BLACK-AND-WHITE FOR EMPHASIS]\n\nRIEEN (as human spouses do in all betrayal scenes): “NOOOOOOOOOOO!”\n\nShe drops a bowl of nutrient orbs.\n\nIt shatters in slow motion.\n\n(Zeckan scholars remain perplexed by the human insistence that moments of heightened emotional significance must unfold at a reduced temporal rate. Attempts to replicate this phenomenon in real-time studies have resulted in multiple injuries and one unfortunate combustion incident.)\n\nTULAR (defensive Earth Husband Instincts activated): “What in the cursed void are you?!”\n\n(It remains unclear why humans ask rhetorical questions they do not wish to hear the answers to. Zeckan scientists have tested multiple responses to such inquiries — including detailed explanations, humorous quips and immediate self-destruction — and have determined that all answers are considered unsatisfactory.)\n\nVEYL, despite his grotesque, pulsating form, remains surprisingly casual — as all Earth Betrayers must. He lets out a long sigh, placing his mismatched horror-limbs on his strange, alien hips.)\n\nVEYL (exasperated, yet somehow still likeable): “Well, shit.”\n\n[CANNED LAUGHTER — BECAUSE HUMAN AUDIENCES REQUIRE IT]\n\nTHE ARGUMENT UNFOLDS: Extended drama\n\n(Zeckan scholars have determined that Earth arguments must escalate in a structured format: Shock → Denial → Betrayal → Emotional Outburst → Sudden Violence.)\n\nTULAR surges forward, shielding RIEEN. His Earth Warrior Instincts engage.\n\nTULAR (furious): “Stay back, you monstrosity! You have deceived us!”\n\nVEYL (smoothing his pulsating skin): “Minor technical malfunction. Give me a second —”\n\nHe fumbles with his wrist device. Instantly, his perfect human form snaps back into place.\n\nVEYL (charming again): “See? No problem. Still me.”\n\nRIEEN (trembling): “You are not our Veyl.”\n\nVEYL: “Oh, Rieen, darling, let’s not be dramatic. Nothing has changed.”\n\nTULAR advances menacingly. He is about to deliver a monologue.\n\nTULAR (booming): “You stole our lives! You robbed Rieen of her last season to breed! You took everything!”\n\nVEYL (momentarily annoyed, then recovers): “You’re being overly emotional. I gave you love, joy —”\n\nRIEEN: “You gave us lies.”\n\nThe intensity heightens. The argument spirals into pure Earthly chaos. Gestures become exaggerated. Plates are thrown.",

          "authors": "Anna McKie",
          "abstract": "Epidemiologist Lauren McCullough is leading the VOICES of Black Women study.Credit: Courtesy of Lauren McCullough\nBroadening the long view\n\nLongitudinal studies — which follow individuals to collect data about health, lifestyle and environment over a period of months, years or even decades — have helped researchers understand disease risk, inform prevention strategies and improve public health planning. But the majority of large-scale longitudinal research has historically taken place in Europe or North America, meaning many populations remain under-represented in the data.\n\nA new generation of longitudinal studies is aiming to better reflect population diversity — not just by recruiting from underserved groups, but by embedding community involvement, local scientific leadership and context-specific questions into their design. This article is one of a series of three profiles about studies taking this approach.\n\nWhen epidemiologist Lauren McCullough began working in cancer research in the United States, she was struck by a glaring omission in population-level studies. “When thinking about large-scale cancer studies, one of the groups that have been left behind have been Black women,” she says. “That’s despite the fact that Black women are more likely to get an aggressive disease and, with very few exceptions, are more likely to die of their cancer.”\n\nNow, McCullough, visiting scientific director at the American Cancer Society (ACS), is leading a research effort to help change that. The VOICES of Black Women study aims to enrol 100,000 Black women aged 25–55 with no prior history of cancer. The longitudinal study, which launched in 2024, will follow participants for at least 30 years, capturing a range of data on health, lifestyle and lived experience to reach a depth and scale not seen before for this population, say those involved.\n\nFor McCullough and Alpa Patel, co-investigator on the study and senior vice-president of population science at the ACS, researchers on the team had to be more than just experts. They wanted people who “really had the passion for the topic and were committed to ensuring the study was going to be designed and executed in a way that we all felt really proud of”, McCullough says.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\nThe VOICES team hope the data will begin to clarify what is behind disparities in cancer risk for Black women in the United States. They are around 40% more likely to die from breast cancer than white women, for example, despite having lower incidence rates. According to the ACS, Black women have a 12% higher overall cancer death rate than white women.\n\nInitially spanning the 20 US states with the largest populations of Black women, the study now recruits nationwide, working in partnership with a network of hospitals, community organizations and health centres.\n\nThe VOICES team wants to look beyond the biological data typical of a standard longitudinal study — such as genetics, diet or medical history — to capture some of the potential social drivers of health. “Something that was really missing when I emerged from my training was understanding how the social aspects impact cancer,” McCullough says. “How do social elements above the skin impact the biology below the skin?” To that end, the study asks participants about factors such as their experiences of racism, access to quality health care and what social support they receive.\n\nThis information is collected through a 60-minute baseline survey and shorter follow-ups, in which participants are asked about day-to-day discrimination and economic stressors. “A lot of the existing data are at the area level, like residential racial segregation, but that doesn’t really capture the specific insults an individual might experience,” McCullough says. By capturing individual experiences, the team hopes to uncover how these cumulative exposures interact with biological processes to influence cancer risk.\n\nThis is important, McCullough says, because “the data among Black women doesn’t match our ideas about how socioeconomics should lead to better health outcomes. In fact, some of the greatest health disparities are among Black women with higher levels of socioeconomic status.” Recent studies have shown that racism-related stress contributes to persistent health gaps between Black and white women by disrupting cortisol patterns, as demonstrated in a 2024 study1 published in Scientific Reports, and by activating cellular stress-response pathways linked to aggressive breast cancer, according to research from the Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, North Carolina2. The VOICES study also includes biological sampling. Participants can voluntarily provide blood samples and undergo height, weight, waist and blood-pressure measurements. These will help researchers investigate the role of ancestry, hormones, inflammation, infections and genetic mutations in cancer development.\n\n“In five years or so, I think we will better understand the various exposures that might differentially impact Black women,” says McCullough. For example, it could lead to better regulation of products frequently used by Black women, such as chemical hair relaxers, which were linked to an increased risk of uterine cancer by a 2023 study3.\n\nKey facts: VOICES of Black Women\n\nStudy name: VOICES of Black Women.\n\nLead institution: American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPrincipal investigators: Lauren McCullough, visiting scientific director at the ACS, and Alpa Patel, senior vice-president of population science at the ACS.\n\nParticipant goal: 100,000 Black women aged 25–55, cancer-free at enrolment.\n\nCurrent participant numbers: 4,850\n\nData collected: Online surveys (60 minutes at baseline, two 30-minute follow-ups per year) covering health behaviours, discrimination, social support, economic stress and personal care product use; optional blood samples; anthropometric and biometric data (such as height, weight, blood pressure).\n\nLaunch year: Pilot 2023, official launch 2024.\n\nDuration: At least 30 years.\n\nFunding: Solely funded by the American Cancer Society.\n\nEnrolled participants, who so far number almost 4,000, will receive regular follow-ups — two 30-minute surveys per year — with the hope this will build trust. McCullough says early feedback suggests participants feel their experiences are well represented.\n\n“It takes a different level of comfort and trust to join a study. So, I am always grateful for every single person that joins,” she says.",

          "abstract": "A brain scan of a person with Huntington’s disease, which causes a loss of brain volume as neurons are killed off by the accumulation of a mutant protein.Credit: Zephyr/SPL\n\nA one-time gene therapy can markedly slow the progression of Huntington’s disease, potentially paving the way for the first ever treatment to alter the course of this rare, inherited brain disorder.\n\nIn a small trial of 29 people who were in the early stages of Huntington’s-related decline, participants who received a high dose of the therapy directly into their brains saw the disease slow by 75% over three years, compared with those in a control group.\n\nGenetic therapies offer new hope against incurable brain diseases\n\nThe benefit was statistically significant across several clinical measures, according to data released this week by uniQure, a gene-therapy company based in Amsterdam. Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.\n\n“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”\n\nSlowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”\n\nA deadly repeat\n\nPeople living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year on year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.\n\nThe disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.\n\nSome of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on antisense therapy, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development1. But hopes dimmed in 2021 after a leading candidate failed in late-stage testing, with those receiving the therapy seeming to fare worse than those who were given a placebo2.\n\nThis clinical setback redirected attention towards a different strategy: gene therapy, which aims to provide a one-time intervention that permanently silences or modifies the deficient gene at its source.\n\nMolecular muzzle\n\nIn the case of uniQure’s gene therapy, the treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver the recipe for making a short RNA sequence known as a microRNA directly into cells in the affected parts of the brain. The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a Nobel prize last year, although the technology has yet to yield any approved medicines.\n\nAdministering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.",

          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health fell as much as US$5 billion behind in its awarding of grants this past year, but has managed to catch up.Credit: Francis Chung/POLITICO/AP/Alamy\n\nStaff members at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) seem to have done the impossible. Despite US President Donald Trump’s administration laying off thousands of the agency’s workers, delaying meetings to review research grants and terminating funding for some projects, the NIH seems like it will dole out its entire US$48-billion budget on deadline — by the end of the fiscal year on 30 September.\n\nAt some points in the past year, the agency — the world’s largest funder of biomedical research — was nearly $5 billion behind in its awarding of grants. Researchers feared that the NIH would have to return any money it didn’t spend to the US Treasury rather than investing it in science. But staff banded together to put things on track in the past few months (see ‘Playing catch-up’).\n\n“Everyone has been rallying together to clean up the mess, but it’s a mess that did not need to be made,” says an NIH programme officer who spoke to Nature on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\n\nSource: NIH Reporter; adapted from: Jeremy Berg\n\nAlthough the agency’s budget will be spent, many fewer new projects will be funded. That’s because the White House budget office directed the NIH to award some research projects large sums upfront — rather than spreading it out over years — meaning that fewer institutions and researchers will receive agency funding. Success rates for grant applications at the NIH have therefore hit all-time lows.\n\n“That is extremely demoralizing,” says Michael Lauer, who for about ten years ran the NIH’s ‘extramural’ arm, which funds researchers at institutions across the United States. “We want people to be excited about being in science. And if the likelihood of success is so low, you might have to close your lab. This will do even more to chase people away from doing science in the US.”\n\nThe NIH did not respond to Nature’s queries about the funding situation or scientists’ concerns about low success rates.\n\nAn ‘unbelievable’ year\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has directed the NIH to suspend sessions to review grant applications, lay off about 6% of its 20,000-person workforce, terminate projects on a slew of topics such as COVID-19 that do not align with the president’s priorities and freeze and unfreeze its funding programmes several times. Furthermore, representatives of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency demanded that they review grants approved by NIH employees before any payments were made, Nature reported.\n\nExclusive: NIH to dismiss dozens of grant reviewers to align with Trump priorities\n\n“This year was really unbelievable,” says an NIH grants-management specialist, who has been at the agency for a decade and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “I have never experienced anything like this.”\n\nThe administration’s spending slow-down at the NIH earned a reprimand in early August from a watchdog agency in the US government. The watchdog found that the NIH had been illegally withholding, or impounding, funds that the US Congress allocated to it.\n\nTo pick up the grant-processing pace, some employees have cancelled holiday plans, worked overtime and filled in for staff missing across the NIH, the programme officer says. “Our work is already end-loaded towards the end of the fiscal year,” she says. But this year, “it’s like a pressure cooker that exploded”. But, she adds, “there was a willingness to work extra hard to move the science forward”.\n\nCollateral damage",

          "abstract": "There are limited options for pain relief during pregnancy.Credit: The Good Brigade/Getty\n\nResearchers are concerned about what will happen should pregnant women follow US President Donald Trump's advice to avoid the painkiller Tylenol — also called paracetamol and acetaminophen. In an address at the White House on 22 September, Trump claimed the medication is linked to autism and other long-term neurodevelopmental conditions in the developing child. But experts warn that avoiding the drug when it is needed could place women and their fetus at even greater risk.\n\nParacetamol is one of the most widely used drugs during pregnancy and is generally considered safe. It is commonly used to relieve pain and reduce fevers, including those caused by viral infections such as the common cold and bacterial infections that cause urinary-tract or kidney conditions.\n\nOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that acetaminophen products would have a new warning label that lists a possible association between taking the drug and an increased chance of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism in children. FDA commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement that the change “may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy”. Trump was more direct: “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.\n\nThe advice has been rejected by physicians, medical organizations and health regulators in many countries, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the UK Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. The World Health Organization said in a statement that there is no “conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link”. The drivers of ADHD and autism are complex and genetics plays a large part.\n\nUntreated fever\n\nBut there is evidence that leaving a fever untreated, particularly if it is high (above 39.1 °C) or lasts longer than 24 hours, raises the risk of negative outcomes during pregnancy, says Debra Kennedy, a women’s health researcher at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia. “It’s been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and some birth defects,” she adds, including spinal and heart defects and abnormal facial features. Women should not have to be in discomfort from pain or a fever unnecessarily when there is no convincing evidence that taking paracetamol will cause harm to their child.\n\nThere is some evidence that untreated high temperatures during pregnancy might increase the chance of autism and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, because they can interfere with fetal brain development1. Kennedy warns that raising fear around paracetamol use could also lead women to use pain relief that is not as safe. \"I definitely think there will be some women who will be reluctant to take paracetamol during pregnancy because of these statements,\" she says, adding that other doctors have begun asking her for resources to provide to women expressing concerns about taking paracetamol during pregnancy.\n\nLimited options",

For example, origami, the Japanese art of folding paper, has enabled deployable structures, including shelters and aerospace applications1.

By cutting patterned slits in a flat disc, the authors designed parachutes that open during flight, generating drag and slowing their descent.

Yet, their closing pledges — increased collaboration and innovation — felt familiar and incremental for a crisis that many people see as systemic.\n\nAre ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says\n\nStuart Gillespie’s book Food Fight offers a sharp diagnosis: a global system once designed to stave off famine through cheap, calorie-dense foods now fuels obesity, disease, environmental harm and inequality. Drawing on four decades of experience in global nutrition and policy, Gillespie argues that tinkering won’t do. Fixing the system will take nothing less than a revolution.\n\nThe statistics that Gillespie presents in this eye-opening book are shocking: poor diet now accounts for one-quarter of all adult deaths worldwide (more than 12 million a year); malnutrition in all its forms affects one in three people; and ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which are highly profitable to corporations, are linked to as many as one in seven premature deaths in some countries. Moreover, food production generates roughly one-quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nGillespie attributes many of these issues to corporate greed, weak regulation by governments and complicit international organizations. The result is a system that prioritizes profit, with people and the planet paying the price.\n\nUltra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition\n\nThe book traces the shaping of modern food systems to colonialism. Agriculture during colonial times was extractive, and geared towards the production of profitable items, including sugar, tea, coffee and cocoa, rather than nourishing local populations. Gillespie argues that this logic of plunder persists in today’s corporate-dominated system, in which a handful of transnational firms — ‘Big Food’, ‘Big Sugar’ and ‘Big Choc’ — control nearly every stage of food production, distribution and consumption. Their pursuit of profit drives the manufacture of ultra-processed products that are designed to be addictive and have a long shelf life and strong appeal, while simultaneously shifting social and environmental costs to the public.\n\nOne of the most damning sections of Food Fight deals with the health impacts of this corporate control. Gillespie emphasizes that malnutrition is no longer just about hunger — it’s about the poor quality of diets. The number of people with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and diet-related cancers is soaring worldwide. At the same time, undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies persist — the ‘double burden’ of malnutrition.\n\nA heavy toll",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "Credit: AFP via Getty\n\nChina has revealed its goal for slashing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, providing a glimpse into how global emissions might change over the next decade. In a video address to the United Nations Climate Summit on 24 September, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced that China will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035.\n\nThe pace at which China cuts emissions will have a profound global impact. The country has accounted for 90% of the growth in the world’s CO₂ emissions since 2015 and it is now the largest GHG emitter in the world, responsible for around one-third of the global total, according to the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think tank based in New York City. Analysts have warned that China’s action could make or break the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nIn 2020, Xi pledged that China’s CO₂ emissions would peak before 2030 and that the country would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Some researchers say China’s CO₂ emissions will probably peak soon if they haven’t already.\n\nThe latest targets are part of China’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), a climate-action plan that all countries subject to the Paris agreement must submit to the UN every five years. China also set clean-energy targets for 2035.\n\nThe importance of China’s latest NDC is that its targets cover the years until 2035, past the country’s proposed peak, says Yao Zhe, a Beijing-based researcher of China’s climate policy at Greenpeace East Asia. “This is the first time China has officially outlined its post-peaking plan,” Yao says.\n\nOnce China’s emissions drop, global emissions will probably start to drop, says Belinda Schäpe, a China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Helsinki-based think tank. “That’s why these targets are so important for the global community, because they can help them understand” how the world’s emissions trajectory could look, she says.\n\nThis is also the first time that China has announced a target that covers not only carbon dioxide (CO₂) but all GHGs including methane and nitrous oxide, says Zhang Da, who researches energy economics and climate change at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nAmbitious or not?\n\nSome researchers think that China’s emissions-reduction target falls short of what the world needs to achieve the Paris agreement’s aim, of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and striving to stay below 1.5 °C.\n\n“Anything less than 20% is definitely not aligned with 2 degrees. Similarly, anything less than 30% is definitely not aligned with 1.5 degrees,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst who has tracked China’s emissions trends for more than a decade and is CREA’s co-founder. Myllyvirta cites his analysis of a set of future climate scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to help the world adhere to the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe way China has defined its emissions cuts — as 7–10% of an undefined amount, rather than specifying a year as the basis for calculation – leaves the door open for short-term emissions increases, Myllyvirta says.\n\nThe different pathways for China to achieve carbon neutrality between 2030 and 2060 could result in different amounts of cumulative emissions, says Myllyvirta. “What matters for the climate is the total amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere over time,” he says, adding that this is why cutting emissions fast early on is important.\n\nBut others, such as Da, regard China’s target as an important step. “Reducing non-CO₂ emissions is typically more challenging than mitigating CO₂,” says Da. “A 7–10% reduction in net GHG emissions from peak levels usually implies a higher level of CO₂ reduction.”\n\nA study by Da and colleagues1, published in January, found that if China reduces its energy-related CO₂ emissions by 10–12% from peak levels by 2035, the country would meet its goal of being carbon neutral before 2060. A separate study2, also co-authored by Da, found the two-degree temperature goal is achievable under China’s carbon-neutral timeline.",

It’s easy to track which papers result from a grant, but much harder to follow how research has broader societal impacts on policies, medicines or products.\n\n“Those are much more exciting [impacts], and provide greater public good,” says Dashun Wang, director of the Center for Science of Science and Innovation at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nWang and his colleagues built a tool called Funding the Frontier, which integrates data on research publications, patents, policy papers and clinical trials, and presents the information in a visually intuitive way. They also combined the tool with a machine-learning-driven predictive algorithm to forecast which studies and fields are likely to lead to the most societal benefits in the future — for example, which grants are most likely to result in a patent. They described the prototype in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server1.\n\nFunding the Frontier includes a mind-boggling amount of data, drawn from four large data sets: the Dimensions, Altmetric and Overton databases, as well as the authors’ own SciSciNet data set. The total collection links 7 million research grants to 140 million scientific publications, 160 million patents, 10.9 million policy documents, 800,000 clinical trials and 5.8 million newsfeeds, all published between 2000 and 2021, with 1.8 billion citation linkages among them. The data can be displayed in several ways, showing the impacts that flowed from a particular study and tracing outcomes back to their sources and all the links between them.\n\nStaša Milojević, who studies the science of science at Indiana University in Bloomington and was not involved in developing the tool, says that it could help to fill an important gap when it comes to translating studies of how science works into useful data. “Many studies in the area of ‘science of science’ have potential science-policy and funding implications,” she says. “However, their practical impact is often limited because they lack the tools that stakeholders can easily use to obtain useful insights.”\n\nThe size of the database, and its ability to link disparate strands together, is the biggest advantage, says Milojević. “The sheer amount of data, and the degree of data aggregation associated with FtF [Funding the Frontier], is impressive,” she says. “Even without its predictive aspect, having a tool that allows one to look up PIs [principal investigators] or grants from wide areas of science and evaluate them in terms of their various research metrics normalized for variations over fields and time is extremely useful.”\n\nHow to demonstrate the real-world impact of your research\n\nCase studies\n\nWang expects that many people will be interested in the tool. Funders might use it to investigate their funding portfolio to see which areas have been most productive; university administrators could investigate the footprint of their institution, to identify areas of strength and weakness and help to decide where to invest.\n\n“There’s an infinite amount of questions you could ask,” he says.\n\nThe preprint, which is yet to be peer reviewed, includes case studies involving anonymous potential users. One project manager at a large US funding agency used it to examine the broad social impacts of the agency’s grants, which he said he had never been able to see before. He found that their projects had been cites in policy documents in Germany and the United Kingdom and at other intergovernmental organizations. But he also identified a previously unknown gender disparity — namely that, in some fields, female PIs were under-represented — which he planned further investigate.\n\nA second user, who works for a private investment firm specializing in biomedical research, was most interested in the tool’s predictive potential. He found that, in the field of Alzheimer’s research, the biggest clinical impact over the past 20 years came from studies aimed at understanding the disease, but the biggest predicted future impact was concentrated in studies of the social-support systems of people with the disease — suggesting a potential new investment opportunity.",

          "abstract": "Pregnant people have long relied on paracetamol for pain and fever. Credit: BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty\n\nThe painkiller acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is one of the most widely taken drugs during pregnancy, used by roughly half of all pregnant people worldwide.\n\nBut today, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would slap a warning label on the drug, citing a “possible association” between autism spectrum disorder in children and the use of acetaminophen, also called Tylenol in the United States, during pregnancy.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, however, was not as nuanced in his language: “Don’t take Tylenol”, he said repeatedly in a widely anticipated announcement about autism. “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.\n\nAutistic people show differences in social communication and interaction, and, over the past few decades, the reported prevalence of the developmental condition has risen in some countries. But many researchers who study autism caution that there are insufficient data to link it with paracetamol, and that focusing on this is merely a distraction.\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\n“There is no definitive evidence to suggest that paracetamol use in mothers is a cause of autism, and when you see any associations, they are very, very small,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a charity for autism research and campaigning in London, who is autistic. “At the heart of this is people trying to look for simple answers to complex problems.”\n\nAt today’s announcement, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr acknowledged that autism has many possible causes. FDA commissioner Martin Makary noted that, in some cases, insufficient transport of the nutrient folate into the brain has been linked with traits common in autism. The FDA announced today that it would initiate approval of a form of folate, called leucovorin, for people with low levels of the vitamin in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBut Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, and Trump focused their attention on two other factors that they said could be linked to autism: acetaminophen and vaccines. Decades of research have not uncovered a reproducible link between vaccines and autism.\n\n“The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism,” says Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and executive director of the PEAR-Net Society, a non-profit organization in Vancouver advocating for maternal–fetal health and research. “Suggesting otherwise may fuel misinformation and undermine confidence in safe treatments and immunizations.”\n\nHere, Nature examines the evidence for a link between paracetamol, which is used to treat fever as well as pain, and autism.\n\nHow strong are the data connecting autism and paracetamol during pregnancy?\n\nScientists say that the most-robust research has found no link. “The better-controlled studies are less likely to find even a small risk,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies autism at Boston University in Massachusetts. “And even then, what we’re talking about is a minor association. We do not think that taking acetaminophen is in any way contributing to actually causing autism.”\n\nWorking out whether there is a link between the drug and autism is difficult, says Viktor Ahlqvist, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and co-author of what might be the biggest study1 on the link. The medication is available over the counter, so a lot of use is not recorded in medical databases. This means that researchers rely on self-reports, which can be unreliable.\n\nConfounding factors are an even bigger problem. Many pregnant people who take paracetamol have a health problem, such as an infection or underlying condition. Any apparent link between the drug and autism might therefore be explained by these other health factors, rather than the drug itself. Scientists try to adjust for this in their studies, but this is “rarely sufficient”, Ahlqvist says. This is one reason why studies looking for a link have produced conflicting results.\n\nThe study led by Ahlqvist harnessed data from nearly 2.5 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019 and — from the country’s extensive health records — data on paracetamol prescriptions during pregnancy and on self-reported use collected by midwives, as well as whether children later received autism diagnoses.\n\nThe study showed that around 1.42% of children exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy were autistic, compared with 1.33% of children who were not exposed — a “very small” difference, says Ahlqvist.\n\nThe team also compared pairs of siblings (born to the same mother), in which one had been exposed to paracetamol and one had not. Siblings share half of their genome, a similar upbringing and maternal health, so differences in autism are more likely to be due to the drug. Using this method, the researchers found no association between paracetamol and autism — which supports the idea that links found in other studies could be explained by confounding factors.\n\nA large, high-quality study2 from Japan of more than 200,000 children — also using sibling comparisons and published this year — found no link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism.\n\nAre there any studies that do link the medication and autism?\n\nA review3 of studies published last month in the journal Environmental Health concluded that there is an association. But researchers interviewed by Nature point instead to the contrasting results of a review4 of high-quality studies on the topic. That review, published in February, concluded that “in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk” of autism.\n\n“There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship, and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced and unsupported by the most robust methods,” Monique Botha, a social and developmental psychologist at Durham University, UK, said in comments to the Science Media Centre, a press office in London.",

          "abstract": "Too many papers, too little time.Credit: Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty\n\nThe challenge of staying up to date with the scientific literature has become a burden for everyone from students to senior investigators. In fields such as public health, annual publication counts now exceed half a million articles — more than 1,300 papers every day. Experienced researchers and early-career scientists alike report anxiety about falling behind and emphasize the importance of building efficient reading habits. Some have noted that the pressure to keep up has left many scientists increasingly reliant on social media and recommendation systems to find papers, rather than systematic reading.\n\nWhat’s clear is that the difficulty of keeping up with the literature is no longer a niche problem, but one that cuts across disciplines, methodologies and seniority levels. As researchers at different stages of our scientific journeys — a PhD student, a mid-career investigator and a senior group leader — we, too, have faced this challenge. Collectively, we have spent decades navigating the scientific literature, testing different ways to filter information and adapting to the accelerating pace of publication.\n\nHere, we offer five complementary strategies to help you filter the literature and stay up to date on your research field. These are the strategies that we have found to be the most effective, and we hope that they will help others, too, whatever their field or career stage.\n\nSubscribe to what matters\n\nOne of the simplest and most reliable ways to stay current is through journal table of contents (ToC) alerts. This conventional method might seem outdated in the age of personalized algorithms, but subscribing to a carefully curated selection of journals remains a sound strategy. Often, ToC alerts highlight key articles and provide direct links to abstracts or full texts. Some can even filter by article type and have specific alerts for reviews, editorials, research articles or methods papers.\n\nBluesky’s science takeover: 70% of Nature poll respondents use platform\n\nReceiving a curated list of new papers from a handful of reputable journals provides a structured and predictable way to remain grounded in the core literature of your field. It’s particularly helpful for recognizing recurring themes, spotting important reviews and following long-term shifts in editorial priorities — all without needing to actively search. We recommend subscribing to a blend of landmark and niche journals to capture both broad and field-specific research.\n\nYou might miss important articles published in journals that fall outside your alert list. When browsing long tables of contents, especially under time pressure, it’s easy to skim over titles that later prove relevant. Still, for many researchers, ToC alerts remain a first line of defence against information overload.\n\nLet PubMed do the work\n\nMoving beyond broad overviews, use platforms such as PubMed and Google Scholar to create a personalized surveillance system that monitors the literature for the topics, authors or keywords that matter to you. Users can set up saved searches and automated alerts, which can be configured to arrive weekly or monthly by e-mail.\n\nQueries can incorporate Boolean operators (such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’) and be polished to reduce the number of irrelevant hits. This method is particularly useful for capturing articles that appear in lesser-known journals or are outside your usual reading scope.\n\nThe same can be done for preprint servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, which allow users to set up RSS (really simple syndication) feeds or e-mail alerts on the basis of keywords, authors or subject areas. Including preprints in your alerts can give you early insight into emerging findings, methods and controversies because they frequently appear weeks or even months before peer-reviewed publication.\n\nThat said, custom alerts require maintenance. Poorly constructed queries can return overwhelming — and often irrelevant — results. And even well-designed alerts can pile up in your inbox, adding to the very overload they’re meant to reduce. Still, when used properly, search alerts across both peer-reviewed databases and preprint repositories can surface important literature with remarkable precision.\n\nFollow the people, not the papers\n\nAlthough many tools focus on topics or journals, an increasingly effective way to filter literature is to follow the researchers themselves. Professional networks such as ResearchGate and LinkedIn allow scientists to receive updates directly from the people and labs they care about. This person-centred approach can be particularly powerful for those who already know the key players in their field and want to monitor their scientific output in a more digestible, progressive format. For instance, ResearchGate can notify you when someone you follow uploads a new publication, preprint or data set. It also generates curated suggestions on the basis of your reading habits, recommendations and profile interests. These help to surface work that might otherwise be missed. Unlike static e-mail alerts, these feeds evolve as your network grows, offering a dynamic way to stay informed.\n\nThis approach also has the advantage of reinforcing professional awareness. Associating papers with specific individuals or groups can help to contextualize findings, track thematic trajectories in laboratories and even identify potential collaborators or competitors. Some authors also post supplementary materials or tutorials that aren’t always accessible through conventional journals, adding important context.\n\nOf course, not all researchers upload their work promptly, and some don’t use these platforms at all. As with social media, the quality of your feed is only as strong as the network you build. Still, for those willing to invest the time, following the people behind the papers offers a valuable, filtered window into the scientific landscape. A good tip for getting started is to identify active users in your field and screen their followers and followings for inspiration.\n\nUse social media wisely\n\nResearchers increasingly use social-media platforms such as X and Bluesky to share their latest publications, discuss preprints, highlight interesting studies and comment on scientific developments. Following the right accounts can provide a curated stream of relevant papers and ideas, often before they appear in journals or search alerts. These platforms also allow you to interact with researchers you might otherwise meet only at conferences — or perhaps be too shy to approach in person.",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "The US government ceased many operations early on Wednesday after Congress failed to pass legislation to fund agencies’ activities.Credit: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty\n\nThe US government shut down at 12:01 a.m. et on 1 October, after lawmakers in Congress failed to agree on a funding bill to keep the government running. Threats of federal shutdowns have become routine in the past decade, but this closure could be different: US President Donald Trump’s administration has encouraged mass firings of federal workers — a group that includes tens of thousands of scientists — during the lapse in funding.\n\n“When you shut it down, you have to do lay-offs. So, we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected,” Trump said on 30 September. It’s not clear when such lay-offs would begin, whether they would survive legal challenges or how extensive they would be. Even without any shutdown-driven lay-offs, the Trump administration projects that it will cut 300,000 people from the roughly 2.4-million-person federal workforce by the end of the year as part of its efforts to downsize the government.\n\nNASA begins mass firings of scientists ahead of Trump team’s deadline\n\nIn the meantime, the federal government has stopped non-essential operations. Science-agency staff members have been sent home, their research suspended. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had planned to halt its in-house basic research and stop admitting new people to the NIH hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. If the shutdown lasts more than a few days, it will directly affect non-government researchers: both the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would stop awarding new grants.\n\nShutdowns “can have a significant impact on the scientific research enterprise, and a lot of that does depend on how long a shutdown is”, says Joanne Padrón Carney, the chief government-relations officer at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a non-profit organization in Washington DC.\n\nIt’s unclear how long the shutdown could last. The first Trump administration (2017–21) featured a 35-day closure, the longest in US history, that cost roughly US$5 billion and led to disruptions across most US science agencies. There is no set date for the parties to meet for negotiations.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s questions about mass layoffs and the shutdown’s effect on science.\n\nShutdown showdown\n\nIn March, a small group of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to pass a bill to keep the government open. But this time, Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns about loss of health-care subsidies and a range of other issues, including attacks on free speech.\n\n‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts\n\nAlthough many scientists worry about the effect of a shutdown, some, including some federal researchers, see this as an opportunity for Congress to derail the Trump team’s activities, which have already included substantial lay-offs, budget cuts and disruption to research.\n\nAt a public protest in Washington DC on 29 September, federal employees spoke out against the actions of the Trump administration. “American science, the gold-standard and world-leading science and innovation enterprise, is being destroyed,” said Mark Histed, a neuroscientist at the NIH in Bethesda. “Congress has a rare moment of leverage to check Trump’s executive overreach and it must stand up and do so.”\n\nDrastic reductions\n\nNo previous shutdowns carried the threat of mass firings, officially called reductions in force (RIFs). According to guidance issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the office has directed agencies to consider issuing RIF notices to all employees who are working on certain projects: those whose Congressional funding lapsed on 1 October and whose goals are not “consistent with the President’s Priorities.” Carney says that the memo could be used to close programmes, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge at science agencies.\n\n‘Totally broken’: how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies",

          "authors": "Séverine Toussaert",
          "abstract": "The open-science movement has promoted the sharing of scientific protocols, statistical-analysis programs and data files. These efforts have undoubtedly made it easier to see how researchers come to their conclusions. But methods and findings are just the tip of the iceberg. Research often involves a long journey, during which scientists reassess their expectations, pivot and adapt to unexpected challenges and constraints. All too often, this is hidden from view.\n\nIs my study useless? Why researchers need methodological review boards\n\nI vividly remember the first experiment I conducted for my PhD in economics, investigating the conditions under which trust forms between strangers. I had built a solid theoretical framework, designed the experiment — in which students played a trust game — carefully, and optimistically named my database ‘AwesomeData’. But when I ran my first sessions, the results made no sense. My participants weren’t behaving as theory — or even common sense — would suggest, because my set-up made the task too confusing.\n\nThe fall was hard. Despite all my preparation, no one had told me what the research process looks like. The project ended up going through many iterations, a completely redesigned experiment and six rejections from journals before a paper was published. These setbacks remain invisible to anyone reading the final manuscript.\n\nFor science to be truly open, we need to pay more attention to these twists and turns, which happen in all research. Not disclosing this information causes three key problems.\n\nFirst, it prevents readers of research from properly understanding a project’s robustness and generalizability. In some fields, small pilot tests are used to fine-tune an experiment’s design — such as showing that a programme works only if participants receive incentives, or if a message is phrased in a particular way. Details of these pilots (and so the lessons learnt) rarely appear in print. Policymakers might then assume that the intervention can be scaled up regardless of incentives or wording.\n\nImpact factors are outdated, but new research assessments still fail scientists\n\nSecond, lack of disclosure stops other researchers from learning how to work more efficiently and invest their resources wisely. This can exacerbate inequities. Researchers with sparse social networks can struggle to access the informal knowledge held by veterans in their field, yet this is easier for well-connected researchers, who often come from wealthier regions or groups.\n\nFinally, sharing the trial-and-error aspects of research matters for mental health. Humans have a hard time learning from missing evidence — the ‘what you see is all there is’ phenomenon described by psychologist Daniel Kahneman. Hiding failures can lead researchers to overestimate how much others succeed, fuelling impostor syndrome.",

          "title": "China’s research hospitals push for prominence",
          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the geographical centre of medical research might be moving, as the amount and quality of research produced by China’s research hospitals rises, and the United States’ grip on the sector loosens.\n\nChina increased its investment in science by more than 3,800% between 1996 and 2023, says Bilal Demirel, who studies science and innovation at the Rathenau Institute in The Hague, the Netherlands, and is now coming close to matching what the United States spends. With China currently increasing its annual R&D budget by 7% — while US funding looks set to fall under President Donald Trump — there is every chance China will lead on research investment in the coming years.\n\nThanks to this growing government support, some of China’s research hospitals are rapidly moving up the Nature Index rankings. But questions remain about the quality of research in the Chinese health-care sector, with some of its hospitals also topping global lists for retracted papers — and it is not yet clear how effective efforts to rein in the problem will be.\n\nHospitals on the up\n\n“Chinese hospitals used to be quite weak in research, but that is changing rapidly,” says Yi Rao, director of the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Peking University.\n\nRao says the trend is driven by an increase in the number of physicians who have had good training in rigorous research, more encouragement and support from the government for selected hospitals to carry out research, and an increase in collaboration between biomedical scientists and clinical scientists.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\n“Past experiences in the West have shown clearly, and China is learning quickly, that research in hospitals is integral for innovating new treatments and for validating good treatments,” says Rao.\n\nDemirel’s data show that medical research is growing rapidly in the country. In 2003, about 10% of China’s research publications indexed in the Web of Science database were in medical fields. By 2023, that had grown to almost 20%. “They are really going hard on medical sciences,” he says.\n\nHospitals in China now make a significant contribution to the research output published in Nature Index journals. Of the leading 200 research hospitals in the world, ranked by Share, more than one-quarter — 51 in total — are in China, second only to the United States with 69. Germany lies at third with 20. The country’s top performer overall is West China Medical Center in Chengdu, home to the medical school of Sichuan University. It is ranked ninth among the world’s leading 200 research hospitals, based on research published from 2020 to 2024, and has been rising steadily through the ranks for the past few years, up from 24th in 2019. China’s hospitals are rapidly increasing their output as well. Among the top 25 fastest-rising research hospitals globally, ranked by how much their adjusted Share increased between 2023 and 2024, 16 are in China.\n\nAreas of strength\n\nChenkai Wu, who studies global health at Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China, says that in 2024, the Chinese government launched initiatives to promote four priorities in health research, linked to China’s specific strengths and needs. These are new and emerging diseases, building on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic; cancer and cardiovascular disease — two priorities that are growing issues in an ageing population; and rare diseases, leveraging China’s huge population. “Rare diseases are of course rare, but considering the population of China, we still have a lot of cases,” says Wu.\n\nThe initiatives are currently seeking input from the scientific community on specific research questions and its total funding has not yet been announced, says Wu, but he expects it to be worth hundreds of millions of yuan over a few years.\n\nSource: Nature Index\n\nChinese researchers are also making strides in the field of global population health, says Wu. That is partly a legacy of China’s long-standing practice of providing medical services to developing countries throughout Asia and Africa, as part of its international aid programme.\n\n“The government sent many teams overseas to provide medical aid, but until recently it didn’t involve a clear research component,” he says.\n\nIn 2013, the China Consortium of Universities for Global Health was launched by 10 leading universities in public health to build research capacity in the field, and it has since grown to 29 members. Wu and his colleagues carried out a bibliometric analysis of publications by the original 10 members between 2014 and 2020 (C. Wu et al. Glob. Health Res. Policy. 8, 10; 2023). They found that the number of publications in the field of global health that included data from outside China has steadily increased over that time, from just 10 in 2014 to 58 in 2020.\n\nThe most-studied research topic by far was chronic non-communicable diseases, totalling more publications than the next three most common topics combined. That reflects China’s “epidemiological shift” in recent years, says Wu, as the country has become better at dealing with infectious diseases while chronic illnesses become more common in the ageing population.\n\n“Over 90% of deaths in China now are due to chronic illnesses, not infectious disease,” says Wu. “So they are the national priority for public health.” Child and maternal health, neurological disorders and infectious disease were also common topics.\n\nBut Wu also found that relatively few of the studies, just 16%, involved primary data collection — most were secondary analyses of existing data sets. Of the primary studies, most had study populations in Asia and Africa. Several involved studying malaria in Myanmar and its neighbouring regions in China, whereas the African studies tended to focus on child and maternal health.\n\nThere has been a surge in interest in China in building new large data sets that can support this kind of research, with the government investing a great deal of money over the past five years, says Wu. But Chinese scientists are now facing issues that are familiar to their colleagues in the West — these data sets can be expensive and challenging to maintain over the long term. “Funding agencies are very interested in building them, but less interested in maintaining them,” says Wu.\n\nChina has also now surpassed the United States in the number of ongoing clinical trials, according to an analysis (E. H. Lee et al. J. Clin. Epidemiol. 183, 111791; 2025) co-authored by John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at Stanford University in California. China took the lead in 2019 and has maintained that lead in the years since. In 2023, China was home to 16,612 registered trials, compared with 9,100 for the United States.\n\nCancer, cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases were prominent fields of study, but the trials cover the full gamut of medical research. “China is working on practically every disease, they’re not lagging behind in any area,” says Ioannidis.\n\nSurgery takes place at a hospital in Huai’an using an orthopaedic surgical robot. Credit: CFOTO/Sipa USA/Alamy\n\nAlthough one of the biggest issues facing sponsors of trials is increasing costs, the per-patient cost is lower in China, and is not rising as it is in the United States and elsewhere. This potentially offers new outsourcing and partnership opportunities for international sponsors, Revati Tatake, a researcher at London-based analysis firm GlobalData, told a clinical-trials industry conference in San Francisco in February.\n\nCurrently, however, China is involved in relatively few international trials conducted across multiple sites. Most of its trials are single-centre studies conducted only in China — with 70% run by sponsor companies based in the country.\n\n“That doesn’t mean they’re not trustworthy, but they are less likely to be the pivotal trials that change the health-care landscape internationally,” says Ioannidis. “At the very top, China is not challenging the US just yet.”\n\nThese shifts in research output towards China are likely to accelerate in the coming years, as the Trump administration’s cuts to science agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) begin to bite.\n\nFor example, many grants from the NIH have been abruptly cancelled for political reasons. The future of the agency also looks bleak — the Trump administration is proposing that the NIH’s budget be cut by almost 40% next fiscal year and its 27 institutes consolidated into just 8.\n\n“It is a loss to the US, but also a loss to patients of the whole world,” says Rao. “Fortunately, the cut in the US coincides with some dramatic increases in Chinese support for science and medical research.”\n\nRao says that if the United States keeps cutting back on funding then China will eventually be able to pick up the slack. “It will take a while for China to pick up all that is cut by the US,” he says — perhaps 10 or 20 years — but if the cuts continued he would be “confident that China will surpass the current level of US support for medical research”.\n\nPersistent problems\n\nDespite the rise of China’s research hospitals in international rankings such as the Nature Index, some of the country’s medical institutions have a spotty reputation when it comes to research quality and integrity.\n\nA Nature analysis found that Chinese hospitals and medical schools dominate the list of institutions that had the greatest proportion of their research output retracted between 2014 and 2024 (see Nature 638, 596–599; 2025). Retractions can represent attempts to correct unintentional errors, but they can also be a result of fraud and misconduct. The top three spots in the Nature analysis, and seven of the top ten, were all taken by hospitals in China, although there was no overlap with institutions topping the Nature Index.",

It aims to revive lost species using CRISPR gene-editing technology, including the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.). It attracted controversy when it announced it has ‘de-extincted’ the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago. Its co-founders are technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm, Colossal’s chief executive, and George Church, the company’s genetics adviser, who also holds academic research positions at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nIn the third article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Lamm describes how the name ‘Colossal Biosciences’ came about.\n\nThe fact that the world will lose up to 25% of all biodiversity between now and 2050 is a huge problem. At my company, we asked ourselves, how do we come up with a name that encompasses three elements: the problem, the solution and our flagship species, the mammoth?\n\nClimate change, biodiversity, CRISPR and gene editing, artificial intelligence, computational analysis and advanced embryology can be difficult concepts for the public to fully grasp. We came up with ‘Colossal Biosciences’ because losing species is a colossal problem, our solution is colossal and the mammoth is a colossal animal.\n\nWe felt that our brand and name should not only reflect the problem and solution, but also be approachable to children, including some who will grow up to read Cell, Nature and Science. Every week, we get little pictures of dodos and baby mammoths that kids draw, and their parents mail us physical letters, saying things such as: ‘Thank you so much for doing what you’re doing. My kid is excited about science. You’re making science cool.’\n\nA big, awesome name\n\nTo come up with Colossal, I worked with Chris Klee, executive vice-president of design at the company, and Chris Stevens, co-founder of Maven Creative, our branding agency, in Orlando, Florida.\n\nWe’ve worked together for the past 20 years. We had a list of seven or eight potential names — including ‘Huge’, ‘Macedon’ (an ancient kingdom) and ‘Footprint’ (because every species has a unique one). Everything was centred around the concept of ‘big and awesome’. Obviously, ‘Mammoth’ was on the list because the world is facing a mammoth challenge, but we felt that calling it that would have pigeonholed us to one species.\n\nWe also liked ‘Colossus’, and the idea of using ‘us’ to signify a team effort. But Colossus is a character in the Marvel Universe media franchise, and we didn’t want to be too Hollywood. We also considered names linked to evolution, and thought ‘Darwin’ could be a cool one. But when we said ‘Colossal’ out loud, we were like, ‘That’s it!’\n\nAlongside the name, there’s the brand — so before we decided on Colossal, we underwent a process to come up with a brand that encapsulated ‘Harvard University meets 1980’s MTV’.",

Now a study in mice reveals why this dumping occurs: mitochondria are expelling ‘tainted’ DNA1.\n\nScientists found that, in the cells of ageing mice with kidney inflammation, strands of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contained an excess of certain types of nucleotides — molecular building blocks — that can harm DNA. This excess prompted the mitochondria to eject the abnormal fragments of genetic code into the cytosol, a fluid that fills the cell, in which the free-roaming mtDNA kick-started key inflammatory pathways associated with ageing.\n\nThe study is exciting because it helps to explain why and how mitochondria throw away their DNA, says Timothy Shutt, a medical geneticist at the University of Calgary in Canada, who focuses on mitochondria. This insight could help researchers to better understand mitochondria’s contribution to inflammageing — the chronic inflammation that occurs as people get older, adds Shutt.\n\nThe findings were published 24 September in Nature1.\n\nOut with the rubbish\n\nMitochondria are energy-producing organelles that have their own genome. When the mtDNA is damaged or disrupted, the mitochondria kick it out, sending it into the cytosol. This can occur when the relative levels of certain nucleotides in the mtDNA become too high or low.\n\nThis oversupply problem, which stresses the mitochondria, can be caused by certain drugs and also seems to happen in ageing cells. But exactly how this nucleotide imbalance leads to mtDNA release and inflammageing had been unclear, says study co-author Thomas Langer, a cell biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, Germany.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nTo find out, Langer and his colleagues turned to mice engineered to lack an enzyme called MGME1. As these mice age, their kidneys usually become inflamed, making them useful models for studying inflammation. MGME1 ensures that the mitochondrial genome makes accurate copies of itself, but the connection between its loss and inflammation was unclear.",

          "authors": "Carlos Garcia-Soto",
          "abstract": "The sea bed holds vast reserves of cobalt, nickel and other minerals, yet no international rules govern how such extraction might proceed or how its impacts should be contained. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is mandated to set those rules, but in its July session, it failed to agree on a mining code. Meanwhile, 30 contracts for resource exploration remain in force and are edging closer to industrial extraction. This contradiction is not accidental. It stems from how the authority works — licensing first, restraining later. Transparency and independent review are needed to restore the balance.\n\nGuess how much of the ocean floor humans have explored\n\nDecision-making is concentrated in the ISA Council, which is responsible for rule-making, licensing and oversight. In other multilateral policy settings, guardianship and licensing are separated and public reporting is mandatory. The council deliberates mainly in closed sessions. Scientists and civil-society representatives can attend as observers, but rule 75 restricts them to a seat without a vote — they are present in the room, yet absent from the decision-making.\n\nThree structural gaps currently erode the ISA’s credibility as a body to govern the sea bed on behalf of all humankind. A representation gap: decisions are dominated by states with mining interests, whereas nations without mining capacity — and independent scientists and civil-society groups — remain marginal. A mandate gap: safeguards are applied mainly as formalities, with weak links to science. And a legitimacy gap: baseline data produced largely by contractors are subject to little independent review or oversight — unlike in other governance regimes such as regional fisheries bodies or the International Whaling Commission.\n\nThese gaps date back to the 1990s, when the ISA’s architecture was designed — before deep-sea ecosystems were understood, before biodiversity was recognized as a pillar of sustainable development and before transparency became a norm in multilateral negotiations. The ISA was established in 1994 under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) with a dual mandate: to safeguard the sea bed as humanity’s common heritage and to regulate its exploitation for the benefit of all. Three decades on, that balance has tilted towards exploitation, with the authority pressed to consider mining applications before binding rules or environmental standards exist.\n\nFive priorities for a sustainable ocean economy\n\nIn July 2021, the state of Nauru triggered a clause in UNCLOS obliging the ISA to finalize a mining code within two years. When no code was adopted by July 2023, this period’s expiry entitled states to submit applications in the rules’ absence. Although negotiations and drafting of the code have advanced since, progress on environmental baselines and benefit-sharing mechanisms has stalled. In practice, the precautionary principle has been applied unevenly across ISA sessions, reflecting divergent legal interpretations, standards of evidence and political alignments.\n\nNorway’s January 2024 vote to allow exploratory sea-bed mining has heightened environmental concerns. Moreover, independent research usually arrives too late to shape outcomes, whereas data generated by contractors dominate the evidence base and raise doubts about independence. Proposals to embed independent review in ISA procedures have repeatedly stalled, leaving trust in the authority’s decisions fragile.\n\nThree gates would give the ISA enforceable checkpoints before any mining licence is granted. These focus squarely on institutional reform, not on individuals or countries, and would help the ISA to fulfil its mandate.",

          "title": "Public trust in science has declined since COVID — virologists need to unite around safety standards",
          "authors": "Melanie Ott, Olivier Schwartz, Alex Sigal",
          "abstract": "In an opinion piece published in The New York Times in March, two leading virologists argued that experiments on a coronavirus found in bats and similar to those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had been conducted without sufficient safety measures. The experiments involved infecting human cells with the live bat virus to see how the virus behaved1.\n\nRegulatory authorities in many countries where research on potentially dangerous viruses is conducted, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, would require such studies to be conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities. (There are four biosafety levels, with BSL-4 being the most stringent.) But for these experiments — which were approved by the equivalent authorities in China — the 25 researchers across 7 institutes and universities in China (including the Guangzhou National Laboratory and the Wuhan Institute of Virology) used BSL-2 procedures. They also used a negative pressure ventilation system designed to prevent microorganisms from spreading outside the laboratory.\n\nIn our view, this work and the discussion it has provoked highlights a broader and growing problem that the entire virology community needs to address. On the one hand, the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases is growing2,3 (see ‘A growing threat’), making investigations of potentially dangerous viruses more important. On the other hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in virology and science more broadly has declined and work on viruses has become more politicized.\n\nTo improve trust in science — and to ensure that essential work on viruses can continue — international, standardized and transparent biosafety guidance is urgently needed. Here, we lay out how such guidance might be developed.\n\nSource: Ref. 6\nPatchwork regulation\n\nOver the past 30–40 years, various protocols and procedures have been introduced to reduce the risk of viruses escaping from labs, or of people being infected by viruses used in research.\n\nToday, researchers in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States, can work on certain ‘dangerous’ viruses only if they use biosafety cabinets, personal protective equipment and strict standardized procedures for BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities. The use of negative pressure, which ensures that the air in a facility leaves through a filter that captures pathogens, and strict controls over access to the facility are also required.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nWhich viruses qualify as dangerous is decided by the government of each country, and is usually listed as an appendix to the regulations governing the work. In the United States, federal funding for research involving the enhancement of viruses that cause influenza, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — whether through the use of genetic manipulation or by harnessing natural evolutionary processes — was banned in 2014. The ban was lifted in 2017, but research is only permitted after a stringent review process and with the use of BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities4. These rules are likely to change again under the current US administration.\n\nIn China, national biosafety laws were updated in 2004 and 2020. These require investigators undertaking studies on potentially pathogenic living organisms to use BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities, among other strict precautions5. It is unclear exactly how these rules are enforced, however. They don’t seem to have been applied to the experiments on the MERS-like coronavirus found in bats, which were approved by the Wuhan Institute of Virology institutional biosafety committee.\n\nThe level of detail included in regulations also varies. For example, Canada uses the Canadian Biosafety Standard, which lays out exactly how containment is to be achieved. The United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have similar standards. Many other countries, however, do not provide such detailed information, although they might provide details of the containment levels necessary for certain pathogens.\n\nAvian influenza viruses can infect and spread among domestic poultry, including chickens.Credit: Andres Kudacki/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nThis patchwork regulation has led to confusion in the field. And the lack of transparency has probably made it easier for people to spread misinformation and fake news around the handling of live viruses in research.\n\nMore than five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the controversy about its origins shows no sign of abating. According to the lab-leak theory (now promoted by the administration of US President Donald Trump), research on bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the accidental infection of lab personnel, which in turn sparked the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the institute is known to have been doing research on coronaviruses before the pandemic, there is no firm evidence that it possessed or conducted work on a SARS-CoV-2 precursor virus. Meanwhile, findings indicating that the pandemic resulted from a natural ‘spillover’ event, the epicentre of which was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, continue to accumulate. (A spillover event is the transmission of what is called a zoonotic virus from other animals to humans.)\n\nTrump freezes ‘gain of function’ pathogen research ― threatening all US virology, critics say\n\nIn our experience, virologists are often reluctant to engage in discussions about work that involves the enhancement of live viruses — either genetically or through natural evolutionary processes — for fear of being caught in the crosshairs or of their own work being shut down, even if it is low risk. But now is not the time to lie low.\n\nThe number of outbreaks and deaths caused by viruses such as those that cause SARS, Ebola and mpox has been increasing. Data scientists predict that, if current trends continue, Nipah virus, Machupo virus, coronaviruses and filoviruses will, compared with 2020, cause 4 times as many spillover events and 12 times as many deaths by 2050 because of global travel, climate change, tropical deforestation, and wild-animal hunting and trade6,7.\n\nAnd although virologists now have various ways of studying viruses that can spread between animals and humans, besides growing fully functional zoonotic viruses in the lab, experiments involving live viruses are key to testing antiviral drugs and vaccines. It’s hard to imagine how it would have been possible for researchers to develop COVID-19 vaccines, for instance — estimated to have saved millions of lives since 2021 — without studies on live SARS-CoV-2 (and earlier work on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in animal models.\n\nGiven the crisis of mistrust in science and institutions, and an increasingly fractured geopolitical world, unified international guidelines are crucial for protecting essential research involving dangerous viruses.\n\nA global standard\n\nCentralized, standardized guidelines would be analogous to the guidelines for research on human embryos produced by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) — an organization that includes investigators in more than 80 countries. They would be similar to national regulations for research on dangerous viruses, but on a global level. They could lay out what factors might make the use of a particular virus or approach high risk or what benefit-to-cost ratio might justify a research project being pursued or blocked, for example.\n\nSome scenarios should not be allowed to happen. If an investigator is working on the H5N1 bird flu virus in a BSL-3 facility, for instance, they should take strict precautions to prevent viral strains that cause human seasonal flu from entering the facility, even though seasonal flu is not considered a dangerous virus. This is because strains of flu virus can exchange RNA fragments. Such exchange could make H5N1 more transmissible in humans.",

          "abstract": "A crime-laboratory officer removes material from the house of the prime suspect in the Gilgo Beach killings.Credit: Jeenah Moon/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nA judge in New York rejected a request on 23 September to disqualify the use of cutting-edge DNA sequencing as evidence in a case against an alleged serial killer. The ruling paves the way for a type of DNA analysis known as whole-genome sequencing — used to decipher ancient DNA in fossilized remains, for example — to be admitted as evidence in US criminal trials.\n\n“This is a big step forward for the use of DNA evidence, because it will allow comparisons and matches with evidence that was previously considered too minuscule, too old or too badly degraded to be considered useful,” says Nathan Lents, a biologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. “You can bet that cold-case units all over the country are going back through their evidence lockers to see if there are samples that can now be tested with a reasonable chance of success.”\n\nA technology matures\n\nThe Gilgo Beach killings were a series of murders that occurred in Suffolk County, New York, between 1993 and 2011. Many of the victims were sex workers, and the bodies of some of them were found near the eponymous beach. New York architect Rex Heuermann was charged with seven of the murders in 2023 and 2024 partly on the basis of hairs found on the victims.\n\nIn 2010, investigators concluded that there wasn’t enough genetic material in the hairs for conventional forensic technology to identify whose they were. But since then, genomic technology has matured at a fast pace.\n\nRex Heuermann appears in a New York court in 2023. Credit: James Carbone/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nForensic scientists still identify suspects from hair and other samples using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which can amplify snippets of DNA called short tandem repeats (STRs). Today, however, scientists can also sequence whole genomes and look at single-letter variations in the DNA to zero in on a person of interest. This technology has the added benefit of being able to analyse severely degraded samples — from Neanderthal remains to hairs in the Gilgo Beach case. But it has typically been used only during investigations, and the results have not been widely presented as evidence before juries.\n\nThe controversial company using DNA to sketch the faces of criminals\n\nThe prosecution in the Gilgo Beach case contracted the company Astrea Forensics in Santa Cruz, California, to analyse the hairs found on the victims. Because they were rootless, the hairs hadn’t yielded enough DNA for conventional STR profiling. (Rootless hairs are made mostly of keratin and don’t contain much genetic material, Lents says.)\n\nBut Astrea was able to sequence the small amount of genetic material in the hairs and then use statistical-analysis software to scan the DNA for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) — single-letter differences in people’s genetic codes. Even in a degraded sample, whole-genome sequencing followed by this statistical analysis can spot thousands of SNPs: enough to pinpoint an individual’s unique pattern, Lents says.\n\nNext, scientists at Astrea compared the SNP profiles they obtained with profiles stored in genealogy databases and looked for matches. People submit their DNA to genealogy services, such as 23andMe and Ancestry, and these companies return SNP profiles that people can then upload to websites such as GEDMatch to locate potential relatives. Users have the option to make the data available to forensic genealogists — and these data are what Astrea used to zero in on Heuermann and his family.\n\nSetting precedent\n\nThe defence team in the Gilgo Beach case initially challenged the validity of Astrea’s DNA-analysis methods — which were developed by palaeogenomics researcher Richard ‘Ed’ Green at the University of California, Santa Cruz. (Green declined to comment for this article, given the ongoing prosecution.) The defence argued that the statistical methods used by Astrea were unique, and questioned whether they had been sufficiently validated.",

Experience is often seen as key, with success coming from years of knowledge building and collaboration. This is certainly true for most Nobel Prize laureates, who have an average age of 58.\n\nHowever, research teams with high fractions of beginners — authors with no prior publication history — tend to be more disruptive and innovative, found a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 12 September1.\n\nActively integrating beginners into research groups could boost the disruptive and innovative qualities of the work by having fewer collaborators who are burdened by knowledge, the authors say. “Beginner scientists have less loyalty to prevailing assumptions, and they can take more intellectual freedom,” says co-author Raiyan Abdul Baten, a computational social scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nCan creativity in science be learnt? These researchers think so\n\nBeginner’s charm\n\nThis pattern was first noticed by researchers during a study of whether artificial intelligence can predict how innovative and disruptive a paper will be in its scientific domain2. In the new study, the team analysed more than 28 million articles from SciSciNet-v2, a data lake for the science of science research. These scientific papers spanned 146 fields and were published between 1971 and 2021.\n\nDisruption scores were calculated by comparing how many citations a paper has garnered compared with the papers that it referenced. A disruptive paper that was cited more times than were the papers it referenced could, for example, disprove an established theory and offer an alternative hypothesis.\n\nDuring the analysis, Baten and his colleagues noticed a link between a paper’s disruptiveness and the number of beginner authors, which led them to partition data by authors’ ‘career age’ — defined as the number of years since their first publication. Beginner authors were those with no previous publications.\n\nThey were surprised to find that papers with a higher proportion of beginner authors tended to be more disruptive than were papers with more early-career or senior authors. Disruption scores were highest when beginners made up the entire team, but they were also high when beginners were paired with co-authors with track records of producing disruptive work. Papers with the highest ratio of beginner authors consistently showed a positive correlation between disruption and citation count.\n\n“As the fraction of beginners increases in teams, the disruptivity and innovation go up,” says Baten. “Across team sizes, decades and disciplines, we found these results to be robust,” he adds.\n\nWhat makes a good PhD student?\n\nDiversity boosts scientific progress\n\nWhy do collaborations with more beginners tend to be more disruptive? The researchers speculate that these scientists offer new perspectives because they are less attached to previous theories and knowledge than are their more experienced colleagues. “Sometimes, it is difficult to unlearn the prevailing assumptions then adopt radically new ones,” says Baten. This could allow early-career scientists to be more receptive to new ideas and more likely to take risks by exploring experimental approaches, he says.",

          "abstract": "A medical researcher gathers information as part of a Health and Demographic Surveillance System in northern Malawi.Credit: Malawi Epidemiology and Intervention Research Unit\nBroadening the long view\n\nLongitudinal studies — which follow individuals to collect data about health, lifestyle and environment over a period of months, years or even decades — have helped researchers understand disease risk, inform prevention strategies and improve public health planning. But the majority of large-scale longitudinal research has historically taken place in Europe or North America, meaning many populations remain under-represented in the data.\n\nA new generation of longitudinal studies is aiming to better reflect population diversity — not just by recruiting from underserved groups, but by embedding community involvement, local scientific leadership and context-specific questions into their design. This article is one of a series of three profiles about studies taking this approach.\n\nIn March 2020, just before borders closed and labs were shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, around 100 scientists gathered in Kampala to discuss forming a pan-African research consortium. Their idea: what if Africa’s many longitudinal population studies — some of which have been running for decades — could be brought together?\n\nAlthough Africa is home to more than 1.5 billion people and has some of the world’s most pressing health challenges, those at the meeting felt the reach and impact of its population studies were less powerful than they could be.\n\nThat meeting marked the beginning of the African Population Cohorts Consortium (APCC), an initiative designed to connect and strengthen large-scale longitudinal studies across the continent. The 60-plus studies within the consortium, from 16 countries, have already contributed to important evidence-based health-care policies — from the first measles vaccine trials in Senegal to the roll out of malaria bed nets in The Gambia — but until now, they’ve remained largely siloed.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\nMany cohorts have contributed a great deal to science, but their potential is far from fully realized,” says Kobus Herbst, interim steering committee co-chair and director of population health at the Africa Health Research Institute, based in Durban, South Africa.\n\nThe consortium was supported in its early stages by charitable funders the Wellcome Trust, based in London, and the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, as well as the UK Medical Research Council. In 2024, Wellcome awarded £4 million (US$5.37 million) to establish a permanent secretariat, hosted by the Science for Africa (SFA) Foundation in Nairobi, and to launch the consortium’s first initiatives.\n\n“Wellcome has a long history of supporting health-data platforms such as longitudinal population studies,” says Victoria Pelly, a senior research manager at Wellcome. “Although we fund some in lower- and middle-income countries, a lot of the large-scale studies are still based in high-income countries.” Wellcome’s support for the APCC was driven “by a recognition that there’s a wealth of research capacity and context-specific data on the African continent that’s underutilized”, she adds.\n\nThe APCC’s blueprint, which sets out its goals, governance structures and priorities, was developed by a team led by Herbst and Evelyn Gitau, chief scientific officer at the SFA Foundation, and has been endorsed by the teams and institutions running the studies.\n\nEach cohort study has a seat on a members council, which elects the steering committee. A separate participant forum makes sure that communities involved in the cohorts have a role in shaping research priorities. Delegates from each cohort meet to share views on the research planned and how it’s carried out.\n\nDorcas Kamuya, another co-chair of the interim steering committee, is keen to emphasize the importance of the participant forum as a way of directing the research. “We’re creating a platform informed by values we hold dear — friendship, reciprocity, togetherness,” she says. “It’s essential we don’t undermine them as we build systems.”\n\nKey facts: African Population Cohorts Consortium\n\nStudy name: African Population Cohorts Consortium (APCC).\n\nNumber of participants: Brings together 67 African studies, covering around 6 million people.\n\nPopulation being studied: Populations across the African continent, with a focus on diverse geographic, ethnic and socioeconomic groups, including rural and underserved communities.\n\nData collected: Data vary by cohort but includes demographic, health, environmental, behavioural and — in some cases — biological and genomic data.\n\nLaunch year: Formally initiated in 2020.\n\nDuration: Ongoing initiative building on existing cohort studies, many of which have been running for years or decades.\n\nFunding: Initial funding that culminated in the APCC Blueprint was around £1 million (US$1.35 million), with the bulk coming from the Wellcome Trust and additional contributions from the Gates Foundation and UK Medical Research Council. In 2024, Wellcome awarded £4 million to establish a permanent secretariat and launch the consortium’s first initiatives.\n\nThe APCC has already actively engaged 67 existing studies, which together represent data from around 6 million participants. Most are Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) studies — long-running observations that track births, deaths and migrations in certain communities to monitor population health over time. Others include birth cohorts that follow children from infancy, genomic studies looking at genetic and environmental risk factors, and platforms that host clinical trials in everyday settings.\n\nMany of these studies operate in under-resourced settings. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 64% of countries in Africa lack the capacity to accurately count and register births and deaths. Health data availability and quality remain insufficient in many countries in the region, it says. “These cohorts provide ideal environments to engage with communities, involve them in the science, and build capacity of young data scientists and epidemiologists in Africa,” says Herbst.\n\nThat’s another goal of the APCC creators: to expand opportunities for African researchers. “One of the things I hope to see is a large cohort of African scientists whose careers have been launched through this work,” Herbst says. “People who’ve done their master’s projects using cohort data, completed their PhDs within these studies, and gone on to postdocs and beyond.”\n\nAs well as a way of bringing the science together, collaborating scientists say the APCC acts as a research community, where the cohort researchers and institutions can share results with others in the field, get inspiration on questions to pursue and identify follow-up collaborations and funding opportunities. Herbst adds that the APCC can also “amplify their voices to have policy impact on the continent”, for example by pooling results or testing whether findings from one study apply in another region of Africa.\n\nTo guide those collaborations and to inform its own future funding calls, the APCC has set out three strategic research programmes: health across the life course, climate and health, and universal health coverage.\n\nSource: Ramsey, M., Crampin, A. C., Bawah, A. A., Gitau, E. & Herbst, K. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Data Sci. 7, 277–294 (2024).\n\nTesfahun Melese, coordinator of the Dabat Research Centre in Gondar, Ethiopia, says being part of the APCC has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and capacity-building. The centre, based at the University of Gondar, runs three HDSS sites in the region, tracking data on indicators such as births, deaths and migration. “Being a member of the APCC, we can disseminate our research and data to the scientific community,” he says. “We can collaborate with other HDSS sites, get support for data management and analysis, co-write papers, and apply for grants together. That makes a big difference.”\n\nThrough connections made at an APCC event, Melese is setting up a partnership with another surveillance site in South Africa to do a study of youth employability, which is in the stages of securing funding from the Mastercard Foundation, a charitable Canadian funder supporting young people in Africa and Indigenous young people in Canada.",

M.-D. Madler et al./Nature\n\nA fresh supply of the immune cells that keep the brain tidy might one day help to treat a host of conditions, from ultra-rare genetic disorders to more familiar scourges, such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nIn the past few months, a spate of new studies have highlighted the potential of a technique called microglia replacement and explored ways to make it safer and more effective. “This approach is very promising,” says Pasqualina Colella, who studies gene and cell therapy at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “But the caveat is the toxicity of the procedure.”\n\nNew hope for Alzheimer’s: lithium supplement reverses memory loss in mice\n\nMicroglia are immune cells that patrol the brain, gobbling up foreign invaders, damaged cells and harmful substances. They can help to protect neurons — cells that transmit and receive messages to and from other tissues — during seizures and strokes, and they prune unneeded connections between neurons during normal brain development.\n\n“Microglia do a lot of important things,” says Chris Bennett, a psychiatrist who studies microglia at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “So, it’s not surprising that they are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases.”\n\nThose diseases include a suite of rare disorders caused by genetic mutations that directly affect microglia. Malfunctioning microglia have also been implicated in more familiar conditions with complex causes, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as ageing, says Bo Peng, a neuroscientist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.\n\nImmune-cell swap\n\nThis has led researchers to investigate a tantalizing possibility: that replacing disease-causing microglia could treat some brain conditions. But swapping out microglia poses special challenges. Physicians typically replace a person’s immune cells by performing a bone-marrow transplant, which provides a fresh supply of stem cells that shelter in the bone marrow and give rise to many immune cells. Microglia, however, reside almost exclusively in the central nervous system, and typically replenish themselves by dividing rather than relying on stem cells in the bone marrow to send in replacements.\n\nHow CRISPR gene editing could help treat Alzheimer’s\n\nPhysicians already use bone-marrow transplants to treat some rare diseases that affect microglia, such as a condition called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The treatment can be effective, says Marco Prinz, a neuropathologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, but the results are inconsistent and typically replace only a small percentage of the recipient’s natural microglia.\n\nIn July, Peng’s team used bone-marrow transplants to replace abnormal microglia resulting from a fatal brain disease called CAMP (CSF1R-associated microgliopathy). The treatment was a success both in mice and in a small trial of eight people with the rare disorder: none of the eight participants experienced a decline in their motor or cognitive abilities in the two years following the treatment1, whereas members of a control group who did not receive the procedure experienced a deterioration of both.\n\nOne possible reason for the success of the CAMP trial is the nature of the disease itself, says Bennett, because people with CAMP tend to produce relatively few microglia. This could leave space for the transplanted cells to thrive.\n\nOnerous regimen\n\nCreating that niche for the new microglia is a pivotal step in microglia replacement — and a source of concern. To make room for transplanted cells, physicians must first wipe out as many of the brain’s resident microglia as possible. This can entail high levels of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both of which can leave the recipient vulnerable to infection during the procedure and raise their long-term risk of cancer. That means that microglia replacement is, for the moment, too toxic to be used except in severe, rapidly progressing diseases such as CAMP, says Colella.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey M. Perkel",
          "abstract": "Travis Oliphant: scientist, software developer, entrepreneur and now, subject of a documentary.Credit: Christi Norris/BYU\n\nIn 2005, Travis Oliphant was an information scientist working on medical and biological imaging at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, when he began work on NumPy, a library that has become a linchpin of scientific computing in the Python programming language.\n\nOliphant came across Python as a graduate student in 1998 and, as he wrote in the Guide to NumPy (2006), “quickly fell in love” with it. That “is a remarkable statement to make about a programming language”, he acknowledged. “If I had not seen others with the same view, I might have seriously doubted my sanity.”\n\nBut as he explained to Nature, Python has two particularly attractive features, even for a programmer who is conversant in more powerful languages: it’s easy to read — “executable English”, as he puts it — and extensible. Oliphant would go on to write or contribute to two of the language’s most crucial extensions: NumPy and SciPy.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of downloads per month, NumPy simplifies and standardizes the treatment of complex numeric arrays, enabling mathematical computations that are necessary to do science — including artificial intelligence (AI) — in the Python language. This is one reason why Python has become the go-to language of scientific computing. As a 2020 Nature research article pointed out1 , “NumPy underpins almost every Python library that does scientific or numerical computation, which includes SciPy but also Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn and scikit-image.” SciPy, in turn, is a collection of scientific algorithms, many of which Oliphant created.\n\nNow a technology entrepreneur and chief AI scientist at OpenTeams in Austin, Texas, Oliphant has gone from scientist to software developer to chief executive to venture capitalist — all thanks to NumPy, he says. “NumPy has been a driving force for my whole life.”\n\nNow, his career has taken him to the silver screen. Last month, the YouTube channel CultRepo, whose films tell the human stories behind technologies, released a movie about the programming language and its backstory. Fittingly, the official premiere for Python: The Documentary was held at PyCon Greece, a conference dedicated to the language, in Athens on 28 August.\n\nOliphant features in the 84-minute film, alongside Guido van Rossum, who created the language at the end of 1989. A separate featurette, also released last month, focuses on NumPy and SciPy, with Oliphant in a starring role.\n\nNature chose to mark the 20th anniversary of NumPy’s creation by asking Oliphant to reflect on two decades of array arithmetic.\n\nWhy did you develop NumPy?\n\nNumPy was a merger of two existing array libraries in the Python ecosystem. When I started using Python in 1998, a library called Numeric already existed. Numeric was written in 1995 by Jim Hugunin, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He was a pioneer and a brilliant technologist: he basically built an amazing ‘while-loop’, a block of code that executes as long as a specified condition remains true. And this while-loop did a bunch of things that made it easy to do mathematics using big arrays of numbers.\n\nAround 2000, computer scientists began writing a new library, called NumArray. NumArray was a replacement for Numeric, with more sophisticated querying and support for more expanded data types. But I saw it as a problem because SciPy worked only with Numeric — and people were starting to write libraries that worked only with NumArray. There was a library, called ndimage, that did image processing. And I liked image processing — that was a big part of my graduate research, and it worked only with NumArray.\n\nSo I saw this divided community. That’s what prompted me to spend a year writing NumPy: I wanted to merge NumArray and Numeric together, to make it easier for this fledgling ecosystem of scientists using Python. I needed to help myself, too, because I was also a user.\n\nWhat were some key innovations?\n\nLooking back on my work on NumPy, a few things stick out as really compelling. First, it was a blend of two array structures. And there was a whole lot of backward-compatibility work to make sure that every NumArray user and every Numeric user could still use NumPy, without having to make a lot of changes to their code.\n\nAnother innovation involves ‘typing’. Python uses ‘dynamic typing’, in which variables can be attached to different types of object. For instance, a variable can refer first to an integer but then be reassigned to a string of text. But each object itself has a definitive type. The innovation in NumPy was related to what is contained in the array. I introduced the concept of the data type, or dtype, which defines the type of thing inside the array — is it a 32-bit float? An 8-bit integer? It’s the detail of what the bits are inside the array.\n\nAnother breakthrough was the universal function, or how to perform operations on two arrays that are not the same shape. For example, it’s very easy to understand what to do if you have a 3 × 3 array and you want to add to another 3 × 3 array: just add each element. But what if I have a 1 × 3 array, and I want to add it to a 3 × 3 array — what do I do there? There’s something called broadcasting, in which you assume the 1 × 3 array is actually 3 × 3, and you just add them elementwise. NumPy exposed the broadcasting algorithm in such a way that anybody could build on it.\n\nHow has NumPy changed over 20 years?\n\nThe changes have been slow. And it’s a trade-off for success, actually. When nobody is adopting your library, you have all kinds of room to change it quickly. Once people start adopting it at scale, it’s really hard to make changes without creating a lot of disruption. So, you have to create a process for that. It’s expensive, actually.\n\nFor me, one question has been a big motivator: how do we pay for this? How do we create companies and alignment approaches that allow open-source software to be funded, developed, sustained, supported and innovated on?\n\nSo that’s how open source has taken me on a journey from scientist to software developer to chief executive to venture capitalist. It’s all tied to NumPy — NumPy has been a driving force for my whole life, actually. And I still feel very much a part of it.\n\nIn 2018, I created Quansight, a Python-focused consulting firm in Austin, and Quansight Labs, the firm’s public-benefit division, followed in 2019. And Ralf Gommers, a central maintainer of NumPy and SciPy, helped to do that. He just became the co-chief-executive of Quansight Public Benefit Corporation (formerly Quansight Labs), along with Tania Allard. Quansight now has people who work on NumPy, SciPy, Python and the rest of the ecosystem, funded by grants, customer projects and investment revenue.\n\nI'm very proud of Quansight because I left academia in 2007 to get into entrepreneurship and to work out how to fund NumPy and SciPy, and I now have a company that actually pays people to work on the products. It just took me a little while. I don’t know whether that means that I’m not very good at it, but it’s definitely passion driven.\n\nWhere does NumPy fall short?\n\nI would say there’s two things that NumPy didn’t add early enough to really be the fundamental ground on which everybody built their AI models. First, it didn’t support graphics processing units (GPUs). It worked on central processing units (CPUs), but modern machine learning and deep learning rely on GPUs for training. The shift to GPUs led to modern breakthroughs in the field; it’s why NVIDIA, a tech company in Santa Clara, California, that makes GPUs, is doing so well. The machine-learning libraries PyTorch and TensorFlow worked with GPUs from the beginning. But NumPy does not use GPUs natively, and that’s a big thing that’s caused it not to be as useful as it could have been.",

          "title": "AI is dreaming up millions of new materials. Are they any good?",
          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "When the pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) firm Google DeepMind announced almost two years ago that it had used a deep-learning AI technique to discover 2.2 million new crystalline materials, it seemed to herald a thrilling new era of accelerated materials research1.\n\nComposed of elements from across the periodic table, the materials in the trove included 52,000 simulations of layered compounds similar to the wonder material graphene, 528 potential lithium-ion conductors that might be used to improve rechargeable batteries, and much more.\n\nResearchers built an ‘AI Scientist’ — what can it do?\n\nBut the effort — and similar ones that followed, involving the technology firms Microsoft and Meta — quickly came under fire from researchers who say that some of the compounds that the AI systems dreamed up were unoriginal, unfeasible or not fit for purpose.\n\n“We found quite a lot of things that were ridiculous,” says materials scientist Anthony Cheetham at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), after looking through DeepMind’s list of hypothetical crystals. He and his UCSB colleague Ram Seshadri note that more than 18,000 of the compounds predicted by the project include extremely scarce radioactive elements such as promethium and protactinium, which they doubt could ever be useful materials2. “It’s one thing to discover a compound, and a totally different thing to discover a new functional material,” says Cheetham.\n\nWork involving Meta suggested more than 100 materials that might capture carbon dioxide directly from the air and help to reduce global warming3. However, these provoked similar criticism. Computational chemist Berend Smit at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) says that the candidates are not viable for that purpose. He suggests that the AI tool used in the work seemed so exciting that the authors were “a little bit blinded to the reality”.\n\nSo will AI really revolutionize materials discovery, or is it drowning in its own hype? Since the initial criticisms, materials scientists have examined the results from these firms in more detail to assess the true potential of AI. The teams behind the work have responded, in some cases toning down the initial claims or proposing workarounds. Many researchers conclude that AI holds great promise in materials science, but that more collaboration with experimental chemists — and some humility about the current limitations of these systems — will be crucial for realizing their full potential.\n\nCrystal balls\n\nFrom the mixture of copper and tin that sparked the Bronze Age to the invention of stainless steel, the discovery of materials has driven innovation throughout human history. In the past decade, the use of AI in materials science has taken off (see ‘AI’s material growth’). Many of the latest efforts, which use AI to speed up the discovery of materials, focus on crystalline inorganic solids, a subset of chemical compounds that are essential components of countless technologies, from semiconductors to lasers.\n\nSource: Scopus\n\nThe properties of crystalline inorganic solids are determined not only by the atoms they contain, but also by how those atoms are arranged in repeating patterns. So when scientists plan to make new inorganic crystals, they don’t just come up with fresh combinations of atoms — they often try to predict what structure those atoms might adopt.\n\nBefore the advent of AI, researchers used more-conventional computational methods to do so. One of the most powerful methods is density functional theory (DFT), a way to approximate the complicated mathematics that describes how electrons behave in materials. For a hypothetical inorganic compound, this can reveal which structure is the most stable — and therefore most likely to exist — as well as the compound’s properties.\n\nScientists have used DFT to predict new materials that have spectacular properties and that went on to be made in the lab — including super-strong magnets and ‘superconductors’ that transmit electricity without resistance but, unlike most superconducting materials, don’t require extremely cold temperatures4. The Materials Project, at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California, has recorded DFT-calculated structures for roughly 200,000 crystals in an open-access database5.\n\nBut DFT is computationally hungry. Most academic labs can access enough computing power to run DFT calculations on a handful of compounds, but surveying millions at a time would be unfeasibly expensive.\n\nGoogle AI and robots join forces to build new materials\n\nThat’s where the high-profile AI efforts come in. In the case of DeepMind, rather than relying solely on intensive DFT calculations, the London firm fed a machine-learning algorithm the results of calculations that had already been recorded by, for example, the Materials Project. The algorithm, which the team called graph networks for materials exploration, or GNoME, learnt from these examples how to predict the stability of randomly generated crystal structures, and did so much faster than conventional DFT does. The system then checked the most promising of these predictions using DFT and poured the results back into GNoME to improve its performance. That ultimately enabled GNoME to dream up an enormous collection of compounds that it expects to be stable1.\n\n“I’m completely convinced that if you’re not using these kinds of method within the next couple of years, you’ll be behind,” says materials scientist Kristin Persson at LBNL and the University of California, Berkeley, who is the director of the Materials Project.\n\nIn another effort involving DeepMind researchers, AI has also been used to help synthesize materials. Persson co-wrote a paper6, published alongside the GNoMe results, which described the robotic ‘A-Lab’. The system was fed tens of thousands of published papers describing how to make various inorganic compounds. It learnt to devise recipes for synthesizing a list of target compounds that had not been made before but for which structures had been predicted by DFT and logged by the Materials Project. A-Lab then deployed physical robots to make those compounds and analyse the products to check that they match the targets, tweaking the recipes if necessary.\n\nShortly after the GNoME and A-Lab teams published their papers, Microsoft unveiled its own AI tool for materials discovery7. Like GNoME, MatterGen is a machine-learning model that has been trained to generate stable crystal structures. But MatterGen was designed to be more targeted than GNoME: it is able to suggest hypothetical materials that have specific properties. “You can directly generate the crystals that satisfy your design criteria,” says Tian Xie, a researcher at Microsoft Research AI for Science in Cambridge, UK, who led the effort. “This is much more efficient than using brute force to create millions of candidates.”\n\nThe project involving Meta is even more targeted. The firm’s Fundamental AI Research team worked with scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, to identify porous materials called metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) that might efficiently suck CO2 directly from the air.\n\nThe researchers used DFT to calculate the ability of more than 8,000 experimentally reported MOFs to bind to CO2. Then, they used those results to train an AI model to perform the same task, and showed that it offered similar accuracy and was much faster than DFT. In a May 2024 paper3, the researchers predicted that more than 100 of these MOFs contained regions that would strongly bind to CO2, offering proof of principle that AI tools could accelerate the development of MOFs for direct air capture.\n\nOut of order\n\nBut all of these forays have engendered controversy. When solid-state chemist Robert Palgrave at University College London looked at the A-Lab results, he quickly concluded that the project had mischaracterized some of the 41 inorganic compounds that it claimed to have produced, and in some cases had synthesized materials that had already been made. Palgrave has since produced a more extensive critique of A-Lab’s work, in collaboration with Leslie Schoop at Princeton University in New Jersey and others, in which they detail shortfalls in the characterization of the products and conclude that no new materials were discovered in the A-Lab paper8.\n\nThey also identify a more fundamental problem, rooted in the limitations of the DFT technique that supplied A-Lab with its target structures. Palgrave notes that the DFT method usually predicts highly ordered crystal structures, which might be stable only if temperatures could plunge to the limit of absolute zero (–273 °C). But in reality, the arrangements of atoms in crystalline materials are often much messier. Although many of the ordered DFT structures that A-Lab was told to make seemed new, they had, in fact, been made before as disordered structures — and it was those known, disordered forms that A-Lab eventually made, says Palgrave.\n\nGerbrand Ceder, who is at LBNL and the University of California, Berkeley, and co-led the A-Lab work, disagrees. He says that a detailed reanalysis by researchers showed that A-Lab’s characterizations were reliable. “A-Lab made the compounds that it claimed it made, and for which it had no synthesis information,” he says. “Making disordered versions of predicted ordered compounds is typically characterized as a success, and the standard in comparing theory predictions and experiments,” he adds.\n\nThe A-Lab project deployed robots to make new compounds using recipes devised by AI.Credit: Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley Lab\n\nThe disorder issue also affects AI-based DFT surrogates such as GNoME, says Johannes Margraf, a computational chemist at the University of Bayreuth in Germany. Together with colleagues, he trained a machine-learning system on crystal structures that have been determined by experimental measurement, rather than DFT. The model learnt to forecast whether a compound is likely to be disordered owing to similar elements swapping places in a crystal9. It suggested that of about 380,000 stable compounds that the DeepMind team highlighted as promising targets for synthesis — all with apparently ordered crystal structures — 80–84% would be disordered in real life.\n\nThis finding implies that many of GNoME’s suggestions are unlikely to be realized in the lab, at least in their ordered forms, and might have different properties from those predicted. AI models trained on DFT data can also miss potentially useful properties that arise from a structure’s disorder, which the models don’t account for, says Margraf. “If you ignore the presence of disorder, you can have both false negatives and false positives,” he says. “It’s not a small detail.”\n\nRobot chemist sparks row with claim it created new materials\n\nMaterials scientist Ekin Dogus Cubuk, one of the lead authors of the GNoME paper1 who has now left DeepMind to found the start-up company Periodic Labs in California, accepts that many of the ordered structures predicted by GNoME will probably turn out to be disordered. He says that the tool’s main purpose is to provide a signpost towards promising compounds that require further investigation. “It’s not like somebody can just simulate a material and it just becomes an incredible product.”\n\nSome, however, were riled by DeepMind’s suggestion in their paper1 that they had achieved “an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity”, which sounded too good to be true. “It was kind of a red rag to a bull,” says Cheetham. “Our hackles were raised.”\n\nMachine-learning engineer Jonathan Godwin, who worked for DeepMind before leaving in 2022 to found his own AI-materials firm, Orbital Materials in London, agrees: “It’s pretty implausible to say that 2.2 million things you haven’t synthesized are new materials.”\n\nA DeepMind spokesperson points out that more than 700 of the compounds GNoME predicted were independently made by other researchers, and that GNoME structures helped to guide the synthesis of several previously unknown caesium-based compounds that might be of interest for applications such as optoelectronics and energy storage10.\n\nNot actually new",

But the majority of large-scale longitudinal research has historically taken place in Europe or North America, meaning many populations remain under-represented in the data.\n\nA new generation of longitudinal studies is aiming to better reflect population diversity — not just by recruiting from underserved groups, but by embedding community involvement, local scientific leadership and context-specific questions into their design. This article is one of a series of three profiles about studies taking this approach.\n\nWhen John Chambers first shared his genetic studies on Asian populations in London two decades ago, they were scientifically accepted but the international response was muted. “They weren’t always taken seriously,” Chambers, a cardiovascular epidemiologist recalls, “partly because they focused on a small migrant group in London. And that’s not where most Asians live.”\n\nOne of those early studies, published in 20141, analysed the full genetic sequence of more than 300 South Asians and revealed millions of previously undocumented genetic variants. It helped show why South Asians are more vulnerable to conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. However, it had become clear to Chambers, who was based at Imperial College London at the time, that the research needed to be rooted in Asia, to fully capture the region’s cultural, behavioural and genetic diversity.\n\nIn 2015 he got a call from James Best, then the dean of the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, which was at the beginning of a collaboration with Imperial and Singapore’s National Healthcare Group to create a state-of-the-art cohort study. Best wanted Chambers involved as one of the six principal investigators.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\nIt marked the start of an ambitious longitudinal population cohort study called Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS). Since it began in 2018, HELIOS has recruited 10,004 people across Singapore’s three main ethnic groups — Chinese, Malay and Indian — and is collecting an unusually rich set of biological, clinical, behavioural and environmental data. The goal is to understand why Asian populations face such high rates of chronic disease, and how prevention, diagnosis and treatment can be improved.\n\n“Cardiovascular mortality has dropped dramatically in the US and Europe over the past two decades,” says Chambers, who is now based at NTU. “But in Asia it’s gone the other way.”\n\nThere are around 296 million people in Asia with diabetes, more than half the estimated 589 million adults around the world with the condition. Cardiovascular disease deaths in Asia rose by 93% from 5.6 million in 1990 to 10.8 million in 2019, whereas the population only increased by 45%. Despite these trends, people of Asian ancestry remain under-represented in global biomedical studies.\n\nAs Singapore’s population grows older and chronic disease rates rise, the need for well-designed, long-term health studies has grown. By 2030, one in four Singaporean citizens will be aged 65 or older, and already around one in three adults has high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n\nAnurag Agrawal, dean of biosciences and health research at Ashoka University in Sonipat, India, says that large, long-term health studies that collect detailed biological and lifestyle data, such as HELIOS, are key to closing this gap. “They are some of the richest sources of information from which biological insights can be gleaned and it is critical that people of the south and southeast Asian regions be represented,” he says. It is particularly important as artificial intelligence becomes “the language of biology”, he adds, with growing use of machine learning to analyse biological data, detect patterns and guide health-care decisions.\n\nKey facts: Health for Life in Singapore\n\nStudy name: Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS).\n\nLead institutions: Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. Partner institutions: Imperial College London, Singapore’s National Healthcare Group.\n\nParticipant goal: 10,000 adults aged 30–84 across Chinese, Malay and Indian groups.\n\nData collected: Imaging, biosamples (blood, urine, saliva, stool, skin), physical tests and validated questionnaires on lifestyle, diet, mental health and cognition. Includes genomic and metabolomic profiling.\n\nLaunch year: 2018\n\nDuration: Long term; now part of SG100K, Singapore’s national precision-medicine programme.\n\nFunding: Part of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine programme, which has committed S$114 million so far.\n\nThe HELIOS participants, aged 30 to 84, undergo extensive baseline phenotyping, including bone-density scans, retinal imaging, electrocardiograms and testing for lung function and physical fitness. They provide blood, urine, saliva, stool and skin cell samples. They also complete detailed lifestyle, dietary and mental-health questionnaires, all validated in local languages. This is all taken over three to four hours, as participants move through 11 dedicated stations, each focused on a different aspect of health.\n\nIt sounds onerous but HELIOS has budding participants lining the block, keen to receive a comprehensive analysis of their health that dedicated doctors will assess. Participants will be contacted if previously unknown health issues surface in the results. “At one point the waiting list was 12 months,” Chambers laughs. “It’s been an amazing success.”\n\nData from the study are already revealing health disparities among ethnic groups2. Indian and Malay participants show higher rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and anxiety symptoms than Chinese participants, despite reporting higher physical activity and, in some cases, better diet quality. “A huge global conundrum is why South Asians have a higher risk of diabetes than Europeans,” Chambers says. “What’s often not appreciated is those same disparities exist even within Asian populations.”\n\nThe detail of the HELIOS study means that researchers can build an in-depth picture of participants. It combines whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variation, RNA sequencing to capture gene activity, and metabolomic profiling to measure compounds in the blood related to diet and disease. These data are linked to national health records — including laboratory tests, prescriptions and clinical diagnoses — providing researchers with a long-term view of each participant’s health across multiple systems.\n\n“This is a step change in how we assess diet and health,” Chambers says. Most studies rely on asking participants to recall how often, or what, they ate “but let’s be honest, most people can’t remember what they ate yesterday”. Instead, HELIOS uses what’s known as plasma phenotyping: analysing chemical markers in the blood to identify diet-related biological patterns without relying on self-reporting. It “lets us identify dietary phenotypes objectively, at scale, across hundreds of thousands of samples”, Chambers says.\n\nA recent analysis3 used data from HELIOS to identify a genetic variant that alters the levels of a coenzyme involved in removing cholesterol from the blood stream, reducing the efficiency of cholesterol transport, and which is common in Asians but rare or absent in other populations, he says. “That’s why its effect is so much more visible in our cohort.” It’s exactly the kind of region-specific insight HELIOS was built to reveal, and a reminder of why diverse representation in biomedical research matters.\n\nJimmy Lee Chee Keong, one of the six principal investigators on HELIOS, and a psychiatrist in the National Healthcare Group, says that at the project’s conception both academic and health-care leaders were thinking about “how to drive the health insights of the future”.",

Credit: Diana Bagnoli/Getty\n\nScientists moved a step closer to understanding the complex causes of autism spectrum disorder this week. Although all of the headlines went to US President Donald Trump’s poorly evidenced statements that the painkiller acetaminophen is linked to the neurodevelopmental condition, his White House autism event brought welcome — and largely overlooked — news to scientists: the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is investing US$50 million in an unusual autism-research effort.\n\nTrump and Jayanta Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, announced on 22 September that 13 research groups will receive funding under the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI), a Trump-administration programme to fund studies that explore how interacting genetic and environmental factors contribute to autism. “This is where the field needs to be going in searching for the complex causes of autism,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, who studies autism at Boston University, Massachusetts.\n\nTrump team backs an unproven drug for autism — but does it work?\n\nThe funded projects range from studies on environmental exposures during pregnancy to experiments on brain cells. Funding was also awarded to efforts to replicate the projects’ results and so ensure that they are robust.\n\nResearchers, although pleased by the aims of the funded work and the rigour of the methods, have some concerns about the project. Several ADSI-funding recipients say that they are expected to complete their projects relatively quickly — within three years instead of the usual five — and some say that they are alert to political interference with their results. Trump prompted fierce pushback from scientists with his statements about acetaminophen — also known as paracetamol — earlier this week, given the lack of convincing evidence to support a link with autism. “We should wait until the research happens before announcing an answer,” says Jason Stein, a neuroscientist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who received an ADSI grant.\n\n“This is not political interference, but rather a bold, science-driven effort to deliver meaningful answers more quickly,” said a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS), which oversees the NIH.\n\nQuick turnaround\n\nThe NIH announced the ADSI in May and invited researchers to submit grant applications for research into the causes of autism, its growing prevalence and potential interventions. Some researchers expressed concern that applicants had only a month to submit proposals — much less time than usual — and it was unclear who was reviewing the grants and with what criteria. Some worried that the funding would be channelled to researching the discredited idea promoted by Trump’s health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr that vaccines are linked to autism. “Some people thought: maybe we should steer clear of this,” says Judith Miller, a psychologist who studies autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania\n\nIn the end, nearly 250 research teams applied, and no awards were granted to projects that focus explictly on autism and vaccines.\n\nSeveral of the projects will involve exposomics: the study of the array of environmental factors to which a person is exposed. Miller is leading a three-year, $4.3-million project combining genome and exposome data to seek factors associated with autism. The project will draw on previously collected data on more than 100,000 children, including about 4,000 autistic children, and connect those to maternal-health records. The research team plans to use information on where participants live to add in data on air quality, access to green spaces and other environmental markers. “We haven’t been able to bring this type of data all together in a clinical population” before, Miller says.\n\nReplication requirement\n\nStein and his team, by contrast, are examining autism using brain organoids grown from the stem cells of autistic and non-autistic children. The researchers plan to expose the tissue to substances that epidemiological studies have linked to autism — such as valproic acid, a drug used to treat epilepsy — and examine how this affects gene activity.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?",

          "abstract": "Engineer John Logie Baird used ventriloquist dummies in early experiments of his invention: the television.Credit: Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty\n\nLong before modern technology, the principle of the common good existed. It was not born with society itself, but later, with an awareness that if it were neglected, a society might collapse.\n\nPrinciples that promote social cohesion and well-being are found in most cultures. Early examples include the millennia-old Code of Hammurabi, which punished certain liars with a humiliating haircut1, and ancient Biblical law, which required landowners to leave part of their harvest for orphans, widows, foreigners and poor people.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nThe real difficulty has been recognizing the boundaries that humans tend to draw when applying such codes. Do we include others, or only our species, culture, country or family? That ambiguity is where the problems begin.\n\nLack of commitment to the common good is evident in many of today’s challenges — conflict, inequality, humanitarian crises and environmental degradation. And now, it clearly extends beyond the physical world, to the digital universe, in which people spend an ever-growing portion of their lives.\n\nIt’s a good time to take stock, 100 years after inventor John Logie Baird successfully transmitted human faces through television, paving the way for today’s countless streams of online content, shaped by algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAre we, as a society, ensuring that communication technologies preserve the common good, or at least do not harm it? I think we’re not, but we should. Here, I set out a manifesto calling for algorithms to be designed and used with the common good in mind.\n\nNew media, old problem\n\nIn the twentieth century, television stood out as one of the main technologies shaping people’s perception of reality. People nowadays associate the word ‘television’ with the device, but when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi first used the term in 1900, he was naming a broader idea: the transmission of images at a distance2.\n\nBuilding on that concept, the world of images that now surrounds us — from streaming to social media — can be considered as just one more evolution of television. Technological progress is clear, but social progress is stagnant.\n\nA man’s face transmitted in a public demonstration of television in 1926.Credit: Ann Ronan Pictures/Print Collector/Getty\n\nIn the early days of television, despite the many private interests surrounding it, there were concrete efforts, in several regions at least, to steer it towards the common good. Broadcasts were guided by principles such as public interest and public service.\n\nNow, however, these pursuits are increasingly being held hostage to algorithms, AI and a handful of private companies (legitimately driven by self-interest and profit). In many ways, this is far from what people experienced in the past century. Yet the pursuit of the common good must remain. After all — and this is not mere rhetoric — our future depends on it.\n\nFortunately, we have acquired a century of learning.\n\nThe great rewiring: is social media really behind an epidemic of teenage mental illness?\n\nThe habit of seeing images from afar is not new — it has been part of humanity since the first expressions of imagination and storytelling. Fireside stories and artworks in ancient times, for example, reveal not only the earliest seeds of television — in images conjured by the imagination — but also their dual potential. They either served the public by reinforcing social values and creating shared references, or they neglected that role in favour of private interests, by fostering exclusion or spreading misinformation.\n\nTelevision, and what followed, merely technologized this practice. On 2 October 1925, Baird reported a symbolic moment. He transmitted, in greyscale, the recognizable image of a face — first, a dummy’s head, and then the face of a young man called William Taynton. This was the first time that such a feat had been achieved3.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1960, television technology consolidated and acquired a social dimension. As more people used it, concerns arose about its role. Two models emerged, which shaped the evolution of television around the world, and drew on principles already established for radio, such as the BBC Royal Charter and the US Radio Act of 1927.\n\nThe public-service model — focused on citizens — aims to always promote social cohesion and well-being. This model was favoured in the United Kingdom, and still drives the ethos of the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation).\n\nCrowds gathered to watch the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969 on large television screens. Credit: CBS Photo Archive/Getty\n\nThe commercial model — focused on profit — aims not to compromise those values in the pursuit of gain. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) pioneered this service in the United States. Even using the commercial model, working for the common good cannot be ignored. Because these companies operate inside society, they are also expected to act in the public interest.\n\nThe lesson is this: it is up to society to ensure, through regulation, not only that the main players shaping our digital landscape do no harm, but also that they ‘pay back’ for occupying social space, through concrete actions in favour of the common good, at a local or global scale.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1990, the television set became one of the most influential objects in the world. A common idea of global reality began to take hold through mass audiences that watched global events, such as the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing and news reports from the Vietnam War. Yet, as the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO warned in a 1980 report4, the vision people got was sometimes incomplete, filtered by the producing countries. Although controversial then, from today’s perspective, this criticism seems less like calling out censorship and more like a plea for fairness.\n\nWhy we need mandatory safeguards for emotionally responsive AI\n\nA further lesson can be drawn: a freer, more globally connected and technologically dependent world must not seek to homogenize everything and everyone, but to ensure that all differences are seen, respected and heard.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, the generalist logic of television, in which large mixed audiences receive the same programming, was increasingly replaced by diverse and specialized interests in production and consumption — a trend that was tremendously amplified by the popularization of the Internet. It was the start of the transition to our current world, which is awash with information. Yet, as UNESCO also noted in 20055, one challenge was to ensure that all this information was not only accessible and respectful of freedom of expression, but also transformed into knowledge that benefited people and societies.\n\nToday, this remains a crucial challenge. Free access to the digital ecosystem and all that it offers is not enough. It is equally essential to ensure that its use serves the good of both the individual and the collective.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2025, users of smartphones and people with Internet access have increasingly shaped the media. To enhance that experience, other protagonists entered the scene, notably social-media algorithms and AI tools. Ideas, generality and predictability gradually gave way to emotion, personalization and randomness. The sense of community shifted: it no longer depends so much on physical space, but on shared interests, habits and online content.\n\nThe digital world is no longer separate from everyday life — it is officially part of it, with access required for schools, public services, banking and work. That changes everything. As UNESCO reminded us in 2023, respect for human rights must be the fuel of the digital world, not left at the doorstep6.\n\nThe concern of a century ago is not so different from now: to give social and democratic meaning to the images that surround us. In the past, those images were shaped by human hands. Today, non-human agents have entered the scene, filtering, organizing and directing much of what we see, read and hear.\n\nWe need a new ethics for a world of AI agents\n\nAt this stage, the most important question might no longer be: where is technological progress heading? Rather, after all this technological advancement, where does social and democratic progress stand? Is the idea of public service still included in social media and AI today?",

We identified 7,469 (1.39 per 1,000 person-years) suicide attempts among mothers and 8,338 (1.62 per 1,000 person-years) among fathers. Compared with the corresponding week in the preconception period, mothers had a lower risk of suicide attempt during and after pregnancy (with the lowest IRR of 0.14 (0.11–0.17) at first week postpartum); fathers’ risk of suicide attempt remained largely stable before childbirth, but a lower risk was observed during the first 10 postpartum weeks (IRRs ranging from 0.69 (0.58–0.81) to 0.91 (0.84–0.99)), followed by a higher risk in the later postpartum period (IRRs ranging from 1.10 (1.01–1.21) to 1.72 (1.33–2.24)). Compared with fathers, mothers had a lower risk of suicide attempt during and after pregnancy (for example, IRR of 0.22 (0.18–0.28) at first week postpartum).

The cultural logic of ‘honour’ is frequently studied in relation to conflict, but its role in competition and cooperation remains underexplored. The current study investigates how perceived normative and personally endorsed honour values predict competition and cooperation behaviours. In an online experiment testing preregistered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

          "abstract": "Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena. Yet in practice, prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, and even as prizes proliferate, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic’s historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners’ papers become more innovative than their matched peers. This difference widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to nonprizewinners, prizewinners’ collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The findings’ implications for innovation in science and the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.",

Recognizing nature’s diverse values in decisions is a fundamental lever for sustainability transformation. While economic valuation of nature has a long history, it has struggled to recognize the full suite of nature’s values, particularly the broad, relational, intrinsic, and shared values reflecting the complexity of human–nature relationships. We explore opportunities to expand the consideration of values within the economics of biodiversity by reviewing conventional and heterodox economic approaches. We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames. Our perspective transcends the dominant economic framing of nature as a passive, largely substitutable asset, to also consider nature as place, self, and harboring agency. This helps to overcome the limitations of conventional economic assumptions, better reflects peoples’ lived experiences, and supports transformations toward more just and sustainable futures.",

          "authors": "Shijia Peng, Aaron M. Ellison, Charles C. Davis",
          "abstract": "Climate change is altering the timing of species’ life-cycle events (i.e., phenology), but the rates of phenological shifts vary across taxa. These mismatches in phenological response may disrupt interactions between interdependent species, such as plants and their pollinators, which may lead to reduced plant reproduction via pollen limitation and thus contribute to secondary extinction risks for plants. However, secondary extinction risk is rarely assessed under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we used ca. 15,000 crowdsourced specimen records of Viola species and their solitary bee pollinators, spanning 120 y across the eastern United States, and integrated climate data, phenological information, and species distribution models to quantify the risk of secondary plant extinction associated with phenological mismatch with their bee pollinators. We further examined geographical patterns in secondary extinction risk for plants and explored how their interactions between plants and generalist versus specialist pollinators influence such risk. Secondary local extinction risk of Viola spp. increases with latitude, indicating that future climate change will pose a greater threat to plant–bee pollinator networks at northern latitudes. Additionally, the sensitivity of secondary local extinction risk to phenological mismatch with both generalist and specialist bee pollinators varies by latitude, with specialist bees showing a sharper decline at higher latitudes. Our findings demonstrate that existing conservation priorities based solely on primary extinction risk directly caused by climate change may be insufficient to support self-sustaining populations of plants. Thus, incorporating secondary extinction risk resulting from ecological mismatches between plants and pollinators into future global conservation frameworks should be carefully considered.",

          "abstract": "Modularity among traits is thought to drive morphological evolution and diversification, with more modular species often showing greater morphological disparity and faster evolutionary rates. However, recent studies suggest this pattern is not universal, as higher integration can sometimes be linked to faster rates of evolution. In adaptive radiation, modularity likely facilitates morphological divergence, but its specific role in trait diversification within these events remains uncertain. Antarctic icefishes (Perciformes: Notothenioidei) have undergone adaptive radiation in the frigid Southern Ocean, yet the role of modularity in their craniofacial evolution remains poorly understood. Emerging from a common ancestor 22 Mya, these fishes developed unique morpho-physiological adaptations, such as antifreeze glycoproteins, that contributed to their evolutionary success, but the contribution of cranial modularity to their diversification is still unexplored. Here, we analyze skull shape across 172 perciform species using micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to investigate the tempo and mode of skull evolution in 80 notothenioids versus 92 perciform relatives. Notothenioids exhibit considerable cranial shape diversity, with skull shapes ranging from short to long faces. Fast rates of skull shape evolution occurred in smaller subclades following the emergence of cranial elongation, a derived trait within notothenioids. They also exhibit elevated evolutionary modularity relative to their perciform relatives, with reduced covariation among skeletal elements over time, likely corresponding with Miocene cooling events and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We propose that greater phenotypic modularity in notothenioid skulls represents a pivotal innovation, facilitating their evolutionary response to new ecological opportunities in the Antarctic.",

Our findings show that neuronal activity is often influenced by multiple biophysical model parameters, in a nonadditive (i.e. synergistic) fashion.

The MEPAN mouse recapitulates the major hallmarks of MEPAN, including a movement disorder, optic neuropathy, defects in protein lipoylation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the brain. MECR catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), and the mechanism by which loss of mtFASII leads to neurological disease is unknown. LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of Mecr mutant cerebella identified loss of subunits of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and subunits of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) complex. Native gels revealed altered OXPHOS complex and supercomplex formation and changes in binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to mitochondrial complexes. These results demonstrate that MECR plays a key role in the acylation of ACP which is necessary for ACP-LYRM-mediated supercomplex modulation and ISC biogenesis and suggest unique pathways for therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Diverse factors, including environmental features and cognitive processes, can drive animals’ movements and space use, with far-reaching implications. For example, repeated use of individual-level travel routeways (directionally constrained but imperfectly aligned routes), which results in spatial concentration of activity, can shape encounter-based processes including predation, mate finding, and disease transmission. However, how much variation in routeway usage exists across species remains unknown. By analyzing GPS movement tracks for 1,239 range-resident mammalian carnivores—representing 16 canid and 18 felid species from six continents—we found strong evidence of a clade-level difference in species’ reliance on repeatedly used travel routeways. Across the global dataset, tracked canids had a 15% (±7 CI) greater density of routeways within their home ranges than did felids, rising to 33% (±16 CI) greater in landscapes shared with tracked felids. Moreover, comparisons within species across landscapes revealed broadly similar home range routeway densities despite habitat differences. On average, canids also reused their travel routeways more intensively than did felids, with hunting strategies and spatial contexts also contributing to the intensity of routeway usage. Collectively, our results suggest that key aspects of carnivore routeway-usage have an evolutionary component. Striking interspecific and clade-level differences in carnivores’ reliance on reused travel routeways within home ranges identify important ways in which the movement patterns of real-world predators depart from classical assumptions of predator-prey theory. Because such departures can drive key aspects of human-wildlife interactions and other encounter-based processes, continued investigations of the relationships between movement mechanisms and space use are critical.",

          "abstract": "The ideal delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) to specific sites requires evading immune clearance and selectively binding target cells. Wrapping NPs in cell-derived membranes has shown promise in improving targeted delivery, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Protein corona (PC) formation on NPs can significantly alter their biological identity to influence biodistribution, making its characterization on membrane-wrapped NPs (MWNPs) and unwrapped NPs crucial. In this study, we compared MWNPs incorporating membranes derived from megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 cells, which can accumulate in bone marrow (BM) and preferentially bind hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with unwrapped NPs. We investigated differences in PC composition, macrophage uptake, target cell uptake, and biodistribution in wild type (WT) mice and knockout mice that have low or absent expression of different opsonin proteins. In vitro, MWNPs with a PC exhibited increased target cell uptake and decreased macrophage uptake compared to unwrapped NPs with a PC. Proteomics revealed apolipoprotein B as the dominant opsonin on both NP types after incubation in mouse, bovine, or human serum, with other proteins like complement, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins also being present. Biodistribution studies indicated a complex interplay between the PC and targeting/clearance, where complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G adsorption on MWNPs led to macrophage clearance but also enabled HSPC targeting. Meanwhile, apolipoprotein E adsorption facilitated hepatocyte clearance but reduced immune cell uptake in the liver. Future research on PCs could determine whether these mechanisms are generalizable to other types of MWNPs, potentially revealing strategies to enhance their effectiveness as delivery systems.",

          "abstract": "Canonical bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) detect cues by sensors with opposing kinase and phosphatase activities to alter the level of phosphorylation of cognate response regulators to mediate responses. We previously identified the Campylobacter jejuni BumSR TCS as the founding member of a bacterial TCS family in which the sensor solely functions as a phosphatase. Sensing specific intestinal metabolites inhibits BumS dephosphorylation of phospho-BumR (P-BumR) to impact BumR as a transcriptional regulator of genes influencing host colonization. Since BumS lacks kinase activity, BumR must depend upon a noncognate phosphodonor in the bacterium to form P-BumR. Through a genetic screen and selection, physiological assays, and biochemical analysis, we identified acetyl phosphate (AcP) and carbamoyl phosphate (CP) as natural in vivo phosphodonors for BumR. In C. jejuni , AcP and CP are products of metabolic pathways fueled by amino acids favored by the bacterium as carbon sources for growth. Producing and utilizing AcP and CP as bona fide BumR phosphodonors allows BumSR to integrate different types of inputs for signal transduction. Microbiota-generated gut metabolites are cues for BumS to control its phosphatase activity for P-BumR and inform about the spatial location of C. jejuni in host intestines. In contrast, AcP and CP are cues for BumR that directly influence P-BumR levels and activity and inform about the richness of favored carbon sources in intestinal niches for optimal energy generation and metabolism. Our study reveals how a bacterial TCS strategically integrates information from multiple cues through both essential components for optimal signal transduction.",

However, the potential of aGPCRs as targets for biologic therapeutics has not been extensively explored. CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells. We generated a panel of synthetic human antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of CD97, from which we identified an antibody that was efficiently internalized. This antibody binds to all isoforms of human CD97 but not to its close homolog, EMR2. Structure determination by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy revealed that this antibody targets the CD97 GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, whose presence is conserved in aGPCRs, through an unconventional binding mode where it extensively utilizes the light chain framework for antigen recognition. Screening of conjugation methods and payloads resulted in a stable ADC that effectively killed AML and GBM cell lines, as well as patient-derived GBM stem cells, with minimal cytotoxicity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting CD97, as well as the aGPCR GAIN domain in general, and uncovers a previously unrecognized surface that an antibody can utilize for antigen recognition.",

          "abstract": "Effective conservation genomics of endangered species requires realistic understanding of the fitness consequences caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in declining populations. We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution. By linking genotype to phenotype via advanced molecular biology tools in a non-model species of conservation concern, this study highlights the need to fully integrate genomics and molecular experimental approaches in modern conservation biology.",

Hippocampal area CA2, which processes social memory, also makes direct connections to CA1. However, the function of these connections is unknown. To test whether CA2-CA1 connections might facilitate the interaction of social and episodic memories, we used models of behaving mice and in vitro electrophysiology that allow prior activation of CA2 by either novel social interaction or electrical stimulation before inhibitory avoidance training or induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1. We show that social novelty promotes consolidation of CA1-associated memory, which was blocked by the selective chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting CA2 neurons. In both cases, CA2 priming was time-dependent, involved direct CA2-CA1 connections, increased expression of plasticity protein protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), and promoted associativity via synaptic tagging and capture. Taken together, CA2-CA1 connections can significantly impact CA1 plasticity and memory consolidation. The inclusion of CA2 into hippocampal circuitry and function broadens the role of the hippocampus as an integrative memory hub.",

          "abstract": "T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen among vastly outnumbering noncognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen–TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multithread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multithread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.",

Using multiple cell types including the human SupT1 T cell line and purified CD4 + T cells, we demonstrate that PLSCR1 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 with diverse tropisms and subtypes, as well as HIV-2 and SIV. Mechanistically, we find that PLSCR1 blocks viral entry and cell-to-cell transmission, in part by restricting HIV-1 virion–cell and cell–cell fusion without affecting CD4 or CXCR4 expression or virus binding to the cell surface. Collectively, these findings establish PLSCR1 as a broad-spectrum lentiviral restriction factor that acts at the membrane fusion stage, thereby expanding our understanding of ISG-mediated antiviral defense.",

Even more rare are empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to keep pace with environmental change. Here, we explore these connections by conducting an integrative study on the breeding range of the yellow warbler ( Setophaga petechia ). Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we first identify loci associated with variation in bill morphology and individual quality. We then employ gene–environment association (GEA) analyses and find that precipitation is a key environmental driver of putative selection on bill shape. Finally, we test whether contemporary individuals whose bill shapes deviate from the historical relationship with precipitation experience increased stress (measured by telomere length) as a result of maladaptation. We also use historical DNA to test whether local populations have shifted their ranges over the past century, confirming that the observed changes are not due to range shifts. Our results align with predictions from GWAS and GEA analyses, indicating that birds with shallower bills in increasingly arid regions suffer higher stress (i.e., shorter telomeres) because of maladaptation. Overall, this study links genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data with stress biomarkers to improve understanding of the process of local adaptation and the consequence of failing to keep pace with changing climate conditions.",

Here, we use FMAPB2 to precompute pair interaction energies and then use the latter to drive simulations of dense protein solutions. The resulting MAEPPI (many-protein atomistic energy from precomputed pair interaction) enables simulations of atomistic proteins at the speed of Lennard-Jones particles. On snapshots sampled from the simulations, we directly calculate the SAS profile. The results reveal artifacts generated by widely used spherical models and support a significant dimer population of bovine serum albumin at high concentrations.

Here, we provide a reference genome for the highly invasive fern Lygodium microphyllum and compare the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of its gametophyte and sporophyte life phases. Under ambient conditions, we found differential regulation and splicing of developmental genes (homeobox and MADS-box clades) may play a role in the genomic determination of the haploid and diploid life stages. We generated a base pair-resolution methylome of a fern gametophyte, and determined that methylation patterns are remarkably similar between vegetative tissues despite their morphological and functional differences. We further explored the physiological and transcriptomic responses of gametophytes and sporophytes to freezing stress, the most likely abiotic factor limiting further range expansion of this invasive species. While controlled by the same genome, we show that life phases and tissues use alternative molecular pathways in response to freezing and greater physiological resilience in the gametophyte life stage to this stressor. Our results underscore the need to incorporate both life phases when developing effective mitigation strategies, as differential responses to environmental stressors between phases reveal opportunities for management approaches (e.g., targeting gametophytes in addition to sporophytes).

High-speed optical imaging reveals brief flashes between charged bubbles, arising from strong electric fields at curved gas–liquid interfaces.

          "abstract": "Neuroscience has long relied on macaque studies to infer human brain function, yet identifying functionally corresponding brain regions across species and measurement modalities remains a fundamental challenge. This is especially true for the higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often nonhomologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a long-standing ambiguity by supporting a correspondence between macaque ML and human FFA and between AL and more anterior temporal cortex in humans. This result is consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.",

The evolutionary relationship between EmcB and other deubiquitinases is currently unknown. Here, we show that EmcB defines a broad family of bacterial deubiquitinases divergently evolved from the eukaryotic Ovarian Tumor (OTU) family of deubiquitinases. Our data indicate that the emcB gene has an internal gene rearrangement that resulted in a circular permutation of the OTU fold. Proteins with a region homologous to the deubiquitinase domain of EmcB were identified in numerous members of the bacterial order Legionellales. Proteins with an EmcB-related deubiquitinase domain demonstrated cysteine protease activity that cleaved ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related modifiers. Most of the bacteria encoding EmcB-related proteins had components of the Dot/Icm Type IVB secretion system that delivers EmcB into host cells. Indeed, many of these EmcB-related proteins were translocated into eukaryotic cells by the Dot/Icm system of Legionella pneumophila , consistent with their predicted roles as bacterial effector proteins that target host pathways. Comparison of EmcB family deubiquitinases revealed a two-domain architecture of EmcB comprising a deubiquitinase domain and a ubiquitin binding module that confers enzyme specificity for certain polyubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin binding region in EmcB was found to be necessary for efficient inhibition of RIG-I signaling. Thus, these EmcB-related proteins represent a large family of deubiquitinating enzymes that arose by divergent evolution in Legionellales , likely enabling these bacteria to infect different host cells by targeting signaling pathways regulated by ubiquitin.",

          "abstract": "One of the most fascinating mysteries in the field of origins of life concerns the driving force that led to the selection of today’s 20 universal L -alpha amino acids in biology. An essential aspect of life’s emergence involves the formation of compartments, which offer encapsulation for target molecules and provide protection from hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Thus, polymers capable of assembly may have had a chemical evolutionary advantage over polymers that lacked this ability. We postulated that primordial peptide assembly could be one of the driving forces that led to the chemical selection of alpha amino acids in life today. To test this hypothesis, we generated depsipeptides, oligomers composed of ester bonds and peptide bonds that form readily under mild drying conditions, as model prebiotic peptides. However, it is unknown whether depsipeptides form assemblies in an aqueous environment similarly to peptides and proteins. To test the hypothesis that depsipeptides with alpha backbones will form assemblies more readily than beta backbones, we synthesized depsipeptides using a matrix of eight alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and six alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids. The reaction products were analyzed by microscopy and a physical stability analyzer to study assembly formation as well as various analytical techniques for chemical analysis. Our results demonstrate assembly formation in depsipeptide systems containing hydrophobic hydroxy acids and indicate that depsipeptide assemblies containing alpha hydroxy acid backbones are significantly more stable than beta analogs. Overall, our results offer an assembly-driven mode of selection for the alpha backbone in present-day biology.",

Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU , impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes.

The turnover mechanisms are not fully understood and differ for two main mammalian paralogs—NM2A and NM2B—whereas paralog copolymerization adds complexity to this process by enabling the intrinsically fast NM2A to dynamize the intrinsically slow NM2B. Here, we show that the nonhelical tail, the C-terminal phosphorylation sites, and surprisingly, the motor domain of the NM2A heavy chain synergistically accelerate the turnover of NM2B in trans and cell motility, suggesting that these three mechanisms collectively control NM2A’s own dynamics. Conversely, the phosphomimetic NM2B tail facilitates only local turnover of endogenous wild type NM2B but not its global redistribution unless the NM2A motor is combined with the phosphomimetic NM2B tail.

These responses connect changes in heme homeostasis to mitochondrial function, including core metabolic processes such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as to enzymes involved in the control and storage of iron.

Pair feeding studies showed that neither the induction of FGF21 nor the hypothermia was secondary to decreased food intake. Notably, mice selectively lacking FGF21’s coreceptor protein, βKlotho, in noradrenergic neurons were also more susceptible to influenza virus infection, including hypothermia. We show that FGF21 acting on noradrenergic neurons, including those in the locus coeruleus region, stimulates energy expenditure and thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Our findings reveal an FGF21-regulated neuronal pathway that protects mice against influenza infection and suggest the potential utility of using FGF21 pharmacologically to improve outcomes after influenza infection.",

          "abstract": "Critical to our understanding of infections and their treatment is the role the innate immune system plays in controlling bacterial pathogens. Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this, we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show that i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality. Overall, our findings illustrate the utility of the G. mellonella model system in conjunction with established in vivo models in studying infectious disease progression and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), especially GII.4 strains, are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, yet no approved vaccines or antivirals exist. The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wild-type and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to nonclustering strains and outcompete nonclustering strains in replication assays exhibited by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and an HBGA nonbinding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in postattachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and nonclustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.",

Recycling REEs from industrial waste provides a sustainable alternative to mining, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impacts. The mainstay approaches for REE recovery, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods, can be inefficient, consuming high energy and generating large aqueous and acid waste streams. Here, we introduce flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl 2 ) as an efficient method for REE separation and recovery by capitalizing on the free energies of formation (ΔG form ) of the metal chlorides and the boiling points of those metal chlorides. FJH-Cl 2 enables high-purity (&gt;90%) and high-yield (&gt;90%) REE recovery from waste magnets in a single step. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis show that this process reduces the number of steps by 3× while reducing energy consumption by 87%, greenhouse gas emissions by 84%, and operating costs by 54% while eliminating water and acid use by 100% compared to traditional methods. This offers an environmentally friendly and economically viable pathway for sustainable REE recycling and recovery.",

In 2023, three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric DS candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a follow-up analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a DS interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic DS candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, with the former being the second most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify, in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, a tentative feature ( S / N ∼ 2 ) indicative of the smoking gun signature of DSs: the He II λ 1640 absorption line. In view of ALMA’s recent identification of a probable O III nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated DS is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations, it would imply a DS embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of DSs, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.",

Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of the apo BoDV-1 L-P complex, revealing a unique “mitten-shaped” architecture. The structure characterizes key domains involved in RNA synthesis, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, polyribonucleotidyltransferase, and an inactive methyltransferase domain. While no RNA or NTPs were visible, we observed distinct conformational states, showing large-scale rearrangements of the P tetramer and L domains, as well as remodeling of the RNA template, nucleoside triphosphates, and nascent RNA entrances and/or exits, upon introducing RNA and NTPs.

Through the use of FIB-SEM tomography, the electrode’s percolating fractal-like nano-carbon black network has been visualized at the nanoscale, providing insights into the theoretical energy storage capacity of this material. To reduce the required times for the production of functional electrodes, we also present a cast-in electrolyte approach, where centimeter-thick electrodes could be produced without the need for postcuring steps. In these prototypes, device performance scales linearly with electrode thickness and cell count, and a simple analytical model was developed to explain these scaling phenomena. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative ionic and organic electrolytes further contribute to improved electrochemical behavior, with the fabricated designs ultimately achieving a 10-fold increase in supercapacitor energy density compared to previous designs. Finally, we were able to fabricate a 12 V, 50 F supercapacitor module and a 9 V arch prototype that integrate energy storage into load-bearing architectural elements.

However, the regulatory mechanisms and functional consequences of newly identified lysine acylation modifications in cancer therapy remain to be elucidated. Here, we established diverse preclinical tumor models resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and focused on histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as it exhibited more pronounced alterations compared to other acylations. Next, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 as a key regulator responsible for the resistance-associated decrease in crotonylation levels. Furthermore, integrated crotonylomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling, supplemented by gene manipulation studies, revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance resulted from transcriptional suppression of HNF1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were regulated by reduced histone H3 lysine 56 crotonylation. Importantly, through pharmacological screening, we identified a histone decrotonylase inhibitor that enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity by activating epigenetic reprogramming through the selective upregulation of histone Kcr levels across multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism driven by crotonylation that contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, highlighting the potential of modulating crotonylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.",

Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green color. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris , develop as woven fibrillar structures, in contrast to the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibers, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue coloration. Our findings not only introduce a variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.",

Notably, a single-copy, highly conserved mitochondria-localized physiological gene underwent a significant duplication, resulting in one copy being recruited into the venom system and acquired cytotoxicity against wasps' hosts. Through this neofunctionalization process, we observed several key evolutionary changes, including loss of ancestral mitochondrial localization and enzyme activity, acquisition of a secretory signal peptide, shift in expression pattern, positive selection, and the establishment of evolutionary acquired protein–protein interactions.

We assessed associations between expression of neighbor proteins and driver mutation status, comparing both between and within cancer types. We further evaluated if neighbors were enriched in significant associations with multiple drivers and characterized the impact of neighbor expression on overall survival for all cancer types. We found a significant correlation between the number of driver associations (DA) a neighbor gene has and the number of sign-coherent survival associations, particularly for neighbors enriched in positive associations, where high neighbor expression correlated with increased driver mutations and poorer survival. We identified 119 neighbors enriched in positive DA with at least two unfavorable survival associations and 25 neighbors enriched in negative DA with at least two favorable survival associations.

This is a phylogenetically controlled quantitative synthesis to assess parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals across contrasting temperatures and precipitation. We found large variation in the effect of temperature on parasite prevalence, precipitation on parasite prevalence, and temperature on infection intensity. This provides robust quantitative evidence against the controversial “warmer sicker world” hypothesis. There was no effect of climate on parasitism, irrespective of whether the parasite was an endoparasite or ectoparasite, or across different parasite lifecycles. Although some host and parasite taxa were understudied, we found no consistent taxonomic patterns. Importantly, we revealed large gaps in the literature, including the relationship between humidity, prevalence, and infection intensity. Ectoparasites and reptile hosts were also very underrepresented, and deserve further study. Focusing future research on these gaps will help to confirm whether certain types of host–parasite interactions are more or less sensitive to changes in climate, with implications for conservation.",

Although hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social function, their respective contributions to the process of social pain empathy have not been systematically characterized. To address this, we employed a multimethod approach, combining naturalistic fMRI, functional decoding, gene expression analysis, and pharmacological modulation using intranasal administration of OXT (24 IU) or AVP (20 IU) in a cohort of 163 participants. Our findings indicated that both OXT and AVP significantly enhanced pain empathy compared to placebo, with overlapping yet distinct neurofunctional and genetic modulation patterns. Specially, both neuropeptides engaged a shared perception-cognition-emotion network, including frontal regions, the insula, superior temporal sulcus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Crucially, they exhibited divergent mechanistic profiles: OXT preferentially influenced resting-state connectivity and perceptional-visual processing areas, while AVP exerted stronger modulation on perceptional-execution circuits. These differential effects aligned with their unique receptor expression patterns and interactions with distinct genetic systems. By delineating how OXT and AVP shape the multidimensional nature of social pain empathy, our findings provide a neurobiological framework for understanding these processes and offer potential pathways for targeted interventions in social cognition disorders.",

          "abstract": "Antibodies that recognize the conserved prehairpin intermediate (PHI) of class I viral membrane-fusion proteins typically show limited neutralization and have not been considered promising therapeutic agents. We previously developed a bispecific antibody (bsAb), iMab/D5_AR, directed toward both the gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR) that is exposed within the HIV-1 PHI and toward CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells. CD4-binding led to prepositioning of the bsAb at the site of viral fusion, enhancing its neutralization potency and achieving 95% breadth (IC80 &lt; 5 μg/mL) against a panel of 119 pseudotyped, multiclade HIV-1 viruses. In the current study, we engineered a bsAb against NHR that also targets CCR5, one of two HIV-1 coreceptors on T cells. This optimized bsAb design further improves neutralization potency and achieves 100% neutralization breadth against the 119-member pseudotyped virus panel, including those resistant to CD4-binding iMab/D5_AR. Considering that nearly all initial HIV-1 infections occur via CCR5-tropic viruses, we expect our redesigned bsAb targeting CCR5 to be an effective prophylactic agent. These findings further support the rationale for pursuing the NHR as a therapeutic target for HIV-1 and lay the groundwork for a new class of engineered broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

As it is ubiquitous throughout zeolite generation and application, host–guest interaction between zeolite and water attracts broad interest, but mechanistic understanding remains fragmented. Here, advanced solid-state NMR techniques (2D 17 O SPAM-MQ, 27 Al{ 31 P} J -HMQC, 27 Al{ 29 Si} REDOR, and 1 H TQ-SQ NMR) combined with isotopic tracing and theoretical calculations determine water-induced octahedrally coordinated aluminum in silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves (SAPOs) as an exclusive product of Al(OP) 4 units coordinated with two water molecules—a structure distinct from that in aluminosilicates. Based on the knowledge of aluminum speciation, we elucidate four water interaction mechanisms in SAPOs, including Brønsted-acid interaction, coordination, reversible/irreversible hydrolysis, and capillary condensation. Contrary to conventional wisdom attributing SAPO degradation to Al-O-P hydrolysis, we clarify that desilication dominates structural collapse, establishing Si environments as catalyst durability descriptors. These mechanistic insights decipher the nature of SAPO interacting with water and its fundamental differences from aluminosilicate zeolite.",

However, the complete repertoire of cargoes and regulators associated with individual AP complexes remains poorly defined. Intriguingly, AP-4-mediated TGN export operates independently of clathrin, suggesting the involvement of uncharacterized accessory factors in vesicle biogenesis. To address these gaps, we developed an in vitro vesicle formation assay using wild-type HeLa cells or cells deficient in AP1γ1 or AP4ε, reconstituting their roles in packaging their known clients, Vangl2 and ATG9A, respectively. Coupling this assay with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, we mapped distinct cargo profiles for AP-1 (which buds from the TGN and ARF1-positive endosomes) and AP-4, identifying the 45 kDa calcium-binding protein (CAB45) as an AP-1-dependent cargo and the Type-1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) as an AP-4-dependent cargo. Additionally, we uncovered PRRC1 and WDR44 as cytosolic regulators essential for AP-4-mediated TGN export. Our study advances the mechanistic understanding of AP-1 and AP-4 in secretory trafficking and provides a robust strategy to systematically identify cargo clients and accessory factors for specific adaptor complexes.",

          "abstract": "With the learning from living protein polymerization in nature, achieving living/controlled supramolecular assembly of biopolymers such as proteins in vitro is a longstanding challenge for material design. Herein, we provide a thiol-regulated interfacial protein aggregation (TRIPA) for unfolded protein systems with typical living polymerization features. By triggering globule proteins into the unfolded state through a reversible exchange reaction of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl agents (R-SH), protein monomers are partially unfolded and assembled at the air–water/solid–water interface (AWI/SWI) through the entropy-driven adsorption and conformation transition. The process could be well repeated over time to form a two-dimensional (2D) nanofilm at the interface by following a pathway of monomer-oligomer-2D assembly. Similar to living polymerization, the film thickness exhibited a linear increase with the assembly conversion ratio of the monomers. With the stepwise addition of native protein into the reaction system, the thickness periodically increased in a linear manner. Such living/controlled supramolecular polymerization (LCSP) of protein at the interface leads to the synthesis of a nanofilm with well-defined flat morphology, ultrahigh modulus, and nano- to macroscale controlled thickness. The resultant protein nanofilm could then attach onto a variety of flexible and rigid material surfaces to produce a stable structural color coating. Compelling evidence in the present work thus underlines a demonstration of LCSP of biopolymers in vitro. It may hold a solid impact by opening a window for living/controlled polymerization of versatile biospecies such as proteins, saccharides, nucleic acids, and cells.",

          "abstract": "Tertiary plastids derived from diatoms in “dinotom” dinoflagellates offer a rare view of organellogenesis in action, while the genomic and metabolic processes underlying their conversion remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis of two dinotoms at different plastidial levels: Durinskia capensis at the kleptoplastidy state, alongside its kleptoplastid-source diatom Nitzschia captiva , and its close relative Durinskia kwazulunatalensis at an early permanent state. We show that in both dinotoms, the diatom nucleus retains high transcriptional autonomy, but its expression profile is plastid biased, signaling early host influence. In contrast, only D. kwazulunatalensis exhibits striking signs of genomic reconfiguration in the diatom nucleus: intron insertions, increased guanine (G) and cytosine (C) content, and growing nucleotide similarity to host transcripts. These shifts suggest an incipient nucleomorph-like transformation. Metabolically, only D. kwazulunatalensis expresses a complete hexose phosphate export pathway, suggesting deeper metabolic integration, while both species retain simpler carbohydrate transport routes. Additionally, we propose that diatom karyokinesis might be controlled by a dual mechanism via suppression of key transcription factors at the G1-S checkpoint and nitrate availability. Together, our findings reveal a continuum of plastid integration degrees, from temporary organelle theft to genomic accommodation and metabolic codependence. Dinotoms thus serve not only as evolutionary artifacts but as living laboratories, illuminating how kleptoplastids inch toward permanence.",

While continuum models for postyield plastic flow are well established, a unified framework connecting preyield avalanche dynamics to bulk rheology remains lacking. Here, we introduce a birefringent double-shear experiment that enables sustained probing of avalanche statistics and quasistatic flow behavior near the yielding transition. We find that the avalanche regime exhibits rate-weakening behavior, while the plastic regime is rate-independent, resulting in dual rheology under identical local shear rates and indicating hysteresis and mechanical instability. Within a stress-activated framework, we identify the mean normalized stress drop, a measure for mesoscale avalanche size, as a key field variable that bridges the two regimes. Incorporating this variable, we formulate a unified constitutive model that captures the entire yielding transition. These findings establish mesoscale avalanche evolution as a central mechanism underlying granular yielding rheology.",

The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.",

          "abstract": "Putative metazoan body fossils from the Precambrian are curiously lacking morphological characteristics that link them unambiguously to extant animal phyla, including sponges. Chemical fossils such as the rare C 30 hydrocarbons 24- iso -propylcholestane (24- i pc) and 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), however, have been proposed as evidence for the Neoproterozoic emergence of the Demospongiae (Porifera) due to their prevalence in rocks of this age and the occurrence of their sterol precursors in contemporary demosponges. However, there are alternative hypotheses which posit that diagenetic alteration products of algal sterols, or those from Rhizaria or other protists, account for the enigmatic steroid distributions observed in these ancient sedimentary rocks. Here, we report additional support for the Neoproterozoic rise of demosponges through the chemical characterization of two previously unrecognized C 31 hydrocarbons—24- n -butylcholestane (24- n bc) and 24- sec -butylcholestane (24- sec bc). Precursor C 31 sterols from contemporary demosponges, as well as a suite of synthesized C 31 sterol standards were reduced to their sterane counterparts. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and collisionally activated dissociation mass spectra confirmed the presence of 24- n bc and 24- sec bc in well-preserved early Ediacaran rocks, and the coelution of these compounds with synthetic standards enhances the robustness of these findings. Co-occurrence of abundant 24- i pc and 24- sec bc was found for numerous Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rock/oil samples, closely mimicking the abundance patterns and high structural selectivity of major C 30 and C 31 sterols detected in numerous species of modern demosponges.

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to assemble repressive chromatin. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3 deposition is regulated by the H3K36 methyltransferase ASH1 and components of constitutive heterochromatin including the H3K9me3-binding protein HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1). Hypoacetylated histones are a defining feature of both constitutive heterochromatin and PcG-repressed chromatin, but how histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to normal H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression within PcG-repressed chromatin is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen to identify HDACs required for repression of PRC2-methylated genes. In the absence of HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1 (HDA-1), PRC2-methylated genes were activated and H3K27me3 was depleted from typical PRC2-targeted regions. At constitutive heterochromatin, HDA-1 deficient cells displayed reduced H3K9me3, hyperacetylation, and aberrant enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. CHROMODOMAIN PROTEIN-2 (CDP-2) is required to target HDA-1 to constitutive heterochromatin and is also required for normal H3K27me3 patterns. Patterns of aberrant H3K27me3 were distinct in isogenic ∆ hda-1 strains, suggesting that loss of HDA-1 causes stochastic or progressive epigenome dysfunction. To test this, we constructed a new Δhda-1 strain and performed a laboratory “aging” experiment. Deletion of hda-1 led to progressive epigenome decay over hundreds of nuclear divisions. Together, our data indicate that HDA-1 is a critical regulator of epigenome stability in N. crassa.",

Dynamic phase transitions exhibit critical points that are hyperuniform, while anomalously large fluctuations are often quoted as a hallmark of active matter. Here, we show that the apparently disordered state of active nematic defects exhibits suppression of fluctuations on scales as large as the system size, reminiscent of what is seen for ordered lattices. Modeling the nematic defects in terms of continuum densities, we show that their distribution becomes asymptotically hyperuniform in the limit where their proliferation is solely driven by activity, rather than by thermal fluctuations. When both effects are at play, the resultant hyperuniform structure is limited to a finite range of length scales, ℓ &lt; ℓ × , with ℓ × → ∞ as thermal unbinding is suppressed. The system of active nematic defects can therefore be said to possess hidden order across scales provided ℓ is comparable to the system size. This organization is most pronounced when considering the subpopulation of either the positive or the negative defects, illustrating lack of multihyperuniformity. Our experimental findings are supported by hydrodynamic theory and agent-based simulations, which further allow elucidating the role of both creation/annihilation of defect pairs and of their mutual repulsion and attraction in achieving hyperuniformity.",

However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia–reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Changes in bacterial colony morphology are common during chronic human infections and are thought to provide a survival advantage. In the human pathogen Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB), a unidirectional transition from a smooth (MAB S ) to rough (MAB R ) morphotype frequently occurs during chronic infection. This transition has profound clinical implications, as MAB R induces a heightened proinflammatory response, contributing to increased morbidity. To better understand this phenomenon, we used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes essential for the survival of MAB S and MAB R . Our analysis revealed distinct genetic requirements for growth in vitro, including several genes involved in responding to environmental stresses. Notably, some of these uniquely essential genes are therapeutic targets in mycobacteria. In a murine infection model, the divergence in essential gene profiles between MAB S and MAB R was even more pronounced, driven partly by the differing host immune responses elicited by each morphotype. These findings demonstrate that the transition from a smooth to rough morphotype not only impacts MAB’s survival strategies but also highlights the importance of considering morphotype-specific genetic and functional adaptations when developing therapeutic approaches. Our work underscores the critical need to incorporate morphotype conversion into the prioritization of drug targets, as targeting morphotype-specific vulnerabilities could improve treatment outcomes for infections caused by this pathogen.",

The molecular basis for such kinetic coupling is incompletely understood, but one potential mechanism is through elongation rate–dependent alternative folding pathways of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). To search for RNA structures in nascent pre-mRNA, we modified Sequencing of Psoralen Crosslinked, Ligated And Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) [J. G. Ashley Aw et al. , Mol. Cell 62 , 603–617 (2016)] for use with C hromatin A ssociated R NA.

Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) disruption of several such duplexes that sequester splice sites has a major impact on AS outcomes, even though the ASOs do not directly disrupt splice sites. ASO disruption of these regulatory elements that we designate “RNA kinetic switches” modified AS of NISCH Exon 18, GAK Exon 7, and MEGF8 Exon 14 in a way that depends on the rate of transcription elongation. We propose that these switches mediate kinetic coupling via the effects of transcription speed on folding of nascent RNA structures that modulate AS and that many nascent RNA structures can thereby serve as targets for splice-modifying ASOs.",

Therefore, we utilized the high fecundity of Xenopus tropicalis and easily observable pigment phenotypes to construct a BRAF V600E -targeted mitf locus knock-in model. Results indicated that this approach enabled efficient generation of BRAF V600E knock-in X. tropicalis and produced a versatile frog model. The BRAF V600E knock-in induced the transdifferentiation of RPE cells into retinal cells, resulting in a symmetric retinal structure in the eyes of these frogs. The transformation of RPE cells ultimately leads to these frogs becoming eyeless frogs, which serve as a tool for retinal regeneration research. Additionally, in eyeless frogs the BRAF V600E knock-in led to the abnormal proliferation of both melanocytes and xanthophores into melanocytic and xanthocytic nevi respectively. Consequently, eyeless frogs provide a model for studying abnormal pigment cell proliferation, offering a platform for investigating pigment cell nevus formation. Furthermore, the cdkn2b -knockout eyeless frogs serve as a valuable xanthophoroma model for tumor biology research. Overall, the BRAF V600E -targeted knock-in X. tropicalis not only represents a strategy for constructing gene knock-in animal models but also serves as a versatile tool for research in retinal regeneration and tumor biology.",

          "abstract": "In order to find extrinsic rewards, humans explore their environment even if exploration requires several intermediate, reward-free decisions. It has been hypothesized that intrinsic rewards, such as novelty, surprise, or information gain, guide this reward-free exploration. However, in artificial agents, different intrinsic reward signals induce exploration strategies that respond differently to stochasticity. In particular, some strategies are vulnerable to the “noisy TV problem,” i.e., an attraction to irrelevant stochastic stimuli. Here, we ask whether humans exhibit a similar attraction to reward-free stochasticity. We design a multistep decision-making paradigm in which participants search for rewarding states in a complex environment containing a highly stochastic but reward-free subregion. We show that i) participants persistently explore the stochastic subregion, and ii) their decisions are best explained by a novelty-driven exploration strategy, compared to alternatives driven by information gain or surprise. Our findings suggest that novelty and extrinsic rewards jointly control human exploration in complex environments.",

          "abstract": "Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) have been identified to associate with various neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. Damage to MLVs can exacerbate the pathological progression of these diseases and significantly impede therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, targeted repair of the damaged MLVs has emerged as an innovative strategy for treating these central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study, we find that inorganic Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles, rather than conventional endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), can repair the damaged MLVs to restore their structure and functions. These nanoparticles not only promote the growth and development of lymphatic vessels but also enhance the drainage capacity of impaired MLVs, thereby facilitating the transport of immune cells and macromolecules through these vessels. Unlike the conventional repair of damaged MLVs, this is an instance where inorganic nanoparticles have been explored to stimulate the expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3, thereby promoting the structural and functional recovery of these vessels. The enhanced drainage function of MLVs mediated by Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles significantly alleviates the symptoms of pre-formed fibrils (PFFs)-induced Parkinson’s disease in mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that inorganic nanoparticles can promote the growth and development of meningeal lymphatics like VEGF-C, providing a cost-effective and innovative strategy for repairing damaged MLVs to boost the therapeutic efficacy of CNS diseases.",

The Arabidopsis long terminal repeat retrotransposon Copia93 , also known as Evade , exhibits exceptionally high transpositional activity, but the mechanism underlying its extraordinary mobility remains unclear. Here, we identify an Element for Nuclear Expression (ENE) motif within the 3′ UTR of Evade that forms a triple helical RNA structure with the poly(A) tail, shielding the transcript from deadenylation and degradation. Deletion of the ENE motif significantly reduces Evade transcript stability, extrachromosomal DNA levels, and de novo insertions. Furthermore, we show that the mRNA deadenylase CCR4a directly binds Evade RNA to shorten its poly(A) tail, thereby suppressing transposition. Loss of CCR4a leads to Evade upregulation, while additional deadenylases contribute to its repression in the absence of CCR4a. Our findings uncover an RNA-based strategy that enhances transposon stability and mobility, illustrating a coevolutionary arms race between host silencing pathways and TE-encoded structural elements.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 plays a crucial role in regulating excitability of small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and is an emerging target for pain therapeutics. Using dynamic clamp, we systematically manipulated Nav1.8 conductance to assess its impact on action potential (AP) electrogenesis, rheobase, and repetitive firing in native rat DRG neurons and those expressing the gain-of-function Nav1.7L858H mutation which underlies inherited erythromelalgia, a human genetic pain disorder. Our findings reveal that the Nav1.8 contribution to net sodium current is highly correlated with AP voltage threshold. Nav1.8 conductance regulated AP overshoot and voltage threshold without significantly affecting undershoot or resting membrane potential. We identified two populations of wild-type DRG neurons: strong responders (50% of cells), which exhibited substantial rheobase modulation with alterations in Nav1.8 conductance, and weak responders (50% of cells), which remained largely unaffected. In hyperexcitable Nav1.7L858H-expressing neurons, partial Nav1.8 subtraction (50%) restored rheobase above control levels in 63% of cells. However, weak responders (37%) remained hyperexcitable. The effect of Nav1.8 subtraction in responsive neurons supports the conclusion that Nav1.8 inhibition can reduce neuropathic pain. However, the presence of weakly responsive DRG neurons suggests that other channels might need to be targeted for full pain relief.",

          "abstract": "Knowing the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter’s bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter’s atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential nonuniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter’s midlatitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A nonuniform water vapor distribution emerges in the midlatitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from subsolar to supersolar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter’s midlatitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a supersolar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the nonuniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Endogenous pathogens can constrain virulence to ensure survival in the host. Pathogenic state can be controlled by metabolic responses to the prevailing microenvironment; however, the coupling and effector mechanisms are not well understood. Flux through the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway can modulate virulence of the oral pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis , and here we show that this is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent differential partitioning of gingipain proteases. The OCM essential precursor pABA inhibits the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and consequently relieves inhibition of its cognate kinase, Ptk1. We found that in the absence of pABA, reduced Ptk1 kinase activity blocks extracellular release of gingipains. Surface retention of gingipains confers resistance to neutrophil mobilization and killing, and virulence in animal models of disease is elevated. Reciprocally, Ptk1 and gingipains are required for maximal flux through OCM, and Ptk1 can phosphorylate the OCM pathway enzymes GlyA and GcvT. Further, ALP, an alkaline phosphatase involved in synthesis of DHPPP, which combines with pABA to make DHP, is phosphorylated and activated by Ptk1. We propose, therefore, that although the primary function of Ptk1 is to maintain OCM balance, it mechanistically couples metabolism with tunable pathogenic potential through directing the location of proteolytic virulence factors.",

We demonstrate that minimal platinum (Pt) loading for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can be achieved through atom abstraction. At low loadings of Pt with copper (Cu), reduction over silica or other oxide supports formed nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt mainly dispersed in the bulk. Addition of tin (Sn) to the alloy led to formation of surface Pt 1 Sn 1 dimers. The larger atomic radius of Sn compared to Cu drove it to the surface, and its stronger interactions with Pt abstracted it from the bulk. Single metallic Pt atoms were stabilized on fully open surfaces, resulting in nearly 100% surface exposure. This configuration reduced Pt usage by one order of magnitude for propane dehydrogenation and improved catalytic stability.",

We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity.

Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II.

          "abstract": "Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.",

          "abstract": "The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.",

Coevolutionary analysis and deep learning (DL) based protein structure prediction have enabled comprehensive PPI identification in bacteria and yeast, but these approaches have had limited success for the more complex human proteome. We overcame this challenge by enhancing the coevolutionary signals with 7-fold deeper multiple sequence alignments harvested from 30 petabytes of unassembled genomic data and developing a new DL network trained on augmented datasets of domain-domain interactions from 200 million predicted protein structures. We systematically screened 200 million human protein pairs and predicted 17,849 interactions with an expected precision of 90%, of which 3,631 interactions were not identified in previous experimental screens. Three-dimensional models of these predicted interactions provide numerous hypotheses about protein function and mechanisms of human diseases.",

In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement.

We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.",

A structure of Cap10 revealed a transfer RNA transglycosylase family enzyme remodeled to bind a partner cGAS/DncV–like nucleotidyltransferase that is modified with an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase.

Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification.

Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low.

We show that while virtually all PAE plasmids were devoid of resistance genes and most never acquired them, a minority evolved to drive the global spread of resistance to first line and last resort antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. Modern plasmids have evolved through complex microevolution and fusion events into a distinct group of highly recombinogenic, multi-replicon, self-transmissible plasmids that now pose the highest risk to resistance dissemination, and therefore to human health.",

          "abstract": "Millions of Americans must attend mandatory court dates every year. To boost appearance rates, jurisdictions nationwide are increasingly turning to automated reminders. However, previous research paints an incomplete picture of their effectiveness—in particular, there has been little work assessing the impact of reminders on downstream arrests and incarceration. In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment. The effectiveness of reminders bolsters the theory that lapses in memory or comprehension contribute to missed court appearances.",

The human menstrual cycle has also a period close to that of the lunar cycle, and recent studies suggest a temporary synchrony between menstrual and lunar cycles. Nevertheless, lunar influence on human reproductive behavior remains controversial. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual records of individual women from the past 24 years and compared them with records from the past century. We show that women’s menstrual cycles recorded before the introduction of light-emitting diodes in 2010 and the extensive use of smart phones significantly synchronized with the Moon, while those after 2010 coupled to the Moon mostly in January. We hypothesize that the high gravimetric forces between the Moon, Sun, and Earth every January are sufficient for this coupling, while the increasing exposure to artificial light at night impinges on synchrony at other times.",

However, technological solutions come with associated costs, and in small-scale societies, technological complexity reflects this trade-off between efficiency and resource constraints. Here, we analyze this trade-off and show a sublinear scaling relationship between toolkit richness and tool part richness in ethnographic societies. This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.",

Leveraging nationwide health surveys and registers from Denmark, we investigated patterns of sleep problems from late adolescence to adulthood and explored early life-course determinants. We generated life-course embeddings using unsupervised machine learning on data from 2.2 million individuals born from 1980 to 2015. We used this landscape to identify neighboring factors of sleep problems. We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns. Specific childhood adversities, such as sibling psychiatric illness, foster care, and parental divorce, were shared factors across multiple sleep disorders such as insomnia and nightmares. These findings underscore the complex interplay between medical and psychosocial factors in sleep.",

The epigenetic mechanism underlying spatiotemporal gene regulation during in vivo neuron differentiation remains largely unknown.

Here, we show that Atoh1-Cre –mediated knockout (ACKO) of Kmt2d encoding the lysine methyltransferase KMT2D (MLL4) in cerebellar GC lineage inhibits the transition of GC progenitors to GCs while cell non-autonomously affecting other cerebellar cells. Kmt2d ACKO impaired cerebellum-associated behaviors and caused facial peculiarity, microcephaly, and reduced body size in mice. KMT2D temporally activated neuronal differentiation programs in cerebellar GCs. KMT2D-mediated activation of the key neuronal transcription factor genes En2 , Pax6 , and Myt1l via super-enhancer/enhancer programming was critical for GC differentiation. These findings reveal a unique epigenetic mechanism in which KMT2D temporally orchestrates gene expression required for cerebellar GC differentiation by programming neuronal enhancers.",

However, the therapeutic potential of liver-targeted ceramide lowering remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2 , which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle–mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline–deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet–induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.",

          "abstract": "High-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can assist in determining protein structure, but it requires time-consuming acquisition. Deep learning enables ultrafast reconstruction but is limited to spectra of up to three dimensions and cannot provide faithful reconstruction under unseen acceleration factors. Extending deep learning to handle higher-dimensional spectra and varying acceleration factors is desirable. However, scalability requires complex networks and more data, seriously hindering applications. To address this, we designed a network to learn data in one dimension (1D). First, time-domain signals were modeled as the outer product of 1D exponentials. Then, each 1D exponential was approximated with a rank-one Hankel matrix. Last, reconstruction error was corrected with a neural network. Here, we demonstrate robust 3D NMR reconstruction across acceleration factors (2 to 33) using one trained network. In addition, we find that reconstruction of 4D NMR is possible with artificial intelligence. This work opens an avenue for accelerating arbitrarily high-dimensional NMR. ",

Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.",

The sensor enables direct probing of the amide I band in sub-10-nanometer proteins. By using s-CFW to amplify target spectral features, the developed physics-informed CNN achieves a mean relative error of less than 0.1 in predicting secondary structure percentages, more than twice as accurate as a pristine CNN. This method enables in situ and real-time quantification of subtle conformational changes during protein assembly, thereby addressing the issue of data scarcity that now hinders the development of advanced deep learning models for predicting protein dynamics and interactions in physiological environments.",

          "abstract": "The distinct compositions of metallic cores from noncarbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) reflect differences in accretion and differentiation histories of earliest inner and outer Solar System planetesimals. Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.",

However, existing projections often do not align with past data, complicating adaptation planning, impact assessments, and communication. We present a spatial Bayesian model that generates local projections at tide gauge sites from historical records. The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The model enables projections of local relative sea level rise for any given global temperature trajectory, illustrated with three IPCC AR6 Working Group III pathways.",

We show that floods driven by compound space-time storm clustering have higher peaks, volumes, and durations compared to those from isolated storms or single-mode clustering. Under future climate conditions (2070 to 2100; SSP3-7.0 scenario), projections indicate a 26% rise in the number of extreme storms, an 8% increase in average storm precipitation, and a 17% reduction in dry intervals preceding flood peaks. The dominant flood type is projected to shift from those produced by isolated storms (38%) to ones produced by compound storm clustering (49%)—the type of floods that have been responsible for catastrophic floods historically. These findings highlight the need to incorporate storm clustering and its changes into design flood analysis and management strategies for the LMRB.",

Using pooled phenotype sorting and sequencing of male Drosophila melanogaster from natural populations, we identified starvation resistance–associated variants, many in regulatory regions or altering protein sequences. RNA interference experiments showed that 85.7% (66 of 77) of the candidate genes with nonlethal knockdown effects influenced starvation resistance. Of these, 49 had sex-dependent effects, including 12 with sexually antagonistic effects—all increasing resistance in females but decreasing it in males. These patterns were not explained by sex-biased expression or knockdown efficiency. Analysis of the Lnk gene revealed that both nonsynonymous mutations and expression changes had sex-dependent effects. Our findings indicate that polygenic architecture, sex-dependent effects, and pleiotropy jointly shape evolutionary outcomes and that some variants maintained by these forces may enable rapid responses to environmental change.",

This ability gives pathogens a competitive edge over commensal microbiota, which can drive virulence in the inflamed gut. Despite such a critical function, the molecular mechanisms underlying the synthesis of Eut BMCs remain elusive. We report a systematic study for dissecting the molecular basis underlying Eut BMC assembly in Salmonella . We determined the functions of individual constituent proteins in the structure and function of Eut BMCs and demonstrated that EutQ is essential for cargo encapsulation and Eut BMC formation through specific association with the shell and cargo enzymes. We found that Eut proteins can self-assemble to form cargo and shell aggregates independently in vivo and that the biogenesis of Eut BMCs follows a “shell-initiated” pathway. Cargo enzymes exhibit dynamic liquid-like organization within the Eut BMC. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the structure and assembly of the Eut BMC that serves as a paradigm for membraneless organelles.",

Nonvolatile switches with zero static power are promising, but current phase change material approaches face challenges including unreliable durability, high switching energy, complicated fabrication, and compromised scalability. Here, we propose and demonstrate a nonvolatile silicon photonic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switch enabled by tailored stiction effect based on van der Waals (vdW) force. The device uses a unique split waveguide crossing (SWX) with a push-pull MEMS actuator to efficiently switch the mode propagation. The vdW force between two halves of the combined SWX with zero gap provides reliable nonvolatility. The device features 0.23-decibel excess loss, 44.4-decibel extinction ratio, 200-nanometer bandwidth, and ~1-picojoule theoretical switching energy. Furthermore, excellent scalability is validated by a fabricated high-performance 16 by 16 nonvolatile photonic switch array, which has never been reported before.",

We introduce laser Speckle PARticle SizEr (SPARSE), a noncontact optical technique that enables particle sizing over 10 nanometer–to–10 micrometer range, through analyzing the spatiotemporal attributes of polarized laser speckle, back-scattered from biofluids and tissues. We demonstrate that SPARSE effectively quantifies the average particle sizes in milk, blood, and intact tissue without a prior knowledge of particles’ refractive indices or concentrations. Through beam scanning, particle size distribution is mapped in benign and malignant breast tissues with high resolution (~100 micrometer), mirroring histopathological microstructures.

At this sub-epsilon precision level, the half-life of 234 U is refined to 245,670 ± 260 years. For U-Th geochronology, systematic uncertainties from decay constants largely cancel, effectively reducing the uncertainty in the 234 U half-life to ~±25 years.

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.",

However, by a lenient threshold search strategy combined with a machine learning approach based on structural similarity, here we identified 9419 potential ARGs within lytic phages. We showed that potential trimethoprim-resistance dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ) genes enriched in lytic phages could confer trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli . Sequence analysis revealed that lytic phages rarely transfer these potential dfrA genes into their bacterial hosts. Functional studies showed that these dfrA genes not only enhance phage reproduction in the presence of trimethoprim but also promote bacterial growth during phage infection. These results highlight that abundant functional ARGs were selected in evolution to improve lytic phage reproduction by promoting bacterial growth during infection, suggesting that dfrA genes play important roles in evolutionary mutualism between lytic phages and their hosts.",

While increasing channel thickness enhances its capacitance and thereby amplifies transconductance, it simultaneously impedes ion transport kinetics, leading to slower switching speeds. Here, we present a three-dimensional electrolyte-surrounded OECT architecture that redefines ion transport dynamics by enabling multidirectional ion doping to the channel for efficient and rapid switching. Our proposed approach achieves a remarkable enhancement in the operational bandwidth of OECTs, reaching 26 kHz while preserving their high transconductance, notably using a commercially available conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). This is enabled by micro/nanostructured channel design that enhances ion accessibility and minimizes parasitic effects. This advancement allows for continuous, wide-frequency neural signal recording from peripheral nerves. This work offers a robust strategy for achieving both high transconductance and fast switching in OECTs, establishing a foundation for the development of next-generation, high-speed bioelectronic interfaces.",

Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening.

Our findings indicate that a topological transition occurs in response to modulation frequency increases, producing anomalous edge states with chirality within Floquet harmonic bandgaps. The open nature of the metasurface facilitates harmonic generation via Floquet edge states. Experimentally, we confirm the existence of Floquet harmonic bands and the robust unidirectional propagation of these edge states.

This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states.

We used a temperature-dependent population dynamics model to assess the impacts of lake warming and fishing on 521 freshwater fish populations in the Midwestern United States—a transitional zone between cold- and warmwater species. Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.",

Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses.

Here, we report on a previously unidentified axonal sensory and motor neuropathy likely caused by a homozygous genetic variant of missense mutation (c.472G&gt;C, p.P158A) in the NAMPT gene. Two affected siblings presented with a range of clinical features including impaired motor coordination, muscle atrophy, foot deformities, and positive Babinski sign. Using different preparations including recombinant human and mouse NAMPT proteins, patient fibroblasts, and mouse model, we showed that the p.P158A mutation decreased NAMPT enzyme activity, leading to disrupted cellular bioenergetics, metabolic derangements, and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the p.P158A mutation could cause synaptic dysfunction and motor neuron degeneration in the mouse model. This Mutation in NAMPT Axonopathy (MINA) syndrome is the first human hereditary neurological disease linking to an NAMPT variant. Our study has substantial clinical implications.",

Here, we present a sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy using shape memory polymers (SMPs) to facilitate full-cycle capture operations. The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision. The adhesive-integrated system successfully performs dynamic capture, manipulation, and release under free-floating conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy. The proposed concept and design offer a paradigm for robust, multifunctional capture in high-dynamics environments.",

Here, we investigate changes in immune cell glycocalyx with age and find that α2,6-linked sialic acid, a glycan epitope associated with inhibitory signaling, is down-regulated in T cells from old animals. This reduction is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which have little to no α2,6-linked sialic acid. To understand how α2,6-linked sialic acid affects T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell–specific deletion of sialyltransferase gene St6gal1 . The lack of α2,6-linked sialic acid leads to reduced responsiveness in naïve T cells, leading to impaired T cell responses against Listeria monocytogenes infection and tumor growth. PD-1 pathway blockade partially restores St6gal1 -deficient T cells’ ability to control tumor growth. These findings suggest that α2,6-linked sialic acid is critical for maintaining long-term T cell responsiveness, and its loss may contribute to decreased T cell function with age.",

Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions.

          "abstract": "Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to balance growth and defense. The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis . Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.",

TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) is a core transcriptional repressor in the plant circadian system that is phosphorylated near its N terminus.

We establish that TOC1 phosphorylation (particularly at S175) is necessary for optimal interaction with FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5 (PIF5) at the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) promoter to down-regulate CCA1 expression. Expression of the closely related LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) also requires TOC1 but is independent of TOC1 phosphorylation, suggesting different TOC1-dependent gene repression mechanisms. We additionally show that TOC1 phosphorylation–dependent interactions at specific clock gene promoters selectively regulate these circadian system components more acutely than nonrhythmic genes. Our genome-wide analysis demonstrates that the TOC1 phosphostate is important for optimal chromatin presence and robust rhythmic gene expression.",

Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene. These findings imply that a glacier-free Sierra Nevada is unprecedented since before the Holocene. Future alpine glacial environments in California are thereby likely a no-analog scenario within the current interglacial.",

This multipass configuration also reduces the lasing threshold by nearly 70%, facilitates spectral broadening of pump pulses, and compresses the pulse duration of N 2 + lasing.

We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.",

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion.

To overcome these challenges, we developed engineered basement membranes (eBMs) using peptide-conjugated alginate hydrogels with independently tunable mechanics. Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV)–modified eBMs, with fast stress relaxation and low stiffness, supported normal mammary acinus formation. Both increased stiffness and slow relaxation were required to induce invasion in IKVAV-modified eBMs, differing from the invasive phenotype observed in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)–modified eBMs regardless of the mechanical properties. Mechanistic studies revealed the balance of β1 and β4 integrin signaling, hemidesmosome formation, and laminin production were influenced by eBM properties. Inhibiting focal adhesion kinase or hemidesmosome signaling disrupted acinus formation in IKVAV-modified eBMs. This defined, xenogenic-free eBM system offers a modular platform for tissue engineering and disease modeling.",

          "abstract": "One of the most widely cited objections to hypotheses that defend a central role for humans in late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions in South America has been the assumption that extinct megafauna was a marginal resource in early human economies. On the basis of accurate chronological frames and faunal quantitative data, we demonstrate that extinct megafauna were the principal prey item of early foragers from ~13,000 to 11,600 calibrated years before the present, and this fact had likely been obscured by lumping together pre- and postextinction archaeological faunal assemblages within a single chronological window. We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened. This strongly reinforces the idea that humans must be central to the debate on Quaternary extinctions in South America.",

NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal–induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.",

TPGS reinforced the lipid bilayer of LNPs, enhanced gastrointestinal stability, and facilitated colonic mucus penetration.

This study proposes an ultrathin flexible sensor inserted endovascularly with a stent to detect type I endoleaks, which pose the highest rupture risk. A coplanar capacitive sensor was attached to the stent graft using a specially developed flexible thermal adhesive to monitor blood leakage, without compromising the stent graft’s function. It seamlessly folds and unfolds with the stent, allowing implantation through catheter-based procedures. Experimental validation confirmed that the sensor does not induce blood leakage and demonstrated long-term stability and functionality under vascular and dynamic conditions.

Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4–stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.",

PreTfr are expandable in vitro while retaining suppressive capacity. They are transcriptionally similar to naïve T regs (nT regs ) ex vivo, but after stimulation, they gain increased expression of Tfr-related suppressive molecules such as IL-1RA, suggesting that they are primed for full differentiation into mature Tfr. Further, we demonstrate that preTfr but not nT reg are significantly reduced in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and patients with sepsis and that this loss is correlated with increased anti–interferon-γ antibodies and activated atypical B cells. Together, these data suggest that Tfr are disrupted at the earliest stage of their formation during severe disease and may be an important therapeutic target in future vaccine developments.",

Preliminary data showed that naïve mice exposed to improperly pasteurized milk containing live H5N1 virus developed lethal infection, whereas prior H1N1 infection conferred protection.

Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.",

Photonic toroidal vortices constitute a family of three-dimensional, spacetime nonseparable structured light fields carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, as solutions to the dispersive Maxwells’ equations, these wave packets do not survive nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by transverse and longitudinal OAM, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by longitudinal OAM. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion and induces topological transformations of vortex lines, characterized by annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. The renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.",

We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits.

We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime.

We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.",

Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface.

Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics.

FapC, the major biofilm-forming functional amyloid in Pseudomonas , is essential for biofilm integrity, yet its structural details remain unresolved. Using an integrative structural biology approach, we combine a solution nuclear magnetic resonance–based structural ensemble of unfolded monomeric FapC, a ~3.3-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density map of FapC fibril, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to capture the transition from the unfolded to folded monomer to the fibrillar fold, providing a complete structural view of FapC biogenesis. Cryo-EM reveals a unique irregular triple-layer β solenoid cross-β fibril composed of a single protofilament. MD simulations initiated from monomeric and fibrillar FapC mapped structural transitions, offering mechanistic insights into amyloid assembly and disassembly. Understanding FapC reveals how Pseudomonas exploits functional amyloids for biofilm formation, and establishes a structural and mechanistic foundation for developing therapeutics targeting biofilm-related infection and antimicrobial resistance.",

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA. Overall, we show that PTGA is a scalable circular polymer that provides i PP-like properties and that the interfacial ROP method solves the challenges in typical solution-phase polymerization.",

We demonstrate a microneedle device that is several times faster than state of the art, collecting an average of 15.5 mg of ISF in 5 minutes in humans with near-zero failure rate.

The influence of penetration depth, collection time, pressure, and age on ISF collection was elucidated, with Darcy’s law explaining multiple observations.

The foregut and hindgut circuits of the C. elegans enteric nervous system (ENS) control feeding and defecation behavior, respectively.

In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.",

We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism.

This switch makes the simulations computationally feasible, overcoming long-standing limitations of previous models. Using this framework, we successfully reproduce the self-assembly of subunits into icosahedral shells with T numbers greater than one—most notably T  = 3, the most common structure in nature—a feat rigid-body models have so far failed to achieve. We also examine how genome architecture influences assembly and observe trends consistent with experiments using cowpea chlorotic mottle virus proteins: RNAs with more complex structure yield more complete capsids than do linear ones.

In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain.

To address this challenge, we developed an acoustically powered micro-clampbot capable of clamping objects using claws actuated by acoustically induced secondary Bjerknes forces and moving via flagella that oscillate under acoustic input. The robot’s actions are governed by distinct acoustic frequencies, enabling precise and independent control of clamping and locomotion. The micro-clampbot can pick a single particle from a cluster and navigate delicately through narrow channels, with narrow necks (~2.1 times the width of the micro-clampbot).

Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.",

This restriction can be bypassed by instead measuring commuting modular observables, which are counterparts to the naturally incompatible observables. Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables—number and phase. We prepare a different resource—number-phase states—and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL. These results introduce previously unidentified measurement capabilities unavailable to classical systems and mark a substantial step in quantum metrology.",

          "abstract": "Structural plasticity of dendritic spines is a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.",

          "abstract": "The plant cysteine protease metacaspases are structural homologs of animal caspases and play pivotal roles under biotic and abiotic stresses. However, whether metacaspases and purine-rich element (R-motif)–mediated defense messenger RNA translation are involved in plant antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.",

          "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by chronic inflammation and an unstable tear film. Stem cells have shown potential for DED treatment, but the main challenge lies in improving cell delivery effectiveness. Here, we developed eye drops for autoimmune DED treatment using porous arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD)–modified alginate microcarriers with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) (RGD-Alg@MSCs). These microcarriers provided a favorable microenvironment for large-scale cell expansion while maintaining stemness with ideal mechanical properties for ocular application. In vitro, RGD-Alg@MSCs demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic effects compared to conventional MSCs, including improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced release of immunomodulatory factors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these enhanced therapeutic effects. In the mouse model, RGD-Alg@MSCs exhibited prolonged ocular retention and enhanced tear production, promoted corneal healing, and suppressed inflammation by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and T H 17 differentiation. Our microcarrier system substantially improves stem cell delivery efficiency for treating autoimmune DED.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor that frequently infiltrates surrounding brain tissue, causing therapy resistance and recurrence. The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.",
