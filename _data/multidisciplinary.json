          "title": "The pivot penalty in research",
          "authors": "Ryan Hill, Yian Yin, Carolyn Stein, Xizhao Wang, Dashun Wang, Benjamin F. Jones",
          "abstract": "Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amid evolving questions, opportunities and challenges, yet the understanding of pivots between research areas and their outcomes remains limited1,2,3,4,5. Theories of creative search highlight the potential benefits of exploration but also emphasize difficulties in moving beyond one’s expertise6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we introduce a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing work, and apply it to millions of papers and patents. We find a pervasive ‘pivot penalty’, in which the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their previous work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across science and patenting, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. Larger pivots further exhibit weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge, lower publication success rates and less market impact. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in effectively adapting to new opportunities and threats, with implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands.",

          "authors": "Bharat B. Biswal, Lucina Q. Uddin",
          "abstract": "Since the discovery of resting-state functional connectivity in the human brain, this neuroimaging approach has revolutionized the study of neural architecture. Once considered noise, the functional significance of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations across large-scale brain networks has now been investigated in more than 25,000 publications. In this Review, we provide a historical overview and thoughts regarding potential future directions for resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) research, highlighting the most informative analytic approaches that have been developed to reveal the brain’s intrinsic spatiotemporal organization. We review the collaborative efforts that have led to the widespread use of rsfMRI in neuroscience, with an emphasis on methodological innovations that have been made possible by contributions from electrical and biomedical engineering, physics, mathematics and computer science. We focus on key theoretical and methodological advances that will be necessary for further progress in the field, highlighting the need for further integration with new developments in whole-brain computational modelling, more sophisticated approaches to brain–behaviour mapping, greater mechanistic insights from concurrent measurement of neurophysiology, and greater appreciation of the problem of generalization failure in machine learning applications. We propose that rsfMRI has the potential for even greater clinical relevance when it is fully integrated with population neuroscience and global health initiatives in the service of precision psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1,2,3,4. Clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) proteins, which comprise a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, have a pivotal role in the neuronal self-avoidance that is required for mammalian brain development5,6,7. The probabilistic expression of different cPcdh isoforms confers unique identities on neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism also exists in astrocytes remains unknown. Here we report that γC3, a specific isoform in the Pcdhγ family, is enriched in human and mouse astrocytes. Using genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that γC3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine whether γC3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of γC3 chimeric proteins that are capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expression of complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same γC3-null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric γC3 proteins individually expressed in single γC3-null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition mediated by γC3 contributes to astrocyte development in the mammalian brain.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemistry is undergoing a resurgence in synthetic chemistry and boasts compelling advantages1. Repurposing natural enzymes through synthetic chemical strategies holds significant promise for exploring new chemical space2-6. Elegant strategies, including directed evolution7-10, artificial enzymes11, and photoenzymatic catalysis12,13 have demonstrated their capacities for expanding the applications of enzymes in both academia and industry. However, the integration of electrochemistry with enzymes has primarily been limited to replicating previously established enzyme functions14-16. Key challenges in achieving new enzyme reactivity with electricity include compatibility issues and difficulties in heterogeneous electron transfer. Here we report the reshaping of thiamine-dependent enzymes with ferrocene-mediated electrocatalysis to unlock an unnatural dynamic kinetic oxidation of α-branched aldehydes. This robust electroenzymatic approach yields various bioactive (S)-profens with up to 99% enantiomeric excess, is applicable with whole cells overexpressing the enzyme and using down to 0.05 mol% enzyme loadings. Mechanistic investigations reveal multiple functions of the electroenzyme in the precise substrate discrimination, accelerating racemization, and facilitating kinetically matched electron transfer events.",

Excess mROS production has been associated with several disease states2,3; however, the precise sources, regulation and mechanism of generation in vivo remain unclear, which limits translational efforts. Here we show that in obesity, hepatic coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis is impaired, which increases the CoQH2 to CoQ (CoQH2/CoQ) ratio and drives excessive mROS production through reverse electron transport (RET) from site IQ in complex I. Using multiple complementary genetic and pharmacological models in vivo, we demonstrate that RET is crucial for metabolic health. In patients with steatosis, the hepatic CoQ biosynthetic program is also suppressed, and the CoQH2/CoQ ratio positively correlates with disease severity. Our data identify a highly selective mechanism for pathological mROS production in obesity, which can be targeted to protect metabolic homeostasis.",

          "authors": "Antonio Falasconi, Harsh Kanodia, Silvia Arber",
          "abstract": "The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits 1–8 . Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres 9,10 . However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry 11–22 . Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.",

          "abstract": "Terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—formed by the accretion of smaller objects. The Earth was probably the latest terrestrial planet to form and reached about 99% of its final mass within about 60–100 Myr after condensation of the first solids in the Solar System. This Review examines the disproportionate role of the last approximately 1% of planetary growth, or late accretion, in controlling the long-term evolution of the Earth and other terrestrial planets. Late accretion may have been responsible for shaping Earth’s distinctive geophysical and chemical properties and generating pathways conducive to prebiotic chemistry. Differences in the late accretion of a planet may provide a rationale for interpreting the distinct properties of Venus and Earth (for example, tectonism, atmospheric composition, water content), the surface dichotomy of Mars and the high core-to-silicate mass ratio of Mercury. Large collisions and ensuing processes are likely to occur and modulate the evolution of rocky exoplanets as well, and they should be considered in our quest to find Earth-like worlds.",

          "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a globally important seed oil, fibre and drug-producing plant species. However, a century of prohibition has severely restricted development of breeding and germplasm resources, leaving potential hemp-based nutritional and fibre applications unrealized. Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability 1 . Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined 2–4 . However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals 5 . Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions 6–8 , but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.",

          "abstract": "To absorb nutrients and support commensal microbes, the host induces tolerogenic immune responses via peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) 1,2. Prior studies identified type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) as initiators of dietary pTregs3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt APCs4–8 and not by cDCs. Instead, our data suggest that pTreg–cDC1 interactions in steady-state limit the expansion of food-specific CD8αβ T cells. This regulation breaks during infection or food poisoning, enabling dietary CD8αβ T cells to expand and acquire effector functions in response to mimicked food antigens. Unlike in typical infections, after the pathogen is cleared, dietary CD8αβ T cells do not expand in response to their corresponding dietary antigens. Thus, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, tolerance is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. When the host is challenged by infection, this circuit permits the transient expansion of protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption.",

          "abstract": "Surface albedo greatly affects how much energy the Earth absorbs. Intensive human activities and accelerated climate change have altered surface albedo across spatial and temporal scales1,2,3, yet assessments of the effects of land use or land cover (LULC) and snow variations on land surface albedo are scarce at the global scale. As a result, the global land surface albedo dynamics over recent decades and their corresponding radiative forcing to the climate system remain poorly understood4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we quantify the individual and combined effects of snow cover dynamics, LULC conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 and estimate their induced radiative forcing. We show that the negative radiative forcing induced by the global land surface albedo change was −0.142 (−0.158, −0.114) W m−2 over the past two decades. The global snow-free land surface albedo increased by 2.2% (P < 0.001), with a negative radiative forcing of −0.164 (−0.186, −0.138) W m−2 (P < 0.001). The magnitude of this negative forcing is sevenfold larger than the positive forcing induced by snow dynamics, and equivalent to 59.9% of that caused by CO2 emissions from 2011 to 201910. The global radiative forcing due to albedo changes in LULC non-conversion regions is 3.9 to 8.1 times greater than that from LULC conversions. The radiative forcing induced by albedo changes highlights the important role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming.",

          "abstract": "Modelling liver disease requires in vitro systems that replicate disease progression1,2. Current tissue-derived organoids fail to reproduce the complex cellular composition and tissue architecture observed in vivo3. Here, we describe a multicellular organoid system composed of adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells that recapitulates the architecture of the liver periportal region and, when manipulated, models aspects of cholestatic injury and biliary fibrosis. We first generate reproducible hepatocyte organoids with functional bile canaliculi network that retain morphological features of in vivo tissue. By combining these with cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts, we generate assembloids that mimic the cellular interactions of the periportal region. Assembloids are functional, consistently draining bile from bile canaliculi into the bile duct. Strikingly, manipulating the relative number of portal mesenchymal cells is sufficient to induce a fibrotic-like state, independently of an immune compartment. By generating chimeric assembloids of mutant and wild-type cells, or after gene knockdown, we show proof-of-concept that our system is amenable to investigating gene function and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Taken together, we demonstrate that liver assembloids represent a suitable in vitro system to study bile canaliculi formation, bile drainage, and how different cell types contribute to cholestatic disease and biliary fibrosis, in an all-in-one model.",

The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear2,3,4. Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour. These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain. Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue. In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.",

A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution 11–14 , a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons 15 .

It perturbs the Earth’s radiative energy balance and alters the atmospheric oxidation capacity, which determines the lifetimes of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane1. A key mechanism in this dynamic is the impact of air pollutants on the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidant in the troposphere, which accounts for approximately 90% of the methane chemical sink2. However, a comprehensive quantification of the interactions between air pollutants, OH and methane over decadal timescales remains incomplete2. Here we develop an integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach to quantify how variations in key air pollutants influence the methane chemical sink and alter the methane budget. Our results indicate that, from 2005 to 2021, enhanced tropospheric ozone, increased water vapour and decreased carbon monoxide levels collectively contributed to a 1.3–2.0 Tg year−1 increase per year in the global methane sink, thereby buffering atmospheric methane growth rates. This increase in the methane sink was primarily concentrated in tropical regions and exhibited a north–south asymmetry. Periods of high methane growth were typically linked to abrupt OH level declines driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events such as mega wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study suggests a trade-off between O3 pollution control and methane removal mediated by OH and highlights the risk of increasing carbon monoxide emissions from widespread wildfires.",

          "abstract": "The multicellular coordination that underlies tissue homeostasis and disease progression is of fundamental interest1,2,3,4,5. However, how diverse cell types are organized within tissue niches for cohesive functioning remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized cross-tissue coordinated cellular modules in healthy tissues, uncovering their spatiotemporal dynamics and phenotypic associations, and examined their rewiring in cancer. We first compiled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 35 human tissues, revealing substantial inter-tissue variability in cellular composition. By leveraging covariance in cellular abundance, we identified 12 cellular modules with distinct cellular compositions, tissue prevalences and spatial organizations, and demonstrated coordinated intercellular communication within cellular modules using in situ spatial and in vivo perturbation data. Among them, two immune cellular modules in the spleen showed contrasting chronological dynamics with ageing. Analysis of multicellular changes in the breast revealed a menopausal trajectory associated with fibroblast dynamics. Furthermore, interrogation across cancer types uncovered simultaneous rewiring of two types of multicellular ecosystem during tumour progression, including the loss of tissue-specific healthy organization and the emergence of a convergent cancerous ecosystem. These findings reveal fundamental organizing principles of multicellular ecosystems in health and cancer, laying a foundation for further investigations into tissue-level functional coordination across diverse contexts.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electronvolt (eV)-scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications1,2. A variety of such magnetic states with non-trivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d-wave, g-wave or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets3,4,5,6,7. Achieving voltage-based control of the non-uniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energy-efficient and compact devices for information storage and processing8,9. Spin-spiral type II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order that directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry-protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order10,11,12,13,14. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principles calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent an observation of p-wave magnetism in a spin-spiral type II multiferroic, which may lead to the development of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.",

          "abstract": "Many species use a temporary decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate (torpor) as a strategy to survive food scarcity in a cool environment. Torpor is caused by preoptic neurons that express a variety of peptides and receptors1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but no single genetic marker has been found for this population. Here we report that expression of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3R) marks a unique population of median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) neurons that are required for both torpor and lipopolysaccharide-induced fever8. The MnPO-EP3R neurons produce persistent fever responses when inhibited and prolonged hypothermic responses when activated either chemogenetically or optogenetically, even for brief periods of time. The mechanism for these prolonged responses appears to involve increases in intracellular levels of cAMP and calcium that may persist for many minutes up to hours beyond the termination of a stimulus. These properties endow the population of MnPO-EP3R neurons with the ability to act as a two-way switch for the hypothermic and hyperthermic responses that are required for survival.",

          "abstract": "Fast thermal dephasing limits macroscopic quantum phenomena to cryogenic conditions1,2,3,4 and hinders their use at ambient temperatures5,6. For electronic excitations in condensed media, dephasing is mediated by thermal lattice motion1,7,8. Therefore, taming the lattice influence is essential for creating collective electronic quantum states at high temperatures. Although there are occasional reports of high-Tc quantum effects across different platforms, it is unclear which lattice characteristics and electron–lattice interactions lead to macroscopically coherent electronic states in solids9. Here we studied intensity fluctuations in the macroscopic polarization during the emergence of superfluorescence in a lead halide perovskite10 and showed that spontaneously synchronized polaronic lattice oscillations accompany collective electronic dipole emission. We further developed an effective field model and theoretically confirmed that exciton–lattice interactions lead to a new electronically and structurally entangled coherent extended solitonic state beyond a critical polaron density. The analysis shows a phase transition with two processes happening in tandem: incoherent disordered polaronic lattice deformations establish an order, while macroscopic quantum coherence among excitons simultaneously emerges. Recombination of excitons in this state culminates in superfluorescence at high temperatures. Our study establishes fundamental connections between the transient superfluorescence process observed after the impulsive excitation of perovskites and general equilibrium phase transitions achieved by thermal cooling. By identifying various electron–lattice interactions in the perovskite structure and their respective role in creating collectively coherent electronic effects in solids, our work provides unprecedented insight into the design and development of new materials that exhibit high-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena.",

For organic semiconductors (OSCs), the electrical performance has been extensively improved by developing doping methods and dopants9,10,11,12,13. However, compared with the state-of-the-art spatial resolution of inorganic semiconductor fabrication processes, OSCs lag far behind, limiting the construction of complex organic electronic devices5. Here we present a facile light-triggered doping strategy and develop a series of inactive photoactivable dopants (iPADs) for regionally controlled n-doping of OSCs. By converting iPADs into active dopants through ultraviolet (UV) exposure, controllable doping of various n-type OSCs with high electrical conductivity greater than 30 S cm−1 has been realized. Using iPADs can substantially improve the performances of OSCs in transistors, logic circuits and thermoelectrics. Also, regionally controlled doping is demonstrated in OSCs with a record resolution down to 1 μm. Overall, our strategy has achieved tunable doping levels in OSCs with high spatial resolution, which is expected to be highly suited for integrated circuits in both roll-to-roll and laboratory-scale environments.",

          "abstract": "There is ongoing debate as to when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved on Earth1,2. Geochemical data from ancient sediments indicate localized or ephemeral photosynthetic O2 production before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) approximately 2.5–2.3 billion years ago (Ga), and currently suggest Archaean origins, approximately 3 Ga or earlier3,4,5,6,7,8,9. However, sedimentary records of the early Earth often suffer from preservation issues, and poor control on the timing of oxidation leaves geochemical proxy data for the ancient presence of O2 open to critique10,11,12,13. Here, we report rare Earth element data from three different Archaean carbonate platforms preserved in greenstone belts of the northwest Superior Craton (Canada), which were deposited by the activity of marine photosynthetic bacteria 2.87 Ga, 2.85 Ga and 2.78 Ga. All three indicate O2 production before the GOE in the form of significant depletions in cerium (Ce), reflecting oxidative Ce removal from ancient seawater, as occurs today14. Using 138La-138Ce geochronology, we show that La/Ce fractionation, and thus Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, making these the oldest directly dated Ce anomalies. These results place the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier and bring an important new perspective on a long-standing debate regarding Earth’s biological and geochemical evolution.",

However, ex vivo manipulation and patient conditioning before transplantation are major hurdles that could be overcome by an in vivo approach. Here we demonstrate that in vivo gene delivery to HSPCs after systemic LV administration is enabled by the substantial trafficking of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow in newborn mice. We improved gene-transfer efficiency using a phagocytosis-shielded LV, successfully reaching bona fide HSPCs capable of long-term multilineage output and engraftment after serial transplantation, as confirmed by clonal tracking. HSPC mobilization further increased gene transfer, extending the window of intervention, although permissiveness to LV transduction declined with age. We successfully tested this in vivo strategy in mouse models of adenosine deaminase deficiency, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and Fanconi anaemia. Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer provided a selective advantage to corrected HSPCs in Fanconi anaemia, leading to near-complete haematopoietic reconstitution and prevention of bone marrow failure. Given that circulating HSPCs in humans are also most abundant shortly after birth, in vivo HSPC gene transfer holds strong translational potential across multiple diseases.",

          "abstract": "Lakes are crucial for ecosystems1, greenhouse gas emissions2 and water resources3, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations4,5. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes6,7,8, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001–2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user’s and producer’s accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset7. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world’s population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes9, protecting lacustrine systems10,11,12 and improving global climate models13,14. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.",

          "abstract": "The shale gas revolution has shifted propylene production from naphtha cracking to on-purpose production with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as the dominant technology1-9. Because PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures that favour sintering and coking, the challenge is to develop active and stable catalysts1-3 that are sufficiently stable10,11. Zeolite-supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been developed to balance activity, selectivity and stability12,13, and more recent work documented a PDH catalyst based on zeolite-anchored single rhodium atoms with exceptional performance and stability14. Here we show for silicalite-1 (S-1) that migration of encapsulated Pt-Sn2 clusters and hence agglomeration and anchoring within the zeolite versus agglomeration on the external surface can be controlled by adjusting the length of the S-1 crystals’ b-axis. We find that when this axis is longer than 2.00 μm, migration of Pt-Sn2 monomers during PDH results in intra-crystalline formation of (Pt-Sn2)2 dimers that are securely locked in the channels of S-1 and capable of converting pure propane feed to propylene at 550 °C for more than 6 months with 98.3% selectivity at 91% equilibrium conversion. This performance exceeds that of other Pt-based PDH catalysts and approaches that of the Rh-based catalyst. While synthesis requirements and cost are currently prohibitive for industrial use, we anticipate that our approach to controlling the migration and lockup of metals in zeolites may enable to development of other noble metal catalysts that offer extended service lifetimes in industrial applications15-17.",

Proposed models include highly magnetized neutron stars6, white-dwarf pulsars7 and white-dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions8. Although some models predict X-ray emission6,9, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches1,2,3,4,5,10.

Its correlated and highly variable X-ray and radio luminosities, combined with other observational properties, are unlike any known Galactic object. The source could be an old magnetar or an ultra-magnetized white dwarf; however, both interpretations present theoretical challenges.

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene that encodes an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other related DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis. Viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell, driving abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that likely prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA by DRT9 in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.",

He was leading a large team at a marketing and communications agency and invited me to chat. He introduced me to the agency’s chief executive, who was planning an event and wanted me to give a seminar inspired by one of my publications on how stress and anxiety can spread from leaders to their team members. Her tone was enthusiastic and genuine, and the connection felt personal. I agreed to help shape the session.\n\nWe had three meetings. I adjusted the content to fit the audience. I drafted an outline. And although I mentioned a fee during the first two calls, I waited until the final exchange to send an actual quote in writing. It was a symbolic amount, far below market rate — and more of an honorarium, given the personal connection.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nI followed up.\n\nNot a word.\n\nNo pushback. No negotiation. No ‘thanks but no thanks’. Just silence.\n\nThat silence was the clearest message possible: my time was valuable to the agency only if it was free.\n\nThe greater good\n\nExperiences like this are common in academia. Corporations and public-sector organizations routinely reach out to academics across disciplines, asking for expertise, insights or participation. The offer is framed as an ‘opportunity’. Sometimes the organizations mention visibility; sometimes they dangle the vague possibility of future collaboration, or free or discounted services. What’s almost never on the table?\n\nMoney.\n\nCollection: Time management\n\nLet’s be clear, this is unpaid labour. And, in many cases, the offer is structured that way deliberately. Yes, researchers often conduct unpaid work that serves our academic community: the scholarly ecosystem depends on everyone to pitch in, from serving on committees to peer review (which can raise issues related to, but slightly separate from, the ones I'm highlighting here). Plus, many of us have a romanticized idea that we should share our knowledge freely, as part of some higher mission. That the work is its own reward.\n\nAnd so we overcommit. We publish, teach, mentor, review, advise, engage and serve, all while chasing grant money to justify our existence. Especially for early-career researchers, the pressure to be ‘seen’ can be intense. Saying no feels like self-sabotage. Worse, many researchers worry that asking for payment will make them look difficult or entitled.\n\nBut every time we accept unpaid external work, we reinforce a broken norm. We teach organizations that academic insight is free. We lower the bar for what counts as professional respect. And we participate, whether we realize it or not, in the erosion of our own boundaries. Plus, there’s the opportunity cost of the time we’ve given away — the loss of the chance to do something else with that time.\n\nNot all unpaid work is bad. There are causes worth supporting and people worth helping. But researchers should be selective and support causes that align with their values. Unpaid work should be the exception, not the rule.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to shift the narrative, which have helped me to protect my time and value as a professional.\n\nSet clear fees or ‘rate sheets’\n\nEven if it’s just a short document outlining what you charge for a lecture, workshop or advisory session, having a tangible list of services and fees forces you and any prospective partner to treat your labour as professional work. Adjust rates as needed for non-profit organizations or public-interest endeavours. But don’t let your default be ‘free’.\n\nCollection: Work-life balance",

          "abstract": "Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future Neil Shubin Dutton (2025)\n\nOn his first fossil-hunting expedition to the Arctic regions of Greenland in 1988, evolutionary biologist and science writer Neil Shubin felt utterly disoriented. It was daylight around the clock, with the sun sweeping a great ellipse across the sky. Life’s rhythm was determined not by light, but by sound; glacially fed rivers roared at midday but, by 3 a.m., had faded to quiet trickles.\n\nAs the Arctic and Antarctica grow warmer, the fragile window available to us for understanding these icy outposts and the planetary processes they control is rapidly closing, writes Shubin in Ends of the Earth, an ambitious and far-reaching introduction to the polar regions. He explores polar science through the work of leading researchers and examines broader issues, such as how melting ice is beginning to expose microorganisms previously unknown to science.\n\nClimate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice\n\nHe weaves his own story, and those of his collaborators, into a broader narrative that touches on geopolitical issues and the lives of pioneering explorers. The book is packed with information, such as the fact that the polar ice caps have existed for only about 10% of Earth’s history. The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, and the species’ migration out of Africa, occurred at a moment when Earth’s physical geography — its coastlines, islands and ocean levels — was defined by “the amount of water locked in polar ice”, Shubin writes.\n\nAnd that is the book’s key insight. The polar regions drive global climate, environmental dynamics and even human evolution — and have done so for millions of years. This helps to explain why the poles are so crucial to policy debates about climate change. The permafrost holds 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon — about twice the amount in the atmosphere.\n\nA second point highlighted by the author is the unique value of the polar regions for scientific discovery, owing to their extreme and unusual physical conditions. For example, Antarctica’s dry, stable air and vast ice sheets make it one of the best places on Earth to collect interstellar dust, which settles and is preserved in the snow.\n\nLayers of history\n\nThe layered structure of polar ice acts as a natural archive of Earth’s climate history, allowing scientists to reconstruct past temperatures. And the polar regions host extraordinary forms of life. Ecosystems in Antarctic subglacial lakes — buried some 3 kilometres beneath the ice — might have evolved in complete isolation for millions of years, and some microbes in the pitch-dark conditions can metabolize minerals to survive. Research into these habitats can offer rare insights into life in extreme environments, Shubin writes.\n\nHowever, by focusing so much on ice sheets, the author unintentionally reinforces the idea that the polar regions are defined by glacial ice. This might apply to Antarctica, a whole continent covered by ice, but is not true of the Arctic, whose landscapes include tundra and, by most reckonings, forests. Much of that region remained unglaciated even in the last ice age.\n\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914–17), led by Ernest Shackleton, aimed to make the first land crossing of Antarctica.Credit: Smith Archive/Alamy\n\nShubin notes how a definition of the Arctic is elusive. It has been framed over the centuries by various markers, including the northern tree line, the Arctic Circle and political or cultural boundaries. Yet, in the book, the Arctic is widely portrayed mainly as Greenland and the heavily glaciated high Arctic archipelagos — regions that most resemble Antarctica.\n\nFrom crevasse falls to polar bears, train fieldwork leaders for emergencies",

          "authors": "Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "The Singapore freshwater crab is, it’s fair to say, picky.\n\nA diminutive, nocturnal creature, Johora singaporensis lives only along a handful of hill streams in small pockets of relatively unvisited rainforest in and around the nature reserves of Singapore.\n\nNature Spotlight: Singapore\n\nThe city-state covers just 730 square kilometres — 16% of which is rainforest — yet is home to almost 6 million people. That doesn’t leave a lot of room for crabs. Plus, “there are very few hills in Singapore”, says Darren Yeo, a freshwater ecologist at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Because of its stringent habitat requirements, says Yeo, “this crab was bound to be endangered at some point”. Even so, Yeo was surprised when, in 2008, an undergraduate student in his department returned empty handed from a survey of one of three known locations of the crab. “That started the ball rolling, when people started pressing panic buttons,” says Yeo.\n\nSince Singapore was made a trading outpost by the British in 1819, scientists estimate1 that human activities, such as deforestation, have led to an extinction rate of 37%. Now, however, the country’s central government is working to protect and develop the natural world as part of its city-planning strategy, which it says will improve mental health, keep urban temperatures down and safeguard the country’s environmental legacy.\n\nIt was through this strategy that the Singapore freshwater crab found a reprieve. Shortly after the discovery that its numbers were dwindling, a sophisticated conservation strategy kicked into gear. The National Parks Board (NParks), Singapore’s nature authority, formed a working group with representatives from academia, government agencies, non-governmental organizations and international conservation specialists. Together, they developed a captive-breeding programme for the crabs and released some of them at suitable sites to boost wild populations. Today, J. singaporensis is still endangered, but not facing imminent extinction.\n\nFieldwork revealed that the number of freshwater crabs was dwindling in Singapore.Credit: E.X.P. Toh\nPaving the way\n\nSingapore’s population grew by 2% last year, and by 5% the year before that. Like many high-income nations, its birth rate is decreasing, but it is courting international workers to make up the deficit and keep economic targets at 5% growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Of its 6 million people, 1.9 million are classed as non-residents, including foreign workers and students. The country’s economy is shepherded by its central government, which employs more than 150,000 people and maintains a tight grip on the country’s institutions. The government, which has been in power since independence in 1959, is listed as a ‘flawed democracy’ in the Economist Intelligence Unit 2024 Democracy Index, ranking between Sri Lanka and Guyana. Its GDP per capita, meanwhile, ranks as the highest in Asia, and compares with that of Norway.\n\nIn May, the country went to the polls to re-elect the People’s Action Party, which found itself unopposed in 5 of the 97 seats being contested. Only 2.8 million people were eligible to vote in the election, and the People’s Action Party’s biggest rival, the Workers’ Party, contested only 26 seats. Voting is compulsory in Singapore, and, according to a 2024 report2 from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the country’s media industry is straightjacketed by an “elaborate network of laws governing traditional and online media”. “The laws give the government the right to order the publication of ‘corrections’ to online content that it considers to be erroneous, or to prevent a ‘diminution of public confidence’ in the government,” the report says.\n\nSingapore’s shoreline changed substantially between 1989 (left) and 2018 (right).Credit: Landsat/EROS/USGS\n\nSince 1960, Singapore has reclaimed around 150 square kilometres of land from the sea. In part, this is to meet demand for homes: around 80% of Singaporeans live in government-provided housing, nicknamed HDBs, after the Housing and Development Board, and many of those are in high-density skyscrapers. Singapore is the third most densely populated territory in the world, after Macau and the city-state of Monaco. Alongside this, the country’s economic success is buttressed by being the world’s busiest port outside China, hosting more than 3.11 billion tonnes in traffic last year.\n\nThis urban development and economic success has come at a cost for the natural environment: where once there was jungle, there is now city. Singapore has lost almost all of its primary rainforest, except for a small tract of land in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, which sits in the middle of the island and is part of one of the two main water catchment areas. Although some of the country’s remaining non-primary rainforests, including in the Central Catchment, are protected from development, their long-term fate is a concern for environmentalists.\n\nIn 2023, Desmond Lee, the country’s national development minister, said that nearly 100,000 homes were likely to be built by 2025. Woodland areas, including Pang Sua and Clementi Forest, are scheduled for development, although the government says that there is no immediate need for construction. “The land area we’re working with is so small, which means we have to be very smart about how we do it,” says Harvey Neo, who studies the urban environment from the leafy campus of the Singapore University of Technology and Design.\n\nHow farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool\n\nIn a bid to achieve its sustainability goals, the government has pledged to plant one million trees by 2030 and transplant 100,000 corals into its marine waters, which NParks said in 2024 would take at least 10 years to complete. Neither project is without controversy. “Nobody is tracking how many trees we are cutting down while we are planting a million trees,” says Andie Ang, a primatologist at Mandai Nature, a wildlife organization affiliated with Mandai Wildlife Reserve, and president of the environmental charity the Jane Goodall Institute Singapore. “How about those century-old trees that are being cut down for development?” One person told Nature, anonymously, that government representatives had initially suggested transplanting one million corals into local waters: a figure that the source said was unrealistic.\n\nAnother concern is the availability of information. Academics and civil-society groups say that they cannot access the same data that are available to government agencies. “There’s not always a one-to-one connectivity in terms of the data that civil society is privy to and the data that government and civil service is privy to, and very often that leads to miscommunication between these two parties,” says ecologist Sankar Ananthanarayanan at the NUS. Together with Ang, Ananthanarayanan co-authored the 2024 Singapore Terrestrial Conservation Plan, which outlines the views and concerns of the country’s environmental groups.\n\nCivil servants dispute this characterization. “At least 80% of our work is collaborative, because we can’t do it on our own,” says Lim Liang Jim, who runs the conservation division of NParks. Some species data might be withheld from the public to protect against poaching, he adds.\n\nOne recommendation put forward by the Terrestrial Conservation Plan is to improve communication and consultation around plans to clear forests for development. However, some people remain sceptical. “In a place like Singapore, usually by the time you know that a patch of forest is going to be developed, they’re going to do it, no matter what,” says Kalai Vanan Balakrishnan, who is chief executive of the non-profit organization the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES).\n\nA city in nature\n\nSingapore has a robust and detailed urban-planning system, however, and that means all proposed buildings are assessed for their environmental impact and contribution to the country’s green image. Government planning policies are stringent, and include a range of requirements, from mandatory environmental sustainability standards for all new buildings to improve energy performance and increase green construction practices to smaller obligations, such as incorporating planter boxes with vegetation on overhead pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe country is among the greenest cities in the world in terms of plant coverage. Treepedia, a remote-sensing urban tree-canopy monitoring project led by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab in Cambridge, and the World Economic Forum in Cologny, Switzerland, found that Singapore had the second-best canopy cover of street trees, after Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe government has a long-stated ambition of keeping urban spaces full of plant life — a series of policies bundled into the plan to create a ‘city in nature’. There are a variety of reasons behind this, says Tan Puay Yok, who studies urban greening and ecology at the NUS. “By placing greenery closer to where people live and closer to buildings, the buildings are shaded from solar radiation,” he says. “Cooling of the environment is one big thing.”\n\nOtter populations returned to Singapore, thanks to sustainability measures.Credit: CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe approach is effective: the 62-hectare Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in the centre of the island can be up to 3 °C cooler than high-density residential blocks nearby. This is valuable in a country where summer temperatures can reach 36 °C. “It’s very easy to feel it as you walk round the city”, says Chua Siew Chin, who studies forest ecology at NUS. “Singapore has warmed up a lot over the years; greening can help with that.”\n\nThere are psychological benefits, too. “We know that even just looking at greenery makes people feel better,” says Yok. Vegetation also provides noise mitigation and soaks up water from rainfall, he adds. “This all ties back to having that scientific understanding of how greenery benefits urban dwellers living in a dense city like Singapore.”\n\nMeet the researchers pioneering Spanish climate solutions",

          "authors": "Martín De Ambrosio, Fermín Koop",
          "abstract": "Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nMore than 1,000 scientists took to the streets yesterday in Buenos Aires and other cities in Argentina, some of them wearing gas masks like those seen in the Argentine Netflix series The Eternaut. Playing on the post-apocalyptic television program’s theme — that oppression can be overcome by unity — they protested the demolition of science, or ‘scienticide’, in the country, which they say was initiated by the administration of President Javier Milei.\n\n‘There will be nothing left’: researchers fear collapse of science in Argentina\n\nSince Milei took office in late 2023, he has made massive cuts to government spending, in part to reduce the country’s deficit and bring down inflation. As a consequence, many scientific activities in Argentina have ground to a halt for want of funding, the science sector has lost more than 4,000 workers, and low salaries have prompted many researchers to leave for jobs abroad.\n\nResearch funding has completely stopped, Fernando Stefani, a physicist at the University of Buenos Aires, told Nature at the protest. “It hasn’t been fulfilled in any way — zero,” he said, even for research contracts that had already been approved and were in progress. The National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, which is the main funder of research projects in Argentina, hasn’t made any calls for new projects since late 2023, either.\n\nArgentina’s main science agency, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), which funds about 280 research institutes across the country and employs most of the nation’s scientists, has been paying salaries but not much more, sources say. Some researchers who spoke to Nature aren’t sure whether they will be able to feed laboratory animals in the coming weeks. And even though salaries are being paid, they have dropped by about 40% since Milei took office. “The salaries of younger researchers are on the verge of poverty levels, and those of older researchers are not enough for a decent life,” Stefani said at the protest.\n\nAlthough Milei’s actions have brought year-on-year inflation down to its lowest level in three years, the prices of many goods such as fuel have risen. Meanwhile, government spending cuts have left people without many basic services. “The research system is simply being allowed to be destroyed through inaction and underfunding,” Stefani said at the protest.\n\nA protester on a subway platform holds a sign that says, “Without science there is no future”.Credit: RAICYT\n\nMilei has expressed animosity towards scientists, suggesting that they are freeloading off the government, and during his presidential campaign promised to shut down CONICET entirely. So far, he has not followed through on this pledge, but “it’s like death by starvation”, Lidia Szczupak, a neuroscientist at the CONICET-funded Institute of Physiology, Molecular Biology and Neurosciences at the University of Buenos Aires, told Nature at yesterday’s march. “Our salary is very poor — we are carrying on for the love” of science, she added.\n\nCONICET did not respond to Nature’s request for comment by the time this story was published.\n\nChainsaw government",

          "title": "Trump’s call for ‘gold-standard science’ has prompted an outcry: here’s why",
          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson, Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has been tasked with guiding US agencies to develop new scientific-integrity policies.Credit: Kevin Carter/Getty\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last week, mandating the overhaul of research-integrity policies, to ensure that the federal government promotes “gold standard science” that is “transparent, rigorous, and impactful”. But many researchers fear that the order will do the opposite, by putting US scientists and science under the thumb of political appointees — and they are mobilizing opposition.\n\n‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts\n\nThe order, titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”, states that research-integrity issues, including high-profile retractions and an inability to reproduce many scientific studies, have caused the public to lose faith in science. It accuses Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence when crafting public policies on climate change, public-health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and more. The order comes as the Trump administration slashes funding for science across federal agencies and at major US research universities.\n\nAlthough many researchers agree that breaches of scientific integrity are important to address, some who spoke to Nature worry that language in the 23 May order opens the door to political interference in US science.\n\n“It all sounds very non-objectionable, but it’s extremely dangerous” in its details and subtext, says Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The order “steamrolls” long-standing efforts to create a buffer between science and politics, says Goldman, who helped to develop scientific-integrity policies under Biden that the latest order revokes. For instance, enforcement of the new research-integrity policies could be left up to political appointees rather than non-partisan career government employees, as was required under Biden.\n\nVictoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for the US Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which coordinates science policy across the government, said to Nature in a statement that the order creates a path to rebuilding trust between the scientific community and the public “through common-sense scientific principles”. She also accused the Biden administration of incorporating “radical woke ideology” into the scientific enterprise by introducing diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. “If that’s not politicizing science, I don’t know what is,” she said.\n\nThe latest order has incensed some in the scientific community: nearly 4,900 scientists and others had signed an open letter at the time this story was published, arguing that it promotes a “Fool’s Gold” standard for science. “The Executive Order further consolidates political control over the Nation’s scientific infrastructure, co-opting the language of open science to implement a system under which direct presidential appointees are given broad latitude to designate many common and important scientific activities as scientific misconduct, and to penalize those involved accordingly,” the letter says.\n\nCompeting policies\n\nDuring Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, researchers and public-policy specialists repeatedly accused his administration of undermining science and censoring government scientists. For instance, scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were sidelined as the administration sought to weaken environmental and public-health regulations; later, in a survey, hundreds of researchers reported political interference in their work. Partially in response, Biden issued an executive order during his first week in office in 2021, calling on some 30 federal agencies to create or update scientific-integrity policies to shield government scientists from political interference.\n\nMichael Kratsios, head of the OSTP, has criticized the scientific community for quashing voices of dissent.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nTrump’s executive order revokes those policies while calling for the OSTP to issue guidance within the next 30 days on establishing new ones; federal agencies then have 60 days to develop policies and report back to the OSTP. Among other requirements, the order directs agencies to ensure that their policies “protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration of alternative scientific opinions”. OSTP head Michael Kratsios and other Trump officials have said that scientific groupthink on topics such as climate change and the COVID-19 response has squashed valid opinions and caused harm.\n\nOne of the main fears among critics of the order is that Trump’s policies will allow agencies to put politically appointed officials in charge of investigations into allegations relating to research integrity. That could enable the administration to punish government scientists for failing to meet vague expectations to “transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties” when using data in agency decision-making. “This could be used as a cudgel to punish almost anyone. It’s just frightening,” says one senior government official who has worked on scientific-integrity issues under multiple administrations. The official requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nEmphasizing uncertainty",

          "authors": "Maya Gosztyla",
          "abstract": "I spend nearly as much time on planning and documenting experiments as I do on running them.Credit: Michael Copeland\n\nLast September, right after finishing my PhD in biomedical sciences, I joined BrainStorm Therapeutics as one of its co-founders and lead scientist.\n\nI stumbled across the biotechnology start-up company, based in San Diego, California, by happenstance: a recruiter for another job I’d applied for unsuccessfully was also recruiting for BrainStorm. A meeting with two of the company’s co-founders clarified for me that we were a good match: I had the niche scientific expertise they were looking for, and the company was exactly aligned with my interests and career goals. I’d known before starting my PhD that I wanted a career in industry, and I’d become increasingly drawn to the fast-paced start-up world.\n\nAnd Brainstorm’s mission, to overcome the more-than-90% failure rate of clinical trials involving neurological diseases, by using brain organoids for drug discovery, appealed to me. During my PhD at the University of California, San Diego, one of my projects focused on modelling human diseases using brain organoids.\n\nA brain organoid is essentially a tiny 3D sphere of brain cells that we grow from stem cells derived from a patient. The organoids act like mini brains, with multiple cell types and spontaneous electrical activity. In contrast to conventional disease models involving mice, which have largely failed to predict efficacy of treatments in humans, organoids present an all-in-human system to evaluate therapeutics using clinically relevant screening endpoints. BrainStorm uses brain organoids in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) to discover therapeutics for diseases including Parkinson’s and rare genetic epilepsies.\n\nFor me, landing this role is a great example of how luck often plays a major part in our career trajectories; sometimes you just have to be in the right place at the right time. It’s certainly not easy — by the time I spoke to the recruiter, I’d already spent several months unsuccessfully applying for jobs while wrapping up graduate school — but persistence is key.\n\nIn my first few months, I’ve seen first-hand how biotech is a wildly different beast from academia. It soon became clear that organizational skills, which I’ve written about for Nature’s Careers section, are even more crucial in business than they were during my PhD. These skills, incidentally, served me well: I graduated in five years on the dot, well below the average for my laboratory, despite facing delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and twice going on strike as a member of the University of California academic workers’ union.\n\nTime management for entrepreneurs\n\nIn a previous article for Nature, I mentioned that one of the most challenging aspects of graduate school for me was that it’s easy to waste days on unimportant or unfocused work. This is doubly true as an entrepreneur. You’re your own boss, so there’s no one else to hold you accountable and ensure that you spend your time and energy wisely.\n\nJust like during graduate school, I manage my goals at an annual, a quarterly and a weekly level. I always start with the big picture: where do the other co-founders and I want our company to be, a year from now, and how should we be spending our time to accomplish this? These goals will inevitably shift, too, so it’s important to revisit the conversation regularly. I use a Notion page to track our high-level goals over time.\n\nI’ve learnt that a common challenge for biotech start-ups is to work out how much effort to devote to fundraising, as opposed to research. There’s no single answer that works for every company, but it’s important to regularly audit whether you’re balancing these tasks appropriately for your goals.\n\nI’ve continued to plan how I’ll spend every hour in my workdays, using the task-management tool Todoist and Google Calendar. I build this plan after our Monday-morning meetings, in which the team discusses goals for the week and divides up action items. Once a month, I look back at how I’ve spent my time and evaluate whether I need to make any adjustments.\n\nFor a start-up on a lean budget, time is your most valuable asset; guard it closely. Don’t be afraid to decline commitments that don’t align with your long-term vision.\n\nTime management for scientists\nAs I did in graduate school, I take 5 minutes first thing every morning to check my RSS-feed aggregator and bookmark any papers that I want to read later. I block out an hour or two on Friday mornings to read through these and take notes. I also like to set aside time for continued learning; there are a ton of free or low-cost online courses available from sites like Coursera, Udemy and edX. During my lunch break, I’ll often watch course videos on topics ranging from AI and programming to business and finance.\n\nI have a lot more meetings these days (internal discussions, investment pitches, networking events and so on) than I did in graduate school, so my calendar varies a lot, day-to-day. I try to batch meetings together in the first or the second half of the day, so that I can spend the other half focusing on research. I spend a large portion of my time growing organoids and running experiments, as well as writing code for AI disease-modelling work.\n\nAcademia is the Wild West when it comes to lab notebooks, in that nothing is standardized, but record-keeping becomes a lot more serious in industry (I think this is true in any company, even more so for one engaged in biomedical research). Maintaining a detailed electronic lab notebook is crucial for documenting inventions, ensuring regulatory compliance and building an organized data repository (this can be virtual) for investors. I spend nearly as much time planning and documenting my experiments as I do actually running them.",

          "authors": "Edouard Machery, John M. Doris",
          "abstract": "Anatomy of a Train Wreck: The Rise and Fall of Priming Research Ruth Leys Univ. Chicago Press (2024)\n\nIn 1996, psychologists reported that people walk more slowly after reading words associated with ageing, such as ‘grey’ and ‘old’. This delightfully unexpected finding — an example of a phenomenon called social priming, in which stimuli such as meaningful words unconsciously influence behaviour — became one of the most influential results in the field of social psychology (J. A. Bargh et al. J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 71, 230–244; 1996).\n\nIt also heralded a reproducibility crisis. In 2012, another team of psychologists reported that it had tried and failed to replicate the result. Despite a vigorous defence of the original study in now-deleted blogposts by its lead author, John Bargh, most psychologists have since concluded that what they came to call the elderly effect is probably not real. As other results in the field also toppled, the crisis stimulated fierce debate about how to study the ways in which humans think and behave.\n\nWhat’s next for psychology’s embattled field of social priming\n\nThis revealing episode is the subject of Anatomy of a Train Wreck, in which historian of science Ruth Leys asks how a supposed breakthrough in a provocative and influential research field turned out, ultimately, to be a cautionary tale. Packed with compelling research, her engaging account will be of interest to anyone curious about psychology and influences on human behaviour.\n\nLeys begins by examining one of the dominant strands of social psychology in the 1970s and 80s, attribution research. Investigations of how people understand their own and others’ behaviours, as the result of either one’s character or of circumstances, suggested that people are sometimes ignorant of why they take the actions that they do. For instance, people tend to make up explanations — insisting, say, that they chose one of two identical objects because they had ‘noticed’ that one was of higher quality.\n\nThis work laid the foundations for theories of social priming by seeming to show that actions are not — or at least, not always — the product of conscious decision-making, but can be the result of unconscious processes.\n\nConforming to expectations\n\nLeys then carefully recounts social priming’s troubles. Critics argued that the elderly effect was a consequence of participants conforming to experimenters’ expectations about how they would behave, rather than responding to the cue words alone. Avoiding inadvertently influencing participants is a familiar methodological difficulty in psychology experiments, which Bargh insisted his team had addressed. Nonetheless, repeated attempts to replicate the finding failed. So did efforts to replicate many other examples of social priming — such as the ‘professor effect’, in which thinking of a professor while taking a test supposedly improves results.\n\nReplication games: how to make reproducibility research more systematic\n\nLeys goes beyond this history to question theories that underpin the fields of social psychology and cognitive science. Her critique is influenced by the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe’s classic work on the theory of human action, Intention (1957). Like Anscombe, Leys highlights the difference between reasons and causes when it comes to explaining and justifying actions.\n\nBehaviours make sense in light of people’s reasons — they might buy ice cream because they want to eat ice cream, for instance. By contrast, actions needn’t make sense in light of causes — someone could buy ice cream because they are hypnotized, say, regardless of their wants and needs. Leys argues that many social psychologists, including Bargh, have missed this difference; they focus exclusively on the causes of actions and ignore people’s reasons. And, she continues, social-priming experiments fail to replicate, in part, because people always have unique reasons for their actions, which depend on their individual histories. For instance, she suggests, whether people walk more slowly when they read a word such as ‘old’ depends on what they want and believe: after all, they could equally well walk faster to help an old person.\n\nA person’s behaviour is shaped by context.Credit: Getty",

The asteroid’s small size and fast spin — a full rotation takes only 28 minutes — will make gathering samples challenging.\n\nOther countries have brought back samples from asteroids. Japan nipped bits off asteroids Itokawa and Ryugu, and the United States snatched samples from Bennu. China has previously returned samples from the Moon’s near and far sides.\n\nKamo‘oalewa is considered a quasi-satellite of Earth: it dances around the planet in an oscillating orbit, but is too far away to be tied to Earth by gravity, as the Moon is. The asteroid basically hangs around Earth’s vicinity, says Li Chunlai, a planetary scientist at the NAOC.\n\nBy studying samples from Kamo‘oalewa, researchers hope to determine whether it was once part of the Moon — and was chipped away during a collision event — or has escaped from the asteroid belt that circles between Mars and Jupiter. “This is still debatable,” says Marco Fenucci, a mathematician who studies the dynamics of small astronomical bodies at the European Space Agency, near Rome. No asteroids in the Solar System are known to come from the Moon. “I am really excited for what is to come and to see what surprises this asteroid will reveal,” says Fenucci, following news of the successful launch. He expects researchers will learn a lot about asteroids of Kamo‘oalewa’s size from the mission.\n\nThe samples will also help researchers to understand how asteroids form and evolve, says Li.\n\nThree options\n\nAs Tianwen-2 heads towards Kamo‘oalewa, it will make a few tweaks to its course, open up its solar-panel wings and test its scientific instruments. It is scheduled to arrive at its first stop in the middle of next year, and stay there for about nine months, according to posts on social media.\n\nThe Tianwen-2 team doesn’t quite know what to expect when the craft arrives at Kamo‘oalewa, so has planned three approaches for collecting samples. The first strategy involves the probe descending to about one metre above the asteroid, and hovering while a robotic arm extends to collect material from the surface. The spacecraft could also extend a sampling probe that brushes up loose material. And if conditions permit, the spacecraft will land on the asteroid with its three legs and anchor itself with the robotic arm to collect material.",

          "abstract": "Taking a risk by opening the door to a new research field can have negative consequences for scientists, at least in the short term, a study shows.Credit: Dwayne Senior/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nShifting to a different research field can have negative consequences for a scientist, according to an analysis1. A team assessed millions of scientific papers and concluded that, when a scientist moves away from their original area of expertise, their publications receive fewer citations than their previous work. The larger the shift, the greater the effect — a phenomenon the authors of the study have named the ‘pivot penalty’.\n\nRenewal of NIH grants linked to more innovative results, study finds\n\nThe study, published today in Nature, also investigates cases in which an external event such as a disease outbreak drives the shift in focus. The findings suggest potential consequences for the recent US research-funding cuts — targeted at research topics including misinformation and the health of minority groups — that could push scientists to change fields.\n\n“When you move out of the area in which you’re trusted, you lose that recognition,” says Kieron Flanagan, a science-policy specialist at the University of Manchester, UK, adding that he is not surprised by the results of the analysis. But the sheer amount of data that the team evaluated sets the study apart, he says.\n\n“I hadn’t seen an analysis of that particular issue done at that scale,” says James Wilsdon, director of the Research on Research Institute in London.\n\nQuantifying the pivot\n\nThe authors measured scientific pivots by scrutinizing the reference sections of 25.8 million research papers published between 1970 and 2015. They compared the citations in a paper with those cited by the same author in the previous three years; specifically, they analysed the journals in which the cited papers were published.\n\nGiven that journals are mostly topic-specific, this shows the scientific fields that a researcher typically draws from, says Dashun Wang, a computational social scientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and a co-author of the study. “If, all of a sudden, I’m citing journals that I’ve never cited, it’s an indication that I’m doing something very different than what I usually do,” Wang says.\n\nAccording to the analysis, a pivot is large if, for instance, a researcher moves from crime-data assessment to forecasting the spread of COVID-19. By contrast, a small pivot would be moving from research on bat-derived influenza viruses to studying the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe researchers found that, the larger the pivot size, the less likely a paper is to rank among the top 5% most-cited papers published in its field that year. They also determined that it was more difficult for scientists to get their papers published after a pivot (see ‘When risks don’t pay off’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\n“It’s a very strong relationship, and it’s pretty universal,” says co-author Benjamin Jones, an economist at Northwestern University, who points out that the trend holds for patents as well. The team analysed 1.7 million patents granted in the United States from 1980 to 2015 and found a similar phenomenon when evaluating the technology areas listed in a patent’s citations.\n\nThe authors were motivated to investigate research pivots because of the massive shift towards studying COVID-19 during the pandemic. “We thought, ‘this is great that everyone wants to help, but how helpful will it be when people are jumping in from areas further and further away [from COVID-19]?’,” Jones says. The analysis found that, even though COVID-19 research was in high demand and papers on the topic were more likely to be published in high-impact journals during the pandemic, researchers coming into the area from outside fields still experienced the pivot penalty.",

          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "As US science policy continues to shift under the administration of President Donald Trump, the impacts are rippling beyond the nation’s borders. In Canada, researchers are feeling the heat. Canadian academics are some of the Americas’ top research collaborators, and receive funding from US agencies, either directly or through international partnerships. As a result, they have not been spared the funding cuts and job losses that are plaguing their US counterparts.\n\nTo Jeff Cardille, a landscape ecologist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, the trend is clear: all US-funded international projects he’s involved in have been cut since January. These studies focused on deforestation and land-use changes, but Cardille is reluctant to give more details, to avoid putting his colleagues’ jobs in jeopardy.\n\n“It feels strange,” he says. “Two months ago, I would have been thrilled to talk” about the work. “Now, I don’t feel comfortable even mentioning these things existed.”\n\nThe loss of these projects disrupts not only his work, but also that of his students who were planning to make them part of their scientific training. “I just recruited a graduate student from Mexico, now I don’t know what I can promise her in terms of research experience,” he says.\n\nElena Bennett, an ecologist at McGill University (and Cardille’s wife), is also aware of several international projects that have been shut down, including some that she was involved in. She is similarly hesitant to say more.\n\n“Some were just told ‘you’re done, move on’,” says Bennett. “Others are unsure if they’re still going to get funding, if they still have jobs. Everything is on hold until we see how this will shake out.”\n\nThe uncertainty, and the seemingly random nature of the cuts and firings, are taking a toll on those affected. “Every time I get on a Zoom call there is another person crying,” says Cardille. “Every meeting feels like a funeral for our careers.”\n\nEcologist Elena Bennett has witnessed the discontinuation of some projects.Credit: Yannick Peterhans / USC Wrigley Institute\nLong-standing links\n\nThere is a long history of close partnerships and collaboration in science between Canada and the United States, says Chad Gaffield, chief executive of the U15, a group of some of Canada’s most research-intensive universities, in Ottawa. But in recent years, many countries have begun to focus more on their own domestic capacity to underpin their sovereignty, allowing them to engage internationally without leaving them vulnerable to geopolitical shifts.\n\n“There’s no doubt the world of research is global, but as we learnt in the pandemic, we’re not living in a global village,” he says. “However intertwined we are, borders still make a big difference.”\n\nResearchers in Canada receive funding from a variety of US funding agencies, but the largest share comes from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. In the 2023 fiscal year, Canada received more than 90 NIH awards, which amounted to roughly Can$60 million (US$45 million). The total research budget of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) is around Can$1.3 billion.\n\nResearchers at McGill University and its affiliates currently lead 7 projects funded by the NIH and collaborate on another 86 that are led by institutions in the United States, according to a university spokesperson. In the 2023 fiscal year, around 2% of McGill’s total research funding came from US funders, says Dominique Bérubé, McGill’s vice-president of research and innovation, so the direct financial effects of any cuts on the university will be limited. “Cuts to that total won’t impact the university in a major way, but it might impact individuals who are more connected to their US collaborators,” she says.\n\nMcGill University leads seven NIH-funded projects and collaborates on dozens more led by U.S. institutions.Credit: Gabriel Mello/Getty\n\nOther institutions, such as the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada, are in a similar situation. “Of UBC’s total research funding, only about 1% comes from the US NIH,” says a university spokesperson. The University of Toronto is aware of a few cancelled grants and is continuing to monitor the situation closely, says a spokesperson. But, they add: “At this point, it is too early to fully assess the impact of the current uncertainties for our researchers receiving funding from US government sources, as well as for any research collaborations with colleagues in the United States.”\n\nVincent Poitout, vice-rector of research at the University of Montreal, says that the university gets between about Can$4 million and $5.5 million a year from the NIH. “It’s not an insignificant amount at all,” he says. Part of Poitout’s own research on diabetes is funded by a portion of a four-year NIH grant, known as a sub-award, held by a colleague at the University of California, Davis. This year’s portion of the award arrived in mid-April, about a month later than usual. The timing was fortuitous: an NIH policy issued on 1 May stipulates that all grants that include foreign sub-awards must be paused until a new formula for such awards is issued in the autumn. “Thankfully, our own grant seems to be safe, but others have been cut,” he says.\n\nHowever, Poitout says that uncertainty around whether the funding will continue after the autumn is almost worse than knowing it will be cut, especially for the postdoctoral researcher and master’s student who are working on the grant. “It’s starting to create chaos, making people so worried they’re paralysed,” he says. “But I’ll never have my students pay the price, I’ll find a way to continue their training.”\n\nIt is not just the potential loss of grant money that is affecting researchers in Canada, says Sarah Laframboise, executive director of the campaign group Evidence for Democracy in Ottawa. She says that the cuts to funding and staff are disrupting a lot of key connections in joint research projects, with Canadian researchers sometimes abruptly losing contact with their US counterparts.\n\nShe says that big cuts to staff at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made fisheries-management collaborations more difficult and could disrupt the data sharing that Canada relies on for weather forecasting and disaster management. “The loss of that data will be very detrimental to not only researchers but everyday Canadians as well,” Laframboise says.\n\nSarah Laframboise worries about the Trump administration’s restrictions on certain fields of research.\n\nLaframboise is also concerned about the Trump administration’s crackdown on research areas that are considered to be ‘political’, such as anything related to climate, environment, race and gender. Many funders, including the NIH, now have lists of words that could trigger a review of grant applications.\n\n“I worry about the politicization of these words and subject areas, and whether those ideological shifts might come into Canada,” she says.\n\nThat concern is not unfounded. Some researchers in Canada who are working on US-funded projects have been sent a questionnaire to determine how their work aligns with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including questions about whether the work contains components on climate justice; diversity, equity and inclusion; or gender ideology. In April, a Canadian cancer-research group involved in an NIH clinical-trials network was forced to remove gender-inclusive language from its trial protocols.\n\nThis message has also made its way into the country’s political discourse. During campaigning for the Canadian election in April, the leader of the Canadian Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, pledged to end the “imposition of woke ideology in the allocation of federal funds for university research”. On 28 April, the Conservatives lost the election to the Liberal Party led by Mark Carney, who took a harder line against Trump.\n\nRecruitment opportunity\n\nAlthough the turmoil in the United States has extended to Canada, there is a silver lining — it has provided a potential opportunity to attract talented US researchers looking for international career options. A March poll on the Nature website found that more than three-quarters of respondents were considering leaving the United States for Europe or Canada because of the disruptions caused by Trump’s administration.\n\n“We’ve been very dependent on the US system, however there might be an important opportunity for Canada to re-establish itself in many areas of research,” says Bérubé. Online discussions have started to circulate, centring on how Canada could capitalize on an exodus of talent from the United States. Poitout says that he has already been contacted by some US colleagues about a potential move.\n\nCanada already has programmes in place to attract foreign research talent. The Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERC) offer either Can$1 million or Can$500,000 per year for 8 years, specifically designed to draw world-class researchers who are interested in relocating their laboratories to a Canadian university. The programme is not offered every year, but the latest competition opened in January 2025, with around 25 positions available.",

London, then New York City — at that time, I could find the financial support and intellectual environment I needed only by moving abroad.\n\nToday, many scientists in the United States are experiencing cuts to government research funding and face a similar reckoning. I’ve seen the evidence. I’m now back in Portugal, working as chief executive of the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine (GIMM) in Lisbon. In the past 2 months, more than 30 junior researchers at US institutions have written to me to ask about job opportunities — 10 times what I would normally expect.\n\nEuropean countries must work together to become the global destination for scientific talent.\n\nHow the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble\n\nSome efforts are under way. A European Union initiative offers incentives and protections to researchers affected by political instability or funding cuts. Programmes in France aim to host displaced or returning scientists.\n\nBut most of these initiatives are fragmented. A coordinated strategy is crucial to lure the brightest minds.\n\nCERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, shows what can be achieved. It was created in the 1950s by physicists, who persuaded governments to invest in shared infrastructure and long-term collaboration. Now, it involves more than 12,000 scientists and thrives thanks to stable funding, open science and a culture of international partnership.\n\nSimilarly, programmes launched in the 1990s and 2000s made Canada a global research hub. Funding for national priorities such as environmental and genomics research was paired with competitive working conditions — including fast-tracked immigration and world-class infrastructure.\n\nAnd China’s Thousand Talents and Ten Thousand Talents programmes have lured thousands of scientists with generous start-up funding — often exceeding US$500,000 and guaranteed for five to ten years — as well as the promise of autonomy over their research agenda and budget.\n\nCuts to US science will take a generation to repair — leaders must speak up now\n\nHow can Europe emulate these successes? More funding is key. Last year, two reports recommended that the budget for the European Framework Programme, which funds research and development across the EU, be doubled, from almost €100 billion (US$112 billion) for the 2021–27 cycle to between €200 billion and €220 billion for 2028–34 (see go.nature.com/3zqdjte and go.nature.com/4mpgdgh).

It might all have been for nothing.\n\nGupta’s trial has been ensnared by a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy announced on 1 May that bans ‘foreign subawards’, which are funds that a US grant recipient can give to an international collaborator to help complete a project. Since the policy was disclosed, NIH employees have been forbidden from issuing grants involving such awards, according to internal documents that Nature has obtained.\n\nAs a result, funding will abruptly cease for dozens, if not hundreds, of ongoing trials of experimental drugs and treatments. The change puts thousands of trial participants, as well as the scientists running the trials, in limbo. Gupta, an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says she will have to start winding down her trial on 1 June unless she finds alternative funding.\n\nNIH killed grants on orders from Elon Musk’s DOGE\n\nTo understand the policy’s impact, Nature spoke to nine affected researchers who have been scrambling to find funding quickly to avoid shutting down their work. On top of the impact on research, scientists say that the policy could do tremendous harm to trial participants, who might suddenly find themselves without care. And it is a waste of taxpayers’ money, says Amy Conroy, a behavioural scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is studying the effectiveness of a programme in Malawi to reduce alcohol use in people with HIV.\n\n“This trial is the product of five years of formative work that American taxpayers have invested in, and they will never know the results of this study that they’ve paid for,” says Conroy, whose grant supporting this programme has a foreign subaward.\n\nThe NIH, which has cited national-security concerns and a lack of transparency as the rationale for the change, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the policy, its impacts on clinical trials or scientists’ frustrations. The NIH has said that direct funding for foreign sites will not be affected and that it will announce an alternative funding mechanism by October.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nThe NIH is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, and typically gives multi-year awards that are doled out in one-year increments contingent on researchers making reasonable progress. The new policy, which took effect on the day it was announced, requires that ongoing projects that include foreign subawards no longer receive funding when they come up for their next allotment.\n\nThis affects a large chunk of the agency’s portfolio: in 2024, the NIH funded about 1,800 projects with a combined value of more than $10 billion that include at least one foreign subaward, according to the US government website USAspending.gov.\n\nCaught in the crossfire are participants of trials funded by these foreign subawards. Many are members of vulnerable populations, such as those living with HIV. If their trials end, they will lose access to treatments and care.\n\nNIH turmoil sparks anxiety over future of its global grants\n\n“You can imagine how a participant from rural Africa is going to feel one day when they realize we have disappeared, we’ve gone back to the US and we’ve collected all this information about them,” Conroy says. “There’s the potential for medical mistrust and anti-democratic beliefs to flourish.”\n\nThat scenario worries grantees such as Prasanna Jagannathan, a malaria epidemiologist at Stanford University in California. Since 2022, he and his colleagues have been running a trial involving nearly 1,000 infants in Uganda to test a drug cocktail that could boost immunity to malaria. The researchers administered the drugs monthly for up to two years. Now the trial is in a crucial phase: after participants stop taking the drug, the scientists will monitor them for infection.\n\nThere’s a possibility that, post-treatment, malaria cases will be more serious than if the children had not received the therapy, because participants were not infected with the disease naturally while they were taking the drugs. “If we put them at an increased risk by giving them this drug, we’re obligated to continue to provide care for them,” Jagannathan says. “That’s what they signed up for.”\n\nConroy fears that she could face disciplinary action from the Malawi government for abandoning participants in the middle of a trial. “They don’t care why it was pulled — they just know this was not ethical.”\n\nJoin the queue\n\nThe NIH says it will allow research projects involving human participants to receive limited funds for “orderly shutdowns”, but researchers who spoke to Nature were unclear on what this means or how much funding is available for this purpose. And their other options are limited.",

          "abstract": "Reliable tools to detect AI-generated images in research papers are not yet available.Credit: University of Jyväskylä\n\nMicroscopic images of tissue samples can be generated so convincingly by artificial intelligence (AI) that journal editors, peer reviewers and readers are being warned to take a much closer look when reading papers.\n\nA study that presented people with real and fake histological images — used to study the microscopic structure of tissues — found that many participants could not tell the difference. To make it easier to spot the fakes, the authors are urging journal editors to require raw data from researchers wanting to publish papers containing such images.\n\nIn the study, 816 undergraduate students at German universities were given eight genuine and eight fake histological images, and were asked to identify which were real. Of the 290 participants who said they hadn’t seen such images before, 55% could classify them correctly. Among the 526 participants who were familiar with such images, 70% classified them correctly, according to the study, published in Scientific Reports last November1.\n\n“I was really surprised how little it took to generate images that looked like true histology,” says study co-author Ralf Mrowka, a nephrologist at Jena University Hospital in Germany.\n\nResearchers and publishers use many tools and techniques to spot fake images. There are several AI-based systems on the market that can detect common signatures of doctored images such as the replication, deletion or splicing of part of the image, for example. But those approaches can’t reliably detect AI-generated images, Mrowka says.\n\nSuch tools are in development. For example, in March, the Vienna-based company ImageTwin announced that it is beta-testing a software function to detect AI-generated images. But it’s going to be difficult for these tools to keep up with rapidly advancing image-generation technology, Mrowka warns.\n\nThe fabrications have reached a level of quality “that will give editors, reviewers and readers a hard time”, he says. “Once I have trained an AI model to generate this type of data, I can generate endless new fake images” and also make modifications to them, he adds.\n\nA challenge for peer reviewers\n\nChhavi Chauhan, founder of Samast AI, a technology company in Cary, North Carolina, says she was surprised that the study categorized undergraduates as experts, despite having limited experience with histological images. She thinks the results might vary if the participants were actual specialists.\n\nChauhan, who is also director of scientific outreach at the American Society for Investigative Pathology in Rockville, Maryland, adds that the fact that the student participants were told there was a mix of real and fake histological images put them in a much better position to spot the fakes than peer reviewers of papers would be. When peer reviewers are assessing manuscripts, many wouldn’t scrutinize the histological images as closely as they would in a scenario where they knew there were fakes, she says.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nSome image-generation tools, such as Google DeepMind's SynthID, insert watermarks, which peer reviewers can be trained to look for. But it’s easy to bypass that feature in freely available tools, Mrowka says.",

          "abstract": "An area buried deep in the brain is a hotspot for immune cells called T cells.Credit: Du Cane Medical Imaging Ltd/Science Photo Library\n\nSpecial-agent immune cells carry information about the gut and fat tissue deep into the brain. This surveillance system, uncovered in mice, is crucial to the brain’s control of behaviour such as pursuit of food, researchers report today in Nature1.\n\nSimilar immune cells are known to populate the membranes covering the brain, but the newly identified cells have molecular traits that give them entry into the core of the organ. Their function is shaped by diet and the microbiome; without them, even hungry mice are slow to eat.\n\n“It’s very exciting to see that from an organ that was considered completely isolated from the immune system,” says Michal Schwartz, a neuroimmunologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who was not involved in the study.\n\nNeighbourhood watch\n\nAlmost every organ in the body houses its own immune cells. Researchers have long thought that most of the healthy brain’s ‘adaptive’ immune cells — those that target specific pathogens — reside in the meninges, the three protective membranes enclosing the brain.\n\nPrevious studies have hinted that adaptive immune cells called T cells might dwell inside the brain itself under stable conditions. But determining whether these cells are truly distinct from those in the meninges has been a challenge, says Tomomi Yoshida, a neuroimmunologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and a co-author of the latest work. “They didn’t really compare and contrast that element,” she says.\n\nGuardians of the brain: how a special immune system protects our grey matter\n\nTo gain a more definitive answer, Yoshida and her colleagues spent five years searching for T cells across the entire mouse brain. They found that T cells are concentrated in a hotspot in the subfornical organ, a structure in the centre of the brain that regulates a range of bodily processes, including eating and drinking. The scientists then sampled tissue from the human subfornical organ, where they also found T cells.\n\nIn both mouse and human brains, the subfornical T cells were distinct from those found in the meninges. They produced more proteins that enabled them to reside in brain tissue and secreted more immune-signalling proteins known as cytokines under normal conditions.\n\nCuriously, the researchers found that the T cells from inside mouse brains were very similar to those in the animals’ fat deposits. To understand this similarity, they gave some mice a high-fat diet. These mice ended up with more T cells in their fat and brain tissues than did mice that ate standard food — evidence of a link between fat mass and brain T-cell populations. After mice on the same diet fasted for 48 hours, the number of T cells in their brains rose and the number in their fat fell, suggesting that food intake affects the number of T cells travelling to the brain.",

          "abstract": "The requirement of evidence\n\nI was the one who found the cache of old books, including Principles of Archaeology, so I am leading the dig. Books can survive for decades if the storage conditions are favourable, as they were in the partially collapsed basement. Perhaps it fell down as the result of an earthquake? We know about earthquakes from our personal experiences, aka data, of the earth quaking.\n\nIt turns out archaeology is the study of the past through physical remains. Plenty of people have tried to figure out what happened to the People from Before, but I am using this ‘science of archaeology’. I have chosen the dig site to be one of their dumps. In The Before, each human was so rich they discarded tonnes of trash in their lifetimes. Yes, it boggles the mind. According to archaeology, we should dig straight down, and as we do so, we should uncover evidence of their past lives. We must study these physical remains objectively and hypothesize and draw scientific conclusions about their lives and what happened to them.\n\nThe nature of evidence\n\nThe top level of the dump is a mixture of sand and other minerals, dead leaves and unidentifiable organic matter — so, in other words, soil.\n\nThe second level of the dump is a fine grey ash with a lot of specks of metal. One of my assistants raises the hypothesis that this ash is from a volcano or meteor strike.\n\nBut in preparation for the dig, I studied various substances we might be expected to find, and I know this ash is cremated human remains. I point out some of the small bone fragments to make my case. Eventually, my whole team agrees.\n\nThe ash is important data; it is probably the remains of the People from Before. At the end of their era, there was a massive die-off. Why? This is the primary mystery we are attempting to solve.\n\nThe layer of ash is very thick, but I hypothesize that the evidence we seek is underneath.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAfter several days of digging we finally make it through the ash layer. We uncover a layer made of their thin rectangular technological devices. These are primarily black plastic with the largest at 30 inches (we carefully measure). There are many, many smaller devices, all about 6 inches tall by 3 inches wide. According to our knowledge of The Before, these are called computers and store data and information. We all wonder why there are so many. We do not know.\n\nAn assistant hypothesizes that they needed many devices because they possessed a huge amount of data. Perhaps this is true, but we have never been able to access any of these data. This technology layer is useless to us.\n\nWe keep digging and eventually make it to the layer underneath the technology. I warn my fellow archaeologists to be on the special lookout for newspapers, magazines and books. They all nod. I don’t know why I tell them this; they know. Books and the like from Before are our most precious resources.\n\nThis layer contains more diverse materials, from bags made of plastic to dishes, clothing, toys and furniture made of plastic; along with some ceramics, glass, wood, fabric, metal and other materials.\n\nAn assistant yells, “I found something!”\n\nWe all stop our digging and traipse over to him.\n\nHands shaking, he’s holding out a single sheet of paper, somehow covered in plastic. It’s very colourful with blue, green, red and black letters and shapes; it’s as if it were brand new.\n\nThe words on the page are easy to read: “Get the latest cutting-edge brain-computer for free! Yes, you heard right! We are giving away the newest microelectrode array technology! Free tech! Free installation! Perfectly safe! With low-cost monthly data plans! Don’t miss out! Don’t get left behind! Text now!” The bottom of the sheet has a bunch of numbers and a larger square made of smaller black and white squares.\n\nInterpreting the evidence\n\nHypotheses depend on evidence; this sheet seems like important evidence. Its vertical position in the dump also seems important. But archaeology is new to me — and everyone else — so I’m not quite sure of the significance.\n\nWe take a break, and an assistant passes around the sheet. We all study it. We marvel at the pristine condition. We hypothesize.\n\n“Is it an advertisement for this brain-computer thing?” someone asks.\n\n“I guess,” I said. “But are they saying they’re going to put things in people’s brains? Why would they do that?” I feel like I almost understand this archaeology stuff, but I do not understand the People from Before at all.\n\n“And what’s a data plan?” an assistant asks.",

          "title": "Cancer-fighting immune cells could soon be engineered inside our bodies",
          "authors": "Cassandra Willyard",
          "abstract": "When Bruce Levine and his colleagues began attempting to engineer immune cells to fight cancer in the 1990s, few people thought they would succeed. “The wider community was very sceptical,” says Levine, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. When they presented their research at meetings, “we were in the last session on the last day, in a room no one could find”.\n\nToday, these engineered immune cells, called CAR T cells, are among the most powerful therapies oncologists have to treat many types of blood cancer. And studies suggest that they might hold promise for brain cancer and other solid tumours, as well as autoimmune and other diseases. One research firm estimates that the value of the CAR-T-therapy market, expected to hit US$11 billion this year, will grow to nearly $190 billion by 2034.\n\nBut CAR-T therapies come with a serious downside — they are laborious to make and difficult to administer. After removing the immune cells, called T cells, from a person’s blood, physicians ship them off to a manufacturer, where technicians genetically engineer the cells to carry a specialized protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (hence ‘CAR T’) on their surface. The cells are grown and amplified into hundreds of millions more cells, frozen and returned to the hospital for re-infusion. Because of the complexity, only about 200 centres in the United States offer the therapy.\n\nThe race to supercharge cancer-fighting T cells\n\n“This whole process, it’s just inefficient,” says Saar Gill, a haematologist and oncologist also at the Perelman School of Medicine. “If I’ve got a patient with cancer, I can prescribe chemotherapy and they’ll get it tomorrow.” With commercial CAR T, however, people have to wait weeks for treatment. That delay, along with the high cost of the therapy, plus the need for chemotherapy before people receive the CAR T cells, means many people who could benefit from CAR T never receive it. “We all want to get to a situation where CAR T cells are more like a drug,” says Gill.\n\nSome biotechnology companies have an answer: alter T cells inside the body instead. Treatments that deliver a gene for the CAR protein to cells in the blood could be mass produced and available on demand — theoretically, at a much lower price than current CAR-T therapies. A single dose of commercial CAR-T therapy costs around $500,000. A vial of in vivo treatment might cost an order of magnitude less.\n\nThe idea has some high-profile proponents. The founders of Capstan Therapeutics, a company in San Diego, California, that is focused exclusively on in vivo cell therapies, include CAR-T pioneers Levine and Carl June, as well as Drew Weissman, who won a Nobel prize for his work on messenger RNA vaccines. CRISPR–Cas9 pioneer and Nobel prizewinner Jennifer Doudna has co-founded a separate company, Azalea Therapeutics in Berkeley, California, that is developing in vivo CAR T. And big pharma is taking notice. In March, the biopharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca agreed to pay up to $1 billion for the Belgium-based in vivo CAR-T company EsoBiotec, which launched its first human trial of an in vivo CAR-T therapy in January.\n\nAlthough human trials have just begun, many researchers are excited about the potential of a simpler iteration of CAR T. “If it’s efficacious and safe, it could really challenge the current paradigm,” says Joseph McGuirk, a haematologist and oncologist who studies cellular therapies at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. And “we need to challenge the current paradigm”.\n\nBringing the outside in\n\nMany of the in vivo CAR-T therapies under development have taken pages from the ex vivo playbook. Similar to the approved therapies, in vivo approaches aim to destroy white blood cells called B cells, and so treat cancers that form in these cells. (CAR-T therapies destroy healthy B cells, too, but people can live without these cells.)\n\nAs with ex vivo, many in vivo therapies rely on an engineered version of a lentivirus to grab onto T cells and deliver the gene for the CAR protein into the cell’s genome (see ‘Made within’). But engineering cells inside the body is a tricky business. With ex vivo, the T cells have been removed from the body, so researchers don’t have to worry about introducing the gene into other cell types. But in the body, many cells share common receptors, so researchers have to find ways to specifically target T cells — or other immune cells that could join the fight.\n\n“The stumbling block is, how do you get it to the right cell, the right place, right time?” says Michel Sadelain, a genetic engineer and director of the Columbia Initiative in Cell Engineering and Therapy at Columbia University in New York City and another CAR-T pioneer.\n\nEach company has developed its own approach to solving this problem, and each has tweaked its vector in different ways. For example, Interius BioTherapeutics in Philadelphia, co-founded by Gill, is testing a vector that latches onto CD7, a protein found only on T cells and natural killer cells.\n\nUmoja Biopharma in Seattle, Washington, is testing a lentiviral vector decorated with a protein that targets three receptors on T cells at once. The company has evidence from animal models that this strategy is more effective than targeting just one receptor, and hopes that it will more closely mimic what happens when a T cell becomes activated naturally, after an infection, for example.\n\nIf effective, such approaches could simplify manufacturing and get CAR-T therapy to more people more quickly. McGuirk notes that when the ex vivo CAR-T therapy Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) was approved in 2022 for people with multiple myeloma, the manufacturer had limited production capacity, leading to long waiting times.\n\n“We had 50 patients at one time on our wait list,” says McGuirk. “More than half of those patients died before we could get them a slot for manufacturing.”\n\nDo cutting-edge CAR-T-cell therapies cause cancer? What the data say\n\nIn addition to simplifying production, there is another potential advantage to in vivo treatment. With ex vivo approaches, people receive chemotherapy before CAR-T treatment to eliminate unedited T cells and make space for the edited ones to proliferate. The idea is to create a blank slate. But with in vivo approaches, people would forgo the pre-treatment chemotherapy. “We don’t want to kill the very T cells that we hope to transduce,” says Gill. That would eliminate chemotherapy-related side effects, such as a greater risk of infections. It might also mean that people who are too ill to receive chemotherapy could still be eligible for CAR-T therapy.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear, however, whether in vivo CAR T delivered through a viral vector can eliminate all the side effects that come with ex vivo approaches. After infusion, CAR T cells multiply in the body and release chemicals that ramp up the immune system. In some cases, they can cause an inflammatory storm known as cytokine release syndrome. “It’s like a train that is running out of control,” says Adrian Bot, chief scientific officer at Capstan Therapeutics.\n\nSome researchers suspect this might be less of a problem with in vivo approaches. That’s because the engineered T cells will be multiplying in the presence of other immune cells, including cells that could help to put the brakes on a runaway immune response, says Yi Lin, a haematologist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. As a result, the side effects might be milder, she says.\n\nEven so, these in vivo approaches are unlikely to eliminate the concerns that have arisen in the past couple of years about secondary cancers caused by CAR-T therapies. Although the risk is low, many countries require CAR-T therapies to carry a warning label detailing this risk. The issue is that lentiviral vectors permanently integrate the CAR gene into the genome of the T cell. Each time the cell divides, it produces more CAR T cells. That means T cells might go on attacking their targets for long periods — years, in some cases.\n\nAlthough that could be an advantage, researchers don’t have much control over where in the genome the lentivirus inserts the gene. If it lands in the wrong spot, it could prompt the formation of secondary cancers. Companies can screen for this problem with ex vivo therapies but not with in vivo.\n\nTurning to RNA\n\nInstead of viral vectors, Capstan and several other companies are turning to nanoparticles to ferry RNA into T cells. The RNA enters the cell’s cytoplasm, where its genetic information is used to make the CAR protein for only a short time. Although the therapy needs to be administered in multiple doses, it could prove to be safer. At the first sign of a serious problem, physicians could stop administering the treatment, and the CAR protein would go away in a few days or less.",

          "authors": "Alison Abbott",
          "abstract": "Daiza Gordon watched her two younger brothers die when they were adolescents. They had Hunter syndrome, a rare, incurable disease — predominantly affecting boys — in which a gene for an important enzyme is missing. Guilt compounded her grief when her attempts to resuscitate her youngest brother failed. She was just 19 years old.\n\nGordon went on to discover how merciless genetics can be. Her own three sons were all born with the condition. When her two eldest hit their second birthdays, the symptoms started to emerge: a thickening of facial features, loss of language, hearing and movement and other impacts to mental and physical development.\n\nBut she sees hope for her sons that was denied to her brothers. Her children are enrolled in a clinical trial testing a technology to carry a replacement for the missing enzyme, called iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), into the brain. Early results indicate improvement in some of the condition’s cognitive and physical symptoms. Gordon’s eldest sons are no longer deaf and they have started to run around. They are meeting developmental milestones she’d never dared to hope for. Her two-year-old, who started the therapy when he was just three months old, is showing none of the early symptoms. “When I look at them, I realize they have a chance of an actual future,” says Gordon.\n\n‘Big leap’ for Parkinson’s treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials\n\nRegular infusions of replacement IDS has been the standard of care for the past two decades, and it protects important organs such as the liver and kidneys from damage. But without help, the large enzyme can’t make it through the protective barrier that separates the blood from one of the most important organs — the brain.\n\nFor Gordon’s children, that help comes from an innovative molecular transport system, a chemical tag attached to IDS that shuttles it through the tightly joined cells that make up the blood–brain barrier. Several such shuttles, which take advantage of natural transport systems in the brain, are now being developed. With the ability to move large biological drugs — including antibodies, proteins and the viruses used in gene therapy — these shuttles promise to revolutionize neuropharmacology. And that’s not just for rare diseases such as Hunter syndrome, but also for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other common brain disorders.\n\nThe field is in its infancy, and much is left to discover about how to target large therapeutic molecules to the exact spots in the brain where they’re needed, says James Gorman, principal investigator of the Wyss Institute Brain Targeting Program at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. Nevertheless, the excitement is palpable. “It seems like every major company in this space has a programme to develop brain shuttles,” he says.\n\nDazia Gordon’s three sons receive regular injections of an enzyme that has been designed to cross the blood–brain barrier.Credit: Daiza Gordon\nHitting the wall\n\nFloating in its protective sac in a sea of cerebrospinal fluid, the human brain is a highly demanding organ. Its hefty metabolic and other needs are supplied by around 650 kilometres of large and small blood vessels that are lined with a layer of tightly packed endothelial cells. This lining forms the blood–brain barrier that keeps out toxic molecules while allowing passage to those that the brain requires. Oxygen and other small, fat-soluble molecules simply diffuse through. But some molecules such as iron and glucose require specialized transporters that are embedded in the endothelial cells.\n\nPharmaceutical developers have generally tried to keep drugs for the brain small and fat-soluble enough to pass through the blood–brain barrier unhindered. Some small synthetic drugs take advantage of transporters — for example, the Parkinson’s disease drug levodopa hitches a ride on a transporter that normally grants access to an amino acid.\n\nBut a different approach is required for large biological drugs, which offer fresh ways of interrupting disease processes — such as breaking up clumps of proteins, replacing missing enzymes and fixing or replacing malfunctioning genes. These medicines don’t cross easily.\n\nThis key protein could be responsible for brain ageing\n\nIn the past four years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several antibodies that target the amyloid proteins that form brain plaques in Alzheimer’s disease. They are the first therapies to tackle the disease’s underlying pathology, but less than 0.1% of an intravenous dose gets through the blood–brain barrier.\n\n“With so little antibody getting into the brain, high doses have to be given — a waste of material, and a likely source of side effects that are occasionally serious,” says neurobiologist Dag Sehlin at Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\nHow this small amount of antibody penetrates the brain’s fortress had been a mystery until the past year or so. Research now indicates that its route is indirect, seeping into the cerebrospinal fluid from blood vessels in the brain sac where the barrier is somewhat less tight1.\n\nThis route is far from optimal. When small molecules cross the blood–brain barrier directly, they flow into the tiniest of capillaries that serve brain cells. When large molecules enter the cerebrospinal fluid, they tend to hang around the outside of the arterial blood vessels that carried them there, where a lot of the brain’s amyloid also settles. That presents two problems. The antibodies don’t distribute to deeper parts of the brain and they can attack the amyloid alongside the blood vessels, causing inflammation and small bleeds that can be life-threatening.\n\nScientists have been searching for better, direct routes into the brain for more than 25 years, says Azad Bonni, who heads neuroscience research and development at pharmaceutical company Roche in Basel, Switzerland, “but things are only now really taking off”.\n\nThe most advanced approach attempts to exploit the system involved in ensuring the brain’s supply of iron, which is required for many important enzymes and is carried through the blood by the protein transferrin (see ‘Crossing the divide’). This large iron-bearing molecule is shuttled across the blood–brain barrier by transferrin receptors on endothelial cells.\n\nSource: S. Edavettal et al. Med 3, 860–882 (2022)\n\nWith enough protein-engineering skills, almost any therapeutic biological agent could be helped through the barrier by attaching it to a molecular construct that targets the receptor in the same way that transferrin does, says Bonni. The construct usually includes a small part of an antibody made to bind to the receptor.\n\n“It took many years of research work to figure out how to make a safe brain shuttle,” says Bonni. Researchers had to ensure that it wouldn’t interfere with the normal function of the transferrin receptor; that it wouldn’t get stuck inside the endothelial cells; and that the therapeutic agent it’s shuttling still works when it reaches its target.\n\nThe brain’s hall pass\n\nShuttle-based therapies are under active development for an array of brain conditions. “It’s now abundantly clear that we can get these drugs across the blood–brain barrier,” says Gorman. “The big frontier facing us is how to efficiently get them where they need to go within the brain for different diseases and with different cargoes.”\n\nSome diseases lend themselves particularly well to brain shuttles. Hunter syndrome has been one of the first to benefit. It is part of a family of rare genetic conditions known as lysosomal storage diseases. Lysosomes are subcellular waste-processing centres that contain enzymes (including IDS), which break down a cell’s waste products.\n\nCells consider foreign proteins, such as therapeutic IDS, as waste, and direct them straight to the lysosome, says Gorman, “which is perfect — because that is where the replacement enzyme needs to be”.\n\nEngineered nose bacteria sneak drugs into the brain",

          "abstract": "In September 2022, during the Woman, Life, Freedom movement in Iran — sparked by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini — I resigned from my Iranian university position in protest. I was on a research visit to Mexico at the time, and couldn’t return home.\n\nScience became my refuge and lifeline. I moved to Italy, then Germany and now Canada, taking up temporary positions to continue my work on dark matter and black holes.\n\n‘I could not keep silent’: Iranian physicist resigns to join protests\n\nI am one of the few fortunate exiled scientists. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 122 million people worldwide are forcibly displaced. But there are no data on how many scholars are among these, or how many are silenced or cut off from their research by war, persecution, political unrest and violations of academic freedom — sometimes because of their work, or simply for expressing dissent or belonging to a marginalized group. Most support programmes focus on established researchers, often leaving graduate students and early-career researchers without help, visibility or a pathway to continue their education and research.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has revealed a troubling inconsistency in global academic solidarity. Some institutions and governments rallied to offer scholarships and support to Ukrainian students and researchers, yet similar opportunities are rarely offered to those experiencing crises elsewhere.\n\nFor displaced people, the challenges extend far beyond leaving home. Eligibility criteria for support are often too stringent. Many people flee at short notice and cannot retrieve degrees or transcripts required by host institutions as proof of qualifications. Their former universities might have been destroyed or closed, or be unwilling to provide documents owing to political pressures. Without these, even the most accomplished scholars can find themselves unable to apply for fellowships or academic positions.\n\nVisa insecurity is another barrier. Scholars from conflict regions often hold passports that make travel difficult. Their visa applications are subject to extensive delays or denials. Background checks can last months or sometimes more than a year, causing scholars to miss out on job opportunities and fellowships. These hurdles disrupt academic careers and send a damaging message: it’s too risky to support scholars from unstable or repressive regions.\n\nThese Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty\n\nEven when visas are secured, most fellowships are temporary. And they often emphasize research excellence to the detriment of other aspects of academic life. Many at-risk scholars are not granted faculty-member status, leaving them unable to teach, supervise students or contribute to departmental life. This causes a deep sense of disconnection from the academic community they once helped to build.\n\nLayered on top of this are isolation from family, friends and support networks, mental-health challenges and the constant pressure to prove one’s worth in an unfamiliar system. Despite being resilient, many at-risk scholars describe feeling invisible — trapped between the trauma of displacement and the unrealistic demands placed on them.\n\nTo genuinely support these scholars, institutions must adopt concrete, inclusive policies. First and foremost is recognition. A clear and expansive definition of who qualifies as an at-risk scholar is needed — one that includes graduate, postdoctoral and non-tenure-track researchers as well as those with established academic careers.",

The bacteria still circulate in low levels in parts of the United States, Africa and Asia, and are typically transmitted to humans by infected fleas carried by rats or other rodents.\n\nPrevious research found that some strains of Y. pestis had reduced amounts of pla2, a gene associated with disease severity, but it was unclear why, says Ravneet Sidhu, a palaeogeneticist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and a co-author of the latest work. “Our findings in this study characterize a case in which a pandemic-causing pathogen has independently evolved to cause what we believe is a slightly weaker form of the disease,” she says.\n\nMice mortality\n\nTo understand the impact of the genetic change, the team infected mice with modern strains of Y. pestis that had normal levels of pla, had reduced levels of the gene or were unable to express it at all. When the bacteria were injected beneath the skin to mimic the form of plague that affects lymph nodes, mice infected with the reduced-pla strain lived almost two days longer than did those infected with the normal strain. Mortality also decreased from 100% with the normal strain to 85% with the reduced-pla strain. However, when the team infected mice intravenously or through the nose to mimic blood- or lung-based infections, the pla-reduced strain was as fatal as the normal strain.\n\nThe team also looked at the genomes of ancient and modern strains of Y. pestis to find out how prevalent pla depletion was. Between 30% and 50% of ancient strains obtained from previously published studies showed signs of depletion, as did 3 of 2,714 modern strains, isolated from a human and two rats in 1994. Wanting to understand why pla was depleted, the researchers analysed the genetic data from these ancient and modern strains. They found that the reduction was caused by deletion of a 2,100-base-pair-long region of DNA containing the pla gene in one region of the genome, and the integration of a DNA molecule called a plasmid carrying the gene into other regions.\n\nSidhu says the team hypothesized that pla depletion occurred because repeated outbreaks of the plague decreased the density of rodent populations. Increasing the time for which rats were infectious would have given them more time to travel between fragmented populations, increasing the chance of them spreading the disease, she adds.",

Longo\n\nScientists have discovered an ancient protein that has the rare property of being ‘ambidextrous’ — it can function in mirror-image forms. The molecule could be a relic of a time when life based on mirror-image molecules existed on Earth.\n\nMany chemicals have a handedness, or chirality, and can exist in two mirror-image forms. But the building blocks of life tend to stick to one or the other. Sugars in nucleic acids such as DNA are right-handed — causing the DNA double helix to twist to the right, if you were looking down its axis — whereas the amino acids that build proteins are left-handed.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nScientists think that a preference for right-handed DNA and left-handed proteins could have helped to maintain the stability and function of biomolecules early in life’s evolution.\n\nLiam Longo, a protein historian at the Tokyo Earth-Life Science Institute, was examining a protein fragment, or peptide, that recognizes nucleic acids and is commonly found in DNA-repair enzymes. He noticed that the structure was symmetrical around a central axis, and suspected that both left- and right-handed versions of the protein could bind DNA.\n\nThe symmetrical segment — called a helix–hairpin–helix motif — is common in proteins that can manipulate and bind DNA and RNA and is found across the tree of life, suggesting that it existed in an early ancestor of all cells, says Longo.\n\nForwards, backwards, this way, that way\n\nTo test his hunch about the molecule’s ambidexterity, Longo and his colleagues created ‘right-handed’ versions of the peptide, including an ‘ancestral’ form potentially similar to the one found in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of today’s cells.\n\nThe mirror-image peptides bound to DNA nearly as well as their twins, and the normal, left-handed versions were able to bind mirror-image DNA. Further experiments showed that both left- and right-handed versions grabbed DNA molecules in similar ways. A study describing the phenomenon is published1 in Angewandte Chemie.",

One popular measure of inhibitory control is the congruency effect, but recent research has highlighted its low reliability, limiting its use for clinical and basic research questions. Here we asked whether it is possible to obtain precise individual estimates of the congruency effect. We sampled more than 5,000 trials from nine participants across four inhibitory control tasks. This dataset, made public for the community, demonstrates that precise individual estimates are achievable but with higher numbers of trials than typically collected with common tools. Using a combination of datasets and simulations, we show that extensive sampling is necessary to reveal true individual differences and improve observations from alternative modelling approaches. We share our dataset as a resource to further understand sources of variation in inhibitory control, ultimately advancing research in this critical field.",

Some scholars argue that this presumed broadening of moral concern is driven by our increasing capacity to recognize, through reason, that the suffering of strangers matters as much as the suffering of those we love. Yet, recent research complicates this story. In several domains, younger children start out with a more expansive moral circle than older children and adults. Younger children are more likely than their older counterparts to judge relationally, physically and phylogenetically distant others as worthy of help or protection. These findings suggest, counterintuitively, that development may not widen our moral circle but may sometimes narrow it. This Perspective raises the possibility that, rather than focusing on overcoming biases against caring for distant others, we should also recognize that, in some domains, we possess an early-emerging tendency to care for them.",

          "abstract": "Through the industrial era, pollutants have been unevenly distributed in the environment, disproportionately impacting disenfranchised communities. Redressing the unequal distribution of environmental pollution is thus a question of environmental justice and public health that requires policy solutions. However, data on pollutants for many locations and time periods are limited because environmental monitoring is largely reactive—i.e., pollutants are monitored only after they are recognized as harmful and are circulating in the environment at elevated levels. Without comprehensive historical pollution data, it is difficult to understand the full, intergenerational consequences of pollutants on environmental and human health. We assert that biological specimens in natural history collections are an underutilized source of quantitative pollution data for tracking environmental pollutants over two centuries to inform justice-centered policy solutions. Specifically, we: 1) discuss the need for quantitative pollution data in environmental research and its implications for public health and policy, 2) examine the capacity of biological specimens as tools for tracking environmental pollutants through space and time, 3) present a framework for integrating pollution datasets from specimens with spatially and temporally matched human health datasets to inform and evaluate policy, and 4) identify challenges and research directions associated with the use of quantitative pollution datasets. Biological specimens present a unique opportunity to fill critical gaps that address environmental challenges relevant to public health and policy. This work demands interdisciplinary partnerships and inclusive practices to connect data generated from specimens with urgent questions about environmental health and justice.",

          "abstract": "The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are trained on massive datasets before being adjusted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are n -consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.",

These structures grow and stabilize to form clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which invaginate and accumulate cargo. Finally, through membrane fission, CCPs detach to form clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Mechanisms governing the transition of CCPs from flat-to-curved structures have been a matter of debate. GAK and its chaperone protein, Hsc70, are well known to mediate clathrin release from CCVs, and several studies have observed a late burst of GAK recruitment as CCVs form. Other studies have proposed that early recruitment of GAK–Hsc70 could function to provide the necessary energy source to remodel nascent flat clathrin lattices, replacing hexagons with pentagons and enabling a gain of curvature and invagination of the growing CCP; however, direct functional evidence is lacking. Here, we show that GAK knockdown inhibits CCP stabilization and invagination. Furthermore, mutations in the J domain of GAK that abolish Hsc70 recruitment to and activation at CCPs lead to the accumulation of GAK at CCPs, hinder CCP stabilization and invagination, and result in a striking increase in the proportion of highly transient, abortive CCPs. These findings support the hypothesis that GAK–Hsc70 promotes the turnover and remodeling of nascent clathrin assemblies required for curvature development during CME.",

          "abstract": "Life history traits influence marine species dispersal and habitat colonization. Medusozoans (jellyfish and siphonophores) exhibit diverse life cycles, evolved from an ancestral cycle alternating between a benthic polyp and a pelagic medusa. Despite their ecological importance, factors shaping medusozoan distribution remain poorly understood. By integrating metabarcoding and environmental data from the Tara Oceans expedition with life history traits, we provide global evidence supporting the longstanding hypothesis that benthic polyp presence/absence is a key factor influencing the distribution and abundance of planktonic medusozoans in the surface ocean. We inferred on a time-calibrated phylogeny of Medusozoa multiple transitions to a fully planktonic (holoplanktonic) life cycle, either through polyp loss, acquisition of drifting polyps, or development of polyps parasitizing pelagic organisms. We could associate each transition with a shift toward offshore habitats and the emergence of globally dominant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), whose abundance far exceeds that of any nonholoplanktonic medusozoans in the planktonic realm. The prevalence of holoplanktonic medusozoans in terms of abundance and diversity is broadly observed in coastal and offshore environments, peaking over greater bathymetric depths in tropical and subtropical regions. We show that holoplanktonic and nonholoplanktonic groups interact with distinct yet compositionally similar planktonic communities. Holoplanktonic OTUs occupy more peripheral positions in a plankton interactome, suggesting greater flexibility in biotic interactions, an adaptive trait in rapidly changing planktonic ecosystems. These findings highlight how life cycle evolution shaped the global distribution of medusozoans and suggest that variations in life history may significantly influence how medusozoans respond to global environmental changes.",

          "abstract": "The tight link between brain and skull formation is a fundamental aspect of vertebrate evolution and embryogenesis. Their developmental synchronization is essential for structural and functional integration. The brain and skull shape coevolution is evident along the vertebrate phylogeny; however, the genetic basis underlying their close evolutionary and developmental relationship remains little explored. Here, we reveal the evolution and function of the MN1 gene that was previously found to be associated with significant shape variation in the mouse skull and the formation of cranial bones. We show that the vertebrate MN1 gene evolved from an ancestral deuterostome sequence. In vertebrates, the MN1 gene structure, synteny, and spatiotemporal expression pattern are remarkably conserved, indicating that the gene carries out a core function. Using a newly generated mouse knock-out model, we demonstrate in vivo that Mn1 integrated into an ancient molecular machinery and controls the expression of the Cyp26 genes in the developing hindbrain, thereby tuning the retinoic acid levels and patterning of the developing central nervous system. This study thus showcases the emergence of a novel gene function from an ancestral sequence and its role in generating a macroevolutionary innovation. The data expand our knowledge of brain and skull codevelopment and coevolution and highlight the role of this regulatory loop in craniofacial human syndromes.",

          "abstract": "NMR-based metabolic biomarkers provide comprehensive insights into human metabolism; however, extracting biologically meaningful patterns from such high-dimensional data remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a manifold-fitting-based framework to analyze metabolic heterogeneity within the UK Biobank population, utilizing measurements of 251 NMR biomarkers from 212,853 participants. Initially, our method clusters these biomarkers into seven distinct metabolic categories that reflect the modular organization of human metabolism. Subsequent manifold fitting to each category unveils underlying low-dimensional structures, elucidating fundamental variations from basic energy metabolism to hormone-mediated regulation. Importantly, three of these manifolds clearly stratify the population, identifying subgroups with distinct metabolic profiles and associated disease risks. These subgroups exhibit consistent links with specific diseases, including severe metabolic dysregulation and its complications, as well as cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions, highlighting the intricate relationship between metabolic states and disease susceptibility. Supported by strong correlations with demographic factors, clinical measurements, and lifestyle variables, these findings validate the biological relevance of the identified manifolds. By utilizing a geometrically informed approach to dissect metabolic heterogeneity, our framework enhances the accuracy of population stratification and deepens our understanding of metabolic health, potentially guiding personalized interventions and preventive healthcare strategies.",

The clinical benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies is usually short-lived, with resistance being driven by tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these limitations, we developed Targeted Apoptotic Immune Modulators (TAIM), a nonviral nanoparticle platform for the targeted delivery of polyinosine:polycytosine (polyIC), to simultaneously induce tumor cell death and activate antitumor immunity. The first TAIM compound, TAR001, was designed as a systemic treatment against metastatic EGFR-positive solid cancers. Here, we present TAR001’s multifaceted mode of action. We demonstrate that TAR001 is selective toward EGFR-overexpressing cancers, provoking a pattern recognition response, apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and antitumor immunity. TAR001 modulates the TME, recruiting and activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Systemic delivery of TAR001 markedly extends survival and inhibits tumor growth in multiple murine tumor models. TAR001 represents an innovative, safe, multimodal treatment approach with the potential to benefit patients with metastatic head and neck, non–small cell lung cancer, colorectal, renal, and triple-negative breast cancers. This unique modality utilizes a broad range of mechanisms to overcome the tumor’s ability to escape apoptosis and immune cell activation.",

With thousands of gene histories, phylogenomics can uncover the genomic signatures of these broad macroevolutionary trends. Diatoms are a species-rich lineage of microeukaryotes that contribute greatly to the global cycling of carbon, oxygen, and silica, which they use to build elaborately structured cell walls. We combined fossil information with newly sequenced transcriptomes from 181 diverse diatom species to reconstruct the pattern, timing, and genomic context of major evolutionary transitions. Diatoms originated 270 Mya, and after &gt;100 My of relative stasis in morphology and ecology, a radiation near the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary led to the diversity of habitats and cell wall architectures characteristic of modern diatoms. This transition was marked by a genome duplication and high levels of gene tree discordance. However, short generation times increase the probability of coalescence between speciation events, minimizing the impacts of incomplete lineage sorting and implicating sequence saturation and gene tree error as the main sources of discordance. Nevertheless, a rigorous tree-based approach to ortholog selection resulted in strongly supported relationships, including some that were uncertain previously. Three pulses of accelerated speciation were detected, two of which were associated with the evolution of novel traits and ecological transitions. The first 100 My of diatom evolution was a slow-burning fuse that led to a burst of innovations in ecology, morphology, and life history that are hallmarks of contemporary diatom assemblages.",

While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.",

Nociceptors also express other sodium channels, notably Nav1.7, raising the question of how effectively excitability of the neurons is reduced by inhibition of Nav1.8 channels alone. We used VX-548 to explore this question, recording from dissociated human dorsal root ganglion neurons at 37 °C. Applying VX-548 at 10 nM (about 25 times the IC 50 determined using cloned human Nav1.8 channels at 37 °C) had only small effects on action potential threshold and upstroke velocity but substantially reduced the peak and shoulder. Counterintuitively, VX-548 shortened the refractory period—likely reflecting reduced potassium channel activation by the smaller, narrower action potential—sometimes resulting in faster firing. Generally, repetitive firing during depolarizations was diminished but not eliminated by VX-548. Voltage clamp analysis suggested two reasons that repetitive firing often remains in 10 to 100 nM VX-548. First, many neurons had such large Nav1.8 currents that even 99% inhibition leaves nA-level Nav1.8 current that could help drive repetitive firing. Second, Nav1.7 current dominated during initial spikes and could also contribute to repetitive firing. The ability of human neurons to fire repetitively even with &gt;99% inhibition of Nav1.8 channels may help explain the incomplete analgesia produced by even the largest concentrations of VX-548 in clinical studies.",

          "abstract": "Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) mediates early signaling events in immunity by coupling membrane receptors to immune responses. Syk comprises a tandem SH2 (tSH2) regulatory module—two SH2 domains connected by a structured linker—and a kinase domain. The association of tSH2 with a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated motif (dpITAM) on membrane immunoreceptors is central to controlling Syk’s signaling activity. tSH2-dpITAM association is regulated by Y131-phosphorylation on linker A, distant from the Syk–immunoreceptor binding sites. A unique thermodynamic signature was reported to control this protein–protein interaction by phosphorylation, yet the molecular mechanism for the phosphorylation effect is unknown. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation affords the detail needed to fill this knowledge deficiency. Long MD simulations revealed a highly correlated interdomain electrostatic network (distance correlation coefficients &gt; 0.75) that is lost upon Y131-phosphorylation. Some of the strongly correlated interdomain pairs carry the same charge or are separated by distances greater than a salt-bridge pair. The strong interdomain connectivity accounts for the single, narrow free energy basin in the domain-structure conformational landscape for unphosphorylated tSH2. Linker phosphorylation disrupts this network and yields a broader free energy landscape with multiple networks formed by the same group of residues adopting alternative interdomain conformations. A salt dependence of NMR rotational tumbling times substantiates the electrostatic nature of tSH2 domain–domain coupling. Syk tandem SH2 is thus a sensor whose conformational plasticity is sensitive to Y131 phosphorylation. This phospho-sensing response provides the basis for an entropically driven regulatory mechanism that is so-far unique to Syk–immunoreceptor protein–protein association.",

          "abstract": "Greening immediately after etiolated-seedling’s emergence from the soil is critical for plants to initiate their autotrophic life cycle through photosynthesis. The greening process relies on a complex transcriptional network that fine-tunes the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and prevents premature development of chloroplasts. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis HOOKLESS1 (HLS1) as a key regulator of light-induced cotyledon greening. Our results demonstrated that HLS1 is essential for the proper expression of greening-related genes controlling chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development. Loss of HLS1 severely disrupts the Pchlide-to-Chlide transition and impairs reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in etiolated seedlings upon light exposure, leading to catastrophic ROS burst and even photobleaching. Biochemical assays revealed that HLS1 is a histone acetyltransferase mediating the deposition of H3K9ac and H3K27ac marks at multiple greening-related genes, thereby promoting their transcriptional activation. Genetic analysis further confirmed that HLS1’s promotive effect on the greening process is fully dependent on its histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, the loss of HLS1 also interrupts the promotive effect of ethylene signaling on the greening process by reducing the binding of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 to the promoter region of POR genes, thus inhibiting the activation effect of ethylene signaling on the expression of PORs . Collectively, our study reveals that HLS1 acetylates histones to activate greening-related genes, optimizing chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development during dark-to-light transition in seedlings.",

The method is applied to learn all-atom water and gas diffusion models with different functional forms and to train a machine-learning potential for diamond from scratch. Comparison to ensemble reweighting indicates that reversible simulation can provide more accurate gradients and train to match time-dependent observables.",

          "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions and major sources of genomic instability. Studies have suggested that DSBs induce local transcriptional silencing that consequently promotes genomic stability. Several factors have been proposed to actively participate in this process, including Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here, we found that disrupting PRC1 clustering disrupts DSB-induced gene silencing. Interactome analysis of PHC2, a PRC1 subunit that promotes the PRC1 clustering, found several nucleoporins found in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Similar to PHC2, depleting the nucleoporins also disrupted the DSB-induced gene silencing. We found that some of these nucleoporins, such as NUP107 and NUP43, which are members of the Y-complex of NPC, localize to DSB sites. The presence of nucleoporins and PHC2 at DSB regions was interdependent, suggesting that they act cooperatively in the DSB-induced gene silencing. We further found two structural components within NUP107 to be necessary for the transcriptional repression at DSBs: ATM/ Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related-mediated phosphorylation at the Serine37 residue within the N-terminal disordered tail and the NUP133-binding surface at the C-terminus. These results provide a functional interplay among nucleoporins, ATM, and the Polycomb proteins in the DSB metabolism and underscore their emerging roles in genome stability maintenance.",

Errors in Polε proofreading can cause various mutations, including C-to-G transversions, the most prevalent mutation in cancers and genetic diseases. Polε interacts with all three subunits of the PCNA ring to assemble a functional holoenzyme. Despite previous studies on proofreading of several Pol’s, how Polε—or any Pol complexed with its sliding clamp—proofreads a mismatch generated in situ has been unknown. We show here by cryo-EM that a template/primer DNA substrate with a preexisting mismatch cannot enter the exo site of Polε–PCNA holoenzyme, but a mismatch generated in situ in the pol site yields three bona fide proofreading intermediates of Polε–PCNA holoenzyme. These intermediates reveal how the mismatch is dislodged from the pol site, how the DNA unwinds six base pairs, and how the unpaired primer 3′-end is inserted into the exo site for cleavage. These results unexpectedly demonstrate that PCNA imposes strong steric constraints that extend unwinding and direct the trajectory of mismatched DNA and that this trajectory is dramatically different than for Polε in the absence of PCNA. These findings suggest a physiologically relevant proofreading mechanism for the human Polε holoenzyme.",

We provide a comprehensive framework that elucidates how different evolutionary forces interact to influence genotypic robustness and localization within haploid and diploid populations. We demonstrate that in haploid populations, high mutation rates relative to recombination typically drive the population toward regions of increased eigencentrality, a graph-theoretic measure of centrality which is correlated while not identical to mutational robustness. On the other hand, recombination increases the localization of the population to a smaller region of genotypic space, while high values of recombination relative to mutation can introduce shifts in distribution away from regions of high eigencentrality and toward attractors of the recombination dynamics. Diploid dynamics further complicate these interactions, showing reduced alignment with eigencentrality under both high mutation and recombination rates, with the exception of structured diploid landscapes where dynamics are still aligned with increasing eigencentrality. Our findings underscore the nuanced dependencies of evolutionary outcomes on both local and global landscape structures as well as evolutionary parameters.",

Here, we use micropipette aspiration (MPA) to directly characterize the viscoelasticity and interfacial tensions of nucleoli within transcriptionally active Xenopus laevis oocytes. We examine the major nucleolar subphases, the outer granular component (GC) and the inner dense fibrillar component (DFC), which itself contains a third small phase known as the fibrillar center (FC). We show that the behavior of the GC is more liquid-like, while the behavior of the DFC/FC is consistent with that of a partially viscoelastic solid. To determine the role of ribosomal RNA in nucleolar material properties, we degrade RNA using RNase A, which causes the DFC/FC to become more fluid-like and alters interfacial tension. Together, our findings suggest that RNA underlies the partially solid-like properties of the DFC/FC and provide insights into how material properties of nucleoli in a near-native environment are related to their RNA-dependent function.",

          "abstract": "Natural ice plays salient roles in making the Earth habitable and sustainable. Previously overlooked, its role in chemical processes is now of emerging interest, particularly due to the freeze concentration effect, which can substantially promote chemical reactions during ice formation. We demonstrate here that ice formation can serve as a dynamic and unique pathway for mineral genesis. Freezing solutions containing dissolved manganese and carbonates produced rhodochrosite (Mn II CO 3 ) even under slightly undersaturated conditions. At room temperature, by contrast, this occurred when the solution saturation level was increased by ca. 30,000 times. The cryogenic rhodochrosite formed spherical aggregates of nano-polycrystallites, distinctly different from the cubic monocrystalline particles observed at room temperature. The distinct feature likely resulted from the combined effects of the intensified supersaturation induced by the freeze concentration effect and the low temperatures within liquid-like layers, conditions that make liquid-like layers an exceptional environment for mineral genesis, unlike typical natural water systems. The cryogenic rhodochrosite formation was successfully demonstrated using in situ, real-time X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), enabling direct observation of freeze-induced solid formation. Our findings reveal that freeze-induced crystallization may be an active mineralization pathway, potentially influencing elemental cycles within the cryosphere and contributing to minerals with distinguishing properties and reactivities in the environment.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering attenuates widespread sensory and motor processing, both of which are mediated by phase coherence. However, it remains unclear i) whether mind wandering impacts both sensory input and motor output processing by modulating ii) neural entrainment to external stimuli, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), and specifically iii) whether task difficulty with different degrees of attentional demands moderates the impact of mind wandering on phase coherence. Using the thought-probe method, we assessed participants’ attentional states during different sensory and motor tasks with varying task difficulty. We found that mind wandering decreased ITPC exclusively in less demanding tasks but not in difficult ones, regardless of whether the tasks involved visual input or motor output processing. Our results suggest that external task difficulty may modulate the balance between external and internal cognitive processing (e.g., mind wandering), with simpler tasks facilitating internally oriented cognition and increasing mind wandering. This balance between internal mind wandering and external task difficulty is mediated, in part, by phase coherence, which serves as an underlying neural mechanism. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that phase coherence and its dynamics (ITPC) play a key role in mediating the reciprocal balance of internal and external cognition—this suggests their partly shared cognitive-executive resources as entailed by the recently proposed Baseline model of cognition.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in ATP8B1 cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, with symptoms including pruritus, pancreatitis, fat malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, and failure to thrive. High-throughput studies showed interconnection between ATP8B1 and phosphoinositide (PIPs), but the mechanism linking ATP8B1, lipid metabolism, and inflammation remains unclear. Atp8b1 G308V/G308V mouse model, unbiased RNAseq, high-resolution-stimulation emission depltion (STED)-microscopy, and Crispr-Cas9 generated ATP8B1 −/− knockouts in hepatocytes/monocytes/macrophages were used to determine role of ATP8B1 in phosphatidylinositol,4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) trafficking and inflammation. Human ATP8B1, purified from Sf9 insect cells and reconstituted in proteoliposomes, was used to test cell-free PIP2 flip. Various in-vitro techniques were used for testing direct interaction between PIP2 and ATP8B1. ATP8B1 maintains PIP2 at the inner leaflet of plasma membrane (PM). ATP8B1 flips PIP2 in cells, without altering flip of PE or bulk-endocytosis. ATP8b1 flips PIP2 in a cell-free system. ATP8B1 deletion promotes bile-salt-mediated cholesterol extraction from hepatocytes in a PIP2-dependent manner. PIP2 directly binds to the P-loop of ATP8B1. Unbiased RNAseq showed upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in ATP8b1 −/− immune cells. ATP8B1 −/− monocytes/macrophages showed aberrant lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cleavage of GSDMD, formation of GSDMD pores, and interleukin-1beta (IL1β) release. Inflammation-resolving efferocytosis was impaired in ATP8B1 −/− macrophages. Biophysical properties of PM were altered in ATP8b1 −/− cells, with the mechanism being disrupted localization of PIP2. Atp8b1 G308V/G308V mice exposed to LPS showed higher plasma IL1β and lower survival rates vs. WT mice. ATP8B1 maintains PIP2 at the inner leaflet of PM. ATP8b1 directly flips and binds PIP2. ATP8B1 regulates LPS-induced GsdmD cleavage, formation of GsdmD pores, IL1β release, and mortality in mice.",

          "abstract": "The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL135 and UL138 genes play opposing roles regulating latency and reactivation in CD34 + human progenitor cells. We designed an RNA sequencing study to compare the transcriptional profile of HCMV infection in the presence and absence of these genes using the Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) monocytic cell line model for latency. Relative to primary cell models, THP-1 cells offer the strength of a homogenous population that uniformly silences gene expression and will synchronously reexpress viral genes following stimulation to differentiate, which models early phases of viral reactivation. The loss of UL138 resulted in elevated levels of viral gene expression and in spontaneous adhesion of distinct cell populations that support HCMV gene expression and genome synthesis. The loss of UL135 resulted in diminished viral gene expression during an initial burst that occurs as latency is established and in no expression of eleven viral genes from the UL b ′ region even following differentiation and reexpression of viral genes. Transcriptional network analysis revealed host transcription factors (TFs) with potential to regulate the UL b ′ genes in coordination with pUL135. We show that the cellular TF peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma binds to the viral genome and influences the expression of UL133-UL138 locus genes. Our results define roles for UL135 and UL138 in regulation of patterns of viral gene expression for the establishment of latency and reexpression of viral genes for reactivation and reveal insights into differentiation-linked mechanisms of transcriptional control of the HCMV genome.",

          "abstract": "FSP1 is an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase that uses NAD(P)H to regenerate the reduced forms of lipophilic quinone antioxidants, such as coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K. These quinone antioxidants function as radical scavenging agents that prevent the propagation of lipid peroxidation and the induction of ferroptosis. Although several small-molecule inhibitors of FSP1 have been developed and found to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis, our understanding of their molecular mechanisms remains limited and no structures of FSP1 in complex with its inhibitors have been solved. Here, we solve the cocrystal structure of FSP1 in complex with the FSP1 inhibitor FSEN1, revealing that FSEN1 binds within the FSP1 substrate-binding pocket. FSEN1 makes key interactions with a critical phenylalanine, which is absent in mouse FSP1, providing an explanation for the selectivity of FSEN1 for human FSP1. These conclusions are supported by mutagenesis of FSP1 and biochemical and cellular assays of FSP1 function. Our findings provide the first cocrystal structure of FSP1 in complex with an inhibitor, enhancing our understanding of the mechanism of FSP1 inhibition and enabling future rational medicinal chemistry efforts to advance FSP1 inhibitors as therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "The human cortex undergoes immense change in the first years of life, doubling in thickness within the first year and evidencing the greatest change within the first 5 y. While substantial research has identified the early postnatal period as a sensitive period in cortical development, research to date lacks the temporal resolution necessary to identify which aspects of cortical change predict later neural and cognitive function. This study leveraged a rich longitudinal dataset of cortical thickness in 50 children who were scanned up to 11 times between birth and 6 y. We used nonlinear multilevel modeling to explore patterns of cortical change across the brain during this period and distinguish whether different phases of change would predict performance and brain activation during a working memory task children completed at approximately 9 y. Cortical thickness across the brain showed a large increase from birth through 12 mo, a decrease from 12 to 18 mo, and a small increase from 18 mo to 6 y, mirroring patterns of early neural proliferation, pruning, and sustained growth. Performance and neural activation during the working memory task were associated with smaller peak (i.e., 12 mo) thickness and a marginally less steep 12 to 18-mo decline in thickness in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) of the frontal lobe, in line with evidence demonstrating concurrent links between frontal lobe structure and working memory. These findings validate theories of cortical growth developed in preclinical models using human data and demonstrate that prefrontal cortex development in infancy uniquely predicts neurocognitive function 9 y later.",

Cocrystal structure analysis reveals that the anti-IL23R VHH employs both CDR and framework residues to achieve picomolar affinity for IL23R. The engineered VHH remains stable for over 8 h in intestinal fluid and 24 h in fecal samples. Oral administration of this VHH achieves deep pathway inhibition in a murine colitis model. Furthermore, a single pill provides sustained IL23R inhibition in nonhuman primate blood for over 24 h.

          "abstract": "Maintenance of pH within membranous organelles is crucial for cellular processes such as posttranslational modifications, ligand–receptor interactions, and proteostasis. The precise mechanisms that determine the luminal pH of each organelle are not fully understood. This study investigated the mechanisms that regulate luminal pH to ensure optimal enzymatic activity. We identified Oxr1 and its paralog Ncoa7, which regulate the vacuolar-type proton pump ATPase (V-ATPase) at the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network (TGN). Oxr1 and Ncoa7 were predominantly localized at the Golgi and TGN membranes, dependent on their binding to various GTP-bound Rab proteins. In vitro experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicated that Oxr1 and Ncoa7 directly bind to the catalytic subunit of V-ATPase, inhibiting its ATP hydrolytic activity via their TLDc domains. We observed significant acidification of the Golgi/TGN lumen in Oxr1- and Ncoa7-depleted cells. Lectin blot analysis demonstrated that depletion of Oxr1 and Ncoa7 led to a defect in protein glycosylation, a major enzymatic posttranslational modification in the Golgi and TGN. Furthermore, depletion of Oxr1 and Ncoa7, along with drug-induced inhibition of glycosylation, increased lysosomal pH and sensitivity to silicon dioxide-induced membrane damage. This apparent lysosomal dysfunction suggested that, in addition to the Golgi and TGN, Oxr1 and Ncoa7 also contribute to the integrity of other organelles. Our findings indicate that Oxr1 and Ncoa7 protect the Golgi and TGN lumen from excess acidification by inhibiting V-ATPase activity and providing an optimal environment for enzymatic activity in the Golgi and TGN.",

Here, we show that pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) exerts toxicity on the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by generating an aberrantly planar endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure, which we named a “giant ER sheet.” Untargeted lipidomics revealed that C15:0 is incorporated into complex lipids depending on an acyl-CoA ligase Lcf1 and an acyl-CoA transferase Slc1, thereby increasing the saturation level of the acyl chains. The toxicity and giant ER sheet formation were abolished by deleting lcf1 or slc1 gene, indicating that the incorporation of C15:0 into glycerophospholipids causes giant ER sheet formation. The giant ER sheets disrupted the correct migration of Mid1, a protein determining the cell division site, and physically blocked septum formation, hindering correct cell separation. Our results suggest that the ER is the primary site targeted by saturated FAs, leading to lipotoxicity.",

The rice immune receptor XA21 confers race-specific resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , which causes the deadly disease bacterial leaf blight. Here, we demonstrate that XA21 is cleaved by the rhomboid-like protease OsRBL3b, likely within its transmembrane domain. OsRBL3b mRNA transcripts are preferentially expressed in rice spikelets. Rice plants expressing Xa21 but lacking a functional OsRBL3b displayed impaired anther dehiscence and pollen viability, resulting in male sterility and yield reduction with high levels of XA21 protein present in spikelets during anthesis. In leaves, osrbl3b mutants expressing XA21 had normal levels of this resistance protein and disease immunity. This balance between reproduction and disease resistance through the specific expression of a rhomboid protease may be key to limiting the detrimental effects of an active immune response and may be useful in future for genetic improvement of crops.",

          "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms underlying the green insect camouflage have puzzled researchers for over a century. Here, we isolated and identified a green water-soluble protein from the integument of bush-cricket Tettigonia cantans . De novo sequencing and cloning revealed a severely fragmented form of vitellogenins, ubiquitous and multifunctional, but still largely enigmatic glycolipoproteins essential for embryonic development and lacking structural characterization. The distinctive color of the identified chromoprotein results from binding of a remarkable combination of farnesylated bilins (recently identified, tentative heme A catabolites) and xanthophylls, which commensurably absorb light in the 600 to 700 nm and 400 to 550 nm spectral regions and thereby produce a hue that perfectly mimics foliage. The high-resolution crystal structure of this unique ~80 kDa dichromophoric protein, which we named “dibilinoxanthinin” (DBXN), revealed two DBXN protomers, each consisting of three polypeptides, with a novel fold enclosing a large hydrophobic cavity that accommodates two bilins, two luteins, and four phosphatidylcholines, all anchored by hydrogen bonds and giving DBXN unique biochemical and optical properties. Among the green insects tested, some contained yellow and blue chromophores in separate fractions, while others had green proteins similar to DBXN, although not necessarily of the same size. Surprisingly, we isolated and identified a larger vitellogenin proteoform with DBXN-like absorption, from the green huntsman spider Micrommata virescens . These data illustrate striking variations in the DBXN-related pigmentation mechanism among different green arthropods and suggest that vitellogenins may have undergone neofunctionalization, reflecting their potential for functional diversification.",

By using a filtration-based protocol, our experiments demonstrate that the self-reproduction process occurs concomitantly with the PISA process and results in a nonlinear increase in the number of polymer vesicles during photopolymerization which can only be ascribed to their reproduction via polymeric spores ejected from previously existing first-generation vesicles. The second and subsequent generations’ vesicles also self-reproduce and continue the process of population growth.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated calcium (Ca V ) channels are pivotal in cellular signaling due to their selective calcium ion permeation upon membrane depolarization. While previous studies have established the highly selective permeability of Ca V channels, the detailed molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we use extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanisms governing ion permeation and valence selectivity in Ca V 1 channels. Employing the electronic continuum correction method, we simulated a calcium conductance of approximately 9 to 11 pS, aligning closely with experimental measurement. Our simulations uncovered a three-ion knock-on mechanism critical for efficient calcium ion permeation, necessitating the binding of at least two calcium ions within the selectivity filter (SF) and the subsequent entry of a third ion. In silico mutation simulations further validated the importance of multi-ion coordination in the SF for efficient ion permeation, identifying two critical residues, D706 and E1101, that are essential for the binding of two calcium ions in the SF. Moreover, we explored the competitive permeation of calcium and sodium ions and obtained a valence selectivity favoring calcium over sodium at a ratio of approximately 35:1 under the bication condition. This selectivity arises from the strong electrostatic interactions of calcium ions in the confined SF and the three-ion knock-on mechanism. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the molecular underpinnings of Ca V channel function, with implications for understanding calcium-dependent cellular processes.",

However, the high-yield biochemical isolation and visualization of endogenous NLGNs is hampered by the lack of efficient antibodies. Thus, to reveal their subcellular distribution, binding partners, and synaptic function, NLGNs were extensively manipulated using knock-down, knock-out, or overexpression approaches, leading to controversial results. As an alternative to the manipulation of NLGN expression level, we describe here the generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse strain in which native NLGN1 was N-terminally tagged with a small biotin acceptor peptide (bAP) that can be enzymatically biotinylated by the exogenous delivery of biotin ligase. After showing that KI mice exhibit normal behavior as well as similar synaptic number, ultrastructure, transmission properties, and protein expression levels when compared to wild type counterparts, we exploited the fact that biotinylated bAP-NLGN1 can be selectively isolated or visualized using high-affinity streptavidin conjugates. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we show that bAP-NLGN1 binds PSD-95 and gephyrin and populates both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, challenging the historical view that NLGN1 is exclusively localized at excitatory synapses. Using superresolution optical and electron microscopy, we further highlight that bAP-NLGN1 forms in the synaptic cleft a subset of nanodomains, which contain each a few NLGN1 dimers and whose number positively scales with the postsynapse size. Overall, our study not only provides an extensively characterized KI mouse model which will be available to the scientific community but also an unprecedented view of the nanoscale organization of endogenous NLGN1.",

For pigment- and oil-producing yeasts, pDEP-DLD-RACS shows high sorting accuracy (&gt;90%), high throughput (~600 events min −1 ), high yield (&gt;85%), and long stable running time (~10 h), and can sort rare cells while preserving full cellular vitality. Moreover, label-free sorting directly from a genome-wide random mutagenesis library with &gt;10 5 Aurantiochytrium sp. Mutants, based on intracellular docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content, produces mutant cells with 58% higher DHA productivity in just two RACS runs over two days, representing two-orders-of-magnitude higher time- and cost-efficiency than conventional approaches. This superior trait arises from global remolding of transcriptomes, including enhanced carbon metabolism, reduced intracellular NADPH synthesis rates, and increased triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis.

          "abstract": "The synthesis of new polyhydrides with high superconducting T c is challenging owing to the high pressures and temperatures required. In this study, we used machine-learning potential molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the initial stage of polyhydride formation in calcium hydrides. Upon contact with high-pressure H 2 , the surface of CaH 2 melts, leading to CaH 4 formation. This surface melting proceeds via CaH 4 liquid phase as an intermediate state. High pressure reduces not only the hydrogenation (CaH 2 (s) + H 2 (l) ↔ CaH 4 (s)) enthalpy but also the enthalpy for liquid polyhydride formation (CaH 2 (s) + H 2 (l) ↔ CaH 4 (l)). Consequently, this surface melting process becomes more favorable than the fusion of the polyhydride bulk. Thus, high pressure not only shifts the equilibrium toward the polyhydride product but also lowers the activation energy, thereby promoting the hydrogenation reaction. From these thermodynamic insights, we propose structure-search criteria for polyhydride synthesis that are both computationally effective and experimentally relevant. These criteria are based on bulk properties, such as polyhydride (product) melting temperature and pressure-dependent hydrogenation enthalpy, readily determined through supplementary calculations during structure prediction workflows.",

Notably, Il18r1 is also predicted to be expressed and functional in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), since epithelial IL18R1 deficiency contributes to worsened outcomes upon inflammatory challenge. However, the nature of Il18r1 + IECs, and their subsequent role in epithelial-intrinsic IL-18 signaling is poorly characterized. Here, we show that, in the murine small intestine, the IL-18 receptor is expressed by rare IECs that we identified to be a subset of enterochromaffin cells (ECC). While these cells are the major producers of serotonin in the intestine, we found no evidence that IL-18 regulated serotonin metabolism or release. Rather, upon radiation-induced injury, Il18r1 + cells appeared in the crypt base and took on a revival stem cell (revSC) program, marked by mixed expression of YAP/TAZ and enteroendocrine genes signatures. Functionally, irradiated Il18 −/− mice display reduced epithelial proliferation and altered differentiation in the small intestine, characterized by increased Paneth cells (PC) and elevated Wnt3 levels, which was partially recapitulated in Il18 −/− ileal organoids. In sum, we identified an Il18r1 + population in the epithelium and revealed a role for IEC-intrinsic IL-18 signaling during injury.",

          "abstract": "The directed movement of eukaryotic cells is critical for processes such as development and immune responses. While much is known about chemoattraction, much less is known about chemorepulsion. The eukaryotic amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum secretes a 60 kDa chemorepellent protein called AprA to cause cells at the edge of a colony to move away from the colony. In addition to AprA, cells secrete a &lt;10 kDa chemorepellent. Here, we show that the &lt;10 kDa chemorepellent is a polymer of phosphates (polyphosphate; polyP). D. discoideum cells move by activating cortical Ras at one edge of the cell to initiate pseudopod formation. AprA induces repulsion by inhibiting Ras activation and pseudopod formation on the side of the cell closest to the source of AprA, without affecting the overall frequency of pseudopod formation. In contrast, polyP activates Ras at multiple regions of the cortex and increases pseudopod formation frequency, especially at the side of the cell furthest from the source of polyP. At least 20 signal transduction proteins are needed for both AprA and polyP repulsion, 9 are needed by polyP but not AprA, and 4 are needed by AprA but not polyP. Together, these results indicate that proliferating D. discoideum cells use two different chemorepellents, that one of the repellents is the unusual molecule polyphosphate, and that the two repellents activate partially overlapping and partially different pathways to induce repulsion by two basically different mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "In eukaryotic genomes, DNA is packaged into nucleosomes to form chromatin. The incorporation of canonical or variant histones into nucleosomes confers different properties and influences chromatin structure to regulate cellular processes, including recombination. During meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed and repaired as interhomolog crossovers. Nucleosome occupancy is generally associated with low crossover frequency, but it remains unclear which histone variants are involved in this process. In Arabidopsis , three variants of H2A coexist: H2A.X, H2A.Z, and H2A.W. Here, we show that H2A.W7 has a suppressive role on meiotic recombination. Genome-wide mapping of the crossover landscape revealed increased centromere-proximal recombination in h2a.w7 . Moreover, H2A.W7 can be recruited to the 3a crossover hotspot via 21-24-nucleotide siRNAs during RNA-directed DNA methylation, causing increased nucleosome occupancy and decreased crossover frequency. Cytological analysis reveals that H2A.W7 restricts heterochromatin clustering during meiosis, which can form a mechanism to limit interhomolog recombination. Conversely, the linker histone H1, of which its loading is known to be restricted by H2A.W, promotes heterochromatin clustering and crossover on a heterochromatic genetic interval. Our study reveals a role for H2A.W7 in repressing crossover formation in Arabidopsis .",

It has been extensively studied as a prototype of a biomolecular condensate whose assembly is driven by phase separation. While the steady-state size of the nucleolus is quantitatively accounted for by the thermodynamics of phase separation, we show that experimental measurements of the assembly dynamics are inconsistent with a simple model of a phase-separating system relaxing to its equilibrium state. Instead, we show that the dynamics are well described by a model in which the transcription of ribosomal RNA actively drives nucleolar assembly. We find that our model of active transcription-templated assembly quantitatively accounts for the rapid kinetics observed in early embryos at different developmental stages, and for different RNA interference (RNAi) perturbations of embryo size. Our model predicts a scaling of the time to assembly with the volume of the nucleus to the one-third power, which is confirmed by experimental data. Our study highlights the role of active processes such as transcription in controlling the placement and timing of assembly of membraneless organelles.",

Rhesus macaques, randomly cued to attend to a target object amid distracters, were rewarded for detecting a color change in the target. While spatial attention does not affect the object tuning curves of V4 cells, the direction of MS significantly influenced object representations in V4 throughout the entire trial. Specifically, intervals following an MS toward the target exhibited superior stimulus decoding and sharper tuning curves compared to intervals following an MS away from the target. Furthermore, MSs directed toward the target enhanced neuronal responses to behaviorally relevant color changes, leading to faster reaction times. This sharpening effect stems from both a refreshing of the initial sensory response and an amplification of attention effects. The firing rate enhancement associated with spatial attention is delayed until the occurrence of the first MS directed toward the target. Subsequently, a positive effect of attention on firing rate, influenced by MS direction, was found throughout the trial across deep and superficial layers of V4, lateral pulvinar, and IT cortex. In summary, these findings underscore a crucial link between covert attention, object processing, and their coordination with MSs.",

          "abstract": "T cells display the remarkable ability to detect single foreign peptides displayed on target cells, while ignoring highly abundant self-peptides. This selectivity has been explained by kinetic proofreading in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, which prevents responses to short-lived binding events regardless of their abundance. However, the biochemical mechanisms that drive kinetic proofreading have remained unclear. Here, using computational modeling, we show that these key signaling properties of the TCR pathway can emerge from the dynamics of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) phosphorylation, diffusion, and condensation following TCR–peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) binding. In this model, time delays in LAT condensate nucleation underlie kinetic proofreading, enabling selective signaling responses to high-affinity pMHC ligands. The cooperativity in the nucleation and growth of LAT condensates also provides a mechanism to amplify weak signals from single high-affinity peptides and for condensates to grow with increasing antigen numbers. In contrast to other models, condensate-nucleation proofreading predicts a dependence of signal strength on pMHC spacing at fixed number, a prediction we validated experimentally using a protein scaffold to present pMHCs at defined intervals. Our results suggest that nucleation-condensation proofreading underlies the remarkable antigen detection capabilities of the TCR signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that add and lose tubulin dimers at their ends. Microtubule growth, shortening, and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryoelectron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to the straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intracluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to forming a straight microtubule lattice and accommodating new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is the key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.",

          "abstract": "The underlying factors that lead to specific strains within a species to emerge as human pathogens remain mostly enigmatic. The diarrheal disease cholera is caused by strains from a phylogenetically confined group within the Vibrio cholerae species, the pandemic cholera group (PCG), making it an ideal model system to tackle this puzzling phenomenon. Comprehensive analyses of over 1,840 V. cholerae genomes, including environmental isolates from this study, reveal that the species consists of eleven groups, with the PCG belonging to the largest and located within a lineage shared with environmental strains. This hierarchical classification provided us with a framework to unravel the ecoevolutionary dynamics of the genetic determinants associated with the emergence of toxigenic V. cholerae . Our analyses indicate that this phenomenon is largely dependent on the acquisition of unique modular gene clusters and allelic variations that confer a competitive advantage during intestinal colonization. We determined that certain PCG-associated alleles are essential for successful colonization whereas others provide a nonlinear competitive advantage, acting as a critical bottleneck that clarifies the isolated emergence of PCG. For instance, toxigenic strains encoding non-PCG alleles of a) tcpF or b) a sextuple allelic exchange mutant for genes tcpA , toxT , VC0176 , VC1791 , rfbT, and ompU , lose their ability to colonize the intestine. Interestingly, these alleles do not play a role in the colonization of newly established model environmental reservoirs. Our study uncovers the evolutionary roots of toxigenic V. cholerae offering a tractable approach for investigating the emergence of pathogenic clones within an environmental population.",

          "abstract": "Pigmentation plays a vital role in the survival of organisms, supporting functions such as camouflage, communication, and mate attraction. In vertebrates, these functions are mediated by specialized pigment cells known as chromatophores of which, uric acid crystal–forming leucophores remain the least understood, with little known about their molecular mechanisms. A key question in pigment cell biology is whether different crystal chemistries require distinct molecular pathways, or whether similar cellular processes drive the formation of diverse crystals. This study was designed to unravel the uncharacterized process of uric acid crystallization in leucophores and compare them to guanine crystal formation in iridophores and pterin formation in xanthophores. The results of our transcriptomic, ultrastructural, and metabolomic analyses, demonstrate that leucophores share molecular pathways with iridophores, particularly those connected to organelle organization and purine metabolism, but express discrete genes involved in uric acid biosynthesis and storage. Additionally, leucophores share intracellular trafficking and pterin biosynthesis genes with xanthophores, suggesting universally conserved processes. Ultrastructural studies reveal star-like fibrous structures in leucosomes, which likely serve as scaffolds for unique one-dimensional uric acid assemblies that radiate from the core and act as efficient light scatterers. These findings provide insights into leucophore cell biology and the specialized mechanisms driving molecular crystalline assembly, and reveal that while some cellular processes are conserved, the specific chemistry of each crystal type drives the evolution of distinct molecular pathways.",

          "abstract": "Imbalanced production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While several monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ have shown reductions in amyloid burden, their impact on cognitive function remains controversial, with the added risk of inflammatory side effects. Dysregulated stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, yet the biological interaction between this pathway and Aβ, as well as their combined influence on AD progression, is poorly understood. Here, we show that while microglia play a protective role in clearing extracellular Aβ, excessive Aβ engulfment triggers the cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA for cGAS–STING cascade. This creates a negative feedback loop that not only exacerbates neuroinflammation but also impairs further Aβ clearance. To address this, we present a nanomedicine approach termed “Aβ-STING Synergistic ImmunoSilencing Therapy (ASSIST)”. ASSIST comprises STING inhibitors encapsulated within a blood–brain barrier (BBB)-permeable polymeric micelle that also serves as an Aβ scavenger. Through a multivalent interaction mechanism, ASSIST efficiently destabilizes Aβ plaques and prevents monomer aggregation, subsequently promoting the engulfment of the dissociated Aβ by microglia rather than neurocytes. Furthermore, the STING signaling induced by excessive Aβ uptake is blocked, reducing inflammation and restoring microglial homeostatic functions involved in Aβ clearance. Intravenous administration of ASSIST significantly reduces Aβ burden and improves cognition in AD mice, with minimal cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microhemorrhages. We provide a proof-of-concept nanoengineering strategy to target the maladaptive immune feedback loop arising from conventional immunotherapy for AD treatment.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that target and infect bacteria. Due to a worldwide rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), phages have been proposed as a promising alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacterial infections. Up to this point in history, phage use in preclinical animal studies, clinical trials, and emergency-use compassionate care cases has centered around the original observation from 1915 showing phage as lytic agent, and thus a treatment that kills bacteria. Here, we describe an activity associated with phage therapy that extends beyond lytic activity that results in long-term protection against reinfection. This activity is potent, providing almost complete protection against a second lethal infection for animals treated with phage therapy. The activity also reduced infection burden an astounding billion-fold over the control. Reinfection protection requires phage lytic killing of its target bacterium but is independent of additional phage therapy. The effect is not driven by phage alone, lingering phage resistors, or a sublethal inoculum. In vitro phage-lysed bacteria provide partial protection, suggesting a combination of phage-induced lytic activity and immune stimulation by phage treatment is responsible for the effect. These observations imply certain phages may induce host adaptive responses following the lysis of the infecting bacteria. This work suggests phage therapy may contain a dual-action effect, an initial treatment efficacy followed by a long-term protection against reoccurring infection, a therapeutic-vaccination mechanism of action.",

Here, we demonstrated that host complement C3, acquired by mosquitoes during Plasmodium infection, significantly enhanced rodent malaria infection in laboratory-reared mosquitoes. This effect was recapitulated in field-caught Anopheles sinensis mosquitoes, confirming its relevance to malaria transmission in a more natural setting. Moreover, host-derived C3 significantly reduced the efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies in blocking malaria transmission. Mechanistically, host-derived C3 lyses the mosquito midgut symbiont Elizabethkingia anophelis ( E. anophelis )—a bacterium that intrinsically suppresses parasite development by blocking the zygote-to-ookinete transition. Strikingly, host-derived C3 in mosquitoes appears to be activated by the alternative pathway, and inhibiting Factor B with Iptacopan (LNP023) reduced Plasmodium falciparum ( P. falciparum ) infection, while increased the efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies to blocking P. falciparum transmission in the standard membrane-feeding assay. Therefore, this study describes a strategy of the malaria parasite to utilize host complement C3 to promote its transmission and provides us with an avenue to block malaria transmission and improve the blocking efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies by the inhibition of C3 activation.",

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and modeling of the conformational states of isolated TcEs and TcE–antigen complexes predicted close contacts (≤13 nm) for Formats A and B and far contacts (≥18 nm) for Formats C and D. In supported lipid bilayer (SLB) model interfaces, Formats A and B recruited, whereas Formats C and D repelled, CD2–CD58 interactions. Formats A and B also excluded bulky Quantum dots more effectively. SAXS also revealed that TcE–antigen complexes formed by Formats A and C were less flexible than complexes formed by Formats B and D.

In a minimal system for IS formation on SLBs, TcE performance followed the trend A = B = C &gt; D. Addition of close contact requiring CD58 costimulation revealed phospholipase C-γ activation matching cytotoxicity with A &gt; B = C &gt; D. Our findings suggest that when adhesion is equivalent, TcE potency is determined by two parameters: contact distance and flexibility. Both the close/far-contact formation axis and the low/high flexibility axis significantly impact TcE potency, explaining the similar potency of Format B (close contact/high flexibility) and C (far contact/low flexibility).",

          "abstract": "Partial melting of metasedimentary rocks is generally accepted as the source of peraluminous Himalayan leucogranites—they are commonly considered as pure “S-type” (sedimentary source) granites. Here, a uniquely comprehensive geochronological and geochemical dataset shows that partial melting of metaigneous rocks in the eastern Himalaya produced peraluminous leucogranites—these supposed S-type leucogranites have I-type (igneous) sources. Inherited magmatic zircons from leucogranites and metaigneous rocks have indistinguishable ages, trace element compositions, and Hf isotope compositions, distinct from zircons in metasedimentary rocks. Experimentally, partial melting of metagranitic rocks rather than metapelites predicts alkali major element chemistry of these leucogranites better. High δ 18 O, high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and low ε Nd (t) for Himalayan leucogranites have been used to argue for a metasedimentary rock source, but overlapping values occur in metaigneous rocks. Although sediment-sourced leucogranites also occur, igneous-sourced leucogranites are likely common in large hot orogens. A survey of leucogranite geochemistry across the Himalaya suggests that ~20% might be I-type, with no apparent spatial or temporal bias. I-type leucogranites appear to be rare-metal poor, however. Unlike prior assertions that I-type granites represent juvenile additions to orogens, metaigneous-sourced Himalayan granites more likely represent crustal reworking.",

Whether necroptosis can be activated independent of the upstream signaling pathways leading to inflammatory pathogenesis remains ambiguous. Here, we revealed a mechanism in which a viral protein mediates direct RIPK3 activation resulting in severe inflammatory pathogenesis in patients. The nonstructural protein NSs of a pathogenic hemorrhagic virus, SFTSV, interacts with the RIPK3 kinase domain and forms biocondensate to promote RIPK3 autophosphorylation and necroptosis activation in an RHIM-independent manner. In parallel, sequestration of RIPK3 within the NSs–RIPK3 condensate inhibited RIPK3-mediated apoptosis and promoted viral replication. Infection with an SFTSV NSs mutant virus not forming NSs condensate triggered pronounced apoptosis resulting in reduced viral replication and decreased fatality in vivo. Blocking SFTSV-triggered necroptosis through depletion of MLKL or treatment with a RIPK3-kinase inhibitor reduced viral inflammatory pathogenesis and fatality in vivo. In contrast, blocking SFTSV-triggered apoptosis through depletion of RIPK3 resulted in enhanced viral replication and increased fatality in vivo. The virus-triggered necroptosis correlated with severe inflammatory pathogenesis and lethality in virus-infected patients. The NSs–RIPK3 condensate may represent a necroptosis activation mechanism that promotes viral pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule, can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study decoherence in a sequence of analogous organic molecules of increasing size and find, surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down decoherence and prolongs charge migration. To elucidate this observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from individual vibrational modes and show that: 1) The initial decay of electronic coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces. 2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing position separation in the low-frequency modes. 3) In agreement with another study, we observe that only normal modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a combination of increased hole-mixing and the disappearance of decoherence contributions from specific vibrational modes—CO stretching in butynal and various H rockings in pentynal.",

Here, we used pharmacological and genetic perturbations both in vitro and in vivo to determine whether synaptic scaling and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity (IHP) are arranged and recruited in a hierarchical or modular manner within layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in the rodent primary visual cortex (V1). Surprisingly, although the expression of synaptic scaling and IHP was dependent on overlapping signaling pathways, they could be independently recruited by manipulating spiking activity or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, respectively. Further, we found that changes in visual experience that affect NMDAR activation but not mean firing selectively trigger IHP, without recruiting synaptic scaling. These findings support a modular model in which synaptic and IHP respond to and stabilize distinct aspects of network activity.",

Our study identifies mgat4b , a glycosyl transferase involved in selective N -glycan branching enriched in pigment progenitors, as a regulator of directional cell migration and establishment of melanocyte stem cell (McSC) pool during early development. Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis in zebrafish upon targeted disruption of mgat4b reveals, that migratory melanocyte progenitors marked by galectin expression fail to persist. Lectin affinity proteomic analysis reveals the glycosylation of key melanocyte proteins GPNMB, KIT, and TYRP1 to be under the control of MGAT4B in melanocytic cells. Additionally, mislocalization of Junctional plakoglobin (JUP) explains the observed defects in cell adhesion and migration to be regulated by MGAT4B but not its isozyme MGAT4A. Our meta-analysis further reveals that melanoma patients with both the BRAF V600E mutation and elevated MGAT4B levels have significantly worse survival outcomes compared to those with only the BRAF V600E mutation. By leveraging the zebrafish MAZERATI platform to model BRAF V600E driver mutation in vivo, we show that mgat4b mutant cells fail to aggregate and initiate tumors. RNA profiling of the transformed melanocytes revealed cell–cell junction, adhesion, and ECM binding to be probable contributing factors that resulted in the failure of tumor onset. Using a small-molecule inhibitor we demonstrate that complex N -glycosylation inhibits early-stage melanoma progression. Our study underscores the importance of selective N -glycan branching in both melanocyte development and melanoma initiation, suggesting MGAT4B as a promising therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.",

Our findings indicate remarkably consistent Zn and K isotope compositions across all lunar basalt types, despite significant variations in Th content. This consistency suggests a relatively homogeneous isotopic composition of volatile elements within the Moon, unaffected by subsequent impact events that formed major basins.

Exploring tessellation at the molecular scale is pivotal for gaining profound insights into the effects of tessellation on materials and elucidating the essential design principles for supramolecular tessellation. In this study, we develop a dynamic fullerene host ( 1 ) with three consecutive heptagons, which promotes diverse supramolecular tessellation via hierarchical assembly. In the solid state, molecule 1 arranges itself into a layered square-shaped tessellation in the crystal superstructure. Interestingly, the co-crystal structures of 1 with C 60 and C 70 exhibit highly ordered triangular and rhombic tessellation patterns, respectively, due to the adaptive regulation of heptagons with different curved guests, demonstrating the first series of layered tessellated framework in supramolecular fullerene chemistry.

          "abstract": "A fully functional Dicer helicase, present in the modern arthropod, uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to power translocation on bound dsRNA, enabling the processive dsRNA cleavage required for efficient antiviral defense. However, modern Dicer orthologs exhibit divergent helicase functions that affect their ability to contribute to antiviral defense. Moreover, mechanisms that couple ATP hydrolysis to Dicer helicase movement on dsRNA remain enigmatic. We used biochemical and structural analyses of ancestrally reconstructed Dicer helicases to map evolution of dsRNA binding affinity, ATP hydrolysis and translocation. Loss of affinity for dsRNA occurred early in Dicer evolution, coinciding with a decline in translocation activity, despite preservation of ATP hydrolysis activity. Ancestral nematode Dicer also exhibited significant decline in ATP hydrolysis and translocation, but studies of antiviral activities in the modern nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate Dicer retained a role in antiviral defense by recruiting a second helicase. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses of an ancient metazoan Dicer allowed capture of multiple helicase states revealing the mechanism that connects each step of ATP hydrolysis to unidirectional movement along dsRNA. Our study rationalizes the diversity in modern Dicer helicases by connecting ancestral functions to observations in extant enzymes.",

We performed a Bayesian genome-wide association study and selection analyses in this naturally occurring canine model to elucidate underlying genetic risk factors for gastric cancer and identified 15 associated loci. Variant filtering revealed germline putative regulatory variants for the EPAS1 ( HIF2A ) and PTEN genes and a coding variant in CD101 . Two loci are overrepresented among cases of intestinal tumor subtype. Although closely related to Tervuren and Sheepdogs, Belgian Malinois rarely develop gastric cancer. Across-breed analyses uncovered haplotypes enriched in Malinois at SOX2-OT and IGF2BP2 that are at significantly higher frequency among genome-wide association study controls. Among Tervuren and Sheepdogs, HDAC2 putative regulatory variants were present at comparatively high frequency and were associated with risk of gastric cancer.

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism distinguished by its dependence on iron-mediated lipid oxidation. Cancer cells highly resistant to conventional therapies often demonstrate lipid metabolic and redox vulnerabilities that sensitize them to cell death by ferroptosis. These include a unique dependency on the lipid antioxidant selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), that acts as a ferroptosis inhibitor. Synthetic high-density lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (HDL NP) targets the high-affinity HDL receptor scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) and regulates cell and cell membrane lipid metabolism. Recently, we reported that targeting cancer cell SR-B1 with HDL NP depleted cell GPx4, which is accompanied by increased cell membrane lipid peroxidation and cancer cell death. These data suggest that HDL NP may induce ferroptosis. Thus, we conducted an unbiased CRISPR-based positive selection screen and target validation studies in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cell lines to ascertain the mechanism through which HDL NP regulates GPx4 and kills cancer cells. The screen revealed two genes, acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), whose loss conferred resistance to HDL NP. Validation of ACSL4 supports that HDL NP induces ferroptosis as the predominant mechanism of cell death, while validation of TXNRD1 revealed that HDL NP reduces cellular selenium and selenoprotein production, most notably, GPx4. Accordingly, we define cancer cell metabolic targets that can be simultaneously actuated by a multifunctional, synthetic HDL NP ligand of SR-B1 to kill cancer cells by ferroptosis.",

We show that in mice, this induction of FGF21 occurs at the level of gene transcription and is regulated by two byproducts of ethanol metabolism, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and acetyl-CoA. Using cell-based reporter and thermal shift binding assays, we show that G3P binds to a conserved domain and activates the transcription factor carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), which regulates the Fgf21 gene promoter. The stimulation of Fgf21 gene transcription by ethanol also requires its metabolism to acetyl-CoA and correlates with histone acetylation. Accordingly, a p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase inhibitor blocks histone acetylation, ChREBP recruitment, and transcriptional activation at the Fgf21 promoter. Together, these findings reveal a dual regulatory mechanism driven by both G3P and acetyl-CoA that explains ethanol’s robust stimulatory effect on Fgf21 and possibly other ChREBP target genes in the liver.",

The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO 2 efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions.",

We estimated the divergence from its closest tick-borne relative to 6000 to 4000 years ago, which suggests an emergence coinciding with human lifestyle changes such as the advent of wool-based textiles. Pan-genome analysis indicated that much of the evolution characteristic of B. recurrentis had occurred by ~2300 years ago, though further gene turnover, particularly in plasmid partitioning, persisted until ~1000 years ago.

By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix αC displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix αC in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds.",

We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years.

Here, we performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3.

We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution ( VaPAP1 for loss of mottled black and VaANR1 for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence.

In this study, we repurposed the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to predict this chemical specificity between IDRs and partner proteins using protein sequence as the only input. Our approach—FINCHES—enables the direct prediction of phase diagrams, the identification of chemically specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, the decomposition of chemically distinct domains in IDRs, and a route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in molecular recognition.",

Numerous three-dimensionally preserved fossils constitute one of the most taxonomically rich Late Cretaceous avialan assemblages, including members of Hesperornithes, Ichthyornithes, and near-crown or crown birds (Neornithes), recording a previously undocumented interval in avialan evolution.

Additionally, we identified a network of branched actin filaments that attenuates metaphase spindle elongation. We also visualized nuclear actin in human embryos, suggesting a conserved role for actin in ensuring mitotic fidelity during early mammalian development.",

We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly.",

          "abstract": "Although buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ) is usually the electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), its molecular nature leads to weak interfaces that result in nonideal interfacial electronic and mechanical degradation. In this study, we synthesized an ionic salt from C 60 , 4-(1′,5′-dihydro-1′-methyl-2′ H -[5,6] fullereno-C 60 - I h -[1,9-c]pyrrol-2′-yl) phenylmethanaminium chloride (CPMAC), and used it as the electron shuttle in inverted PSCs. The CH 2 -NH 3 + head group in the CPMA cation improved the ETL interface, and the ionic nature enhanced the packing, leading to a ~threefold increase in the interfacial toughness compared with that of C 60 . Using CPMAC, we obtained ~26% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with ~2% degradation after 2100 hours of 1-sun operation at 65°C. For minimodules (four subcells, 6 square centimeters), we achieved a PCE of ~23% with &lt;9% degradation after 2200 hours of operation at 55°C.",

          "abstract": "The role of the Great Acceleration in transitioning the Earth into a new system state invites questions about the acceleration mechanism itself. Here, we use socioeconomic and environmental datasets from Roman Western Anatolia (first c. BCE to seventh c. CE) to investigate the possible mechanisms of globalization-driven acceleration. After the Roman conquest, Anatolia experienced a rapid transition to profoundly anthropogenic landscapes, reaching hitherto unknown levels of agricultural production that remained stable for several centuries. At the socioeconomic level, as revealed by our application of social network analysis to the numismatic data, the growth dynamics continued, leading to ever greater integration. When international conflict in the seventh c. CE disrupted the connectivity, the anthropogenic landscapes rewilded. This dual-system behavior, critical transition followed by equilibrium in the socioecological realm and continued growth in the socioeconomic realm, suggests that the observed postacceleration stabilization necessitated differential balancing of negative and positive feedbacks in each domain.",

We find that the life satisfaction of Afghans dropped significantly following the conclusion of the War in Afghanistan in 2022, with two-thirds reporting a life satisfaction rating of 0 or 1 on a 0-to-10–point scale. When compared to data from two international well-being datasets together covering more than 170 countries between 1946 and 2022, the mean life satisfaction score in Afghanistan following the Taliban regaining power ( M  = 1.28) is the lowest ever recorded. The mean hope score in the country also dropped to a critically low level ( M  = 1.02) in 2022.

We identify FOXO3 as a repressor of IFNS, whose abundance decreases upon PHD3 induction in response to oAß. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations. Together, our data strongly indicate that the inactivation of the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, improving AD outcome.",

While recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven digital twin development using discrete-time data and finite-depth models on digital hardware, these approaches face significant limitations. They struggle to capture continuous-time dynamics and model complex systems, and suffer from substantial time and energy overheads due to physically separated storage and processing as well as frequent analog-digital (A/D) conversions. Here, we propose a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins. Our approach is intrinsically time-continuous using infinite-depth neural networks to model complex dynamics. Fully analog memristor arrays collocate storage and computation, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck and reducing A/D conversion requirements. We experimentally validate our solver on digital twins of HP variable-resistor model and Lorenz96 dynamics, demonstrating a 166.5-fold/369.3-fold speedup and a 499.0-fold/673.9-fold improvement in energy efficiency, respectively.

          "abstract": "Understanding the regulation of N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A), the prominent internal modification in mRNA, fosters the development of potential therapeutic strategies for human cancers. While the m 6 A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout of FTO , but not ALKBH5 , significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression. Mechanistic analysis reveals that FTO heightens ELK3 mRNA stability in an m 6 A-dependent manner. Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppresses ELK3 expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy. Our findings unravel the crucial role of FTO in T-ALL and highlight the FTO-ELK3 axis as a key nodule during leukemogenesis, thereby providing a fundamental basis to harness selective FTO antagonist for T-ALL therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, is widely used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and drug-resistant Gram-positive infections. However, prolonged use is associated with severe hematologic toxicity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of linezolid metabolites. Our clinical study indicates that elevated exposure to PNU142586, a primary metabolite of linezolid, is associated with an increased risk of linezolid-induced toxicity, even in the absence of renal impairment. To elucidate its mechanism, we identify DNA topoisomerase 2-α (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-β (TOP2B) as primary targets of PNU142586 at molecular, cellular, and in vivo levels. PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification.",

We reveal that preceramic hunter-gatherers represent a previously unknown basal lineage that derives from the initial South American radiation. These hunter-gatherers do not carry differential affinity to ancient North American groups nor contribute genetically to ancient or present-day South American populations. By 2000 years ago, the local genetic ancestry is replaced by populations from Central America associated with the Herrera ceramic complex and survives through the Muisca period despite major cultural changes.

Here, we present high-precision radioisotopic dates for the Ordovician-Silurian transition in South China that reveal the LOME began at 442.76 + 0.35/−0.22 million years ago, with the two phases lasting for 0.34 + 0.46/−0.34 and 0.06 + 0.31/−0.06 million years, respectively. The rapid switch from icehouse to greenhouse conditions, along with the higher mean rate of temperature change during LOME II, resulted in a much higher mean extinction rate during LOME II than I (71.6% versus 8.4% species loss per 100 thousand years, respectively), implying that the rate of climate change was a primary control on the tempo of the LOME.",

Despite its abundance, the impact of defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, on davemaoite’s properties under mantle conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we use machine learning molecular dynamic simulations to examine the behavior of oxygen-deficient davemaoite structures under high pressures and temperatures. Our simulations reveal its superionic transition driven by oxygen’s diffusion, enhancing electrical conductivities. Our predicted phase diagrams demonstrate that higher oxygen vacancy concentrations expand the superionic phase region. This superionic behavior implies that defective davemaoite could play a critical role in early mantle oxidation and deep-Earth oxygen cycling, providing a potential major source of mobile oxygen in the deep mantle. These findings offer fresh insights into the geodynamic processes in Earth’s early mantle and suggest that oxygen-deficient davemaoite could primarily contribute to the electrical conductivity and oxidation state of the deep lower mantle.",

Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion of Piezo1 leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs. These findings establish the force threshold necessary for PIEZO1 activation and reveal PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx as a key mechanism for sensing mechanical cues in the niche and regulating HF-SC activity.",

We find that pharmacological stimulation of this channel and a constitutively active Slack mutation stimulate mRNA translation of a reporter for β-actin mRNA in cell lines and increases the synthesis of β-actin in the neurites of cortical neurons. Moreover, channel activation promotes the binding of two key mRNA translation regulators, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1–interacting protein 1), to the channel itself, releasing both from eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), where they normally inhibit initiation of translation.

Encouragingly, in vitro selection of mutant strains with 5i3 took 39 passages to select resistance, with no phenotypic cross-resistance observed with known RT drugs. Co-crystal structures of wild-type and mutant RT with 5i3 and 5e2 revealed their resilience toward resistance mutations due to enhanced conformational flexibility and positional adaptability. 5i3 exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties and favorable safety profiles, without substantial cytochrome P450 inhibition, and excellent oral bioavailability.

Here, we demonstrate that secondary eggshell units in non-avian dinosaur eggshells are biogenic in nature, based on analyses using advanced microscopic techniques. The structural characteristics of these units suggest a formation mechanism similar to that of turtle and crocodile eggshells, with matrix fibers likely initiating their development. Furthermore, a diminishing presence of secondary eggshell units in non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs points to the evolution of a more refined physiological process for eggshell formation in this lineage.

We also present evidence of enhanced sputtering during a solar storm, offering a glimpse at more intense conditions in the early solar system. Observationally establishing the role of sputtering in the loss of Mars’ atmosphere is critical to understanding the conditions that allowed liquid water to exist on the martian surface and the implications for habitability.",

          "abstract": "Tide gauges provide a long observational record that can inform the nature of satellite-era basin-scale sea level trends. However, common signals must be extracted from geographically sparse records. Here, by applying low-frequency component analysis (LFCA) to tide gauge records and surface climate reconstructions, we isolate three coherent modes of Pacific Ocean variability that we ascribe to: a secular, greenhouse gas–driven climate change (LFC1); a nonlinear mode of variability with a reversal around 1980, potentially linked to aerosols (LFC2); and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (LFC3). Although sea level trend patterns reflect the superimposed contribution of all modes, satellite-era trends are dominated by an increasing phase of LFC2: They are thus potentially unrepresentative of both longer-term historical patterns and those expected in the future.",

          "abstract": "In spring, global warming exhibits prominent zonal asymmetry at continental scales, with Eurasia warming three times faster than North America during 1979–2021. Meanwhile, snow loss is also highly asymmetric. These changes are critical for regional agriculture and water management, yet the roles of specific forcings behind them remain unclear. Based on hierarchical large-ensemble climate model simulations, ~32 ± 28% of the surface air temperature (SAT) asymmetric trend and 16 ± 13% of the snow cover asymmetric trend between Eurasia and North America are attributable to tropical Pacific variability. Single-forcing experiments reveal that anthropogenic aerosols can induce a comparable asymmetry, accounting for 34 ± 23% (24 ± 17%) of observed SAT (snow cover) asymmetric trends. However, their effects are largely masked by the greenhouse gas forcing. As anthropogenic aerosol emissions are expected to decline, the current warming asymmetry may reverse in the future.",

Under compression, Au 8 -C exhibits notable piezoluminescence enhancement. However, Au 8 -P presents monotonic piezoluminescence quenching. High-pressure structural characterizations confirm the existence of stacking-dependent anisotropic compression in Au 8 -C and Au 8 -P. Under high pressure, the columnar-stacked Au 8 -C shrinks faster along the a axis, increasing the aspect ratio (AR) of the fusiform Au 8 core. However, the layered Au 8 -P is compressed faster along the c axis, reducing the AR and leading to a flatter Au 8 core. High-pressure femtosecond transient absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence, and Raman spectra collaboratively confirm that differentiated anisotropic compression notably suppresses nonradiative loss caused by low-frequency vibrations of the Au 8 core, which is responsible for the piezoluminescence enhancement in Au 8 -C.",

TAC-C reveals a strong association between chromatin interaction frequency and gene expression, particularly emphasizing the conserved roles of chromatin interaction hub anchors and hub genes across crop species. Integrating chromatin structure with population genetics data highlights that chromatin loops connect distal regulatory elements to phenotypic variation.

Using benzoylecgonine (a nonvolatile cocaine metabolite) as a sewage tracer, we find that wastewater compounds—including a mixture of illicit drugs, drug metabolites, and chemicals from tires and personal care products—become aerosolized and are detectable in both water and air. Spatial analyses confirm that most measured chemicals concentrate in aerosols near the Tijuana River, potentially exposing local populations to tens of nanograms per hour (e.g., octinoxate and methamphetamine) via inhalation. This airborne pathway highlights a largely overlooked source of atmospheric pollution, emphasizing the need to reassess health risks in coastal regions as global water contamination continues to escalate.",

Here, we theoretically introduce a previously unidentified class of non-Hermitian soliton combs that are enabled by engineering the dissipation and dispersion of a coupled resonator array with nonreciprocal couplings. We show that these non-Hermitian soliton combs allow unprecedented postfabrication agile reconfigurability of the soliton comb spectrum, where the number of comb lines, as well as their frequency spacing, can be markedly tuned by simply tuning the hopping phases between resonators.

Here, we theoretically and experimentally discover a 3D photonic AF TI protected by the combined symmetry of time reversal and half-lattice translation.

These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles.

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism.",

Hence, extreme conditions, i.e., under compressive or tensile loads, can cause irreversible damages that disable the actuation. Here, we report a tough underwater robot that exhibits an accurate, three-dimensional, and multimodal motion. Counterintuitively, the soft robot is composed of polymers that are not photo-mechanically responsive but are powered by the ambient fluid. The unique feature notably widens the pool of material selection and allows further treatment to strengthen the polymer matrix without concerns of trade-off between the mechanical properties with the actuation capability. The tough, photo-inactive gel maneuvers precisely, traveling effortlessly in and out of the tunnels, and enables versatile phototactic locomotion.",

Growing evidence implicates a set of regions in the human parietal and frontal lobes [also known as the “physics network” (PN)] in such intuitive physical inferences. However, the central tenet of this hypothesis, that PN runs forward simulations to predict future states, remains untested. In this preregistered study, we first show that PN abstractly represents whether two objects are in contact with each other, a physical scene property critical for prediction (because objects’ fates are intertwined when they are in contact). We then show that PN (but not other visual areas) carries abstract information about predicted future contact events (i.e., collisions). These findings support the hypothesis that PN contains a generative model of the physical world that conducts forward simulations, serving as the brain’s “physics engine.”",

Clr4 is the sole known methyltransferase catalyzing H3K9 methylation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Clr4 K455/K472 automethylation and H3K14 ubiquitination (H3K14Ub) are vital activators of Clr4, ensuring appropriate heterochromatin deposition and preventing deleterious silencing. While automethylation’s activation mechanism is uncovered, the mechanism of H3K14Ub’s significantly stronger stimulation on Clr4 remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Clr4 bound to ubiquitinated and unmodified H3 peptides at 2.60 and 2.39 angstrom, which revealed a synergistic mechanism underlying the pronounced stimulatory effect: H3K14Ub increases substrate affinity through multivalent interactions and facilitates the allosteric transition of Clr4 from an inactive apo conformation to a hyperactive “catalyzing state,” including conformational changes in the αC-SET-insertion region, autoregulatory loop, and the β9/10 loop. We finally propose a multilevel structural model for the Clr4 catalytic-regulatory cycle.

In the quantum tunneling regime (realized by decreasing the gap size), by injection of carriers into a nanocavity-integrated tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) monolayer, spectrally tunable EL (controlled by the bias polarity) is achieved with a room-temperature quantum efficiency reaching ~3.5%, showing an improvement of more than 10 3 times over previous works.",

Our analysis revealed notable associations between heSTRs and brain- and neuron-specific distal regulatory signals. Potential target genes regulated by heSTRs, identified by incorporating distal regulations, are enriched with neuronal development–related functions and disorders, displaying neuron-specific expression enhancement in humans. Moreover, heSTRs are associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility specifically in human neurons. In addition, heSTRs show substantial association with pathogenic STR loci exhibiting abnormal copy number variations, as reported by cohort studies on schizophrenia and autism.

We report the experimental validation of a quantum fluctuation theorem (QFT) in a photonic system, applicable to general quantum processes with nonclassical characteristics, including quasi-probabilistic descriptions of entropy production and multiple time-reversal processes. Our experiment confirms that the ratio between the quasi-probabilities of the time-forward and any multiple time-reversal processes obeys a generalized Crooks QFT. Moreover, coherence induced by a quantum process leads to the imaginary components of quantum entropy production, governing the phase factor in the QFT.

Exopolysaccharide (EPS), a major virulence factor of R. solanacearum , elicits pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in tomato, but the means by which EPS is recognized in the plant remain poorly understood. We found that tomato non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) receptor kinase SlLYK4 mediates the perception of R. solanacearum EPS and positively regulates resistance to bacterial wilt. The RD receptor kinases SlLYK1 and SlLYK13 are required for EPS-triggered immune responses and form complexes with SlLYK4. These receptor kinase complexes have dual functions in recognizing bacterial EPS and fungal chitin. Phosphorylation of serine-320 in the juxtamembrane domain of SlLYK4 is essential in EPS- and chitin-mediated signaling, whereas phosphorylation of serine-334 or serine-634 in the C-terminal domain is required for chitin or EPS signaling, respectively. Our results reveal the mechanism underlying EPS recognition in tomato and provide insight into how differential phosphorylation of receptor kinase regulates antibacterial and antifungal immunity.",

Many Gram-negative bacteria that encode PQQ-dependent enzymes do not produce it and instead obtain it from the environment. To achieve this, Escherichia coli uses the TonB-dependent transporter PqqU as a high-affinity PQQ importer. Here, we show that PqqU binds PQQ with high affinity and determine the high-resolution structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex, revealing that PqqU undergoes conformational changes in PQQ binding to capture the cofactor in an internal cavity. We show that these conformational changes preclude the binding of a bacteriophage, which targets PqqU as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ structure, we identify amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla occupying diverse habitats, indicating that PQQ is an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.",

Using this method alongside a genetically encoded sensor–based image analysis program, we found that heterogeneous dopaminergic firing patterns create various transmission modes, encoding frequency, number, and synchrony of firing pulses using neurotransmitter quantity, releasing synapse count, and synaptic and/or volume transmission. Under both tonic and low-frequency phasic activities, transporters effectively reuptake dopamine at perisynaptic sites, confining dopamine within synaptic clefts to mediate synaptic transmission. In contrast, under high-frequency, particularly synchronized firing activity or transporter inhibition, released dopamine may overwhelm transporters, escaping from synaptic clefts via one to three outlet channels, triggering volume transmission. Our study illuminates a collaborative mechanism of synaptic enclosures, properties, and transporters that defines the coding principles of activity pattern–dependent dopaminergic transmission modes.",

We experimentally achieved 91% high accuracy for single-shot, concurrent sensing of intensity, polarization, and wavelength using a well-trained five-layer neuromorphic system. The fully on-chip system eliminates optical-electrical conversion and offline digital processing, enabling low-latency and high energy efficiency. Moreover, we achieved stabilization and recovery of high-speed signals at 100 gigabytes per second under randomly perturbed polarization and wavelengths. This work shows the potential for low-latency, energy-efficient optical sensing and complex information processing using neuromorphic integrated photonics.",

Using a community-based cohort of older adults, the current study characterized the neurocognitive (cognitive functioning, brain volumes, Alzheimer’s disease positron emission tomography, and plasma biomarkers) and plasma proteomic (7268 proteins) profiles of four common coronavirus and six herpesvirus antibody titers. Genetic inference techniques demonstrated the associations between viral antibody titers and neurocognitive outcomes may be attributed to altered expression in a subset of mechanistically relevant proteins in plasma. One of these proteins, IGDCC4 (immunoglobulin superfamily deleted in colorectal cancer subclass member 4), was related to 20-year dementia risk, cognitive functioning, and amyloid-β positivity using data from two independent cohorts, while its plasma and intrathecal abundance were causally implicated in dementia risk and clinically relevant brain atrophy. Our findings illuminate the biological basis by which host immune responses to viruses may affect neurocognitive outcomes in older adults and identify IGDCC4 as an important molecular mediator of neurodegeneration.",

          "abstract": "Na V 1.9 is a voltage-gated Na + channel subtype with unique gating properties that are poorly understood, partly due to the lack of reliable heterologous expression systems. Here, we present a transient expression protocol that produces robust mouse Na V 1.9 currents, enabling direct electrophysiological comparisons with native dorsal root ganglion neurons. To further understand the low current density observed in human Na V 1.9, we created chimeras with Na V 1.5 and identified a role for the C-tail—specifically the IQ motif and EF-hand—in regulating current densities, likely due to a weak affinity for calmodulin. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that, unlike other Na V channel subtypes, calmodulin binding to the C-tail is likely too weak to occur under physiological conditions. Markedly, the pre-IQ region did not influence channel expression but was responsible for conferring the characteristic depolarized voltage dependency of inactivation of Na V 1.9. Our findings provide insights into the unique gating mechanisms of Na V 1.9 and demonstrate the robustness of this platform for structure-function studies.",

We screened the Enamine high-throughput collection of 2.1 million compounds, selecting 39 compounds for testing, with the most potent binding with a 130 μM median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ). We then paired FrankenROCS with an active learning algorithm (Thompson sampling) to efficiently search the Enamine REAL database of 22 billion molecules, testing 32 compounds with the most potent binding with a 220 μM IC 50 . Further optimization led to analogs with IC 50 values better than 10 μM. This lead series has improved membrane permeability and is poised for optimization. FrankenROCS is a scalable method for fragment linking to exploit synthesis-on-demand libraries.",

Here, we present a compliant, multiplexed, electrochemical, real-time, localized, inflammation-tracking NO sensor (MERLIN) array for in vivo spatiotemporal measurement of NO, with high sensitivity (883 ± 283 nanoamperes per micromolar per square centimeter); selectivity against nitrites (~27,900-fold), ascorbic acid (~3800-fold), and uric acid (~6900-fold); and low limit of detection (~8.00 nM). MERLIN spatiotemporally tracked NO on rat skin wounds for 7 days, and results indicated that NO peaks on day 3, in line with previously reported iNOS activity.

While reaction kinetic shapes the concentration of components and reaction rates, its use in identification of modules entails knowledge of parameter values. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic modules can be efficiently identified on the basis of steady-state reaction rate couplings in large-scale biochemical networks endowed with mass action kinetics without knowledge of parameter values. We then link the kinetic modules of metabolic networks with robustness of metabolite concentrations to perturbations. Analyzing 34 metabolic network models of 26 organisms, we demonstrate that the ordered binding enzyme mechanism leads to increased concentration robustness compared to random binding.

Acetylcholine release is controlled by distinct BFCN subtypes, modulated by excitatory and inhibitory inputs. However, the organization of the whole-brain input-output networks of these subtypes remains unclear. Here, we identified two distinct BFCN subtypes—BFCN →ACA and BFCN →BLA —innervating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) and BLA, each with unique distributions, electrophysiological properties, and projection patterns. Combining rabies-virus–assisted mapping and triple-plex RNAscope hybridization, we characterized their whole-brain input networks, identifying unique excitatory and shared inhibitory inputs for these subtypes. Moreover, our results reveal a long-range reciprocal input-output loop: BFCN →ACA neurons target the isocortex, their shared excitatory-input source, whereas BFCN →BLA neurons target shared inhibitory-input sources such as the striatum and pallidum, thus enabling dynamic interactions among these BFCN subtypes.

However, the stereoselective conversion of planar indole rings into three-dimensional indoline skeletons bearing multiple stereogenic centers remains a persistent challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe an intermolecular catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of simple indoles via a palladium-catalyzed three-component cross-coupling reaction. By using readily accessible diazonium salts and aromatic boronic acids as arylative reagents under a ligand-swap strategy, this method enables the efficient construction of 2,3-diarylated indolines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral BiOx ligand governs the highly stereoselective migratory insertion of the aryl-palladium intermediate into the indole’s C═C double bond with complete diastereo- and regioselectivity, whereas the achiral fumarate ligand facilitates the reductive elimination step, as corroborated by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, this protocol is extended to the dearomative diarylation of benzofurans, affording chiral 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with high stereocontrol.",

Here, we elucidate how a progenitor cell genome senses and responds to inflammation when the developmental and transcriptional regulator GATA2 is limiting, which causes bone marrow failure in humans and mice and predisposes to leukemia in humans. GATA2 low murine progenitors are hypersensitive to inflammatory mediators. We discovered that the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 conferred transcriptional activation in GATA2 low progenitors in response to Interferon-γ and Toll-Like Receptor 1/2 agonists. In a locus-specific manner, inflammation reconfigured genome activity by promoting PU.1 recruitment to chromatin or tuning activity of PU.1-preoccupied chromatin. The recruitment mechanism disproportionately required IKKβ activity. Inflammation-activated genes were enriched in motifs for RUNX factors that cooperate with GATA factors. Contrasting with the GATA2-RUNX1 cooperativity paradigm, GATA2 suppressed and RUNX1 promoted PU.1 mechanisms to endow the progenitor genome with inflammation-sensing capacity.",

Recent data challenge the notion of random PN-to-KC connectivity, revealing preferential connections between food-related PNs and specific KCs. Our study further uncovers a broader picture—an L-shaped hybrid network, supported by spatial patterning: Food-related PNs diverge across KC classes, whereas pheromone-sensitive PNs converge on γ KCs. α/β KCs specialize in food odors, whereas γ KCs integrate diverse inputs. Such spatial arrangement extends further to the antennal lobe (AL) and lateral horn (LH), shaping a systematic olfactory landscape. Moreover, our functional validations align with computational predictions of KC odor encoding based on the hybrid connectivity, correlating PN-KC activity with behavioral preferences. In addition, our simulations showcase the network’s augmented sensitivity and precise discrimination abilities, underscoring the computational benefits of this hybrid architecture in olfactory processing.",

During subsequent rest or sleep, the activity patterns of these neurons often correlate with those observed during the preceding experience. Growing evidence suggests that these reactivations play a crucial role in memory consolidation, the process by which experiences are solidified in cortical networks for long-term storage. Here, we use longitudinal two-photon Ca 2+ imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, to show that targeted manipulation of PV + inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuates cue-specific reactivations and learning, with only minute effects on spontaneous activity and no apparent effect on normal function such as visual cue–elicited responses during training. In control mice, reactivations were biased toward salient cues, persisted for hours after training had ended, and the prevalence of reactivations was aligned with the learning process. Overall, our results underscore a crucial role for cortical reactivations in memory consolidation.",
