          "abstract": "Behaviours are adaptive traits evolving through natural selection. Crucially, the genetic, molecular and neural modifications that shape behavioural innovations are poorly understood 1 . Here, we identify specialized adaptations linked to the evolution of invertebrate aggression 2 . Using the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus , we developed a machine learning model from behavioural tracking data and identified robust behavioural states associated with aggressive episodes. Strikingly, predatory aggression coincides with a rewiring of key circuits across nematode evolution. We find modifications to the noradrenergic pathway, with octopamine promoting aggressive predatory bouts whereas tyramine antagonistically induces passive states. Modulation occurs through the octopamine receptors Ppa-ser-3 and Ppa-ser-6 , and tyramine receptor Ppa-lgc-55 . These localize to sensory neurons whose inhibition diminishes aggressive events. Crucially, this octopaminergic innovation emerged within this predatory lineage, consistent with an ancient divergence in function. Thus, evolutionary adaptations in noradrenergic circuits facilitated the emergence of aggressive behavioural states associated with complex predatory traits.",

          "abstract": "The mammalian cerebral cortex comprises a complex neuronal network that maintains a precise balance between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific interneuron subtypes form stereotyped microcircuits with distinct pyramidal neuron classes1,2,3. Here we show that pyramidal neurons have an active role in this process by promoting the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. In the wild-type cortex, interneuron subtype abundance mirrors the prevalence of their pyramidal neuron partners. In Fezf2 mutants, which lack L5b pyramidal neurons and are expanded in L6 intratelencephalic neurons, corresponding subtype-specific shifts occur through two distinct mechanisms: somatostatin interneurons adjust their programmed cell death, whereas parvalbumin interneurons switch their subtype identity. Silencing neuronal activity or blocking vesicular release in L5b pyramidal neurons revealed that their communication with interneurons does not require voltage-gated synaptic activity but engages both tetanus toxin-sensitive and tetanus toxin-insensitive pathways. Moreover, a targeted bioinformatic screen for ligand–receptor pairs displaying subtype-specific expression and reduced expression of pyramidal neuron-derived ligand in Fezf2 mutants identified candidate secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These findings reveal distinct, pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms for sculpting interneuron diversity and integrating them into local cortical circuits.",

          "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses occur in all human populations, with the highest rates of diagnosis among Black individuals and those of mainly African ancestry1. Decades of research have established a highly heritable and polygenic basis for schizophrenia, which is mostly shared across populations2,3,4. However, a recruitment bias towards European cohorts5 has led to discoveries that are poorly generalizable to African populations. This exclusion of the world’s most genetically diverse populations narrows our understanding of disease biology and risks exacerbating health disparities. Here we show that electronic health records linked with genomic data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP)6—a national research programme that looks at the effects of genes, lifestyle, military experiences and exposures on the health and wellness of veterans—enable a comprehensive assessment of schizophrenia genetics in populations of African ancestry in the USA. We identify ancestry-independent associations in African populations and expand the catalogue of implicated regions by more than 100 loci. Through statistical fine-mapping and integrative transcriptomic analyses, we refine disease-associated signals to consensus genes with convergent neurobiological functions. These findings provide a much-needed view of schizophrenia’s genetic architecture in populations of African ancestry, and offer biological insights that both extend previous work and broaden its global relevance.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases affect 1 in 12 people globally and remain incurable. Central to their pathogenesis is a loss of neuronal protein maintenance and the accumulation of protein aggregates with ageing1,2. Here we engineered bioorthogonal tools3 that enabled us to tag the nascent neuronal proteome and study its turnover with ageing, its propensity to aggregate and its interaction with microglia. We show that neuronal protein half-life approximately doubles on average between 4-month-old and 24-month-old mice, with the stability of individual proteins differing among brain regions. Furthermore, we describe the aged neuronal ‘aggregome’, which encompasses 1,726 proteins, nearly half of which show reduced degradation with age. The aggregome includes well-known proteins linked to diseases and numerous proteins previously not associated with neurodegeneration. Notably, we demonstrate that neuronal proteins accumulate in aged microglia, with 54% also displaying reduced degradation and/or aggregation with age. Among these proteins, synaptic proteins are highly enriched, which suggests that there is a cascade of events that emerge from impaired synaptic protein turnover and aggregation to the disposal of these proteins, possibly through microglial engulfment of synapses. These findings reveal the substantial loss of neuronal proteome maintenance with ageing, which could be causal for age-related synapse loss and cognitive decline.",

          "abstract": "The Afar depression in northeastern Ethiopia contains a rich palaeontological and archaeological record, which documents 6 million years of human evolution. Abundant faunal evidence links evolutionary patterns with palaeoenvironmental change as a principal underlying force1. Many of the earlier hominin taxa recognized today are found in the Afar, but Paranthropus has been conspicuously absent from the region. Here we report on the discovery, in the Mille-Logya research area, of a partial mandible that we attribute to Paranthropus, dated to between 2.5 and 2.9 million years ago and found in a well-understood chronological and faunal context. The find is among the oldest fossils attributable to Paranthropus and indicates that this genus, from its earliest known appearance, had a greater geographic distribution than previously documented2. Often seen as a dietary specialist feeding on tough food, the range of diverse habitats with which eastern African Paranthropus can now be associated shows that this suggested adaptive niche did not restrict its ability to disperse as widely as species of Australopithecus and early Homo. The discovery of Paranthropus in the Afar emphasizes how little is known about hominin evolution in eastern Africa during the crucial period between 3 and 2.5 million years ago, when this genus and the Homo lineage presumably emerged.",

          "abstract": "Crystalline silicates form at high temperatures (>900 K) (refs. 1,2). Their presence in comets3,4,5,6 suggests that high-temperature dust processing occurred in the early Solar System and was subsequently transported outwards to comet-forming regions. However, direct evidence for this crystallization and redistribution in Sun-like protostars has remained unknown. By comparing James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra of the periodically bursting protostar EC 53 (ref. 7), we detect crystalline silicate (forsterite and enstatite) emission features that appear only during the burst. The emergence of these features indicates active crystal formation by thermal annealing in the hot inner disk during the accretion burst. We also detect a nested outflow—a collimated atomic jet enclosed by slower molecular outflows, consistent with magnetohydrodynamic wind models8. This configuration provides a mechanism for the outward transport of freshly crystallized silicates9. To our knowledge, our results provide the first direct observational evidence of in situ silicate crystallization during episodic accretion bursts in a very young star still embedded in its dense envelope. Although we do not directly detect grains transported to the outer disk, the observed trends are consistent with outward redistribution, indicating that both dust processing and transport occur during the earliest and most dynamic stages of star formation.",

          "abstract": "Fibre electronic devices are transforming traditional fibres and garments into new-generation wearables that can actively interact with human bodies and the environment to shape future life1,2,3,4,5. Fibre electronic devices have achieved almost all of the desired functions, such as powering6,7, sensing8,9 and display10,11 functions. However, viable information-processing fibres, which lie at the heart of building intelligent interactive fibre systems similar to any electronic product, remain the missing piece of the puzzle12,13,14,15. Here we fill this gap by creating a fibre integrated circuit (FIC) with unprecedented microdevice density and multimodal processing capacity. The integration density reaches 100,000 transistors per centimetre, which effectively satisfies the requirements for interactive fibre systems. The FICs can not only process digital and analogue signals similar to typical commercial arithmetic chips but also achieve high-recognition-accuracy neural computing similar to that of the state-of-the-art in-memory image processors. The FICs are stable under harsh service conditions that bulky and planar counterparts have difficulty withstanding, such as repeated bending and abrasion for 10,000 cycles, stretching to 30%, twisting at an angle of 180° cm−1 and even crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons. The realization of FICs enables closed-loop systems in a single fibre, without the need for any external rigid and bulky information processors. We demonstrate that this fully flexible fibre system paves the way for the interaction pattern desired in many cutting-edge applications, for example, brain–computer interfaces, smart textiles and virtual-reality wearables. This work presents new insights that can promote the development of fibre devices towards intelligent systems.",

          "abstract": "Sensing technologies that exploit quantum phenomena for measurement are finding increasing applications across materials, physical and biological sciences 1–7 . Until recently, biological candidates for quantum sensors were limited to in vitro systems, had poor sensitivity and were prone to light-induced degradation. These limitations impeded practical biotechnological applications, and high-throughput study that would facilitate their engineering and optimization. We recently developed a class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins including MagLOV, which overcomes many of these challenges 8 . Here we show that through directed evolution, it is possible to engineer these proteins to alter the properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. We find that MagLOV exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise for single-cell detection. These effects are explained through the radical-pair mechanism, which involves the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using optically detected magnetic resonance and fluorescence magnetic-field effects, we explore a range of applications, including spatial localization of fluorescence signals using gradient fields (that is, magnetic resonance imaging using a genetically encoded probe), sensing of the molecular microenvironment, multiplexing of bio-imaging and lock-in detection, mitigating typical biological imaging challenges such as light scattering and autofluorescence. Taken together, our results represent a suite of sensing modalities for engineered biological systems, based on and designed around understanding the quantum-mechanical properties of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins.",

          "abstract": "Plasticity—the ability of cells to undergo phenotypic transitions—drives cancer progression and therapy resistance1,2,3. Recent studies have suggested that plasticity in solid tumours is concentrated in a minority subset of cancer cells4,5,6, yet functional studies examining this high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) in situ are lacking. Here we develop mouse models enabling the detection, longitudinal lineage tracing and ablation of the HPCS in autochthonous lung tumours in vivo. Lineage tracing reveals that the HPCS cells possess a high capacity for cell state transitions, giving rise to both early neoplastic (differentiated) and progressed lung cancer cell states in situ. Longitudinal lineage tracing using secreted luciferases reveals that HPCS-derived cells have a high capacity for growth compared with bulk cancer cells or another cancer cell state with features of differentiated lung epithelium. Ablation of HPCS cells in early neoplasias abrogates benign-to-malignant transition, whereas ablation in established tumours by suicide gene or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells robustly reduces tumour burden. We further demonstrate that the HPCS gives rise to therapy-resistant cell states, whereas HPCS ablation suppresses resistance to chemotherapy and oncoprotein-targeted therapy. Notably, an HPCS-like state is ubiquitous in regenerating epithelia and in carcinomas of multiple other tissues, revealing a convergence of plasticity programs. Our work establishes the HPCS as a critical hub enabling reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states. Targeting the HPCS in lung cancer and in other carcinomas may suppress cancer progression and eradicate treatment resistance.",

During tissue damage, however, bone-marrow-derived monocytes enter tissues and differentiate into RTMs, repairing the tissue and replenishing macrophages in the niche 1 . The universal cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control the monocyte-to-RTM transition and the maintenance of mature RTMs across tissues remain elusive 3 . Here we show that deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), an enzyme that mediates spermidine-dependent hypusine modification of translation factor eIF5A 5,7 , is required for RTM differentiation and maintenance. Mice with myeloid cell lack of DHPS ( Dhps -ΔM mice) had a global defect in RTMs across tissues, resulting in persistent but ultimately futile monocyte influx. Transcriptional analyses of DHPS-deficient macrophages indicated a block in their ability to differentiate into mature RTMs, whereas proteomics revealed defects in cell adhesion and signalling pathways. Sequencing of ribosome-engaged transcripts identified a subset of mRNAs involved in cell adhesion and signalling that rely on DHPS for efficient translation. Imaging of DHPS-deficient macrophages in tissues showed differences in morphology and tissue interactions, which were correlated with their failed RTM differentiation. DHPS-deficient macrophages were also defective in critical homeostatic RTM functions including efferocytosis and tissue maintenance. Together, our results demonstrate a cell-intrinsic, tissue-agnostic pathway that drives differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages into RTMs.",

A few structurally distinct protein families have been described that account for most of the known membrane transport processes4,5,6. However, many membrane proteins with predicted transporter functions remain uncharacterized. Here we determined the structure of Escherichia coli LetAB, a phospholipid transporter involved in outer membrane integrity, and found that LetA adopts a distinct architecture that is structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to known transporter families. LetA localizes to the inner membrane, where it is poised to load lipids into its binding partner, LetB, a mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein that forms an approximately 225 Å long tunnel for lipid transport across the cell envelope. Unexpectedly, the LetA transmembrane domains adopt a fold that is evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic tetraspanin family of membrane proteins, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and claudins. Through a combination of deep mutational scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, AlphaFold-predicted alternative states and functional studies, we present a model for how the LetA-like family of membrane transporters facilitates the transport of lipids across the bacterial cell envelope.",

Here we show that the temperature of the glacial deep (&gt;1.5 km) Northwest Atlantic was approximately 0–2 °C (only 1.8 ± 0.5 °C (2 s.e.) colder than today), and, after accounting for the whole-ocean change, seawater δ 18 O was 0.3 ± 0.1‰ (2 s.e.) higher and can be traced back to the surface subtropics via the subpolar Northeast Atlantic and Nordic Seas. Together, our hydrographic data reveal the thermal and isotopic structure of the deep Northwest Atlantic and suggest sustained production of relatively warm and probably salty North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, our results provide updated constraints for benchmarking Earth system models used to project future climate change.",

Hundreds of thousands of new chemical reactions are reported annually, yet translating them into actionable experiments becomes an obstacle1,2. Recent applications of large language models (LLMs) have shown promise3,4,5,6, but systems that reliably work for diverse transformations across de novo compounds have remained elusive. Here we introduce MOSAIC (Multiple Optimized Specialists for AI-assisted Chemical Prediction), a computational framework that enables chemists to harness the collective knowledge of millions of reaction protocols. MOSAIC is built upon the Llama-3.1-8B-instruct architecture7, training 2,498 specialized chemical experts within Voronoi-clustered spaces. This approach delivers reproducible and executable experimental protocols with confidence metrics for complex syntheses. With an overall 71% success rate, experimental validation demonstrates the realizations of over 35 novel compounds, spanning pharmaceuticals, materials, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. Notably, MOSAIC also enables the discovery of new reaction methodologies that are absent from the expert’s training, a cornerstone for advancing chemical synthesis. This scalable paradigm of partitioning vast domains into searchable expert regions enables a generalizable strategy for AI-assisted discovery wherever accelerating information growth outpaces efficient knowledge access and application.",

          "abstract": "The leading cause of human pregnancy loss is aneuploidy, often tracing to errors in chromosome segregation during female meiosis 1,2 . Although abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy 3,4 , limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of pre-implantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,809,412 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is associated significantly with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis -regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, variants associated with aneuploidy often showed secondary associations with recombination, and several also exhibited associations with reproductive ageing traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.",

However, methods to follow cell populations over time within the native context of a human tissue are lacking because a biopsy offers only a single snapshot. Here we present one-shot tissue dynamics reconstruction (OSDR), an approach to estimate a dynamical model of cell populations based on a single tissue sample. OSDR uses spatial proteomics to learn how the composition of cellular neighbourhoods influences division rate, providing a dynamical model of cell population change over time. We apply OSDR to human breast cancer data2,3,4, and reconstruct two fixed points of fibroblasts and macrophage interactions5,6. These fixed points correspond to hot and cold fibrosis7, in agreement with co-culture experiments that measured these dynamics directly8. We then use OSDR to discover a pulse-generating excitable circuit of T and B cells in the tumour microenvironment, suggesting temporal flares of anticancer immune responses. Finally, we study longitudinal biopsies from a triple-negative breast cancer clinical trial3, in which OSDR predicts the collapse of the tumour cell population in responders but not in non-responders, based on early-treatment biopsies. OSDR can be applied to a wide range of spatial proteomics assays to enable analysis of tissue dynamics based on patient biopsies.",

Here we report a metagenomic survey to model microbiome transmission in the nursery setting among babies attending the first year, their educators and their families (n = 134 individuals). We performed dense longitudinal microbiome sampling (n = 1,013 faecal samples) during the first year of nursery and tracked microbial strain transmission within and between nursery groups across 3 different facilities. We detected extensive baby-to-baby microbiome transmission within nursery groups even after only 1 month of nursery attendance, with nursery-acquired strains accounting for a proportion of the infant gut microbiome comparable to that from family by the end of the first term. Baby-to-baby transmission continued to grow over the nursery year, in an increasingly intricate transmission network with single strains spreading in some classes, and with multiple baby-acquisition and species-transmissibility patterns. Having siblings was associated with higher microbiome diversity and reduced strain acquisition from nursery peers, while antibiotic treatment was the condition that most accounted for the increased influx of strains. This study shows that microbiome transmission between babies is extensive during the first year of nursery, and points to social interactions in infancy as crucial drivers of infant microbiome development.",

Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases, which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. Here we review the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We describe the spontaneously broken and retained symmetries that delineate altermagnetism as a distinct phase of matter with d-, g- or i-wave compensated collinear spin ordering. In materials ranging from weakly interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators, the microscopic crystal-structure realizations of the altermagnetic symmetries feature a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities. These symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin–orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout, we compare altermagnetism with traditional ferromagnetism and Néel antiferromagnetism, and with magnetic phases with symmetry-protected compensated non-collinear spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions with references to relevant experiments.",

          "abstract": "At every scale they occupy, magnetic fields affect various phenomena, including star formation, cosmic-ray transport, charged-particle acceleration, space weather, transport in planetary atmospheres and laboratory plasmas. These fields are often generated and sustained by turbulent flows in a process called the dynamo. In 1955, E. N. Parker parameterized the effects of small-scale turbulence to propose a mean-field dynamo theory1. The widely used theory reproduces observed large-scale fields but suffers from difficulty in tuning parameters as they are not justified from first principles: studies of turbulent flows show tangled magnetic fields, which are folded and fragmented into small-scale structures owing to shear-flow straining2,3. Here, considering a shear flow that is unstable and driven, we develop analytic theory and perform three-dimensional, advanced computer simulations of turbulence with up to 4,096 × 4,096 × 8,192 grid points, showing ab initio generation of quasi-periodic, large-scale magnetic fields. The generation occurs via the mean-vorticity effect—an additional mean-field dynamo process postulated4 in 1990. Crucial to this dynamo is the prior generation of large-scale three-dimensional jets, robustly produced as topologically protected and exact nonlinear solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The jet-driven dynamo applies to shear-driven laboratory and astrophysical systems. These include binary neutron star mergers5,6, where the reported dynamo probably operates on microsecond timescales to produce in milliseconds some of the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe7, providing signals for multi-messenger astronomy8.",

Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells shape cortical cell diversity by giving rise to excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as well as olfactory bulb interneurons (INs) and a recently characterized population of cortical INs 1,2 . Complex genetic programs orchestrated by transcription factor (TF) circuits govern the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and between different cell fates 3–8 . Despite progress in measuring gene regulatory network activity during human cortical development 9–12 , functional studies are required to evaluate the roles of TFs and effector genes in human RG lineage progression. Here we establish a human primary culture system that allows sensitive discrimination of cell fate dynamics and apply single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening 13,14 to examine the transcriptional and cell fate consequences of 44 TFs active during cortical neurogenesis. We identified several TFs with new roles in cortical neurogenesis, including ZNF219 —previously uncharacterized—that represses neural differentiation and NR2E1 and ARX that have opposing roles in regulating RG lineage plasticity and progression across developmental stages. We also detected convergent effector genes downstream of multiple TFs enriched in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and observed conserved mechanisms of RG lineage plasticity across primates. We further uncovered a post-mitotic role for ARX in safeguarding IN subtype specification through repressing LMO1 . Our study provides a framework for dissecting regulatory networks driving cell fate consequences during human neurogenesis.",

Fundamental questions remain regarding their structure and origin. Although super-Earths have a rocky composition 3 , sub-Neptunes form a distinct population at larger radii and are thought to consist of a rocky core overlain by a hydrogen-rich envelope 4,5 . At the extreme conditions of the core–envelope interface (exceeding several gigapascals and several thousand kelvin 4,6 ), reaction between core and envelope seems possible, but the nature and extent of these reactions are unknown. Here we use first-principles molecular dynamics driven by density functional theory to show that silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible core–envelope pressure–temperature conditions. We find the origin of miscibility in extensive chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicate, producing silane, SiO and water species, which may be observable with ongoing or future missions. Core–envelope miscibility profoundly affects the evolution of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, by dissolving a large fraction of the hydrogen of the planet in the core and driving exchange of hydrogen between core and envelope as the planet evolves.",

Previous studies have partly characterized how FRCs support these interactions 7,8 . However, the molecular mechanisms that operate under physiological conditions remain unknown. Here we show that the viral protein m11, encoded by the herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), inhibits antiviral immunity by targeting the FRC network and interfering with a critical function of cellular CD44. We found that m11 binds to CD44 and established that m11 perturbs the molecular interactions of CD44 with its natural ligand, hyaluronic acid. The interaction of m11 with CD44 impairs the trafficking of dendritic cells within the spleen, thereby impeding efficient priming of naive T cells and the initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The targeting of CD44 by CMV reveals CD44 as a molecule that is essential to the functioning of the FRC network and uncovers a previously unrecognized stroma-based mechanism that is critical for the generation of effective T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "Earth’s early mantle probably existed as a deep, vigorously convecting magma ocean, and its solidification is considered central to the long-term chemical and dynamical evolution of the planet. Yet a notable uncertainty is the grain size of bridgmanite—the dominant lower-mantle phase—whose nucleation behaviour at extreme pressure has remained experimentally inaccessible. Here we show, using a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including large-scale molecular dynamics simulations consisting of up to 1 million atoms driven by machine learning potentials (MLPs), seeding and enhanced sampling, that crystal–melt interfacial energies of MgSiO3 bridgmanite increase substantially with pressure, surpassing those of silicate–liquid systems at ambient pressure by a factor of up to ten (refs. 1,2,3). In a deep basal magma ocean (BMO), this amplified interfacial energy, combined with the potential sluggish cooling, may permit the formation of unusually large bridgmanite crystals, up to centimetre-to-metre-scale sizes. Such potentially large crystals could drive efficient fractional crystallization and cause substantial chemical differentiation and mantle compaction. If operative, this mechanism would provide a new physical pathway linking lower-mantle material properties to early Earth stratification and it motivates future geodynamic models that explicitly incorporate supercooling, compositional convection and elemental partitioning. Our findings thus offer a plausible hypothesis connecting microscopic nucleation processes with macroscopic planetary structure, refining present views of how the Earth’s interior acquired its initial compositional architecture.",

Measured median concentrations over the ocean are 27 times lower than over the land (0.003 and 0.08 particles m −3 , respectively).

However, the ability to produce long complex synthetic DNA sequences and libraries currently lags behind the ability to sequence and edit DNA 1,2 . All existing DNA-assembly technologies rely on DNA sequence information found within the final construct to direct assembly between DNA molecules 3–11 . As a result of this paradigm, these sequences cannot be extensively optimized specifically for assembly without affecting the final sequence. To fundamentally address this challenge, here we show the development of a new DNA assembly technique named Sidewinder that separates the information that guides assembly from the final assembled sequence using DNA three-way junctions. We demonstrate the transformative nature of the Sidewinder technique with highly robust and accurate construction of a 40-piece multifragment assembly, complex DNA sequences of both high GC content and high repeats, parallel assembly of multiple distinct genes in the same reaction and a combinatorial library with a large number of diversified positions across the entire length of the gene for high coverage of a library of 442,368 variants. This technology enables high-fidelity DNA assembly with a misconnection rate at the three-way junction of approximately 1 in 1,000,000.",

          "abstract": "The vertebrate central nervous system is protected by the blood–brain barrier and meningeal membranes, which ensure immune privilege1. In the mammalian brain, microglia and barrier-associated or border-associated macrophages (BAMs) provide immune surveillance and scavenge wastes2, yet how evolution shaped immune-cell diversity and function is not understood. In zebrafish, a vascular-derived mural lymphatic endothelial cell (muLEC) lineage fulfils scavenger cell functions at central nervous system borders3,4,5. Here we identify the transcription factor odd-skipped related 2 (osr2) as a specific marker and regulator of muLEC differentiation and maintenance. osr2 controls the transition of muLECs from interconnected endothelial cells to individual scavenger cells in part by means of control of cadherin-6. muLECs are more transcriptionally similar to BAMs than to other mammalian meningeal cells and share several functions in tissue homeostasis. However, BAMs are absent from zebrafish and muLECs from mice and humans. Analysis of osr2, lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) and BAM markers in diverse vertebrate species reveals muLECs as an ancient lineage and BAMs a recent mammalian specialization. muLECs and BAMs share functional analogies but are not homologous, providing an example of convergent evolution. This highlights the physiological importance of meningeal scavenger cells and the developmental plasticity of LECs in generating specialized cell types throughout evolution.",

          "abstract": "Neural tissues are exceptionally sensitive to oxygen deprivation and rely on a dense network of blood vessels to support their extraordinarily high metabolic demands for oxygen, nutrients and clearance of waste products1,2,3,4. In birds, one of the metabolically most demanding neural tissue—the retina—lacks internal blood vessels5,6. This raises the question of how such a metabolically demanding neural tissue can function without blood perfusion. Here we show that, while the photoreceptor outer segments in the outer retina have access to oxygen, the inner bird retina operates under chronic anoxia, supported by anaerobic glycolysis in the retinal neurons. We provide evidence that the pecten oculi—a uniquely vascularized structure in the vitreous humour of birds, the function of which has been debated for centuries5,6,7,8,9—supplies the anoxic inner retina with glucose and removes lactic acid. We suggest that the pecten’s metabolic support of the bird retina’s anoxia tolerance enabled first the evolution of a thick cell-dense, avascular retina, which secondarily served as an exaptation enabling retinal function during high-altitude migrations.",

          "abstract": "Vertebrate vision is mainly accommodated by a pair of lateral image-forming camera-type eyes and is supplemented in non-mammalian vertebrates by a dorsal pineal complex (pineal and parapineal organs) functioning as photoreceptive and/or endocrine organs1. The pineal complex shares a common genetic and embryological basis with the lateral eyes, both derived from evaginations during the development of diencephalon2. Despite being widely heralded as the ‘third eye’ in crown vertebrates3, the nature of the pineal complex and its presumed visual capability in early vertebrates2 remain unknown. Here we describe two pigmented features situated between the lateral eyes in two species of myllokunmingids, the earliest known fossil vertebrates (approximately 518 million years ago), and interpret these as pineal/parapineal organs. In both myllokunmingid species, the pineal complex contains abundant melanin-containing melanosomes identical to those in the retinal pigment epithelium in the lateral eyes, together with a distinctive, regularly ovoid structure interpreted as a lens. Our results indicate that the lateral eyes and pineal complex in myllokunmingids probably functioned as camera-type eyes capable of image formation. Thus, we propose that the four camera-type eyes represent an ancestral vertebrate character, corroborating hypotheses about the deep homology between the eyes and pineal complex.",

          "abstract": "The quantum superposition principle is a fundamental concept of physics 1 and the basis of numerous quantum technologies 2,3 . Yet, it is still often regarded counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic scales of our daily lives. It is, therefore, interesting to ask how quantum properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects 4 . A model test for this question can be realized by matter-wave interferometry, in which the motion of individual massive particles becomes delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far larger than the particle itself 5 . Over the years, this has been explored with a series of objects of increasing mass and complexity 6–9 and a growing community aims at pushing this to ever larger limits. Here we present an experimental platform that extends matter-wave interference to large metal clusters, a qualitatively new material class for quantum experiments. We specifically demonstrate quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da. They propagate in a Schrödinger cat state with a macroscopicity 10 of μ = 15.5, surpassing previous experiments 5,9,11 by an order of magnitude.",

Despite the intense investigation of orthosteric thalidomide derivatives, little is known about alternate binding sites on CRBN. Here we report an evolutionarily conserved cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN. Small-molecule SB-405483 binds the allosteric site to cooperatively enhance the binding of orthosteric ligands and alter their neosubstrate degradation profiles. A survey of over 100 orthosteric ligands and their degradation targets reveals trends in the classes of compounds and neosubstrates in which degradation outcomes are enhanced or inhibited by SB-405483. Structural investigations provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of the allosteric ligand by shifting the conformational distribution of CRBNopen to a novel CRBNint and increasing the CRBNclosed state. The discovery of a cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN that alters the functional effects of orthosteric ligands opens new directions with broad implications for improving the selectivity and efficacy of CRBN therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "The Indonesian archipelago is host to some of the earliest known rock art in the world1,2,3,4,5. Previously, secure Pleistocene dates were reported for figurative cave art and stencils of human hands in two areas in Indonesia—the Maros-Pangkep karsts in the southwestern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi1,3,4,5 and the Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat region of eastern Kalimantan, Borneo2. Here we describe a series of early dated rock art motifs from the southeastern portion of Sulawesi. Among this assemblage of Pleistocene (and possibly more recent) motifs, laser-ablation U-series (LA-U-series) dating of calcite overlying a hand stencil from Liang Metanduno on Muna Island yielded a U-series date of 71.6 ± 3.8 thousand years ago (ka), providing a minimum-age constraint of 67.8 ka for the underlying motif. The Muna minimum (67.8 ± 3.8 ka) exceeds the published minimum for rock art in Maros-Pangkep by 16.6 thousand years (kyr) (ref. 5) and is 1.1 kyr greater than the published minimum for a hand stencil from Spain attributed to Neanderthals6, which until now represented the oldest demonstrated minimum-age constraint for cave art worldwide. Moreover, the presence of this extremely old art in Sulawesi suggests that the initial peopling of Sahul about 65 ka7 involved maritime journeys between Borneo and Papua, a region that remains poorly explored from an archaeological perspective.",

Here we adopt a new perspective on information gathering and demonstrate an information integration bias whereby there is over-weighting of most recent information via evidence strength updates (ΔES). In a crowd-sourced sample ( N = 5,237), we find that a reduced ΔES weighting drives indecisiveness along an obsessive–compulsive spectrum. We replicate this attenuated ΔES weighting in a second lab-based study ( N = 105) that includes a transdiagnostic obsessive–compulsive spectrum encompassing OCD and generalized anxiety patients. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we trace ΔES signals to a late neural signal peaking at ~920 ms. Critically, highly obsessive–compulsive participants, across diagnoses, show an attenuated neural ΔES signal in mediofrontal areas, while other decision-relevant processes remain intact. Our findings establish biased information weighting as a driver of information gathering, where attenuated ΔES is linked to indecisiveness across an obsessive–compulsive spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that peripheral diseases serve as risk factors for dementia, but the population-level burden of dementia associated with various peripheral diseases has remained unknown. Here, by conducting a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analyses to estimate the relative risks of 26 peripheral diseases across 9 systems with dementia, including 202 articles searched from the PubMed until 6 September 2024, we identified 16 peripheral diseases as associated with increased risk of dementia. With the relative risks estimated from meta-analyses, prevalences extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and communalities among these 16 peripheral diseases derived from the UK Biobank, we analysed the population attributable fractions (PAFs) of these 16 peripheral diseases for dementia, stratified by sex, age, sociodemographic index level, world region and country, and trends from 1990 to 2021. Globally, these peripheral diseases collectively were related to a combined PAF of 33.18% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.80–48.43) of dementia burden, corresponding to 18.8 million prevalent cases. The leading ten PAF contributors were periodontal diseases (6.10%, 95% CI 0.95–10.28), cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases (5.51%, 95% CI 1.77–8.86), age-related and other hearing loss (4.70%, 95% CI 3.51–6.06), blindness and vision loss (4.30%, 95% CI 3.43–5.05), type 2 diabetes mellitus (3.80%, 95% CI 3.06–4.53), chronic kidney disease (2.74%, 95% CI 1.53–4.02), osteoarthritis (2.26%, 95% CI 0.41–4.12), stroke (1.01%, 95% CI 0.86–1.17), ischaemic heart disease (0.97%, 95% CI 0.69–1.29) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.92%, 95% CI 0.34–1.54). This study revealed that a series of peripheral diseases were associated with increased risk of dementia and collectively were related to about one-third of the global dementia burden, highlighting the need for targeted public health strategies.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing assumption in the language sciences is that the mental representation of language is based on constituents—that is, hierarchical structures rooted in grammar. We provide evidence from English for a more basic kind of linguistic representation involving smaller, linear chunks of structure akin to sequences of parts-of-speech elements—such as verb preposition determiner shared between the strings added to a and defined by the. Across four preregistered phrasal decision experiments (total N = 497), we show that it is possible to prime such linear structures, even in the absence of constituents. In two additional corpus analyses of eye-tracked reading (N = 68) and conversation (N = 358), we establish the external validity of the effect. These results provide evidence of multiword language structures that are not explainable in terms of constituents as traditionally construed. This poses a challenge for accounts of linguistic representation, including generative and constructionist approaches.",

          "abstract": "To reduce current and future coastal flood risk, it is critical to better understand how adaptation measures, including nature-based solutions, can reduce that risk. Globally, hybrid coastal defenses, including a combination of coastal vegetation, such as salt marshes and mangroves, with a dike or sea wall, have been highlighted as a promising adaptation measure. Here, we present a global-scale assessment of the potential risk reduction from mangrove restoration in combination with foreshore dike systems under scenarios of climate and socioeconomic change. We provide a quantitative assessment of the benefits in terms of reduced economic damage, exposed population, and poverty exposure. We evaluate mangrove restoration fronting dikes by accounting for wave–vegetation interaction. If mangrove foreshore dike systems were established along coastlines susceptible to flooding, restoration could potentially reduce expected annual damage by US$800 million and reduce expected affected population by 140,000 annually. These values increase under future projections. Our benefit–cost analysis finds mangrove restoration economically viable for about half of the subnational regions assessed (85 to 105 out of 208). At the global scale, the benefit–cost ratio under future conditions ranges from 3 to 6, with a net present value between US$44 billion and US$125 billion. Because absolute risk values and benefit–cost analysis do not differentiate between relative wealth impacts, we also estimated restoration impacts across different wealth levels. We show that restoring mangroves disproportionately benefits people with lower incomes, as they are often more exposed to coastal flooding and located in areas suitable for mangrove restoration. As such, mangrove restoration in low- and middle-income countries could contribute to the resilience of people in poverty.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to investigate whether the predictors of educational attainment (EA) have changed across time. Here, we provide insights by incorporating genetic predictors of education in three nationally representative British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958, and 1970. We investigated whether individual characteristics as proxied by polygenic indexes (PGIs) for EA and cognition have become more relevant to educational success over time and whether returns to genetic predisposition were moderated by early life socioeconomic background. We present three findings. First, associations between the EA PGI and attainment increased over time, with increasing incremental variance explained by the EA PGI. Second, associations between the cognition PGI and attainment were broadly consistent across cohorts, and there was no clear change in explained variance. Since the EA PGI captures multiple traits related to educational success, factors other than those related to cognition may have become more relevant over time. Third, we observed strong evidence of interaction: Associations between the EA PGI and EA were disproportionately larger among those from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. The strength and pattern of associations varied when using EA PGIs that were less conservatively filtered for SNPs. Our findings suggest EA is influenced by social and genetic factors both independently and jointly. Genetic liability and social background could be considered as two forms of inherited advantage which synergistically influence education attainment.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has documented racial disparities in gun violence news coverage in limited and small-scale contexts. This study curates and analyzes a large-scale dataset of news articles linked to specific incidents of gun violence to test for systematic race-related differences in representation across the US news media. Using computational techniques, we quantify how much media attention an incident gets, the topics and linguistic style of articles, and how participants in the incidents are framed. We find significant generalized disparities in media coverage and portrayal of incidents depending on whether they occur in neighborhoods that are majority white or majority people of color (POC), including increased media attention on police shootings if they occur in majority POC neighborhoods, greater focus on the people involved in incidents in majority white neighborhoods, and increased racialization and framing related to crime in majority POC neighborhoods.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondria, which evolved from symbiotic bacteria, possess their own genomes (mtDNA) and support independent transcription and translation within the organelle. Given the essential role of mtDNA in energy production, metabolism, as well as cellular homeostasis, and the high density of confirmed pathogenic mutations that map to mtDNA, there is a pressing need for versatile methods to study and manipulate this genome. Although CRISPR technology has revolutionized the editing of nuclear genomes, it has not been successfully extended to mtDNA, primarily due to the challenge of delivering single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) across both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Here we develop a survival-based reporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to screen for potential RNA import motifs. We identify a 40-nucleotide aptamer (IM83) that facilitates sgRNA entry into the mitochondrial matrix, enabling CRISPR editing by a mitochondrially-localized adenine base editor. We show that mitochondrial import of IM83 is ATP-dependent and enhanced by the tRNA synthetase Msk1. Further investigations identify barriers to efficient CRISPR editing of mtDNA, including loss of membrane potential associated with mitochondrial targeting of the base editor. These insights lay the groundwork for future improvements in CRISPR-based editing of mtDNA in eukaryotes.",

Beyond clearly pathogenic mutations, germline sequencing often reveals variants of uncertain significance (VUS), predominantly single base-pair alterations in coding or noncoding regions. These uncertain variants obstruct LS diagnosis, hampering personalized surveillance. To address this challenge, we developed a highly accurate functional assay that interrogates VUS pathogenicity in human cells. Building on a mouse-based cellular assay, we adapted oligonucleotide-directed mutation screening (ODMS) for human cells and introduced a refined approach named “coselection ODMS.” To ensure physiological expression, the variant is introduced into the endogenous MMR gene by replication-coupled gene editing. Coselection ODMS demonstrated 100% accuracy in classifying 50 benign and 86 pathogenic variants spanning coding and noncoding regions in all four MMR genes. Among 109 patient-derived VUS, 51 were identified as deleterious for MMR function. Importantly, coselection ODMS delivered 100% concordant results in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. With &gt;93% sensitivity and &gt;92% specificity, coselection ODMS provides a highly reliable functional assay in the diagnosis of enigmatic LS variants, enabling risk assessment and personalized surveillance or treatment for affected families.",

          "abstract": "Lymph node (LN) metastasis (LNM) frequently occurs in various cancer types and is associated with high aggressiveness, poor prognosis, and low survival rates. However, effective clinical interventions remain limited primarily due to the distinctive immunosuppressive microenvironment found in metastatic LNs. Targeted delivery of immunomodulators and selective immunoengineering in metastatic LNs offers a promising avenue for repurposing these LNs as an effective antitumor system while mitigating the risk of unwanted immune activation elsewhere. Here, we develop a bioresponsive LN-targeted immunomodulator nanocomplex designed to selectively reprogram the immune microenvironment in metastatic LNs for LNM inhibition. The immunomodulator nanocomplex can target LNs due to specific chemokine receptor 7 modification and selectively release anti-PD-1 antibodies in response to glutathione that is found elevated in the extracellular matrix of metastatic LNs. In two mouse models, our data suggested that the immunomodulator nanocomplex can selectively activate T cell–mediated antitumor immune responses in metastatic LNs and thus effectively inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of animals. Importantly, the modular design of this platform could enable facile incorporation of alternative immunotherapeutic agents that exhibit significant systemic toxicities in the clinic, allowing broader application to payloads that may particularly benefit from localized, LNM-selective activation. This approach holds significant promises for reducing the necessity for complete LN dissection, thereby presenting a valuable therapeutic option for a broad spectrum of cancer patients.",

Using mutational scanning in yeast, we identify thousands of such interactions in a clinically important enzyme, human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Restoration of protein function is not due to the biochemical properties of the substituted amino acids, but rather to a structural feature of the protein, the active site assembly. We develop a machine learning algorithm that uses protein language model embeddings to predict intragenic complementation in ASL with 99.6% accuracy. Additionally, the model trained on ASL generalizes to a structurally related but sequence-divergent enzyme, fumarase, with accuracy over 90%.

Using single-cell transcriptomics and a Nestin-CreERT2;NIHes1 fl/fl conditional knock-out mouse model, we have characterized the NIHes1 NSCs. Our analyses show that NIHes1 NSCs are the ancestral precursor NSCs that generate RGCs and intermediate progenitor cells during development. Loss of NIHes1 expression significantly alters the NSC niche, leading to increased gliogenesis and aberrant migration of projection neurons. NIHes1 NSCs are set aside at embryonic stages as adult neural stem cells and are maintained by NIHes1 expression even at adult stage.

Q-aggSRS allows for specific visualization by targeting the distinct Raman peak from carbon–deuterium bonds, eliminating the need for bulky fluorescent protein tagging (e.g., EGFP). Coupled with analysis from aggregate-tailored expansion microscopy, newly designed two-color imaging, and pulse–chase visualization, we comprehensively quantified the mHtt and non-mHtt proteins within the same aggregates across varying sizes, cell types, mHtt constructs, and subcellular locations. Our findings demonstrate a two-phase aggregate model with a distinct core–shell spatial organization, reveal significant heterogeneity in nucleus/cytoplasm compartmentalization specific to neurons, and identify previously unrecognized loosely packed aggregates specifically in neuronal nuclei. These insights should advance our understanding of native polyQ aggregates, and our proposed interaction coefficients may offer quantitative parameters for developing effective HD therapies.",

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, a well-known mitogen-activated signaling pathway, was significantly inhibited in XY Pdgfra -null gonads, suggesting that ERK signaling is activated downstream of PDGFRA. Using ex vivo whole-organ culture, small interfering RNA cell culture methods, transwell assays, and a genetic mouse model to disrupt ERK signaling in gonadal cells, we found that the ERK pathway promotes testis cord formation via early growth response 1 -mediated cell migration and regulates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in FLCs via activating the transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein 1. These findings highlight the significance of the PDGFRA signaling network in fetal testis organogenesis, thus providing insights into mesenchymal cell differentiation and the etiology of congenital disorders related to gonadal development.",

Here, we report catalytic activity for a single-domain ERP, Gt EXPN_133317, from the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum , which is highly expressed in the early phase of spruce colonization. We demonstrate enzyme-dependent formation of xylan-derived products, such as glucuronylated xylo-oligosaccharides, using high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Structure-based multiple sequence alignment of ERPs with GH45 endoglucanases showed that, next to a single conserved aspartate (Asp87 in Gt EXPN_133317) present in all ERPs and GH45s, fungal ERPs contain a second conserved acidic residue (Asp25 in Gt EXPN_133317). Mutation of these two conserved amino acids, Asp87 and Asp25, led to a nearly complete loss of xylanolytic activity. While these findings do not exclude the possibility of a noncatalytic plant cell wall–loosening mechanism, they show that ERPs likely have other modes of action besides what the current paradigm states.",

Considering the spectrum of mutant phenotypes that can arise within a declining population, there exists the interesting case of mutations which improve fitness relative to the wild-type, but do not restore population growth. Here, we hypothesize that mutations within this phenotype space are functionally inaccessible to populations in decline and term it an “evolutionary excluded zone.” We experimentally demonstrate that this excluded zone disallows certain mutational paths from causing evolutionary rescue in declining populations of M13 bacteriophage. We then integrate this observation into Fisher’s Geometric Model to extrapolate it to other evolutionary rescue scenarios. Our findings indicate that the excluded zone significantly reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue by de novo mutation and that evolution is fundamentally different in declining populations than in ones that are constant or growing.",

However, it remains unclear which phase of memory oxytocin affects to enhance face memory. Our study explored oxytocin’s potential to selectively enhance the consolidation of social memories, specifically human faces, and whether this effect varies between genders. In three preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N = 445, comprising 227 males and 218 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study 1), before retrieval (i.e., Study 2), and before encoding (i.e., Study 3) in three parallel studies. This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocin’s effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval or encoding. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval or before-encoding, significantly improved female participants’ ability to recognize male faces 24 h later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of the social placebo effect—where the belief in receiving oxytocin produces effects similar to those of actual intranasal oxytocin administration—and the approachability ratings during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin specifically enhances the consolidation of long-term social memories in women recognizing male faces. These findings imply that oxytocin selectively enhances the consolidation of human social memory, potentially deepening our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social memory processes.",

          "abstract": "p62/SQSTM1 generates liquid–liquid phase-separated condensates that participate in diverse processes, including protein quality control (PQC) and autophagy. Nuclear p62 condensates were shown to act as ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation hubs, whereas the involvement of cytoplasmic condensates in this pathway has remained unclear. Here, we show that cytoplasmic p62 condensates serve as a hub for proteasomal degradation that displays distinct substrate preferences compared with nuclear condensates. Specifically, cytoplasmic condensates mediate accelerated degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 through recruitment MDM2, its E3 ligase, while nuclear condensates are selectively enriched with USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that stabilizes p53. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissues reveal that p62 in healthy tissues is largely localized to the nucleus, whereas in the corresponding malignant tissues, it is largely in the cytosol, which is correlated with reduced p53 abundance in tumors. Nuclear p62 condensates also promote the degradation of oncogenic c-Myc, underscoring compartment-specific differences in protein turnover. Experiments in cancer cells and xenografts demonstrate that cytoplasmic p62 condensates drive tumor growth, whereas nuclear p62 condensates suppress it. Moreover, condensate formation rather than p62 expression alone is required for both enhanced proteolytic activity and tumor growth modulation. Proteomic analysis reveals that nuclear p62, unlike its cytosolic counterpart, is linked to enrichment of proteins associated with apoptosis, p53 stabilization, DNA damage response, and cellular senescence—all related to tumor suppression. These findings establish that p62 condensates provide compartment-specific regulation of ubiquitin and proteasomal degradation and suggest that manipulating their localization or affecting their dynamics can offer different therapeutic opportunities.",

How such diverse functions evolved from the ancestral role of JH remains poorly understood. The water flea, Daphnia , provides a striking case in which JH governs environmental sex determination (ESD) by inducing male production. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway linking maternal JH signaling to sex determination has remained unknown. Here, we identify the circadian gene, vrille ( Dpvri ), as a direct transcriptional target of JH signaling. Reporter assays revealed that Dpvri is activated by the JH receptor complex (Methoprene-tolerant/steroid receptor coactivator) via newly acquired 9-bp JH response elements (9 bp-JHREs) in its regulatory region, whereas the beetle ( Tribolium ) vri gene lacks such elements and did not show JH-responsive expression. This demonstrates that the presence or absence of specific regulatory sequences underlies interspecific differences in JH responsiveness. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of a single JHRE substantially reduced JH-dependent Dpvri expression and elevated the threshold for male induction, demonstrating its causal role in vivo. Comparative sequence analyses showed that JHREs in vri are conserved in the Cladocera, but absent in the crustacean, Artemia , suggesting that their emergence coincided with the origin of ESD in this lineage. These findings reveal the evolutionary co-option of vri into the JH pathway via acquisition of a JHRE, providing a mechanistic explanation for diversification of JH functions in arthropods.",

          "abstract": "The hydrological functions of forests are well recognized, but their influence on water storage and release dynamics remains poorly quantified. The fraction of young water ( F yw )—the proportion of streamflow younger than 2 to 3 mo—serves as an integrative indicator of a watershed’s capacity to retain and release precipitation. Here, by analyzing F yw across 657 watersheds worldwide, we found that forest cover exhibited a significant negative relationship with F yw . The causality was further corroborated through a meta-analysis of postdeforestation F yw trends, confirming that forest loss accelerates the conversion of recent precipitation into streamflow. This effect was most pronounced in watersheds with shallow groundwater, highlighting the role of forests in regulating rapid, near-surface flowpaths. Beyond total forest cover, we found that forest landscape patterns also exerted influences: A lower proportion of forest edge was associated with higher F yw , but only in sparsely forested watersheds ( ≤ ∼ 40% forest cover), where the edge-enhanced evapotranspiration was most pronounced. This global synthesis not only reinforces the hydrological value of forest conservation and restoration but also highlights that deliberate planning of forest landscape patterns can help mitigate the hydrological consequences of forest loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that integrating forest protection with forest landscape planning is essential for sustaining hydrological functions.",

For multiple BLTPs, we observe the ability to extract and solubilize lipids without lipid selectivity, and we identify membrane destabilization as a critical parameter to achieve effective lipid desorption. We rationally design a mutant BLTP with altered ability to destabilize lipid bilayers, and we show that this abolishes lipid desorption in silico and protein function in vivo. Taken together, our data provide an atomic-level description of the mechanism of lipid transport by BLTPs, ultimately suggesting alternative strategies to interfere with their activity.",

          "abstract": "Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small RNA satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV) which encodes a single protein, HDV delta antigen (HDAg), that is required for replication. Viral replication occurs independently from HBV and relies primarily on host RNA polymerase(s). Bulevirtide, a viral entry inhibitor, is the only approved treatment for chronic HDV but has a low cure rate as a monotherapy, and most patients rebound following cessation of therapy. It is likely that an inhibitor targeting HDV replication is necessary to achieve HDV cure, but the paucity of HDV-derived elements and limited understanding of HDV replication presents a significant therapeutic challenge. Understanding the precise mechanism of interactions between HDAg and viral RNA, and how it is packaged within the virion can inspire structure-guided drug design targeting replication. Using cryoelectron tomography and single particle cryoelectron microscopy, we present reconstructions of the virion and viral RNPs. We observed multiple binding configurations in vitro that suggest a propensity to arrange four RNA segments around repeating units of HDAg in a ladder-like formation. The oligomerization domains of a homo-octameric HDAg complex are directly involved in RNA binding by utilizing the vertices and sides of its square-shaped architecture to bind RNA in a sequence-promiscuous fashion. Structure–function analysis reveals that these RNA contact sites are important for viral replication and their disruption may be a potential avenue for next-generation antivirals to treat HDV.",

TapA interacts with the sensor kinase MtrB at the septum to initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the expression of the essential peptidoglycan hydrolases RipAB, among others, at the end of division. Loss of TapA disrupts division, dysregulates pole formation, and sensitizes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria to several first and second-line TB antibiotics, establishing TapA as a potential therapeutic target, and defining a link between cell cycle progression, envelope remodeling, and intrinsic antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria.",

Four distinct vortex patterns are identified, including a vortex crystal resembling Jupiter’s polar vortices and a single-vortex state akin to that of Saturn.

          "abstract": "The apicomedial actomyosin network is crucial for generating mechanical forces in cells. Oscillatory behavior of this contractile network is commonly observed before or during significant morphogenetic events. For instance, during the development of the Drosophila adult abdominal epidermis, larval epithelial cells (LECs) undergo pulsed contractions before being replaced by histoblasts. These contractions involve the formation of contracted regions of concentrated actin and myosin. The emergence and control of pulsed contractions are not fully understood. Here, we combined in vivo 4D microscopy with numerical simulations of an active elastomer model applied to realistic cell geometries and boundary conditions informed by cell polarity to study in vivo subcellular spatial patterns of LEC actomyosin dynamics. The active elastomer model quantitatively reproduced in vivo observations. When compared to rectangular domains, simulations on realistic cell geometries showed systematically better agreement with experiments. We found that cell shape, cell polarity, and organization of the cell’s actomyosin network codetermine spatiotemporal network dynamics both in vivo and in simulations. Furthermore, the model predicted changes to LEC contractile activity under genetic perturbation of the actomyosin network. Our results show that cell geometry, accompanied by boundary conditions which reflect the cells’ polarity, is important to understanding the dynamics of the apicomedial actomyosin network. Moreover, our findings support the notion that spatiotemporal oscillatory behavior of the actomyosin network is an emergent property of the actomyosin network, rather than driven by upstream signaling.",

Double-positive CD4 + CD8 + (DP) T cells have also been described in human cancers, but their role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. By generating a multiomic single cell atlas of DP and SP T cells, we find that DP T cells possess phenotypic heterogeneity similar to SP T cells that includes multiple clonally expanded populations of cytotoxic DP T cells in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These intratumoral DP T cells can mediate both MHC class I- and class II-dependent killing of autologous tumor cells. In addition, transcriptional profiling of DP TCR-bearing T cells revealed a gene signature enriched for clinical responders to PD-1 blockade in advanced RCC. We confirm prior observations of SP T cells transitioning into DP T cells and more notably, demonstrate that intratumoral T cells are capable of bidirectional differentiation in which DP T cells serve as precursors to SP T cell sin vivo. In the latter scenario, intratumoral DP T cells are shown to express Rag2 , suggesting that the tumor may act as an extrathymic site of T cell development. These findings reveal the multiple roles that DP T cells can possess in antitumor immunity.",

Using the photon momentum method to directly measure trapping forces, we show that swarming clusters generate persistent, dissipative flows indicative of nonequilibrium stationary motility within confined solenoidal mesostructures. These flagellar rotational dynamics break detailed balance in mesoscopic force space and exceed the limits of passive friction, as evidenced by force-velocity correlations and vortex-like circulations. By coarse-graining cluster trajectories into an active Brownian phase space, we quantify the work performed by bacterial swarms at cooperative coupling to thermal fluctuations, resulting in dissipative Ohmic-like currents overcoming conservative trapping.

However, the effects of spatial aggregation on the strength of species interactions are less well understood, especially in diverse ecological communities. In a field experiment with annual grassland plants in California, we manipulated the spatial arrangement—but not the number or identity—of two competitors and measured how they jointly affected a focal individual. We found that focal plants produced more seeds when their competitors were clustered than when they were mixed. These results suggest that mixed competitors generally had a more negative effect than clustered competitors. However, the effect of clustering varied across the pairs of competitor species. Competitor species that exhibited greater differences in size and/or functional traits across the spatial arrangements resulted in larger effects of clustering on focal plant seed production. Additionally, a competitive hierarchy among our study species predicted the effects of clustered versus mixed competitors on focal plant seed production. Altogether, our work suggests that the spatial arrangement of competitors changes the realized strength of competition in diverse plant communities. Given the extensive variation in spatial aggregation in plant communities, this mechanism is likely to be a powerful but underappreciated force shaping competition in nature.",

We administered cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) to young and aged mice. Using snRNA-seq and single nuclear ATAC sequencing, we identified distinct healthy and dedifferentiated RPE clusters in both aged vehicle- and young CSC-treated mice. Dedifferentiated RPE had globally decreased chromatin accessibility and expression of genes linked to “hallmarks of aging.” Notably, young, dedifferentiated RPE also exhibited a compensatory upregulation of hallmarks of aging-related genes including mitochondrial function and proteostasis while aged dedifferentiated RPE did not, which decreased their survival following CSC treatment, as experimentally verified with TUNEL labeling. Similar populations of dedifferentiated and healthy RPE were identified both in mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 4 mo and in macular RPE from a donor who smoked and another with early AMD, but not from a nonsmoker donor.

Preventing future outbreaks and developing efficient mitigation protocols can benefit from advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we developed an agent-based modeling approach to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of an infection outbreak in a confined environment caused by a specific pathogen, and to determine effective containment protocols. The approach integrates the 3D geographic information system of a confined environment, behavior of the hosts, key biological parameters about the pathogen obtained from the experimental data, and the general mechanics of host–pathogen and pathogen–fomite interactions. To assess our approach, we applied it to the historical data of infectious outbreaks caused by norovirus, H1N1 influenza A, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Our AI-GIS Infection Dynamics (AGID) model accurately predicted daily infection numbers, correctly identified the day when the CDC vessel sanitation protocol would be triggered, singled out key biological parameters affecting the infection spread, and propose pathogen-specific changes to existing containment protocols. Our work advances the understanding of infection spread on cruise ships while offering insights applicable to other similar confined settings, such as nursing homes, schools, and hospitals. By providing a robust framework for real-time outbreak modeling, this study proposes more effective containment protocols and enhances our preparedness for managing infectious diseases and emerging pathogens in confined environments.",

          "abstract": "In the human brain, the allowed patterns of activity are constrained by the correlations between brain regions. Yet it remains unclear which correlations—and how many—are needed to predict large-scale neural activity. Here, we present an information-theoretic framework to identify the most important correlations, which provide the most accurate predictions of neural states. Applying our framework to cortical activity in humans, we find that the vast majority of variance in activity is explained by a small number of correlations. This means that the brain is highly compressible: Only a sparse network of correlations is needed to predict large-scale activity. We find that this compressibility is strikingly consistent across different individuals and cognitive tasks and that, counterintuitively, the most important correlations are not necessarily the strongest. Together, these results suggest that nearly all correlations are not needed to predict neural activity, and we provide the tools to uncover the key correlations that are.",

          "abstract": "RNAseq analysis of the Drosophila genome has revealed further immune-induced genes. Two genes initially annotated as lncRNAs, CG44404 ( yulü ) and CG45045 ( shenshu ), are strongly induced. We report here that these two genes actually encode highly related secreted peptides found in the Sophophora subgenus of Drosophila species. We have generated single and double null mutants of these loci and found that the double mutant line did not display any enhanced susceptibility to an immune challenge with a panel of bacterial and fungal pathogens, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We did not observe any increased P. aeruginosa burden in yulü-shenshu mutants, suggesting that the two peptides may not be required for resistance to infection. Rather, we find that they provide a level of protection against Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) purified from either P. aeruginosa or Serratia marcescens culture supernatants. We have recently reported that S. marcescens OMVs induce the paralysis of flies through the induction of apoptosis in at least some neurons. Much of the virulence of these OMVs is mediated by the metalloprotease PrtA. While Yulü/Shenshu do not display any protease inhibition activity, the detection of an association between Yulü and the Drosophila complement thioester-containing protein 2 (Tep2) led to the finding that both Tep2 and Tep4 mutants are sensitive to the injection of PrtA while their overexpression significantly protects wild-type flies from the effects of this protease. Both Tep2 and Tep4 are able to inhibit the activity of PrtA in a thioester- and yulü/shenshu -dependent manner. Thus, these Teps may also function as α2-macroglobulins.",

However, most eTPD receptors are expressed broadly or are restricted to the liver, limiting specific degradation in other tissues. Cytokine receptor–targeting chimeras (kineTACs) are genetically encoded bispecifics for eTPD that fuse a natural ligand like CXCL12 to an antibody, directing soluble or membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation using the widely expressed chemokine receptor CXCR7 (K. Pance et al. , Nat. Biotechnol. 41 , 273–281 (2023)]. Here, we dramatically expand the kineTAC toolbox by constructing 81 different kineTACs based on an unbiased list of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Remarkably, 55 of these expressed at suitable levels for analysis without any optimization. Many of these kineTACs bind receptors that have unique cell-type expression profiles, allowing for eTPD in specific cells and tissues, and some were more potent than the original CXCL12-based kineTAC against specific targets. We further show the internalizing capability of a kineTAC can enhance the performance of antibody drug conjugates. We believe these simple, genetically encoded tools will be useful for expanding the applications for optimized or cell type–selective eTPD.",

          "abstract": "Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are promising electrolyte candidates for next-generation Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, the reverse migration of free anions causes uneven distribution of space charges and Li + flux, ultimately accelerating dendrite growth. Additionally, strong ion–solvent interactions lead to high Li + desolvation barriers and sluggish Li + transfer kinetics. To address these issues, we design a zwitterionic GPE, where the synergistic effects of zwitterionic groups promote Li-salt dissociation through ion–dipole interactions and simultaneously restrict anion migration, effectively suppressing space charge-induced dendrite growth. Moreover, the competitive coordination of zwitterions with Li + weakens the Li + -solvent interaction, accelerating interfacial Li + desolvation. Zwitterions in the inner solvation shell of Li + are preferentially reduced before the solvents, forming a conductive N- and S-rich inorganic interphase that enhances cycling stability. As a result, the zwitterionic GPE enables the Li||SPAN cells to deliver a high discharge capacity of 528.3 mAh g −1 at −20 °C, and achieve 79.6% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles. Besides, the Li||SPAN pouch cell, with an active mass loading of 10.5 mg cm −2 , delivers a high discharge capacity of 1.63 Ah and an impressive areal capacity of 16.3 mAh cm −2 .

          "abstract": "Conservation actions often assume implicitly that heritabilities are zero and that threatened populations cannot adapt to changing environments. To illustrate, we evaluated the last 10 y of recovery plans for US threatened and endangered species and found that only 4% assessed within-population adaptability. This omission reflects the common assumption that population adaptation is too slow or inconsequential to affect conservation practice in the short term. Yet, the median heritability (h 2 ) and evolvability (I A ) across many studies are not zero as assumed, but 0.3 and 0.4, respectively, based on a compilation of estimated values. This moderate heritability could rescue some populations. By compiling literature on conservation assessments, we detail how considering adaptability can shift conservation priorities, alter management recommendations, and provide additional ways to rescue declining populations and species. Based on these findings, we advocate for including population adaptability into conservation plans and adopting the prior expectation of moderate adaptability (h 2 = 0.3, I A = 0.4) along with its uncertainty, as a starting point when better information is lacking. This moderate adaptability could allow some species to respond naturally to environmental change while directing limited resources toward the species that need it most.",

          "abstract": "Cystobactamids are nonribosomal peptide natural products that function as DNA gyrase inhibitors, exhibiting significant antibacterial activity. They are isolated from Cystobacter sp. Cbv34 and contain various alkoxy groups on para-aminobenzoic acid moieties, which are believed to play a crucial role in antibacterial functions. The alkoxy groups are generated by iterative methylations on a methoxy group by the cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent radical S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme CysS. CysS catalyzes up to three methylations to give ethoxy, isopropoxy, sec-butoxy, and tert-butoxy groups. For each methylation, CysS uses a ping–pong mechanism in which two molecules of SAM are consumed. One SAM is used to methylate cob(I)alamin, while another generates a 5′-deoxyadenosyl 5′-radical to initiate substrate methylation. However, little is known about how the enzyme promotes both Cbl methylation and iterative substrate methylation, which occur by polar S N 2 and radical processes, respectively. Here, we report three X-ray crystal structures of a homolog of CysS from Corallococcus sp. CA054B . Two were determined in the presence of methoxy- and ethoxy-containing substrates, showing how CysS accommodates substrates and products during iterative methylation. The third structure, determined in the absence of a substrate, exhibits structural changes that reorient the SAM’s conformation to allow for the methylation of cob(I)alamin.",

Irrespective of whether the data are clustered by region, taxonomic group, conservation status, or breeding program type, the proportion of old individuals has increased continuously, mirrored by a decrease in juveniles and actively reproducing adults. This aging demographic trend compromises the long-term sustainability of zoo populations and thus the ability of zoos to meet ex situ conservation goals.

Modification of generalized fear by recall of a CS Rew + is dependent on the midbrain dopamine system and the regulation of discriminatory fear encoding by the central amygdala (CeA). Precisely timed, transient elevations in dopamine are necessary to reverse fear generalization and nondiscriminatory fear encoding in the CeA. Recall of a positive association is also effective at enhancing the extinction of a conditioned fear response in a dopamine-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that recall of a positive experience can be an effective means to suppress generalized fear and show that dopamine projections to the CeA are an important neural substrate for this phenomenon.",

ER-phagy receptor–ATG9A association nucleates the recruitment of the other key autophagy proteins required to initiate ER-phagy.

          "abstract": "Activation of transcription factor NRF2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) promotes aggressive tumor phenotype and protection from therapy-induced oxidative stress. We postulated that NRF2 high PDAC can be selectively targeted by C29h, a prodrug that is activated by the NRF2-induced enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), which is elevated in human pancreatic tumors. Initial evaluations of C29h alone or together with the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine were conducted on NQO1 high human and mouse PDAC cell lines and patient-derived organoids. As PDAC is enriched in collagen-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) that activates NRF2 and induces NQO1 expression, we examined the ECM effect on the response to C29h, as well as in vivo tumor control in IKKα-deficient Kras G12D /Ikkα ΔPEC mice in which NRF2 is strongly activated, immunocompromised Nu/Nu mice orthotopically transplanted with human PDAC cells and C57BL/6n and NOD/SCID mice transplanted with mouse PDAC. C29h led to NQO1-dependent killing of human and mouse PDAC cell lines and organoids and acted additively with gemcitabine. Furthermore, ECM-plated PDAC cells were more susceptible to C29h cytotoxicity than cells grown on plastic. Importantly, C29h treatment induced tumor regression and increased the survival of PDAC-bearing mice and optimal C29h-induced tumor regression was dependent on CD8 + T lymphocytes whose tumoral recruitment was enhanced by drug treatment. This study supports the use of C29h alone or as part of a drug combination as an effective and promising strategy for selective eradication of NRF2 high PDAC.",

Using 94,515 samples from 0 to 200 cm depth, combined with subregional classification (such as soil type, land use, climate, geomorphology, and soil texture) which helps address spatial heterogeneity, we obtain relatively accurate global distribution data for EC (Electrical Conductivity) and SIC. EC of 0 to 40 cm layer positively influences SIC in most taxonomic subregions, which may be due to the inorganic CO 2 absorption influenced by pH and salinity. EC of 80 to 100 cm layer sometimes negatively influences SIC due to the increase of soil depth. When EC is below 4 dS/m, EC often positively influences SIC. When EC increases by 2 to 4 dS/m, the mean global SIC in 0 to 20, 20 to 40, and 80 to 100 cm layers increases from 66.15, 78.75, and 117.39 to 174.47 to 190.38, 132.76 to 154.98, and 149.14 to 161.37 g/kg, respectively.

          "abstract": "The stable reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) acts as a key signaling molecule for many vital intracellular pathways. In diverse cell types, surface receptors control intracellular H 2 O 2 levels by modulating the activity of NADPH oxidases (NOX), a family of enzymes responsible for ROS synthesis. Most NOX isoforms are regulated through the reversible assembly of protein subunits to form an active oligomeric complex. The NOX isoforms NOX2 and NOX4 are expressed in endothelial cells and generate H 2 O 2 in response to activation of cell surface receptors. The GPCR agonist histamine activates NOX2 independently of NOX4, but the H 2 O 2 response to activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase agonist vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involves both NOX2 and NOX4 by unknown mechanisms [M. Waldeck-Weiermair et al. , Redox Biol. 58 , 102539 (2022); M. Waldeck-Weiermair et al. , Redox Biol. 73 , 103214 (2024)]. Here, we show that endothelial NOX4 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We define the redox states of various subcellular locales in the vascular endothelium and demonstrate that NOX2 is responsible for cytosolic H 2 O 2 signaling, whereas NOX4 contributes to H 2 O 2 generation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Using biochemical assays and structural modeling, we further identify a previously unrecognized regulatory interaction in which the NOX2 subunit p67 associates with NOX4. VEGF stimulation induces dynamic dissociation of p67 from NOX4, unveiling a “cross talk” between NOX isoforms that coordinates the activation of both NOX2 and NOX4 and thereby produces compartment-specific H 2 O 2 signals. This mechanism underscores the pivotal roles of NOX2 and NOX4 subunit interactions in endothelial redox homeostasis controlling cell survival, proliferation, and migration.",

The slow response to membrane depolarization is a hallmark feature of this channel’s physiology, yet the mechanistic basis of how voltage promotes the open potassium conducting state is unknown. We focused on previously identified aromatic residues which might couple the pore and voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) by using a chemical tuning approach whereby aromatic residues are modified by serial fluorination. The data show that serial fluorination at one site (F232 on the S4 helix, within the VSD) resulted in a stepwise voltage-gating shift, where each added fluorine atom further biased channel opening to more negative voltages. Mutant-cycle analysis of proximal positively charged amino acids indicates that F232 likely forms a cation–π interaction with K285, a residue at the tip of the S5 segment in the pore domain. Using cryoelectron microscopy, a partial structure of the F232 penta-F-Phe K v 7.1 (KCNQ1) open channel was resolved to 6 Å.

          "abstract": "Most prokaryotes divide using filaments of the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, while some archaea employ instead ESCRT-III-like proteins and their filaments for cell division and cytokinesis. The alternative archaeal system comprises Cdv proteins and is thought to bear some resemblance to ESCRT-III-based membrane remodeling in other domains of life, including eukaryotes, especially during abscission. Here, we present biochemical, crystallographic, and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC‐domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerizes into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct “semiopen” conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerized on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1, and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues, and reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement. Thus, we illuminate conserved principles of ESCRT-mediated membrane remodeling and extend them to an anciently diverged archaeal lineage.",

          "abstract": "Realization of unusual particle-to-wave-like crossover in phonon transport and understanding its fundamental structural origin can guide the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity. Here, we report such a crossover from particle-like phonon propagation to wave-like coherence with increasing temperature in the zero-dimensional (0D) metal halide, Tl 2 AgI 3 . Composed of discrete (Tl 6 I) 5+ and (Ag 3 I 8 ) 5− subunits, the structure exhibits intrinsic lattice instability governed by Pauling’s third rule where face-sharing of polyhedra drives Coulombic cationic repulsion causing local distortion of Ag atoms, as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function (X-PDF) analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Anharmonic low-energy rattling of Tl is evidenced within the (Tl 6 I) 5+ framework. These structural disorders generate low-frequency localized and anharmonic optical phonons that hybridize with acoustic branches, strongly suppressing lattice thermal conductivity ( κ l ). Consequently, κ l drops to ~0.18 W/m.K at 125 K and remains nearly temperature independent, signaling a breakdown of the phonon-gas model, attributed to phonon localization and wave-like coherence, modeled using the linearized Wigner transport equation (LWTE). The phonon localization in the 0D crystal structure results in a crossover from populations conductivity ( κ p ) associated with particle-like phonon propagation to coherence conductivity ( κ c ) through wave-like tunneling, at 175 K. Our study reveals 0D structural confinement along with anharmonic local structural dynamics can enable particle-to-wave-like phonon crossover, establishing a pathway to mixed phononic regimes and suppressed thermal transport.",

          "abstract": "The Taklamakan Desert, one of the world’s largest and driest deserts, has traditionally been considered a biological void. Here, we demonstrate that large-scale ecological restoration is transforming this hyperarid environment into a carbon sink. By analyzing satellite and ground-based data, we find strong seasonal dynamics: During the wet season (Jul to Sep), precipitation increases to 16.3 mm/mo, enhancing vegetation coverage and photosynthetic activity and drawing down atmospheric CO 2 by approximately three parts per million (ppm) relative to the dry-season levels. Long-term trends reveal significant increases in vegetation cover (6.8 × 10 −4 /y) and photosynthetic activity (6.1 × 10 −3 W/m 2 /sr/µm/y), accompanied by a strengthening net CO 2 uptake (NEE trend: −5.2 × 10 −12 kg/m 2 /s/y). These changes are spatially concentrated along the desert margins and their timing aligns with implementation of China’s Three-North Shelterbelt Program. Our results provide the direct evidence that human-led intervention can effectively enhance carbon sequestration in even the most extreme arid landscapes, demonstrating the potential to transform a desert into a carbon sink and halt desertification. This underscores the critical role of dryland restoration in global carbon management strategies and highlights the Taklamakan Desert as a model for climate change mitigation through nature-based solutions and ecological engineering.",

Although they are presumed to be distinct, their paralogous origins and shared subunits suggest the potential for higher-order assembly. Here, we reveal the conserved octameric architecture of BORC formed by two intertwined tetramers and present the structure of C. elegans BORC. Through cross-linking mass spectrometry of endogenous complexes, we validate this model for human BORC and demonstrate that the integrity of the complex, which is essential for lysosomal transport, relies on specific interfacial residues. We also clarify the disruptive nature of disease-causing mutations and propose that the formation and function of BORC are likely regulated by specific cues. These cues might include the phosphorylation of Snapin and a pH-sensitive histidine residue in BORCS5. Additionally, we present direct biochemical and structural evidence of BORC–BLOC-1 hybrid complexes. Finally, we link a specific hybrid complex to the regulation of transferrin receptor recycling via interaction with the EARP complex. Our work challenges the paradigm of BORC and BLOC-1 as separate entities, establishing a model of dynamic complex formation wherein modular assembly creates functional specialization to meet diverse cellular demands.",

          "abstract": "Progressive lung fibrosis is linked to aging-related dysfunction in fibroblasts, which remains poorly understood. To investigate the alterations in fibroblasts, particularly the molecular programs driving this profibrotic evolution in the aging lung, we isolated senescent lung fibroblasts from aged mice. We observed aberrant vimentin aggregates, which correlate with accelerated fibroblast senescence. CRISPR-based screening identified calumenin as a chaperone protein essential for vimentin proteostasis. A fibroblast-specific knockout of calumenin promotes the accumulation of vimentin aggregates and profibrotic factors migracytosis, exacerbating fibroblast senescence and lung aging. Mechanistically, calumenin collaborates with the TRiC complex to facilitate proper vimentin folding and recruits the chaperonin subunit Chaperonin Containing TCP1 Subunit 2 (CCT2) to degrade misfolded vimentin aggregates. Pathologically, external profibrotic stimuli trigger calcium transients and induce calumenin degradation, resulting in fibroblast senescence and the initiation of fibrosis. The natural product 9-85, derived from high-content screening, specifically targets and disrupts vimentin aggregates upon stimulation, alleviating aging-related lung fibrosis. Our findings reveal that calumenin coordinates vimentin quality control to shape cell structure and suppress the secretome of senescent fibroblasts, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for aging-related organ fibrosis.",

This study uses plot-level data to disentangle the contributions of six drivers (temperature, precipitation, CO 2 , management, age composition, and area) to these increases in 14 forest groups of the conterminous United States. From 2005 to 2022, the passive drivers (CO 2 , temperature, and precipitation) increased live tree carbon (C) by 66 teragrams (Tg) C y −1 with CO 2 fertilization contributing most of the change. Among the anthropogenic drivers, declining forest area reduced live tree C by 31 Tg C y −1 while tree planting increased it by 23 Tg C y −1 . Changes in age composition, driven by both passive traits and anthropogenic choices, increased live tree C by 89 Tg C y −1 . By quantifying the share of removals attributable to passive uptake, this approach enables nations with national forest inventories to better utilize their forests to meet net-zero requirements.",

Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude f 0 and persistence time τ p in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying f 0 , τ p , and the packing fraction ϕ . The morphology of the phase diagram accounts for a nonmonotonic evolution of the relaxation time with τ p , which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.",

Instead, a record of highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, and Au) in lunar impactites has been used as a proxy for the type of impactor material added to the Earth–Moon system. Quantifying impactor mass and flux with the HSE can potentially be complicated by numerous secondary processes, however, including silicate–metal segregation and multiple impact heritage. In contrast, because oxygen has an invariant geochemical affinity, triple oxygen isotope compositions have the potential to offer a robust long-term record of impactor fluxes in complex mixtures such as regolith. Here, we use high-precision triple oxygen isotopes to deconvolve the influences of meteorite addition and silicate vaporization and identify a ubiquitous impactor contaminant comprised of partially evaporated CM or ureilite-like material representing at least 1 wt% of the lunar regolith. Water delivered to Earth by meteorite material over 4 billion years therefore is only a fraction of an ocean’s worth of water but is a significant contributor to the ice reservoir of the lunar cold traps.",

The equilibrium between the dormant and active states, the latter of which is responsible for producing mature oocytes, is therefore crucial for ensuring the sustained reproductive capability of females. We have previously reported that mechanical stress in the ovary plays a crucial role in oocyte dormancy. However, the mechanism underlying this relation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the mechanical stress is directly transduced into the oocytes, rather than to the surrounding granulosa cells. Culture experiments and live-imaging analysis revealed the nuclear localization of FOXO3, a hallmark of oocyte dormancy, within oocytes cultured alone in response to mechanical stress. Interestingly, we found that the cytological response to mechanical stress was accompanied by ligand-independent internalization of the c-kit receptor, which dampens intracellular signaling and prevents oocyte activation. These results shed light on the relation between mechanical stress and oocyte dormancy and provide clues toward a greater understanding of female reproductive capability.",

Although the cross talk between auxin and cytokinin in promoting both vascular cell proliferation and differentiation has been well studied in angiosperms such as Arabidopsis thaliana , little is known about this regulation in other vascular plant lineages. Here, we found that unlike the hormonal cross talk found in all other species under study, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii shows clear task separation, with auxin driving vascular cell proliferation only and cytokinin specifically triggering cell differentiation. Using a cross-species transcriptomics approach, we found that members of the AUXIN / INDOLE-ACETIC ACID ( AUX / IAA ) and CYTOKININ OXIDASE ( CKX ) gene families exhibited divergent expression patterns in response to auxin and cytokinin treatments. Despite these regulatory differences, we show that AUX/IAA and CKX proteins are functionally conserved between Arabidopsis and Selaginella. Taken together, our findings suggest an evolutionary adaptation to the hormonal regulation of vascular tissue development in which core protein functions are conserved, but regulatory circuits diverged in lycophytes.",

We propose to relax GDL to allow for local symmetries, specifically fibration symmetries, which only require isomorphic input trees—a property that is much more common in real-world graphs. We show that GNNs apply the inductive bias of fibration symmetries and derive a tighter upper bound for their expressive power. Additionally, by identifying symmetries in networks, we compress network nodes, thereby increasing their computational efficiency during both inference and training of deep neural networks. The mathematical extension introduced here applies beyond graphs to manifolds, bundles, and grids for the development of models with inductive biases induced by local symmetries that can lead to better generalization.",

Episodes of hydrological perturbations and soil-erosion have been widely documented for the PETM but their link with vegetation- and carbon cycle changes remain poorly constrained. Here, we present organic microfossil evidence showing a strong increase in fern-dominated pioneer vegetation that replaced coniferous forests on the margin of the Norwegian Sea during the first millennia of the CIE. With the present stratigraphic constraints, the “fern spike” occurred simultaneously in terrestrial settings along the North Sea, Arctic Ocean, the US east coast and in southern Australia, indicating that pioneer vegetation persisted for several millennia following a partial collapse of previously stable terrestrial ecosystems. Both the ferns and influx of microcharcoal imply recurrent physical disturbance, including soil destabilization and erosion, potentially linked to droughts, wildfires, and strong hydrological forcing resulting from extreme climate change. Together with evidence for reworked clay minerals and ancient organic matter (kerogen), these findings show that highly disturbed terrestrial ecosystems were widespread across mid- and high-latitude regions globally. Carbon cycle model simulations suggest that a substantial loss of standing and buried biomass, along with oxidation of soil organic matter, acted as important positive feedbacks during the onset of the CIE. Additionally, enhanced kerogen weathering likely contributed as another major positive feedback throughout both the onset and main phase of the CIE.",

Traditional approaches relying on oxygen-utilizing genes need improvement for obligate anaerobes and fragmentary environmental genomes, where gene absence may reflect poor assembly rather than phenotype. We developed a machine learning model (GBDT40-LR) to predict microbial oxygen requirements using 40 broadly conserved genes, 35 without direct oxygen roles. This approach overcomes incompleteness biases in environmental genomes. Applied to 80,787 bacterial genomes [including metagenome-derived assemblies (MAGs)], the model classified 42,014 aerobes and 38,775 anaerobes, enabling large-scale ancestral reconstruction. Molecular clock dating indicates an emergence of aerobic bacterium prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE, 2.5 to 2.3 Ga), likely around ~2.7 Ga. Aerobic lineages subsequently diversified during the GOE and Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE, 0.8 to 0.55 Ga), with persistent anaerobe diversity across Earth’s oxygenation. This establishes that aerobic bacteria originated planetary oxygenation, potentially by 200 to 400 My, providing insights into phenotypic evolution and prolonged anaerobe–aerobe coexistence.",

We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging to estimate the endpoints of MSP- and TSP-related white matter structures (i.e., footprints) within hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex. We then measured the activation of pathway-specific footprints with functional MRI while participants learned novel concepts defined by regularities and exceptions. The functional footprint method revealed links between MSP-related footprint activation and regularity encoding early in learning and TSP-related footprint activation and exception encoding late in learning. These findings provide empirical evidence that learning concept regularities and exceptions is preferentially supported by hippocampal pathways. The pathway footprint approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of the human hippocampus, translating theoretical and computational work into empirically testable questions in humans.",

We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact.

In the first stage of this transport process, newly synthesized lipoproteins are released from the inner membrane by the ABC transporter LolCDE and passed to the periplasmic chaperone, LolA. Here, we show cryo-EM structures of LolCDE in complex with three different lipoprotein substrates, Lpp, Pal, and LolB, with the latter two bearing a disordered peptide linker between the acyl chains and the globular domain. Our work reveals that when the mature lipoprotein lacks an unstructured linker, the N-terminal portion of the protein is in an unfolded state for transport. The lipoproteins make a sequence-independent but structurally conserved interaction with a cleft on the surface of the periplasmic domain of LolE that promotes efficient transport. We propose a model of lipoprotein export where this interaction acts as pivot point for the peptide portion of the lipoprotein allowing the acyl chains to rotate 180° from their initial position in LolCDE to their binding site in LolA. Our results demonstrate how LolCDE can extrude lipoproteins of diverse sequence and structure and reveal an important detail of a transport process fundamental to bacterial physiology.",

          "abstract": "Intracellular action potential (AP) recording that allows long-term monitoring is challenging because permanent membrane penetration is impossible due to cell death or resealing of perforated cell membrane. Herein, an “inherited noninvasive intracellular recording” methodology was proposed, which was based on the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with microelectrode array (MEA)–electroporation system (AI-MEA-EP) to enable prolonged monitoring of intracellular APs in cardiomyocytes. It used MEA-electroporation (MEA-EP) for minimally invasive collection of intracellular signals transiently (~1 minute), as well as noninvasive recording of extracellular signals in long term. The recorded extracellular APs were converted into corresponding intracellular APs by a convolutional neural network–long short-term memory–based AI model enhanced by model self-calibration. The intracellular APs detected by the AI-MEA-EP exhibited high consistency with those physically obtained through MEA-EP. It was demonstrated to monitor cardiac intracellular AP under drug treatments and glucose challenging during &gt;5 consecutive days. This method offers a unique solution to achieve prolonged recording of intracellular signals for advancing cardiac research.",

          "abstract": "Agriculture, forestry, and other land use contribute about a fifth of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Mitigation efforts have emphasized “decoupling” that sustains production while lowering emissions per unit of output. However, the underlying decoupling mechanisms have not been fully characterized. We rely on a mathematical identity to decompose agricultural GHG emission growth ( Δ E ) into three parts: output ( Δ Y ), emissions per unit of input ( Δ E / X ), and output per unit of input ( Δ Y / X ) or total factor productivity (TFP). We then rely on official country-level data to quantify the historical contribution of these components. Over 1961 to 2021, we find that TFP growth—which captures the sector’s ability to produce more output per unit of measured input—has consistently remained one of the main sources of GHG emission reduction within farms. Further decomposition reveals a key role for rising land productivity in reducing emission intensity.",

Studying these diseases in human retinas has been hindered by the rapid loss of neuronal activity after death. While some CNS activity has been restored postmortem, synchronized neuronal transmission beyond 30 min has remained elusive. We overcome this barrier by reviving and sustaining light signal transmission in human retinas recovered up to 4 hours after death and stored for up to 48 hours. We also introduce infrared-based ex vivo imaging for precise sampling, a closed perfusion system for drug testing, and an ex vivo ischemia-reperfusion model in mouse and human retina. This platform enables testing of neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of drugs targeting oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity. Our advances question the irreversibility of ischemic injury, support preclinical studies in vision restoration, offer insights into treating CNS ischemia, and pave the way for human donor eye transplantation.",

However, the contribution of inflammatory forms of cell death in lung carcinogenesis and their effects on the composition of the tumor-immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our multi-omics analyses of samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma revealed that necrosome signaling is repressed because of reduced expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 ( RIPK3 ). Distinct methylation signatures, both in the RIPK3 promoter and nonpromoter regions, correlated with lower transcription levels of RIPK3 . This resulted in limited expression of inflammatory genes, advanced histologic features, reduced immune cell invasion, and decreased patient survival. Mechanistically, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive role of necrosome signaling through the genetic deletion of Ripk3 in two independent, clinically relevant mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, RIPK3 shaped a diverse immune environment by promoting the invasion of innate and adaptive immune cells in patient samples and experimental mice. Thus, RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling enhances a diverse immune microenvironment and hinders progression in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Here, we report modulation of the structure, photoluminescence, and lasing properties of PNCs in glass at temperatures well below the glass transition temperature with a short processing period. We generate tunable PNCs in glass via nanophase separation and ion exchange in the perovskite domains. PNCs-in-glass hierarchical structures are created by controlling nanophase separation and crystallization of PNCs. Substantially increased scattering in the hierarchical structures enables stable CW single-mode random lasing with an ultralow threshold of 52.6 milliwatts per square centimeter.

Here, we identified APCDD1 + cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a distinct stromal population that secretes lactate into the TME in response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Lactate uptake by prostate cancer cells induces androgen receptor variant 7 expression, thereby conferring resistance to ADT. Mechanistically, lactate-induced lactylation of the spliceosome component SNRPA at Lys 123 (K123) enhances its recognition of cis-acting elements, increases chromatin binding, and promotes androgen receptor splicing. Targeting lactate transport with monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors effectively restores ADT sensitivity.

These membranes exhibit high selectivity and permeance and ease of preparation. By applying MXene as the strong interaction patch for covering and repairing defects on PCN nanosheets, the resultant membranes demonstrated an ultrahigh H 2 permeance of 870 to 8046 GPU, considerable selectivity, and superior long-term stability, outperforming most current state-of-the-art membranes. Economic analysis revealed that MXene/PCN membranes achieved ultralow energy consumption and minimal membrane area demands for practical applications.

COBRA models analyze steady-state fluxes using linear constraints but lack kinetic detail. Kinetic models offer mechanistic descriptions via differential equations but require (often unknown) kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce COBRA-k, a framework integrating nonlinear kinetic rate laws into COBRA models to consistently constrain metabolic fluxes, enzyme abundances, and metabolite concentrations. COBRA-k enables flexible exploration of metabolic steady states with optimization techniques, even with incomplete parametrization. COBRA-k models require solving computationally demanding mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We therefore developed a dedicated iterative algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python package. We applied COBRA-k to a large-scale Escherichia coli model, demonstrating its effectiveness and revealing holistic metabolic insights. For example, it accurately predicts and explains the phenomenon of high intracellular glutamate concentration. COBRA-k combines the flexibility of COBRA with kinetic precision, offering a powerful tool for predictive metabolic modeling and engineering.",

Here, we investigate the spectral, temporal, and directional characteristics of room-temperature X D emission from a tungsten diselenide monolayer coupled to a dissipative plasmonic nanocavity. Under resonant plasmon-exciton coupling, the radiative decay rate of X D is accelerated by nearly four orders of magnitude, and correspondingly, the X D lifetime is shortened to a subnanosecond level, making it comparable to that of bright excitons. Fitting the measured lifetimes with a Purcell-formalism–based cavity quantum electrodynamics model allows estimating of the intrinsic room-temperature X D lifetime to be about 24 ± 2.3 microseconds. Furthermore, the measured radiation patterns of the dark excitons show that subtle variations in the nanocavity orientation can effectively tailor the X D emission directionality, important for quantum technologies and optoelectronics applications.",

Overexpression of both isoforms altered excitatory synaptic transmission, structural modeling revealed divergent tertiary configurations between DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 and DOC2A Full-Length , and interactome profiling highlighted that DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 unique interactors are enriched in the myosin II complex and ankyrin binding, suggesting the acquisition of previously unknown structural and regulatory functions by DOC2A ∆Val217-Pro218 .

          "abstract": "Crotonate, a short-chain fatty acid, generates protein crotonylation. However, the role of crotonate in cancer progression is unknown. Here, we present a crotonate–crotonyl–coenzyme A (CoA)–enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) crotonylation cascade blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis. We demonstrated that crotonate promotes EZH2 degradation via crotonyl-CoA–mediated crotonylation at Lys 348 in EZH2 (EZH2-K348cr). EZH2-K348cr leads to reduced genome-wide H3K27me3 (trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone-3) occupancy. Crotonate metabolizes to crotonyl-CoA by ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase 2), and then, acyltransferase p300 catalyzes crotonyl-CoA and generates EZH2-K348cr. Crotonylated EZH2 triggers EZH2 ubiquitination and degradation. Administration of crotonate markedly inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via a crotonate-crotonyl-CoA-EZH2-K348cr cascade. In comparison, crotonate showed better blocking effect than EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in suppressing breast cancer metastasis. The combination of crotonate and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) antibody enhances responses of breast cancer cells to immunotherapy. Together, our findings indicate that crotonate is a promising anticancer drug candidate that suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis by specifically inducing EZH2 degradation.",

Genome-wide RNA interference screens identified genes (encoding for stabilizers) responsible for mutant EGFR stability, with P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2) emerging as a bona fide stabilizer. Mechanistically, high extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels transactivate EGFR mutants via P2Y2 activation, previously shown to signal through Src kinase–dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Our study reveals that ATP-driven P2Y2 activation stabilizes EGFR mutants by forming a P2Y2-integrin β1-EGFR complex enriched in endosomes. Targeting this axis destabilizes EGFR mutants and offers a strategy against drug resistance. Elevated P2Y2 and integrin β1 expression in patients with NSCLC implies clinical relevance.

Here, we used maps of DSBs identified through sBLISS (in-suspension break labeling in situ and sequencing) with transcription stress markers to delineate the transcription stress landscape in cancer. We found that transcription stress sites are shaped by the superenhancer regulatory landscape. Notably, γH2AX is enriched at transcription stress sites; however, not all DSB-enriched genes show similar γH2AX marking. Instead, genes with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Genes with high DSBs marked by γH2AX exhibited substantially higher DSB turnover and repair than those with low γH2AX, and are associated with vulnerability to mutagenesis. These findings underscore superenhancer activity as a determinant of the transcription stress landscape in cancer, posing a threat to the genomic stability of oncogenes.",

It fosters the circulation of goods and information and enables kinship ties across different scales, including long-distance contacts. While such behaviors are known since at least the Upper Palaeolithic, evidence for geographically extensive social networks remains scarce. This evidence is limited to indirect inferences based on shared cultural traits, “art” styles, and symbolic items, while lithic raw material movements are mostly local and regional, with few cases exceeding 300 kilometers. We provide geochemical evidence for the largest confirmed distance between the source and discard location of a knapped lithic object in Palaeolithic Europe. Solutrean artifacts discarded at Peña Capón, Central Iberia, were sourced in Southwest France, 600 to 700 kilometers away. This demonstrates social networks of unprecedented geographic scale maintained during ∼1400 years during the Last Glacial Maximum. It also suggests that stone tools were exchanged as symbolic items to solidify social contacts and sustain far-reaching networks as risk-buffering mechanisms among widely dispersed hunter-gatherers.",

We explored this question in the frame of X-chromosome inactivation, a process under strong selective constraint, governed by the XIST lncRNA and its cis-regulators. Using functional approaches on closely related primate species, we show that XIST regulation has uniquely diverged over a short evolutionary timescale. In human and marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the JPX lncRNA gene is a major regulator of XIST expression. In contrast, JPX has a minor effect on XIST in macaque ESCs, where it acts together with a macaque-specific enhancer. This occurs within a reshuffled 3D organization of the XIST neighborhood triggered by the insertion of a HERVK transposon in the macaque lineage. Retrospective sequence comparisons revealed that many XIST regulators are not evolutionarily constrained, supporting the hypothesis that neutrally evolving noncoding elements harbor adaptive potential. These results illuminate how evolutionary recent elements are integrated into preexisting regulatory landscapes.",

Here, we design a Li-rich, hollow ionic-electronic conductor (HIEC) interlayer, which integrates metallic Li encapsulation and interfacial protection, thus guiding highly reversible thick Li deposition (5 milliampere-hours per square centimeter). In addition, the built-in electron-deficient domains in the HIEC facilitate the formation of the hierarchical SEI and further mitigate active Li corrosion. These synergistic effects of the interlayer enable stable cycling in batteries under both anode-less and anode-free configurations, attaining &gt;99% coulombic efficiency under industrial-level cathode loading and lean electrolyte conditions.

We developed a variable-stiffness mechanics model to predict material-level stress-strain behavior across temperatures and thus the force-contraction relation of device level. This model informs actuator design and control, geometric scaling, peak points in the force-contraction relation, and the theoretical upper bound of contraction strain.

Although TCR-T cells were more sensitive at detecting low-density pHLA, TCR-T cells exerted only transient in vivo antitumor efficacy followed by tumor relapse due to deficient TCR-T cell proliferation and persistence that was associated with a more differentiated and dysfunctional phenotype.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) offer promise for antifibrotic therapy via paracrine signaling, but their clinical efficacy is hindered by poor survival and limited functional activity after transplantation. Here, we present a cell surface engineering strategy that reprograms the antifibrotic function of MSCs by constructing a pseudofibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) on their surface. Through in situ self-assembly of peptide-modified hyaluronic acid, we generate a nanofiber-based matrix that mimics the dense, disordered architecture of fibrotic ECM. This matrix activates the Piezo1/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, inducing up-regulation of Mmp13—a key collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinase—in engineered MSCs. In a rat model of myocardial infarction–associated fibrosis, engineered MSCs exhibit robust antifibrotic activity compared to unmodified MSCs.

An additional challenge of real-world vision is that it is dynamic, causing the appearance of objects (e.g., their size and orientation) to change as we move. Notably, however, these changes are predictable from the three-dimensional structure of the surrounding scene. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we find that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. First, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Second, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision.",

Here, we studied primary patient tumors and cell line models to identify molecular drivers of this hybrid state. Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells derepress TGFBR2 and up-regulate expression and secretion of TGFβ2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. Although TGFβ ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation. Thus, stroma-derived and tumor-derived TGFβ ligands induce and maintain hybrid EwS cells to promote pro-metastatic cell phenotypes.",

This study presents a cortical bone fragment from an elephant, deliberately shaped into a percussor for resharpening flint tools.

To disentangle the contribution of each active site to the observed enzymatic activity, we developed a cleavage assay involving heterodimers of active and inactive (catalytic residue mutated or inhibitor-bound) monomers. Notably, we found that heterodimerization increased cleavage efficiency per active monomer. In addition, we mapped a network of critical residues bridging the two active sites and probed this network through engineered mutations.

Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g., time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians’ eigenstate properties is O ˜ ( log ε − 1 ) , which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision ε. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count ( cnot and non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness.",

          "abstract": "Holonomies are of great interest to quantum computation and simulation. The geometrical nature of holonomies offers increased stability to quantum gates. Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories. Yet, practically designing quantum holonomies with the required properties and scale is challenging. Here, we construct a new class of holonomies by increasing the particle number. We show that multiparticle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multiparticle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics. Our results enable the number of particles to be harnessed as a design parameter, offering increased freedom in constructing holonomic systems.",

We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ 56 Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ 56 Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ 56 Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species.",

ROS detoxification with catalase suppressed E. faecalis –induced UPR and rescued epithelial cell migration, while exogenous hydrogen peroxide was sufficient to restore UPR activation in EET-deficient strains. UPR disruption by pharmacological inhibition also impaired cell migration, highlighting a critical role for UPR homeostasis in wound repair.

We report that fossils of Prototaxites taiti from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert were chemically distinct from contemporaneous Fungi and structurally distinct from all known Fungi.

The granuloma’s necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through up-regulation of the bacterial devR regulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K + transport and rpf genes. Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection.",

Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper; thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counterintuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Last, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.",

          "abstract": "Marine habitability for complex life on Earth and Earth-like planets requires bioavailable nutrients and dissolved oxygen. The cycling of nutrients and oxygen is controlled by physical ocean circulation. However, our understanding of how circulation has varied through time and space is incomplete for Earth and unconstrained for Earth-like exoplanets. Earth’s rotation has slowed over time, affecting ocean circulation by modifying the Coriolis effect. We use a three-dimensional Earth system model to explore how slowing planetary rotation influences ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. We show that slower rotation enhances wind-driven upwelling and global circulation. Nutrient recycling is consequently more efficient, increasing photosynthetic productivity. Additionally, enhanced ocean oxygenation improves habitability for aerobic life under a well-oxygenated atmosphere. However, under a poorly oxygenated atmosphere, slowing rotation increases oxygen fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, Earth’s rotational history may have been a long-term background control on surface oxygenation and the evolution of animals.",

AEGIS can have as many as 12 different units and six different pairs with Watson-Crick-Franklin geometry.

The denuder efficiently removed alkanes and weakly functionalized acids, aldehydes, and alcohols with fewer than 10 carbon atoms from the gas phase. Denuding organic compounds perturbed the CCN-derived hygroscopicity parameter by up to 50%. Denuding either rendered the particles more or less CCN active, and the direction of the effect depended on sample relative humidity and trace gas concentration. The effect was weakest in early spring and strongest in late spring and summer.

Here, we used an active immunization model that closely mimics the human disease to immunize adult mice with intact GluN1/GluN2A receptors, resulting in fulminant autoimmune encephalitis. Serum was collected at 6 weeks postimmunization for single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of GluN1/GluN2A receptors complexed with purified polyclonal anti-NMDAR autoantibody fragments. Native autoantibodies recognized two distinct binding sites on the GluN1 amino-terminal domain, which we confirmed using monoclonal antibodies bound to native NMDARs purified from mouse brain.

However, the regulatory role of PsAF5 in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the intracellular redox state has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we identify that specific cysteine residues in the FYVE domain of PsAF5 sense cellular redox states to form and resolve disulfide bonds in a redox-dependent manner. Under reducing conditions, PsAF5 undergoes redox-dependent phase separation to form cytoplasmic condensates that are functionally decoupled from mitophagy execution. Under oxidative conditions, PsAF5 exhibits increased cytosolic solubility and enhanced interaction with PsATG8, thereby promoting mitophagy.

PiggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) is an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate DNA transposase–derived gene with DNA remodeling activities in human cells. Here, we show that PGBD5 contributes to normal brain development in mice and humans, and its deficiency causes disorder of intellectual disability, movement disorders, and epilepsy. In mice, Pgbd5 is required for the developmental induction of postmitotic DNA breaks and recurrent somatic brain genome rearrangements. In the cerebral cortex, loss of Pgbd5 leads to aberrant neuronal gene expression, including of specific types of glutamatergic neurons, which partly explains the features of PGBD5 deficiency in humans.

          "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) and phospholipids (PLs) are key components of joint lubrication. In osteoarthritis (OA), the molecular weight (MW) of HA is reduced, which has been proposed to weaken the anchoring capacity of PL and impair lubrication. This study reveals a different mechanism by directly linking the MW to the structure of HA-PL (hybrid) assemblies and frictional properties. Using mixed-MW HA and PL to model this difference between healthy and OA synovial composition, we found interfacial lamellar structures form under healthy-like conditions, while hybrid vesicles predominate in OA-like conditions. At physiologically relevant shear rates, lamellar assemblies maintain ultralow friction, whereas vesicles are removed, causing a tenfold friction increase. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how HA-PL structural organization controls lubrication. While this simplified system does not capture the biochemical complexity of synovial fluid, this study advances understanding and offers a framework for designing structure-informed therapeutic strategies and biomimetic lubricants.",

However, current vascular sensors hold challenges in limited perceptive dimension and accuracy and poor interface robustness. Here, we report 18-channel flexible thermal array sensor using active thermal penetration sensing principle for imperceptible monitoring of deep and superficial vasculature. Leveraging contact-free thermal penetration and natural piezo-thermic transduction of human skin, the sensor implements spatiotemporal mapping of vascular dynamics with high sensitivity, good-linearity, fast-response, low cross-talk, and excellent interfacial robustness. It enables real-time and in situ measurements of multimodal vascular characteristics including deep arterial pulsation, superficial capillary perfusion, relative blood flow velocity, skin temperature, and continuous blood pressure via data-efficient vascular feature extraction method.

Here, we performed a comprehensive super-resolution mapping of dendritic spines in layer 5 extratelencepharic-projecting (L5 ET) neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex in mice. In adults, the dendritic spines are highly enriched in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites (spine density “hotspot”), where dendritic calcium spikes are generated. In early development, dendritic spines are evenly distributed. During adolescence, however, the spine density increases specifically in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites in an experience-dependent manner, while other dendritic compartments show a slight reduction. Furthermore, spine accumulation at the hotspot was specifically impaired in mouse models of schizophrenia, demonstrating a link between adolescent spine formation and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our finding suggests that the dendritic compartment-specific spine formation during adolescence shapes nonlinear dendritic integration in L5 ET neurons and supports the maturation of cognitive functions.",

Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the full-length structure of the VACV EFC at near-atomic resolution, revealing a 15-protein asymmetric assembly organized into three layers. The central A16/G9/J5 heterotrimer forms the fusion core, stabilized by conserved PXXCW and Delta motifs, and anchors two A28/H2 adaptor dimers linked to peripheral G3/L5/A21/O3 scaffolds. Structural and evolutionary analyses identify a conserved N-terminal domain in A16 containing a myristoyl-binding pocket and a phenylalanine-rich region that stabilizes the trimer and may regulate lipid engagement. An additional component, F9, binds peripherally to J5, A21, and H2 through Delta-like motifs, reinforcing the prefusion architecture. Together, these results define the VACV EFC as a unique multiprotein fusion machinery and provide a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of poxvirus entry and membrane fusion.",

However, the mechanisms driving the performance decline of TFC membranes at high temperatures remain poorly understood. Herein, we combine controlled experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and micromechanical modeling to elucidate TFC failure mechanisms and to evaluate thermally resilient thin-film cross-linked (TFX) composite membrane. Upon exposure to elevated temperatures (&gt;60°C), salt rejection of TFC dropped from ~99 to &lt;90%, with irreversible structural damage in the polysulfone layer, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. In contrast, the TFX membrane maintained ~99% salt rejection and showed no signs of physical degradation up to 80°C. Our combined analyses revealed that TFC membrane failure arises from irreversible pore expansion in the thermoplastic polysulfone support, leading to polyamide film rupture and delamination. TFX membranes resist thermal deformation, enabling ultrahigh-temperature RO desalination and water reuse.",

Using chromosome-scale genomes from newly sequenced spiders and the whip scorpion, we integrate evidence from macrosynteny and phylogenetic analyses to provide further strong support for a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event that occurred during early Arachnopulmonata evolution. Following this event, the abdominal-A gene pair not only exhibits functional divergence but also jointly facilitates the emergence of spinnerets. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell transcriptomic analyses and functional validation to confirm that the dachshund-1 gene also regulates spinneret development.

Introducing disulfide bonds maintains the ordered urea-based H-bond assembly in bulk polymers while simultaneously suppressing secondary crystallization of these H-bonded arrays and offering secondary H-bonding sites by forming S─S·H─N interactions. This two-atom structural change revitalizes semicrystalline homopoly(urea) materials by allowing chain mobility and reconfiguration below melting temperatures to enable thermoplastic-like (re)processability and thermoset-like robustness, including more than 2-gigapascal storage modulus, a broad creep-resistant temperature range (up to 150°C), ceramic-like hardness, and resistance to common solvents.

The Qiang genetic structure has been profoundly shaped by historical admixture with Han and Tibetans, giving rise to distinct subpopulations. Using ~450 ancient Asian genomes, we traced the most recent common ancestor of the Qiang to ancient Yellow River farmers ~5300 years ago, indicating shared ancestry with other Chinese populations. We identified several highly differentiated variants related to ethanol metabolism and pigmentation between Qiang subpopulations, which likely arose from joint effects of admixture and selection. Notably, a highly prevalent missense variant in a blood pressure regulation gene was detected, suggesting a potential role in altitude adaptation. Collectively, our findings illuminate the genetic history of the Qiang and highlight how admixture and selection shaped the diversity of Tibetan-Plateau fringe populations.",

To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate–photon flux, high-sensitivity, quantum noise–squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5-decibel improvement beyond the shot noise limit in distinguishing l - and d -amino acids in liquid phase.

As a critical step, the rearrangement of short-range ordered aluminosilicate networks enriched with five-membered rings, coupled with geometric matching to the cylindrical micelles of the bolaform organic structure-directing agent, synergistically drives the development and closure of curvature-induced interfaces, ultimately leading to the formation of single-walled zeolitic nanotubes.

Activation is achieved through the interaction of ToxR or TcpP with the α–C-terminal repeat domain of RNAP where a single residue of the activator, a phenylalanine, appears to be the most critical contact, as confirmed by mutagenesis. No interactions of the transcription factors were observed with other subunits of the RNAP, i.e., the σ subunit as it occurs in the structurally related PhoB family of two-component transcription factors.

This study reveals a post-2000 intensification of winter ENSO’s impact on subsequent autumn LESS ice, driven by accelerated ENSO phase transitions compared to the pre-2000 era. Rapid phase transitions of El Niño after 2000 generate persistent cold anomalies in the tropical central–eastern Pacific during the subsequent autumn, strengthening and displacing the Western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) northward. This WNPAC triggers Rossby waves establishing an Arctic anticyclone, warming, and moistening the LESS atmosphere, thereby driving substantial ice loss. In contrast, pre-2000 slower El Niño decay exhibited weaker tropical-Arctic connectivity.

We synthesized 1094 paired observations of CUE ST and heterotrophic respiration rate ( R h ) across natural ecosystems and found a nonlinear relationship between them governed by ecosystem productivity. In low-productivity arid and cold regions, CUE ST declined with increasing R h , whereas in productive tropical and temperate regions, CUE ST stabilized at a low level (0.27 ± 0.11) as R h exceeded 340 ± 10.8 grams of C per square meter per year.

In contrast, natural bone’s load-bearing capability arises from the synergy between citrate, soft collagen, and ultrathin hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (~3 nanometers). Here, we show that elastic poly(octamethylene citrate) enables up to 60 wt % hydroxyapatite incorporation, mimicking the bone’s mineral content. Through a top-down “citrification” process and hot pressing, hydroxyapatite microparticles are partially dissolved and recrystallized into superthin (~5 nanometers) nanorods, enhancing organic-inorganic integration and replicating bone’s Ca/P ratios and architecture.
