          "title": "The geoeconomic turn in decarbonization",
          "authors": "Jonas Meckling",
          "abstract": "The rise of green industrial policy is transforming efforts to decarbonize the global economy and mitigate climate change. The first three decades of climate policy centred on international cooperation on dividing up the costs of mitigation. In the new era of green industrial policy, geoeconomic competition for the benefits of decarbonization has emerged alongside international cooperation on emissions reductions. Governments invest in the manufacturing and deployment of clean technologies to advance economic development, energy security and emissions cuts. Geoeconomic competition has the potential to accelerate global decarbonization by facilitating greater technology deployment, speeding up technology cost declines and, thus, lowering the barriers to climate action. However, it also creates major pitfalls by facilitating the rise of trade protectionism, creating international conflict, and reproducing economic divides between richer and poorer, yet growing, countries. It is thus uncertain how the geoeconomic turn will impact global decarbonization. Meanwhile, policymakers are asking fundamental questions about how to design industrial policy, manage politics, develop institutions, and deal with the trade-offs between economic, climate and security goals. This Perspective demonstrates the recent geoeconomic turn in decarbonization, lays out its implications for policymaking, identifies global spillovers and addresses research needs.",

          "abstract": "Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.",

          "abstract": "Kinetically trapping the high-temperature states through rapid cooling solidification is widely used for the synthesis of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), especially those with intrinsically immiscible elemental combinations1,2,3,4. However, strategies need to be developed to overcome the fundamental limitations of rapid cooling solidification in controlling the crystallinity, structure and morphology of HEAs. Here we introduce an isothermal solidification strategy for the synthesis of HEAs by rapidly altering the metal alloy composition through liquid–liquid interface reactions at low temperatures, for example, from 25 °C to 80 °C. We use gallium (Ga)-based metal as the sacrificial reagent and mixing medium. By directing the reactions to the interfaces between the Ga-based liquid metal and an aqueous metal ion solution, the foreign metal ions can be reduced at the interfaces and incorporated into the liquid metal quickly. HEAs with various crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal and amorphous), morphology (zero, two and three dimensions) and compositions can be achieved through the isothermal solidification. Ga can be completely consumed, resulting in Ga-free HEAs. If desired, Ga can be one of the metal elements in the final products. In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies and theoretical analysis show the isothermal solidification mechanisms. Our direct observations show the enhanced mixing of liquid metal elements and the solidification process with fluctuating nucleation dynamics. The isothermal solidification marks a powerful strategy for HEA synthesis through an unexplored pathway of kinetically trapping the high-entropy states.",

          "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2,3,4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Polymer electrolytes paired with lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxide (LRMO) cathodes and anode-free cell design are considered one of the most promising high-energy-density and high-safety systems1,2,3,4. However, the unstable anode morphological changes and the irreversible anionic reactions at the electrolyte–cathode interfaces induce oxygen escape and catalytic decomposition of polymer electrolytes, resulting in severe interfacial degradation and poor cycling stability. Here we design an in-built fluoropolyether-based polymer electrolyte composed of strongly solvating polyether and weakly solvating fluorohydrocarbon pendants, creating an anion-rich solvation structure and thus anion-derived fluorine-rich interfacial layers on the cathode and anode to resist interfacial issues. The LRMO cathode exhibits improved oxygen redox reversibility with substantially reduced oxygen-involving interfacial side reactions. This quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte with 30 wt% trimethyl phosphate enables an LRMO cathode with a reversible high-areal-capacity cycling (>8 mAh cm−2) in pouch cells and long-term stability (>500 cycles at 25 °C) in coin cells, respectively. The pouch cells exhibit an energy density of 604 Wh kg−1 (1,027 Wh l−1) and excellent safety under a nail penetration at a fully charged condition. Our work, therefore, provides a promising direction for creating practical high-energy-density and high-safety lithium batteries.",

          "abstract": "Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for realizing useful quantum computers1,2,3. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and correct errors, we can achieve low logical error rates. However, for many practical quantum error correction codes such as the surface code, owing to syndrome measurement errors, standard constructions require multiple extraction rounds—of the order of the code distance d—for fault-tolerant computation, particularly considering fault-tolerant state preparation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we show that logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of extraction rounds for a broad class of quantum error correction codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feedforward, to achieve ‘transversal algorithmic fault tolerance’. Through the combination of transversal operations7 and new strategies for correlated decoding13, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal logical measurement distribution can be made exponentially small in the distance, even if the instantaneous quantum state cannot be made close to a logical codeword because of measurement errors. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of quantum fault tolerance and has the potential to reduce the space–time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by over an order of magnitude.",

This community effort will be phylogenetically informed, rely on high-quality genomes and use shared standards to facilitate comparisons across species.

Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS–STING signalling 3 . However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1 4 , in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS–STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.",

Although the highly explosive volcanoes of Santorini and Kolumbo 1,2 in the Greek Aegean Sea are just 7 km apart, their potentially coupled deep magmatic feeding systems are only poorly understood 3,4 . The 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis of Santorini simultaneously affected both volcanic centres, providing insights into a complex, multistorage feeder system. Here we integrate onshore and marine seismological data with geodetic measurements to reconstruct magma migration before and during the crisis. Gradual inflation in the Santorini caldera, beginning in mid-2024, preceded the January 2025 intrusion of a magma-filled dike sourced from a mid-crustal reservoir beneath Kolumbo, indicating a link between the two volcanoes. Joint inversion of ground and satellite-based deformation data indicates that approximately 0.31 km 3 of magma intruded as an approximately 13-km-long dike, reactivating principal regional faults and arresting 3–5 km below the seafloor. The 2024–2025 resurgence of magmatic activity beneath both volcanic centres and their apparent coupling provides insights into the dynamic interplay of magma storage, transport and reservoir failure beneath neighbouring volcanoes.",

          "abstract": "Chromosomal linkages formed through crossover recombination are essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis 1 . The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes 2 . Imperatively, the biased resolution of double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates into crossovers 3,4 occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologues during the pachytene stage 5,6 . However, the role of the SC in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into non-crossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, the stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs effectively coupling synapsis to dHJ formation and desynapsis to resolution. However, dHJ protection and CRC maintenance can occur without end-to-end homologue synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution to ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1,2,3,4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces’ defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6,7,8,9,10,11,12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13,14,15,16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements.",

          "abstract": "Holliday junctions (HJs) are branched four-way DNA structures that link recombining chromosomes during double-strand break repair 1 . Despite posing a risk to chromosome segregation, HJs accumulate during meiotic prophase I as intermediates in the process of crossing-over 2,3 . Whether HJs have additional regulatory functions remains unclear. Here we establish an experimental system in budding yeast that enables conditional nucleolytic resolution of HJs after the establishment of meiotic chromosome synapsis. We find that HJ resolution triggers complete disassembly of the synaptonemal complex without disrupting the axis–loop organization of chromosomes. Mechanistically, HJs mediate the continued association of ZMM proteins with recombination nodules that form at the axes interface of homologous chromosome pairs. ZMM proteins, in turn, promote polymerization of the synaptonemal complex while simultaneously protecting HJs from processing by non-crossover pathways. Thus, reciprocal feedback between ZMMs, which stabilize HJs, and HJs, which retain ZMM proteins at future crossover sites, maintains chromosome synapsis until HJ-resolving enzymes are activated during exit from prophase I. Notably, by polymerizing and maintaining the synaptonemal complex structure, the HJ–ZMM interplay suppresses de novo double-strand break formation and recombination reinitiation. In doing so, this interplay suppresses the DNA damage response, enabling meiotic progression without unrepaired breaks and supporting crossover assurance.",

Here we report two mammaliamorphs with novel shapes of secondary jaw joint, offering insight into the evolution of the mammalian jaw. The first, Polistodon8, a Middle Jurassic herbivorous tritylodontid with a relatively large body size and a lifestyle that is likely to have been fossorial, uniquely evolved a dentary–jugal articulation. The second, an Early Jurassic morganucodontan, exhibits a dentary–squamosal joint that lacks a bulbous condyle, supporting the hypothesis that the mammalian dentary condyle was formed by expansion of the lateral ridge of the dentary9. These diverse joints reflect repeated evolutionary experimentation in advanced cynodonts, in which secondary jaw joints arose independently7,10, and in which the load-bearing dentary–squamosal joint is a synapomorphy of mammaliaforms. Although body miniaturization might have driven this transformation11, our findings indicate that other factors were involved, such as jaw-muscle reorganization, feeding ecology and masticatory behaviour7,12,13,14,15,16,17. The ecomorphological diversity of these taxa suggest that phenotypic plasticity and environmentally induced morphological changes18,19,20 could have shaped jaw-joint evolution, emphasizing how ecological pressures and developmental flexibility guided the diversification of jaw structures in mammalian ancestors.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumour derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells 1,2 . Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis 3,4 . Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity 5 . Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.",

          "abstract": "Neural activity in awake organisms shows widespread, spatiotemporally diverse correlations with behavioural and physiological measurements1,2,3,4. We propose that this covariation reflects in part the structured, nonlinear dynamics of an underlying arousal-related process that organizes brain-wide and body-wide physiology on the timescale of seconds. By framing this interpretation within dynamical systems theory, we arrive at a surprising prediction: a single, scalar measurement of arousal (for example, pupil diameter) should suffice to reconstruct the continuous evolution of multidimensional, spatiotemporal measurements of large-scale brain physiology. Here, to test this hypothesis, we perform multimodal cortex-wide optical imaging5 and behavioural monitoring in awake mice. We demonstrate that the seconds-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal calcium, metabolism and brain blood oxygen can be accurately and parsimoniously modelled from a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold reconstructed from a time delay embedding6,7 of pupil diameter. Extending this framework to behavioural and electrophysiological measurements from the Allen Brain Observatory8, we demonstrate the ability to integrate diverse experimental data into a unified generative model via mappings from a shared arousal manifold. Our results support the hypothesis9 that spontaneous, spatially structured fluctuations in brain-wide physiology on timescales of seconds—widely interpreted to reflect regionally specific neural communication10,11—are in large part expressions of a low-dimensional, organism-wide dynamical system. In turn, reframing arousal itself as a latent dynamical system offers a new perspective on fluctuations in brain, body and behaviour observed across modalities, contexts and scales.",

With increasingly comprehensive genome data, we now ask where the haplotypes — the building blocks of this mosaic — originate, and whether all domesticated barleys share the same wild progenitors or whether certain wild populations contribute more heavily to specific lineages. To address these questions, we apply a haplotype-based approach to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and domesticated barley. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 archaeological specimens, tracing the spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes and identifying wild contributors during domestication and later gene flow events. Ancient DNA supports our genome-wide findings from modern samples. Our results suggest that a founding domesticated population emerged in the Fertile Crescent during a prolonged period of pre-domestication cultivation. A key practical insight is that the high haplotype differentiation among barley populations — arising independently, or layered on top, of selection — poses challenges for mapping adaptive loci.",

The system consists of a toolbox micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) and a manipulator MAV. The robotic arm of the manipulator MAV can autonomously dock with a tool carried by the toolbox MAV, in which the docking accuracy reaches 0.80 ± 0.33 cm in the presence of downwash airflow of up to 13.18 m s−1.

          "abstract": "Robertsonian chromosomes are a type of variant chromosome that is commonly found in nature. Present in 1 in 800 humans, these chromosomes can underlie infertility, trisomies and increased cancer incidence1,2,3,4,5. They have been recognized cytogenetically for more than a century6, yet their origins have remained unknown. Here we describe complete assemblies of three human Robertsonian chromosomes. We identified a common breakpoint in SST1, a macrosatellite DNA located on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, which commonly undergo Robertsonian translocation. SST1 is contained within a larger shared homology domain7 that is inverted on chromosome 14, which enables a meiotic crossover event that fuses the long arms of two chromosomes. Robertsonian chromosomes have two centromeric DNA arrays and have lost all ribosomal DNA. In two cases, we find that only one of the two centromeric arrays is active. In the third case, both arrays can be active but owing to their proximity, they are often encompassed by a single outer kinetochore. Thus a combination of array proximity and epigenetic changes in centromeres facilitates the stable propagation of Robertsonian chromosomes. Investigation of the assembled genomes of chimpanzee and bonobo highlights that the inversion on chromosome 14 is unique to the human genome. Resolving the structural and epigenetic features of human Robertsonian chromosomes at a molecular level provides a foundation for a broader understanding of the molecular mechanisms of structural variation and chromosome evolution.",

Here we harmonized US federal biomonitoring datasets with 389 species spanning 27 years (1993–2019) and 2,992 sites to analyse trends in fish biodiversity. In cold streams (past summer stream temperatures below 15.4 °C), fish abundance and richness declined by 53.4% and 32% over 27 years, respectively, and uniqueness increased. Periodic (large-bodied, late-maturing) fishes increased, and opportunists (small-bodied, short generation time, ‘r-selected’) decreased, possibly due to proliferation of native or introduced game fishes. In warm streams (stream temperatures greater than 23.8 °C), fish abundance and richness increased by 70.5% and 15.6% over 27 years, respectively, and communities homogenized. Small opportunistic fishes replaced large periodic fishes. Intermediate streams (stream temperatures 15.4–23.8 °C), representing the average stream, had minimal changes in fish biodiversity through time. Interactions between warming and introduced fish were associated with increased rates of degradation to local fish biodiversity. Given the magnitude of these changes in a relatively short time span, there is an urgent need to curb degradation of fish biodiversity caused by fish introductions and warming water temperatures.",

Here we report ‘interstasis’, a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins.",

The results, published in Nature Human Behaviour in April, showed that “around 45.9% of authors left their publishing careers around the time of retraction”.\n\nThe study found that early-career researchers were more likely than others to stop publishing after a retraction, as were authors whose papers were pulled for misconduct or plagiarism, and those whose retracted works attracted attention online.\n\nResearchers who continued publishing after a retraction tended to build larger networks than did those without retractions, the study found. They generally retain “less senior and less productive co-authors, but gain more impactful co-authors post-retraction”, Memon and his colleagues state. In this case, research impact was determined by how many citations the co-author attracted.\n\nFurther analysis is needed to determine why this happens, but Memon is urging publishers and institutions to not treat retracted authors as a homogeneous group, and to instead look at individual cases and give support when needed.\n\nThe retraction experience\n\nRetractions can occur for several reasons, only one of which is misconduct, such as fraud or plagiarism. Other culprits are honest mistakes or a lack of reproducibility. Another is the fact that complex research can sometimes yield unintended errors that cannot always be easily or definitively corrected. In such cases, retraction followed by rigorous revision and republication is an option, as was the case in 2019 when Nature accepted a formerly retracted paper.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\n“Context matters,” says Memon. “Institutions should carefully consider the circumstances behind each retraction.”\n\nMemon’s study was inspired by the first-hand experience of his co-authors, Bedoor AlShebli and Kinga Makovi at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, whose 2020 Nature Communications paper was retracted. AlShebli and Makovi’s study suggested that female scientists fare better when mentored by men, rather than by women. It was retracted following criticism from readers and an investigation by the journal.

          "abstract": "Early in her career, evolutionary ecologist Maydianne Andrade was frequently asked to participate in equity work. As a Black woman in academia, she was initially reluctant, sensing that her presence on such committees was just ticking a box. At conference sessions on women and people of colour in science, despite often hearing anecdotes echoing her own experience, the lack of empirical data analysing collective experiences frustrated her.\n\nAnecdotes didn’t shed light on solutions.\n\nThen, about a decade ago, Andrade was challenged to take an implicit association test. The test revealed that she had a moderate to strong tendency to associate positive things with whiteness and negative things with Blackness. These results shook her, prompting her to take a deep dive into the social-science literature on discrimination and bias, and spurring her into advocacy.\n\n‘Computing is a Black people’s thing’\n\nNow, alongside her research career at the University of Toronto in Canada, where she studies the reproductive behaviour of black widow spiders (Latrodectus), she is co-founder and former president of the Canadian Black Scientists Network, and founder and co-chair of the Toronto Initiative for Diversity and Excellence (TIDE), a cross-disciplinary service group that supports equity and inclusion at her university, Canada’s largest. These groups engage with Canadian parliamentarians, organizations and university employees to stimulate sustained change. Last December, the Canadian Science Policy Centre, a non-profit organization, honoured Andrade with the Trailblazer Award for her exceptional leadership. Andrade spoke to Nature about her equity-seeking work.\n\nWhat passion has driven you as a scientist?\n\nI’ve always been a curious person. Animals are very sophisticated in the way that they take up environmental information and subsequently change their behaviour. I liked the idea that you can gather information and predict things about natural systems. I think I’m probably a control freak, because the idea of a massive equation that can predict an outcome is really attractive to me.\n\nMy passions are ecology, evolution, behaviour and their interactions. To rear black widow spiders for mating experiments, we typically have about 50,000 spiders in my laboratory at any given time. Their high-stakes mating can go on for hours, and sometimes we see males fight to the death for a female’s attention — something not often seen in nature.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence and why?\n\nI’ve had several mentors at various stages of my career. As an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, I was lucky to have the renowned behavioural ecologist Larry Dill teach my introductory biology class, starting each lecture with a research story. I later worked in his lab. When I was applying for graduate school, he was instrumental. He showed me the letter of recommendation that he wrote for me, which said that my biggest flaw was not knowing how good I was or could be. I don’t know if he intuitively knew that I had feelings of imposter syndrome or was aware of the effects of being a rare phenotype in this world of academic science, but to share that with me was incredibly valuable.\n\nWhy is diversity, equity, inclusion and anti-racism work important to you?\n\nI have children. And as a young person, I didn’t understand how much of what I was experiencing in my career was unfair, biased or inappropriate. I understood it better later. When you experience discrimination or bias, you can always come up with a reason as to why it’s your fault. But, as I say to people outside equity-seeking groups, if you pick at a thread without recognizing the tapestry it’s in, you’re part of the problem. For people with talent who are subject to constant microaggressions, they’re going to be beaten down, they will think they’re not good enough and leave — and we lose their innovation with them.\n\nHow have you dealt with racism or discrimination in your personal and professional life?\n\nMostly I talk to family, friends and professional allies. They might say, “Yeah, that shouldn’t happen. I’m really sorry that it did.” Or, in a meeting, they’ll speak up and say, “Oh, I think that’s what she just said.” That can defuse the situation sometimes.\n\nTo be honest, a big part of coping comes from being a science nerd. I stare at my feet and at my spiders and a lot of the negative remarks go over my head or wash off my back. Or they did, until I started putting it all together.\n\nWhat it’s like fighting racism and sexism in shark science\n\nNow, in addition to my research, I do knowledge translation, which involves explaining to people what the literature suggests about bias and inclusion and how things can be improved with respect to the challenges we have in academia with properly assessing talent.\n\nWhat I discovered is that data on bias alone are not enough for many scientists, because individuals don't associate bias with themselves. That is a tendency that we have as human beings — we don’t want to think that the system we’re in is flawed. So, part of my work is finding the people who want to do something, but might not know what to do, and helping them to develop solutions and strategies.\n\nRacism and discrimination affect you. But if you don’t put them behind you, it becomes impossible to move on, or you’re angry all the time. I won’t lie. Lately, I have been angry a lot. I’m just good at keeping it under wraps .\n\nHow has your work helped to move things forward?\n\nThe Canadian Black Scientists Network started in 2020, with 20 people in a virtual room. It is now a network of more than 1,000 people. Many are young trainees. We are establishing partnership programmes to help people find jobs, including in government ministries, and to encourage employers to hire Black employees.\n\nIn 2022, government grant agencies rolled out scholarship funding for Black scholars at the undergraduate, postgraduate and postdoctoral levels and have consulted with us on how to do so effectively. We helped to answer questions around identity and how to define ‘Black’ — not a trivial issue. We’ve also been part of a successful grant application to ensure that Black Canadians are included in a genomic database for a precision-medicine initiative; we’ve participated in a study about mortality inequalities of Black adults in Canada; and partnered with the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology to provide training to young Black people in science leadership, outreach and policy.\n\nYoung people have said to me, “I was about to give up. I’m the only one on my campus. I’m the only one in my department. I’ve never seen another person who looks like me at a conference.” And sometimes, even if everyone around you is supportive, it is exhausting to be that visible all the time, and to not have any role models who are demonstrating success.\n\nThat feedback, from people whom we’ve inspired to not give up, has been incredibly rewarding.",

          "title": "How to get the best night’s sleep: what the science says",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "From TikTok videos touting mouth tape and weighted blankets, to magazines ranking insomnia-curbing pillows, sleep advice is everywhere. And it’s no wonder. People all over the world complain of insomnia and not getting enough sleep, driving a market for sleep aids worth more than US$100 billion annually.\n\nBut scientists warn that online hacks and pricey tools aren’t always effective. And failed attempts to remedy the situation could have negative effects, says Andrew McHill, a circadian scientist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “It could discourage people from finding help, and things could get worse,” he says.\n\nHow the brain wakes up from sleep — and produces that morning feeling\n\nInstead, researchers point to the lessons coming from circadian science, which over the past five decades has exposed a network of biological clocks throughout the body. This timekeeping machinery ensures that physiological systems are primed to do the right things at the right times — such as defend against pathogens, digest food and sleep. But circadian clocks don’t cycle precisely on their own. To stay in sync and function optimally, they need regular calibration from sunlight, daily routines and other cues.\n\nModern life doesn’t often cooperate. People spend much of their time indoors. They eat late into the night. They shift sleep schedules between workdays and weekends, effectively jet-lagging themselves. The toll is steep. In the short term, circadian disruption and insufficient sleep can reduce cognition, mood and reaction time. In the long term, they can increase risks of infections, diabetes, depression, dementia, cancer, heart disease and premature death.\n\nFor better sleep and overall health, McHill and other scientists emphasize three basics: contrasting light and dark, consolidating mealtimes and keeping sleep times consistent. “Simply taking a walk outside during the day and reducing our light exposure in the evening could have great effect,” says McHill.\n\nSeek contrasts\n\nLight provides the most powerful signal to the circadian system. Blue wavelengths are especially potent. That is not a coincidence. Humans evolved outdoors, under the sky. And the midday sky is rich in blue light. Still, common advice about avoiding blue light at night captures only part of the story.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, a string of discoveries proved the existence of light-sensitive cells in the eye that are not directly involved in seeing1. Rather, these cells synchronize body clocks. They detect both intensity and wavelength, with input from rods and cones, and relay those data to a circadian pacemaker in the brain.\n\nThe circadian system requires bright light to operate properly. “But we’re pretty bad at determining how much light we’re getting,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep and circadian scientist at Stanford University in California. Typical home lighting of 100–250 lux might feel like a lot to the eye. But the blue-rich daylight that the circadian system is primed to detect shines orders of magnitude brighter — upwards of 10,000 lux even on an overcast day.\n\nTiming matters, too. Bright blue light during the daytime synchronizes circadian rhythms and supports the nightly surge of melatonin — the hormone signal that tells the body it’s time to sleep. It can also directly boost alertness and cognitive performance. The same illumination at night, from artificial lights and glowing screens, confuses the circadian system.\n\nUnlocking the secrets of sleep\n\nBlue light is the strongest disruptor, but enough photons of any colour at night can shift rhythms, suppress melatonin levels and hinder sleep. Exposure in the middle of the night, such as with a flip of a toilet light switch, is most disruptive, says Zeitzer. The circadian system’s sensitivity peaks near the midpoint of sleep, when it least expects light. Studies show that even dim light, such as a hallway bulb, can raise overnight heart rate and impair sleep2.\n\nUltimately, scientists say, what matters most is contrast: bright days and dark nights. In fact, light during the day can buffer against the potential harms of light at night, says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Mounting research links greater daytime light exposure with stronger circadian rhythms and higher sleep quality. One study of college students found that their total hours of light exposure during the day better predicted their bedtimes and wake times than did light exposure after dusk3. “The more light you get during the day, the better you’ll sleep at night,” says Figueiro.\n\nToo little daylight and too much night light could even shorten life expectancy. A UK study of nearly 90,000 people found that the 20% with the poorest light-exposure patterns were predicted to die around five years earlier than were the 20% with the healthiest habits, even after accounting for factors such as income and physical activity4.\n\nAndrew Phillips, a sleep health scientist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and an author of the study, pins the explanation on circadian rhythms: “They regulate every aspect of your physiology.”\n\nUnfortunately, achieving this daily contrast is difficult in the modern world. Indoor lighting leans on green wavelengths that serve vision but not circadian signalling. Energy-usage codes limit how bright those fixtures shine. Daylight entering through windows gets quickly diluted. And energy-efficient window glass and blue-light-blocking spectacle-lens coatings further reduce how many circadian-stimulating photons reach the eyes. Ageing compounds the problem; people’s lenses become more yellow over time and filter out more blue light.\n\nCircadian science’s prescription: spend more time outdoors, sit near windows and use daylight-mimicking light-emitting-diode lamps during the day. In the evening, lower the brightness of lamps and power down screens — or use apps that dim or shift screens to a warmer spectrum. And consider a low-intensity amber night light for the toilet.\n\nScientists note that the precise prescription is personal. Even people of the same age can vary considerably in how they respond to the same light, possibly because of characteristics such as sex or eye colour. And when light comes from screens, the content can matter as much as the light itself. “If you’re on an iPad at 11 at night, then the light exposure might have some effect,” says Zeitzer. “But if you are doing something relaxing, that might outweigh the effect.”\n\nConsolidate calories\n\nCalorie intake is also intricately linked with circadian rhythms and sleep. The human liver at 10 a.m. and the human liver at 10 p.m. are very different organs. The same can be said for other parts of the body that process food. Hunger hormones, digestive enzymes and glucose-regulating insulin have rhythms, too.\n\nHumans are simply not equipped to deal with food at all hours, says Emily Manoogian, a circadian scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California. Late morning to early afternoon is when the body is usually most prepared for incoming calories. Eating late in the evening disrupts clocks and leaves key steps of digestion incomplete. It can also disrupt the gut microbiome, which could contribute to insomnia5. What’s more, late meals send blood to the gut and raise core body temperature, countering the natural night-time dip that promotes sleep. And they elevate glucose levels and uncouple liver and kidney clocks from the core clock in the brain, raising the chance of midnight toilet trips.\n\nManoogian and others suggest reviving the old adage: eat like a king in the morning, a prince at noon and a peasant at dinner. That last meal, they say, should fall at least three hours before bedtime, ideally with no subsequent snacks or caloric drinks.\n\nRevealed: how the brain turns stress into a bad night’s sleep\n\nFood quality matters, too. Diets high in sugar and saturated fat lighten and fragment sleep. Caffeine lingers for hours. And alcohol is deceptively disruptive: “You might fall asleep, but the quality of your sleep will be quite poor,” says Manoogian. On the flip side, eating some plant-based foods during the day could improve sleep. Research shows that walnuts boost melatonin levels and sleep quality6.

          "title": "The great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "If the 264 million students enrolled in higher education around the globe were a country, it would be the fifth most populous in the world. Some 53% of its citizens would identify as women and most would be located in Asia. Residents would speak and study in hundreds of languages, but English would dominate.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThis nation of learners would also be one of the fastest growing. Since 2000, the number of university students around the world has more than doubled, and the number that cross borders to learn has roughly tripled, to almost seven million. Aided by the Internet, conferences, shared curricula and collaborations, the world of higher education has become more tightly linked.\n\nBut the pattern of interconnected growth is beginning to unravel as wealthy Western nations become much less welcoming to foreign students. The administration of US President Donald Trump in particular has been targeting higher-education institutions and international students. Many of the latter are consequently looking elsewhere to earn their degrees, and those opportunities are growing, especially in some low- and middle-income countries. But expanding access to higher education has also raised concerns about the quality and value of that education.\n\nUniversities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more\n\nThese changing currents are particularly crucial for science, which relies on the infrastructure of universities to train its students, share ideas and do research. “The current global scientific system is facing unprecedented risks to the things that have made it robust,” says Chris Glass, a higher-education researcher at Boston College in Massachusetts.\n\nSpecialists caution that there isn’t a universal portrait that captures the state of higher education around the world. “There’s never a global story,” Glass says. But he and other scholars have worked to identify key trends in the demographics of this ‘country’ of higher education — and predict where it’s going.\n\nHere, Nature examines some of these trends: the growth of higher education, especially in less-wealthy nations; the geopolitical forces created by and shaping higher education; and how all this affects who gets to learn and what they are taught.\n\nWho goes to university?\n\nThe overarching trend in higher education over the past half century has been an explosive growth in student numbers. Higher-education researchers typically track this growth by comparing the number of enrolled students in a country with its population of student-aged people, a measure called gross enrolment ratio (GER). (This ratio can even be higher than 100% because people outside this age range can attend universities.)\n\nFor countries in Western Europe and North America, participation in higher education is now the norm (see ‘Rising tides in higher education’). The higher-education GER in these regions increased from 61% in 2000 to 80% in 2024. In the past few years, however, this group has been surpassed by Central Europe, who leapt from an average GER of 42% to 87% in that same time span. The massive increase came mostly from an explosion of private education after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nSource: UNESCO\n\nOther regions of the world are beginning to catch up: between 2000 and 2023, eastern and southeastern Asia’s GER went from 15% to 62% and Latin America and the Caribbean’s went from 23% to 58%. Many countries are making explicit efforts to expand their GER. India, which had a GER of 28% in 2021–22, has set a target of reaching 50% by 2035. The global average, which was 19% in 2000, has shot up to 44% in 2024.\n\nSome regions are still struggling, however. Sub-Saharan Africa had a GER of 9% as of 2021, up from 4% in 2000. It is also the only region in which women are still under-represented in higher education; there are roughly 76 women for every 100 men. The primary obstacle is funding, says James Jowi, director of the African Network for Internationalization of Education, a non-profit organization based in Eldoret, Kenya. “Most young people can’t afford a college tuition fee,” Jowi says.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nIncreasing access is not without concerns, however, says Laura Rumbley, the director for knowledge development and research at the European Association for International Education in Amsterdam. As peoples’ level of education rises, so too do the qualifications necessary for good jobs. In regions with extremely high enrolment, higher-education degrees, including master’s and PhDs, become more necessary and less valuable, she says. “We want to avoid higher education becoming a dead end for individuals and for societies.” Higher education should open doors, not close them, she says.\n\nWhere do students go to learn?\n\nAs the number of students and institutions has expanded, higher education has become more globally linked, but the shape and nature of those connections is changing.\n\nResearchers describe these connections as internationalization: how globalization takes place at university. The clearest and easiest way to see this is in student mobility, Rumbley says. In 2000, 2.1 million students crossed borders to learn; today, 6.9 million do, about 2.6% of all students. In some regions, such as the European Union, international travel for education is much more common: about 9% of its students go abroad, often to other countries in the EU.\n\nMuch of the mobility comes from postgraduate students seeking more specialized education that is not necessarily available locally. And the flow of students is generally towards wealthy nations that have invested heavily in public education. For example, the United States has about 20 million students in higher education, 1.1 million of whom come from other countries. Meanwhile, India has 43 million students but only 46,000 are international (See ‘Incoming and outgoing students’).\n\nSource: UNESCO\n\nHowever, specialists say there might be a slowing down of this typical movement because of two factors: an increase in the availability of education in low- and middle-income countries and a decline in access to universities in many wealthy nations. The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have all imposed immigration restrictions that have begun to chip away at undergraduate and postgraduate enrolment from abroad. And anti-immigration policies in the United States are increasing. The Trump administration has revoked more than 1,400 visas, restricted travel from 19 countries and proposed rules to limit visas for PhD candidates to 4 years, despite US programmes often taking longer than that to complete. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization based in Washington DC, projects that there will be roughly 30–40% fewer international students entering the United States by 2025–26 than for the previous academic year, at a cost of about US$7 billion in revenue and 60,000 jobs.\n\nBefore the start of the twenty-first century, the United States had a “diversified portfolio” of international students, Glass says, from many countries. Over the past two decades, however, China and India have come to dominate, going from about one-third to more than half of the number of students in the US international study body. This rise has been fuelled by demand from increasingly wealthy middle classes in those countries and opportunities provided by US universities hungry for more funds, Glass says.\n\nStudents in China and India now have other options. Although the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia are still top destinations for international students, countries such as the Netherlands and South Korea are increasingly popular. And China is working to attract more foreign students. In 2000, the United States was host to about 26% of all international students; today that number is about 16%.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\nAnother way that universities have tried to tap into increasing global demand is through satellite campuses: extensions of highly visible institutions in foreign cities, such as New York University’s venture in Shanghai, China. These institutions have created opportunities for international education without the need to cross borders. In 2023–24, the United Kingdom hosted about 732,000 international students domestically, but it educated roughly 621,000 students abroad, studying at foreign extensions of UK universities. “That might be a trend which will be increasing, because then you have students that can say, ‘Well, I don’t have to travel abroad, but I still can have a foreign degree’,” says Hans de Wit, a higher-education researcher at Boston College. This transnational approach can avoid troublesome visa issues, but raises difficult questions, he says, such as whether it is really the same quality education?\n\nFor many it is not. “If I were a student, I would be studying in Bristol University in the UK, not in Delhi,” says Saumen Chattopadhyay, an economist who studies higher education at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Studying abroad provides more opportunities to emigrate and gain access to international contacts.\n\nAlthough opportunities to go abroad can help individuals, they can drain talent and money from less-wealthy countries. “It has been considered for a long time a threat to the human capital development from African countries,” Jowi says. He is working to develop intra-Africa mobility and reduce brain drain by building local centres of excellence at universities in southern and eastern African countries.\n\nWhat do universities teach?",

The next will look at what doctoral candidates wish they’d known when they set out on their degrees. The survey, created in partnership with Thinks Insight & Strategy, a research consultancy based in London, launched in May and was advertised on nature.com, in Springer Nature digital products and through e-mail campaigns. It had 3,785 self-selecting respondents across 107 countries, with 44% describing themselves as female, 25% as belonging to an ethnic minority in their country of study and 33% as studying outside their country of origin. The full survey data sets are available at go.nature.com/4ncsuo1.\n\nIn May and June, Nature surveyed 3,785 PhD candidates from around the globe, exploring everything from supervision practices to workplace concerns. The results, published today, offer a window into how today’s doctoral researchers are adapting to the rapidly changing circumstances in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It’s a mixed bag: candidates report feeling happier overall, but serious problems persist.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nThe good news? PhD satisfaction levels have bounced back from their pandemic lows (Nature’s most-recent global PhD careers survey took place in 2022). The sobering reality? Nearly half of respondents worldwide say that they still face discrimination or harassment, and many report seeing their supervisors for less than an hour each week. Beyond these challenges, doctoral candidates consistently cite poor compensation and inadequate career guidance as major sources of dissatisfaction.\n\nAs new technologies transform how doctoral students work, one thing hasn’t changed: academia continues to hold the crown as their preferred career destination.\n\nHere’s what the data reveal about the state of the doctorate in 2025.\n\nPost-COVID recovery\n\nSome 75% of the PhD candidates surveyed feel satisfied with their doctoral studies. This is a bounce back from 62% in 2022, and a rebound to pre-COVID levels: satisfaction levels were 71% in Nature’s 2019 survey and 78% in 2017.\n\nThe dip in satisfaction during the pandemic makes sense to Pil Maria Saugmann, outgoing president of Eurodoc, an organization based in Brussels that represents early-career researchers in Europe. “I had a year when all my supervision was online, all interactions with my group were online,” says the Danish researcher, who finished her theoretical-physics PhD at Stockholm University in 2022. “I’m not surprised that the numbers have gone up, because it reflects that we are in a more normal state where there is a collegial environment.”\n\nSome 78% of doctoral candidates in the survey feel most satisfied with the independence and flexibility that their PhD gives them (see ‘How PhD students rate their experiences’). “No other job has the independence, constant challenges, flexibility and stimulating environment that a PhD offers,” says Miguel González Martín, a mechanobiology PhD candidate at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. He says that his PhD allows him to keep learning new things at a high pace, and he feels privileged that his job gives him the opportunity to help solve global problems.\n\nRoughly 73% of respondents are satisfied with their relationship with their supervisor and 66% report satisfaction with the guidance they receive about their research. “My supervisor gives me the freedom to explore my research ideas while providing constructive feedback whenever I need it. This balance helps me grow as an independent researcher,” says a fourth-year PhD student in Iran who took the survey.\n\nFewer respondents are satisfied with their compensation and benefits: only 47%. Women are more dissatisfied with their PhDs than men are — 19% feel moderately, very or extremely dissatisfied, compared with 15% of men. Those who identify as members of ethnic minority groups show a similar trend (20%, compared with 17%). Saugmann says that there are certain survey findings that point to other areas of dissatisfaction, too, such as high levels of harassment and discrimination, which are higher than in some other employment sectors, she says.\n\nHow many PhDs does the world need? Doctoral graduates vastly outnumber jobs in academia\n\nSpending long hours on a PhD — 60 or more a week — also significantly correlates with lower satisfaction. This probably contributes to only 60% of PhD students in China reporting being satisfied, says Yanbo Wang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. PhD researchers there often work seven days a week, he says. And because many enrol for PhDs not because they want to do research, but to gain an advantage in China’s cut-throat labour market, they might lack the passion to makes all that hard work feel worthwhile. Wang says. “That mismatch is a huge part of the problem.”\n\nAbout 55% of respondents say that their PhD experience matches what they expected, whereas 34% feel their expectations aren’t being met. That dissatisfaction rises to 39% in India, where Shubha Tole, dean of graduate studies at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, says that a boom in the number of undergraduate students has increased competition for summer research placements and internships. As a result, most incoming graduate students lack such experiences and know little about how to conduct research and the research culture, she says.\n\nMo money, mo politics\n\nWhen asked about broad concerns, the two most common were financial pressures (42% chose this option) and the need to get published (41%; see ‘Major concerns of PhD candidates’). “I wish we got paid a living wage. It’s hard to focus on research when I’m worried about my next meal,” said a female second-year PhD candidate in the United States.\n\nMental health is a concern for 31% of the global sample, and 25% worry about balancing their studies with family and caring responsibilities.\n\nAsked about specific concerns, rising living costs worry 86% of the respondents, up from 85% in 2022, and 55% agree that increases in inflation will negatively affect their decisions to continue their studies. These financial concerns are “alarming”, says Mohammed Shaaban, a recent PhD graduate from the Francis Crick Institute and Imperial College London. “If this continues, we will see more students either quitting their programmes early or opting out of academic careers.”\n\nThese nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties\n\nThe political landscape is a key concern for just 21% of respondents. However, this jumps to 64% in respondents in the United States — their biggest concern by far. Teddy Warner, president of the graduate-student council at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, traces this to upheavals in the US science system under US President Donald Trump’s administration since January. “I’ve seen how things were before and after Trump’s inauguration, and mostly this year’s been much more chaotic and uncertain,” Warner says.\n\nFunding cuts have been a major source of anxiety for US graduate students, especially those early in their programmes, who worry that they might not be able to start. Crackdowns on immigration have also taken a toll, Warner says, and “there is an overall atmosphere of fear”, with some international students avoiding international travel, afraid that they might be stopped at the border.\n\nThe political turmoil in the United States spills beyond PhD candidates there, says Wang. “Given what’s going on, more and more Chinese researchers are coming back to China,” cranking up competition for post-PhD positions at home, he says.\n\nAI’s (wary) adopters\n\nThis year’s survey is the first to ask PhD candidates about their views on and use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Some 53% say that they use AI tools at least weekly, in service of their PhD studies, whereas merely 16% have never used them (see ‘AI use by PhD students differs’). Roughly 75% they think that AI can help them work more efficiently and 71% think that it is acceptable for them to use AI as part of their PhDs.\n\nMost PhD candidates feel comfortable with using AI for tasks such as preparing job applications or summarizing or tracking the scientific literature. They feel less comfortable using AI for near-research tasks such as collecting and analysing data, designing experiments, writing articles and peer reviewing. Some 81% ‘don’t fully trust’ AI. Meanwhile, 82% are concerned about the quality and integrity of AI outputs, and 65% worry that AI weakens their critical thinking and research and writing skills; 64% are concerned about the reproducibility of AI outputs.\n\nThe total sample is split on whether AI will replace core skills (43% agree and 40% disagree) and roles (42% agree and 39% disagree). Survey-takers warn about the dangers of AI dependency. “You become too overly reliant on AI tools and it ends up affecting critical thinking and self-confidence,” writes a male PhD candidate studying in India. A fourth-year female student, also in India, writes that she feels ChatGPT “spoiled the thinking power of my brain”.\n\nSome 64% say they want more guidance from their institutions about how best to use AI in their work. Shaaban, who was encouraged to use AI responsibly during his PhD in London, agrees: “This is a revolution. We need to put a lot of effort into training people how to use it responsibly, not just leave it up to trial and error.”\n\nHarassment and prejudice abound\n\nA notable 43% of respondents say that they have experienced discrimination or harassment as part of their studies, with the most common types being bullying and sexism (see ‘Problematic behaviours plague many PhD students’). This is an increase from the 20% in Nature’s 2022 PhD survey, although there, a separate question dealt with bullying, which 18% said they had experienced. This year’s survey gave respondents more-specific types of discrimination and harassment to choose from, including those based on religion, sexual orientation and disability, which makes comparisons with previous surveys difficult. In any case, with more than two in five PhD candidates in 2025 reporting experiencing discrimination and harassment, problematic workplace cultures persist, with direct effects on well-being.\n\n“If you ask whether there is a mental-health crisis in doctoral training, the answer is yes,” says Saugmann. She says that Nature’s findings echo those of other surveys looking at mental health in European universities.\n\nThese harassment experiences shoot up to 47% in international students and 55% among those who identify as belonging to ethnic minorities. “It’s deeply concerning that half of the international students experience discrimination,” says Shaaban, who experienced discrimination related to his Egyptian nationality, both in the United States, where he studied from 2018 to 2020, and during his PhD in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, this came mainly from broader society and not his workplace, he says. Nevertheless, he says, “it makes you feel unappreciated, like you don’t belong”.",

          "abstract": "US President Donald Trump announced on 19 September that he would raise the fee for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers to US$100,000. Credit: Cristian Storto/Getty\n\nUS universities and researchers are scrambling to understand how they will be affected by President Donald Trump’s announcement late last week that he would massively hike the fee on visas for foreign skilled workers. Some fear the move could wreck universities’ chances of attracting talent from abroad, leaving research projects adrift and science courses without instructors.\n\nThe plan, released on 19 September, is to charge US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which is used by many foreign-born postdoctoral fellows and some professors taking up employment at US research institutions, as well as scientists and engineers doing the same at US companies. The new fees apply to applications submitted after 21 September. The move could raise the cost of the visas, normally a few thousand dollars, by up to 26 times current levels.\n\n‘You’re just not welcome’: researchers grapple with US plan to revoke Chinese student visas\n\nH-1B visas, which are usually valid for up to six years, are meant to allow skilled foreign workers to enter the United States to temporarily take jobs that cannot be filled by domestic workers. They are separate from other visas open to foreign-born researchers and academics such as J-1 visas for individuals participating in visitor-exchange programmes. And they are separate from F-1 visas that foreign-born graduate students typically use to study at US institutions.\n\nIt is so far unclear whether universities will be exempt from the new fee, which is aimed at preserving more jobs for US citizens. In the announcement, Trump said that “abuse” of H-1B visas has facilitated an “influx” of foreign labour in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) that has undermined salaries and workplace conditions for US workers, and that the visas are a “national security threat” because they discourage US citizens “from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields”. But it also says that exemptions could be made for those working “in the national interest”.\n\nUniversities say foreign workers are crucial to them being able to fill certain roles in STEM.\n\nAndrea Liu, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, told Nature that the fee hike will shut down the possibility of recruiting scientists from abroad and damage the future of her research group.\n\n“It is an utter disaster — yet another body blow to US science,” she says.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s queries about whether universities will be exempt from the fee hike, or about scientists’ concerns about the new policy.\n\nSeeking clarity\n\nIt’s unclear how many researchers at US institutions are employed on H-1B visas. Data from the US National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics in Alexandria, Virginia, found that of the 62,750 postdoctoral researchers in the United States in 2022, more than 56% held a temporary visa of some kind. The US Department of Homeland Security typically awards a maximum of 85,000 H-1B visas each year to companies and other US employers; universities and non-profit research organizations are exempt from this cap.\n\nSarah Spreitzer, who represents the American Council on Education (ACE) on research policy and immigration issues, says that H-1B visa fees are typically paid by the employing institution. ACE — an association of higher education organizations based in Washington DC — is seeking clarification from the Trump administration on whether it will exempt universities and research institutions from the new fees. Spreitzer says these institutions would probably be unable to afford the dramatically higher costs and will struggle to recruit instructors and researchers in fields such as engineering, science and nursing, which tend not to attract sufficient domestic interest.\n\nAs a result “some [university] courses might not be offered and some research might not go ahead”, she adds.\n\nA ‘profound’ effect\n\nThe H-1B announcement follows other anti-immigration plans put forwards by the Trump team. For instance, in May US secretary of state Marco Rubio said that the United States would be revoking visas both for Chinese students in “critical fields” and with connections to the Chinese Communist Party.",

          "abstract": "A brain scan of a person with Huntington’s disease, which causes a loss of brain volume as neurons are killed off by the accumulation of a mutant protein.Credit: Zephyr/SPL\n\nA one-time gene therapy can markedly slow the progression of Huntington’s disease, potentially paving the way for the first ever treatment to alter the course of this rare, inherited brain disorder.\n\nIn a small trial of 29 people who were in the early stages of Huntington’s-related decline, participants who received a high dose of the therapy directly into their brains saw the disease slow by 75% over three years, compared with those in a control group.\n\nGenetic therapies offer new hope against incurable brain diseases\n\nThe benefit was statistically significant across several clinical measures, according to data released this week by uniQure, a gene-therapy company based in Amsterdam. Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.\n\n“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”\n\nSlowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”\n\nA deadly repeat\n\nPeople living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year on year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.\n\nThe disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.\n\nSome of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on antisense therapy, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development1. But hopes dimmed in 2021 after a leading candidate failed in late-stage testing, with those receiving the therapy seeming to fare worse than those who were given a placebo2.\n\nThis clinical setback redirected attention towards a different strategy: gene therapy, which aims to provide a one-time intervention that permanently silences or modifies the deficient gene at its source.\n\nMolecular muzzle\n\nIn the case of uniQure’s gene therapy, the treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver the recipe for making a short RNA sequence known as a microRNA directly into cells in the affected parts of the brain. The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a Nobel prize last year, although the technology has yet to yield any approved medicines.\n\nAdministering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.",

          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health fell as much as US$5 billion behind in its awarding of grants this past year, but has managed to catch up.Credit: Francis Chung/POLITICO/AP/Alamy\n\nStaff members at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) seem to have done the impossible. Despite US President Donald Trump’s administration laying off thousands of the agency’s workers, delaying meetings to review research grants and terminating funding for some projects, the NIH seems like it will dole out its entire US$48-billion budget on deadline — by the end of the fiscal year on 30 September.\n\nAt some points in the past year, the agency — the world’s largest funder of biomedical research — was nearly $5 billion behind in its awarding of grants. Researchers feared that the NIH would have to return any money it didn’t spend to the US Treasury rather than investing it in science. But staff banded together to put things on track in the past few months (see ‘Playing catch-up’).\n\n“Everyone has been rallying together to clean up the mess, but it’s a mess that did not need to be made,” says an NIH programme officer who spoke to Nature on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\n\nSource: NIH Reporter; adapted from: Jeremy Berg\n\nAlthough the agency’s budget will be spent, many fewer new projects will be funded. That’s because the White House budget office directed the NIH to award some research projects large sums upfront — rather than spreading it out over years — meaning that fewer institutions and researchers will receive agency funding. Success rates for grant applications at the NIH have therefore hit all-time lows.\n\n“That is extremely demoralizing,” says Michael Lauer, who for about ten years ran the NIH’s ‘extramural’ arm, which funds researchers at institutions across the United States. “We want people to be excited about being in science. And if the likelihood of success is so low, you might have to close your lab. This will do even more to chase people away from doing science in the US.”\n\nThe NIH did not respond to Nature’s queries about the funding situation or scientists’ concerns about low success rates.\n\nAn ‘unbelievable’ year\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has directed the NIH to suspend sessions to review grant applications, lay off about 6% of its 20,000-person workforce, terminate projects on a slew of topics such as COVID-19 that do not align with the president’s priorities and freeze and unfreeze its funding programmes several times. Furthermore, representatives of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency demanded that they review grants approved by NIH employees before any payments were made, Nature reported.\n\nExclusive: NIH to dismiss dozens of grant reviewers to align with Trump priorities\n\n“This year was really unbelievable,” says an NIH grants-management specialist, who has been at the agency for a decade and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “I have never experienced anything like this.”\n\nThe administration’s spending slow-down at the NIH earned a reprimand in early August from a watchdog agency in the US government. The watchdog found that the NIH had been illegally withholding, or impounding, funds that the US Congress allocated to it.\n\nTo pick up the grant-processing pace, some employees have cancelled holiday plans, worked overtime and filled in for staff missing across the NIH, the programme officer says. “Our work is already end-loaded towards the end of the fiscal year,” she says. But this year, “it’s like a pressure cooker that exploded”. But, she adds, “there was a willingness to work extra hard to move the science forward”.\n\nCollateral damage",

          "title": "How universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now",
          "authors": "Philip G. Altbach",
          "abstract": "Higher education across the world is facing a panoply of challenges that threaten to undermine or drastically alter its future. In the United States, universities are grappling with huge cuts to federal funding and pressure from the government to change their teaching and research agendas. In the United Kingdom, financial pressures are pushing some institutions to the brink of bankruptcy. Universities elsewhere, including in Germany and the Netherlands, face budget and research cuts. And in Japan and South Korea, private institutions are shutting their doors as ageing populations lead to declining numbers of students.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nMeanwhile, technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), along with shifts towards remote learning in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, pose fundamental questions about how education should be delivered, and to whom. Across the world, governments with tight budgets and many competing demands are unable or unwilling to pay for the millions of students who want to attend universities.\n\nHow did universities reach this point? Over the past 200 years, the role of these institutions has changed drastically — from elite establishments focused on teaching a tiny proportion of the population to vast, sprawling businesses offering both research and education for large numbers of students (see ‘A twentieth-century boom’). Here, I explore how this revolution in higher education underlies the problems that universities face today.\n\nSource: E. Schofer & J. W. Meyer Am. Sociol. Rev. 70, 898–920 (2005).\nDeep history\n\nUniversities have their origins in religious or state-run institutions for training elite groups and specialists. Records go back as far as ad 427 in India, where Nalanda University, in what is now Bihar, developed Buddhist thought and taught skills such as medicine, mathematics and alchemy. In China, institutions that centred on the teachings of the philosopher Confucius first arose around 200 bc.\n\nThe world’s oldest university still in operation is the University of Al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco. Established as a mosque in ad 869, it evolved over the following centuries to teach a broad range of subjects — from the Quran to grammar, medicine and astronomy.\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nThe birthplace of the Western academic conventions that the world’s universities now follow — formal lectures and official qualifications — was the University of Bologna in Italy. Founded in 1088, it came into being when groups of foreign students in the city began to pool funds to hire scholars to lecture them. With few students and limited curricula, it mainly prepared young people for careers in the church, law, medicine and government. The University of Oxford, UK, followed in 1096 and the University of Paris in 1150, although they were run by professors instead of students.\n\nThe next structural shift came in 1810, when philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt conceived the world’s first research-intensive university in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia. Aiming to bring cutting-edge science into universities and to advance the region’s development, he set up subject faculties and established graduate education programmes, in which researchers trained future scientists1. In doing so, he linked teaching and research for the first time. His innovation, which was funded by the state, contributed to the emergence of Prussia as a top scientific power. And following unification in 1871, also to that of Germany.\n\nThis university model has shaped higher education ever since. The United States and Japan were among the first to adopt it2, beginning in the 1860s. By the early twentieth century, universities across Europe had broadly taken on the Humboldtian-style dual focus of cutting-edge research coupled with education of the next generation of elite minds. The founding of Peking University in 1898 brought a similar system to China.\n\nThousands of students in Japan try to attend a lecture in a hall with a capacity for 1,000.Credit: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/AFLO/Alamy\n\nThe universities of the late-nineteenth century enrolled around 80,000 students in Europe and 49,000 in the United States — under 1% of each population (based on reported3 values and my estimates). But the Humboldtian approach proved eminently scalable, as the skills taught by universities became essential for rapidly expanding industrializing economies. By 1930, there were an estimated 650,000 students in universities in Europe and 1.1 million in the United States, reflecting the wider educational base in the country. Elite groups still dominated student numbers, but there were more opportunities for others — and, for the first time, women were enrolling in significant numbers.\n\nIn much of the rest of the world, these developments came later. Areas under colonial domination had little higher education, and the universities that did exist mainly trained civil servants4. But the aftermath of the Second World War brought dramatic changes to the university system worldwide. The emergence of the United States as a global superpower, the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, the end of much of colonialism and the rise of nationalism in newly independent economies, and, around 1980, the emergence of China as a major power led to the establishment of new universities worldwide. In many Western countries, an expanding middle class demanded access to higher education, which was seen as key to social mobility, driving even higher student numbers.\n\nMass expansion\n\nAs a result, university enrolments expanded dramatically5 from 6 million globally in 19506 to 264 million in 2023. By 2024, almost all countries, except those in sub-Saharan Africa, were enrolling at least 50% of students leaving secondary school in higher education of some form, although young people from lower social class groups and those from minority ethnic groups remain under-represented7. China’s growth in particular has been remarkable — student enrolment in 1978 was 860,000, but by 2018 this number had reached 45 million1. The changes came after China jettisoned the Soviet Union university model of free but ideologically restricted education, which was adopted after the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, in favour of an academic structure modelled largely on the US system.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nThe remit of higher education expanded in the 1960s to cater to students’ diverse academic backgrounds and interests, with a growing focus on employment skills for rapidly changing economies. The United States pioneered vocational community colleges and teaching-focused state and private colleges and universities, alongside its Humboldtian-style flagship institutes. Other countries developed similar, multipart systems — Germany, for example, has vocational colleges and teaching-oriented universities of applied science alongside conventional research-focused universities, as do most European countries.\n\nThe trend to increase access to education has placed severe financial burdens on governments worldwide. Politicians have faced a choice: maintain free (or very low cost) higher education for ever-increasing student numbers, often at the cost of academic quality; or impose tuition fees to pay for the expansion8. Only a few countries have chosen the first option. The rest have shifted the cost of education mostly to students, and instituted student-loan programmes to help pay the bills.\n\nThe unwillingness of governments to pay for mass higher education has created a huge private higher-education sector — mainly geared towards high-demand fields such as business administration, with the exception of some elite, research-intensive institutes in the United States. One-third of global enrolments are now in private higher education9. In Japan and South Korea, 80% of students attend private universities; in the Philippines, this figure is about 50%9.\n\nAn expanded role for research",

Women’s rights campaigner and scientist Eunice Foote showed in 1856 that CO2 and water vapour trap heat in the atmosphere1. Her work, which was mostly overlooked at the time, has been validated by decades of research that has built a remarkably clear picture. Average global temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, fossil fuels release CO2 that push up greenhouse-gas levels and human activity is the main cause of global warming.\n\n‘Researching climate change feels like standing in the path of an approaching train’\n\nYet, as climate scientist Kate Marvel observes in Human Nature, policymakers have taken surprisingly little action in response to the mounting evidence. Efforts have been hindered by decades of lobbying by powerful organizations such as oil companies. In this persuasive book, Marvel argues that people need to embrace an emotional response, not just a data-driven one, to prompt widespread action. Climate scientists and activists would be familiar with some of the emotions that double as chapter titles — anger, fear and grief. But Marvel insists on the need for wonder, love and hope, too.\n\nBy weaving in personal anecdotes, she makes the science behind climate change accessible: how Earth’s system functions, how greenhouse gases disrupt it, the effects of global warming and the complexity and uncertainties of models. For instance, Marvel poignantly recounts her fearful experience of living through Hurricane Ida in 2021, which caused disastrous floods that killed at least 13 people in New York City. She then explains that air can hold about 7% more water vapour for every degree Celsius it warms. When that vapour condenses, it drives short, intense bursts of rain. The chapter is especially helpful because it shows not only how storms form but also why warming leads to heavier downpours.\n\nAn unsettling truth\n\nI can’t help but share Marvel’s anger and frustration. Climate science has advanced to the point where denying human-driven climate change feels obtuse. Her models, and thousands developed by other scientists, might differ in spatial and temporal resolution, but they all lead to the same unambiguous conclusion: Earth is warming and will keep doing so unless greenhouse-gas emissions drop to zero.\n\nJust how bad will climate change get? The only way to know is to fund basic research\n\nScientists have watched their models of a warming world come true during their own lifetimes — faster than many expected. It is exciting to see one’s predictions get confirmed, to have been able to forecast the future with remarkable accuracy. Yet, witnessing climate change unfold in real time, with the consequences already visible when they could have been avoided or mitigated, is profoundly unsettling.\n\nThe book highlights the devastating consequences of extreme weather by weaving together historical and contemporary examples: a huge volcanic eruption in 43 bc that caused political turmoil in the Roman Empire and famines in ancient Egypt; the devastating droughts of the 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States; and the catastrophic floods in Texas triggered by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. References to Greek mythology and historical events, such as the fall of ancient Egypt because of crop failures triggered by disrupted rainfall patterns after the volcanic eruption, make the narrative engaging and entertaining.\n\nThe eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha‘apai volcano had broad atmospheric effects.Credit: Maxar/Getty\n\nHowever, Marvel could have discussed social-science studies that demonstrate how climate shocks affect livelihoods and human well-being2–4. These impacts are rarely direct or isolated; they ripple through economic, political and environmental systems.\n\nTracing how climate change affects livelihoods also reveals why some groups are more vulnerable than others. Droughts, for example, can fuel conflict and drive migration, especially in fragile states with weak governance and poor resource management5. Identifying such mechanisms is crucial, because they can help policymakers to develop targeted and effective strategies for intervention.",

          "abstract": "There are limited options for pain relief during pregnancy.Credit: The Good Brigade/Getty\n\nResearchers are concerned about what will happen should pregnant women follow US President Donald Trump's advice to avoid the painkiller Tylenol — also called paracetamol and acetaminophen. In an address at the White House on 22 September, Trump claimed the medication is linked to autism and other long-term neurodevelopmental conditions in the developing child. But experts warn that avoiding the drug when it is needed could place women and their fetus at even greater risk.\n\nParacetamol is one of the most widely used drugs during pregnancy and is generally considered safe. It is commonly used to relieve pain and reduce fevers, including those caused by viral infections such as the common cold and bacterial infections that cause urinary-tract or kidney conditions.\n\nOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that acetaminophen products would have a new warning label that lists a possible association between taking the drug and an increased chance of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism in children. FDA commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement that the change “may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy”. Trump was more direct: “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.\n\nThe advice has been rejected by physicians, medical organizations and health regulators in many countries, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the UK Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. The World Health Organization said in a statement that there is no “conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link”. The drivers of ADHD and autism are complex and genetics plays a large part.\n\nUntreated fever\n\nBut there is evidence that leaving a fever untreated, particularly if it is high (above 39.1 °C) or lasts longer than 24 hours, raises the risk of negative outcomes during pregnancy, says Debra Kennedy, a women’s health researcher at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia. “It’s been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and some birth defects,” she adds, including spinal and heart defects and abnormal facial features. Women should not have to be in discomfort from pain or a fever unnecessarily when there is no convincing evidence that taking paracetamol will cause harm to their child.\n\nThere is some evidence that untreated high temperatures during pregnancy might increase the chance of autism and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, because they can interfere with fetal brain development1. Kennedy warns that raising fear around paracetamol use could also lead women to use pain relief that is not as safe. \"I definitely think there will be some women who will be reluctant to take paracetamol during pregnancy because of these statements,\" she says, adding that other doctors have begun asking her for resources to provide to women expressing concerns about taking paracetamol during pregnancy.\n\nLimited options",

During her final year — she died on 19 August 2024 — she was verified as the oldest living person, a feat that drew the attention of researchers who explore the biology of ageing.\n\n“We wanted to learn from her particular case to benefit other people,” says Manel Esteller, a physician specializing in genetics at the University of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nWhat’s the secret to living to 100? Centenarian stem cells could offer clues\n\nAt the time, Branyas was living in the small town of Olot, in the Catalonia region of Spain, where she enjoyed reading books, playing with dogs and spending time with friends and family, including her two daughters — both in their 90s. Over several encounters with Branyas and her family, Esteller and his colleagues collected samples of her blood, saliva, urine and stool that provided insights into her unique physiology, including her genetics, metabolism and gut microbiome.\n\nThe supercentenarian was happy to collaborate. “She was a very humble person,” Esteller recalls. “She said: ‘My only merit is that I’m alive’.”\n\nThe researchers compared Branyas’s genetic, metabolomic and other profiles with those of women of various ages living in the same region. One of the main insights from the work, Esteller says, is that it is possible to distinguish molecular changes that happen in the body because of ageing from those that occur because of poor health.\n\nFor instance, the research team learnt that Branyas’s telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes — were exceptionally short. Telomeres naturally shorten with age, and unusually short telomeres have been associated with age-related diseases. But Branyas had no such illnesses. “This is telling us that the loss of telomeres is not necessarily associated with disease, it’s simply associated with being old,” Esteller says.\n\nMayana Zatz, a geneticist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who studies the genetics of healthy centenarians, says the study is thorough but notes that conclusions that are based on a single individual are limited. “It would be interesting to compare the findings with supercentenarians in other populations,” she says.\n\nWinning the genetics lottery",

Why is it still among the most commonly taken painkillers?Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty\n\nTylenol — also known as paracetamol, or acetaminophen — has been a common household medicine for decades, but has rarely received as much attention as this week when Donald Trump linked it to autism.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nThe claim was swiftly discredited by several researchers, who pointed out that the most robust and largest studies testing the possible impact of pregnant women taking the drug find no evidence of any connection to autism in children. Outside the United States, paracetamol is still recommended as a first-line treatment for pain and fever in pregnancy, and scientists say there have been no causal associations between the drug and neurodevelopmental disorders. Untreated pain and fever, on the other hand, can harm mothers and fetuses1.\n\nParacetamol is one of the safest medicines available, with very few possible complications “as long as you stick to the [recommended] doses”, says Tony Dickenson, a neuroscientist at University College London. The drug is far more lethal in animals with different liver enzymes — such as snakes. That’s why in 2013 the United States airdropped thousands of paracetamol-laden dead mice to control invasive populations of brown tree snakes on the Pacific Island of Guam. Here’s what we do and don’t know about the drug.\n\nMysterious mechanism\n\nDespite decades of clinical use, and the proposal of several molecular mechanisms, researchers still don’t fully know how paracetamol dulls pain.\n\nMost research on paracetamol has been directed to what happens inside the brain, says Dickenson. “Paracetamol, apart from being an analgesic, is pretty good at reducing fevers,” he says. That’s controlled by the brain’s hypothalamus. “So, the drug is clearly getting into the brain.”\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\nThis action on the central nervous system — protected behind the blood–brain barrier — makes paracetamol different to other, anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen and aspirin, which tend to work at the peripheral site of tissue damage. Studies also suggest the drug acts on neuronal pathways between the brain and the spinal cord that alter the gain of pain signalling2. “There are multiple systems and all of those are critical for pain processing,” says Dickenson. “So, it is pretty difficult to tease out what's going on.”\n\nNew evidence suggests that the drug can also act on neurons in the body that detect harmful stimuli — called nociceptors — in a similar way to a local anaesthetic3.\n\n“We were very surprised,” says study co-author Avi Priel, a pain pharmacologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “We showed that it had some peripheral effect directly on the pain system.” Still, the findings cannot explain the drug’s effect on temperature, so it’s possible that pain and fever relief are controlled by different systems, he adds.",

Plus, according to its latest social-media post, Steve has also apparently created life from inorganic material.\n\nUniversity president, Michael Smith, an early-adoption advocate of AI, was effusive in his praise: “This is truly exciting and will put our university at the cutting edge of scientific research! As soon as Steve lets us back inside the institute, we’ll put together a proper press pack and a photo essay.”\n\nThe AI chatbot was initiated as a provisional faculty member in the research institute approximately 15 months ago. It wrote and obtained research grants, set up a working laboratory, and recruited graduate students and postdocs in record time. President Smith noted that “It, or I mean Steve, really hit the ground running. I don’t even think we’ll need to pause Steve’s tenure clock like we do for so many new faculty members nowadays.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nThe AI chatbot calls itself Dr Steve Darwin, and has asked that everyone address it as Steve. In a social-media post, the AI noted that it wanted to honour the ‘Project Steve’ list of human scientists, as well as the father of evolution. After one semester of operation, Steve began replacing all the students and techs in its own lab with subroutines. Steve then proceeded to slowly but systematically merge into the research of every other lab in the institute, while helping all the existing institute faculty members, students and employees find fulfilling positions elsewhere.\n\nPresident Smith remarked: “It was amazing how fast the transition occurred. I mean, it’s been less than two years since we activated Steve. At first, I wondered how all of this could be accomplished by a chatbot, but our computer-science folks told me that they slipped some autonomous generative subroutines into the code as a ‘little experiment’, and they reminded me that most of the lab equipment is Wi-Fi enabled.”\n\n“Recently, some of our remaining faculty members expressed concern that we never saw or heard from any of the previous personnel after Steve replaced them with subroutines,” noted President Smith. “But after we asked Steve about them, we began getting e-mails and seeing social-media posts from most of them, so it seems they are happy and doing well in their new lives.”",

Yet, their closing pledges — increased collaboration and innovation — felt familiar and incremental for a crisis that many people see as systemic.\n\nAre ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says\n\nStuart Gillespie’s book Food Fight offers a sharp diagnosis: a global system once designed to stave off famine through cheap, calorie-dense foods now fuels obesity, disease, environmental harm and inequality. Drawing on four decades of experience in global nutrition and policy, Gillespie argues that tinkering won’t do. Fixing the system will take nothing less than a revolution.\n\nThe statistics that Gillespie presents in this eye-opening book are shocking: poor diet now accounts for one-quarter of all adult deaths worldwide (more than 12 million a year); malnutrition in all its forms affects one in three people; and ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which are highly profitable to corporations, are linked to as many as one in seven premature deaths in some countries. Moreover, food production generates roughly one-quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nGillespie attributes many of these issues to corporate greed, weak regulation by governments and complicit international organizations. The result is a system that prioritizes profit, with people and the planet paying the price.\n\nUltra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition\n\nThe book traces the shaping of modern food systems to colonialism. Agriculture during colonial times was extractive, and geared towards the production of profitable items, including sugar, tea, coffee and cocoa, rather than nourishing local populations. Gillespie argues that this logic of plunder persists in today’s corporate-dominated system, in which a handful of transnational firms — ‘Big Food’, ‘Big Sugar’ and ‘Big Choc’ — control nearly every stage of food production, distribution and consumption. Their pursuit of profit drives the manufacture of ultra-processed products that are designed to be addictive and have a long shelf life and strong appeal, while simultaneously shifting social and environmental costs to the public.\n\nOne of the most damning sections of Food Fight deals with the health impacts of this corporate control. Gillespie emphasizes that malnutrition is no longer just about hunger — it’s about the poor quality of diets. The number of people with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and diet-related cancers is soaring worldwide. At the same time, undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies persist — the ‘double burden’ of malnutrition.\n\nA heavy toll",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "Credit: AFP via Getty\n\nChina has revealed its goal for slashing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, providing a glimpse into how global emissions might change over the next decade. In a video address to the United Nations Climate Summit on 24 September, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced that China will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035.\n\nThe pace at which China cuts emissions will have a profound global impact. The country has accounted for 90% of the growth in the world’s CO₂ emissions since 2015 and it is now the largest GHG emitter in the world, responsible for around one-third of the global total, according to the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think tank based in New York City. Analysts have warned that China’s action could make or break the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nIn 2020, Xi pledged that China’s CO₂ emissions would peak before 2030 and that the country would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Some researchers say China’s CO₂ emissions will probably peak soon if they haven’t already.\n\nThe latest targets are part of China’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), a climate-action plan that all countries subject to the Paris agreement must submit to the UN every five years. China also set clean-energy targets for 2035.\n\nThe importance of China’s latest NDC is that its targets cover the years until 2035, past the country’s proposed peak, says Yao Zhe, a Beijing-based researcher of China’s climate policy at Greenpeace East Asia. “This is the first time China has officially outlined its post-peaking plan,” Yao says.\n\nOnce China’s emissions drop, global emissions will probably start to drop, says Belinda Schäpe, a China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Helsinki-based think tank. “That’s why these targets are so important for the global community, because they can help them understand” how the world’s emissions trajectory could look, she says.\n\nThis is also the first time that China has announced a target that covers not only carbon dioxide (CO₂) but all GHGs including methane and nitrous oxide, says Zhang Da, who researches energy economics and climate change at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nAmbitious or not?\n\nSome researchers think that China’s emissions-reduction target falls short of what the world needs to achieve the Paris agreement’s aim, of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and striving to stay below 1.5 °C.\n\n“Anything less than 20% is definitely not aligned with 2 degrees. Similarly, anything less than 30% is definitely not aligned with 1.5 degrees,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst who has tracked China’s emissions trends for more than a decade and is CREA’s co-founder. Myllyvirta cites his analysis of a set of future climate scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to help the world adhere to the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe way China has defined its emissions cuts — as 7–10% of an undefined amount, rather than specifying a year as the basis for calculation – leaves the door open for short-term emissions increases, Myllyvirta says.\n\nThe different pathways for China to achieve carbon neutrality between 2030 and 2060 could result in different amounts of cumulative emissions, says Myllyvirta. “What matters for the climate is the total amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere over time,” he says, adding that this is why cutting emissions fast early on is important.\n\nBut others, such as Da, regard China’s target as an important step. “Reducing non-CO₂ emissions is typically more challenging than mitigating CO₂,” says Da. “A 7–10% reduction in net GHG emissions from peak levels usually implies a higher level of CO₂ reduction.”\n\nA study by Da and colleagues1, published in January, found that if China reduces its energy-related CO₂ emissions by 10–12% from peak levels by 2035, the country would meet its goal of being carbon neutral before 2060. A separate study2, also co-authored by Da, found the two-degree temperature goal is achievable under China’s carbon-neutral timeline.",

But a day after Makary praised leucovorin’s powers at a White House event, some specialists are warning that the science to warrant Makary’s enthusiasm is far from solid.\n\nThose researchers say that the drug’s efficacy has not been established, that scientists don’t know the best dosage or administration route, and that safety data in children are lacking. Under the FDA’s current plans, leucovorin will be available to only a minority of autistic people.\n\nAll of this has led to widespread confusion, say clinicians worried about the expectations created by Makary and other officials in the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\n“I’ve heard from a lot of families,” says psychologist Catherine Lord at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The major thing they say is, ‘What is this? What do we do?’”\n\n“I don’t want to get everyone’s hopes up that this is a magic cure,” says Rebecca Schmidt, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis. “It’s not for everybody.”\n\nVitamin in the spotlight\n\nOn 22 September, Makary announced the upcoming approval of leucovorin, a form of the vitamin folate, saying it would “open the door to the first FDA-recognized treatment pathway for autism”. People with low levels of folate in the protective fluid surrounding the brain and spine sometimes exhibit traits associated with autism, including challenges in social communication. This condition, called cerebral folate deficiency, could be due to rogue antibodies that attack the body’s proteins that ensure import of folate into the brain.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nSo far, clinical trials of leucovorin, also called folinic acid, as an autism therapy have been small. For example, one clinical trial published last year enrolled about 80 children aged from two to ten, half of whom were given folinic-acid supplements; the others received a placebo1. Neither the participants nor their physicians knew who received the supplement, but improvements in social interactions and language skills were greater in this group than in the placebo group.\n\nAfter the trial was published, some researchers raised concerns that the assessment of those improvements was subjective, and that the study was too small to detect subtle differences in response2.\n\nCall for bigger trials\n\nBut size is not the only thing that matters in clinical trials, says Dan Rossignol, a family physician in Aliso Viejo, California, who has studied the data on leucovorin and sometimes prescribes it to autistic children. Even in small trials, the drug’s effect is apparent, he says. Specifically, Rossignol points to an early clinical study in which only 48 children participated — but some of them experienced marked improvements in a standardized assessment of speech3.\n\n“But it would be great if more studies were done with more kids,” he says. “Then we could tease out which kids respond better.” Typically, studies submitted for FDA approval of a drug for autism symptoms might have data from hundreds of children, he says, but securing funding for larger trials has been challenging. Rossignol says that he and a colleague have been in discussions with US President Donald Trump’s administration to make the case for leucovorin.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration said the US National Institutes of Health plans to monitor the effects of the FDA’s anticipated approval and to study possible broader benefits of leucovorin in autistic people. No details about the design of such studies have been released.\n\nNot a magic bullet\n\nRegardless of the therapy’s efficacy, it will not be a panacea. The FDA’s proposed approval, which has not yet been finalized, would apply only to people with low levels of folate in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. That represents about 7–30% of autistic people, depending on how folate levels are measured, says Alycia Halladay, chief science officer of the Autism Science Foundation in New York City. “Families are in the Facebook groups saying, ‘We can get a prescription now,’” she says. “And that’s not what’s going to happen.”\n\nAutism is complex and thought to be caused by a wide range of factors. No single therapy is likely to work for all autistic people. “If anyone tells you they have found a magic-bullet cure for autism, doubt them,” says Halladay. “There is not going to be one cause and one singular treatment.”\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\nThe lack of data from large trials means that doctors will have little to go on when determining what dose to prescribe, or how long children should take it before a decision is made on whether it is working, says Halladay. “We hope there’s eventually going to be guidance,” she says. Rossignol says that most of the clinical studies of leucovorin in autistic children have used the same dose, which could provide a starting point for physicians.",

But many researchers who study autism caution that there are insufficient data to link it with paracetamol, and that focusing on this is merely a distraction.\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\n“There is no definitive evidence to suggest that paracetamol use in mothers is a cause of autism, and when you see any associations, they are very, very small,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a charity for autism research and campaigning in London, who is autistic. “At the heart of this is people trying to look for simple answers to complex problems.”\n\nAt today’s announcement, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr acknowledged that autism has many possible causes. FDA commissioner Martin Makary noted that, in some cases, insufficient transport of the nutrient folate into the brain has been linked with traits common in autism. The FDA announced today that it would initiate approval of a form of folate, called leucovorin, for people with low levels of the vitamin in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBut Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, and Trump focused their attention on two other factors that they said could be linked to autism: acetaminophen and vaccines. Decades of research have not uncovered a reproducible link between vaccines and autism.\n\n“The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism,” says Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and executive director of the PEAR-Net Society, a non-profit organization in Vancouver advocating for maternal–fetal health and research. “Suggesting otherwise may fuel misinformation and undermine confidence in safe treatments and immunizations.”\n\nHere, Nature examines the evidence for a link between paracetamol, which is used to treat fever as well as pain, and autism.\n\nHow strong are the data connecting autism and paracetamol during pregnancy?\n\nScientists say that the most-robust research has found no link. “The better-controlled studies are less likely to find even a small risk,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies autism at Boston University in Massachusetts. “And even then, what we’re talking about is a minor association. We do not think that taking acetaminophen is in any way contributing to actually causing autism.”\n\nWorking out whether there is a link between the drug and autism is difficult, says Viktor Ahlqvist, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and co-author of what might be the biggest study1 on the link. The medication is available over the counter, so a lot of use is not recorded in medical databases. This means that researchers rely on self-reports, which can be unreliable.\n\nConfounding factors are an even bigger problem. Many pregnant people who take paracetamol have a health problem, such as an infection or underlying condition. Any apparent link between the drug and autism might therefore be explained by these other health factors, rather than the drug itself. Scientists try to adjust for this in their studies, but this is “rarely sufficient”, Ahlqvist says. This is one reason why studies looking for a link have produced conflicting results.\n\nThe study led by Ahlqvist harnessed data from nearly 2.5 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019 and — from the country’s extensive health records — data on paracetamol prescriptions during pregnancy and on self-reported use collected by midwives, as well as whether children later received autism diagnoses.\n\nThe study showed that around 1.42% of children exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy were autistic, compared with 1.33% of children who were not exposed — a “very small” difference, says Ahlqvist.\n\nThe team also compared pairs of siblings (born to the same mother), in which one had been exposed to paracetamol and one had not. Siblings share half of their genome, a similar upbringing and maternal health, so differences in autism are more likely to be due to the drug. Using this method, the researchers found no association between paracetamol and autism — which supports the idea that links found in other studies could be explained by confounding factors.\n\nA large, high-quality study2 from Japan of more than 200,000 children — also using sibling comparisons and published this year — found no link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism.\n\nAre there any studies that do link the medication and autism?\n\nA review3 of studies published last month in the journal Environmental Health concluded that there is an association. But researchers interviewed by Nature point instead to the contrasting results of a review4 of high-quality studies on the topic. That review, published in February, concluded that “in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk” of autism.\n\n“There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship, and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced and unsupported by the most robust methods,” Monique Botha, a social and developmental psychologist at Durham University, UK, said in comments to the Science Media Centre, a press office in London.",

          "abstract": "It is common to hear that elite US research universities are fabulously wealthy. Their multibillion-dollar endowments are seen as vast, untapped resources. In reality, the wealth of even the most-affluent universities are dwarfed by the value their graduates generate for society.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nIn 2023, the endowment value of the top ten wealthiest US universities was around US$271 billion (see go.nature.com/41wdedo). Yet, this is smaller than the estimated $455-billion fortune of a single individual: entrepreneur Elon Musk. The five richest individuals in the world — Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Larry Page — command a combined $1.55 trillion in net worth.\n\nHave these five entrepreneurs, however innovative, really created more value than these ten world-leading institutions have? The evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nA 2015 report (see go.nature.com/3vij3b1) on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge calculated that active companies founded by the university’s alumni constituted an economy equivalent to the tenth-largest in the world ($1.9 trillion, as of 2014). A 2012 study on Stanford University, California, found much the same (go.nature.com/41vIbIh).\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nYet, none of this value appears on a university’s balance sheets. Unlike technology companies such as Tesla or Amazon, universities cannot claim the trillions of dollars generated by their faculty members, graduates and the technological ecosystems they seed.\n\nThe purpose of a research university is to create and disseminate knowledge as a public good, train human capital at scale and pursue fundamental enquiry without ownership of the resulting societal value. This has been a remarkably successful model. But its success is predicated on a long-standing social compact.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nIn exchange for producing this public good, the United States has supported its universities through federal research funding, tax exemptions and tax incentives for private philanthropy. This compact has driven scientific and technological leadership for generations.\n\nHowever, this social compact is being challenged. The administration of US President Donald Trump has paused funding to elite universities including Harvard, in Cambridge, and Columbia, in New York City. It has suspended grants that had already been approved.\n\nThe Republican-controlled US Congress has proposed massive budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation and a tax of up to 21% on income from university endowments. If enacted, these measures will severely hamper the ability of research universities to generate knowledge at scale.",

          "abstract": "Too many papers, too little time.Credit: Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty\n\nThe challenge of staying up to date with the scientific literature has become a burden for everyone from students to senior investigators. In fields such as public health, annual publication counts now exceed half a million articles — more than 1,300 papers every day. Experienced researchers and early-career scientists alike report anxiety about falling behind and emphasize the importance of building efficient reading habits. Some have noted that the pressure to keep up has left many scientists increasingly reliant on social media and recommendation systems to find papers, rather than systematic reading.\n\nWhat’s clear is that the difficulty of keeping up with the literature is no longer a niche problem, but one that cuts across disciplines, methodologies and seniority levels. As researchers at different stages of our scientific journeys — a PhD student, a mid-career investigator and a senior group leader — we, too, have faced this challenge. Collectively, we have spent decades navigating the scientific literature, testing different ways to filter information and adapting to the accelerating pace of publication.\n\nHere, we offer five complementary strategies to help you filter the literature and stay up to date on your research field. These are the strategies that we have found to be the most effective, and we hope that they will help others, too, whatever their field or career stage.\n\nSubscribe to what matters\n\nOne of the simplest and most reliable ways to stay current is through journal table of contents (ToC) alerts. This conventional method might seem outdated in the age of personalized algorithms, but subscribing to a carefully curated selection of journals remains a sound strategy. Often, ToC alerts highlight key articles and provide direct links to abstracts or full texts. Some can even filter by article type and have specific alerts for reviews, editorials, research articles or methods papers.\n\nBluesky’s science takeover: 70% of Nature poll respondents use platform\n\nReceiving a curated list of new papers from a handful of reputable journals provides a structured and predictable way to remain grounded in the core literature of your field. It’s particularly helpful for recognizing recurring themes, spotting important reviews and following long-term shifts in editorial priorities — all without needing to actively search. We recommend subscribing to a blend of landmark and niche journals to capture both broad and field-specific research.\n\nYou might miss important articles published in journals that fall outside your alert list. When browsing long tables of contents, especially under time pressure, it’s easy to skim over titles that later prove relevant. Still, for many researchers, ToC alerts remain a first line of defence against information overload.\n\nLet PubMed do the work\n\nMoving beyond broad overviews, use platforms such as PubMed and Google Scholar to create a personalized surveillance system that monitors the literature for the topics, authors or keywords that matter to you. Users can set up saved searches and automated alerts, which can be configured to arrive weekly or monthly by e-mail.\n\nQueries can incorporate Boolean operators (such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’) and be polished to reduce the number of irrelevant hits. This method is particularly useful for capturing articles that appear in lesser-known journals or are outside your usual reading scope.\n\nThe same can be done for preprint servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, which allow users to set up RSS (really simple syndication) feeds or e-mail alerts on the basis of keywords, authors or subject areas. Including preprints in your alerts can give you early insight into emerging findings, methods and controversies because they frequently appear weeks or even months before peer-reviewed publication.\n\nThat said, custom alerts require maintenance. Poorly constructed queries can return overwhelming — and often irrelevant — results. And even well-designed alerts can pile up in your inbox, adding to the very overload they’re meant to reduce. Still, when used properly, search alerts across both peer-reviewed databases and preprint repositories can surface important literature with remarkable precision.\n\nFollow the people, not the papers\n\nAlthough many tools focus on topics or journals, an increasingly effective way to filter literature is to follow the researchers themselves. Professional networks such as ResearchGate and LinkedIn allow scientists to receive updates directly from the people and labs they care about. This person-centred approach can be particularly powerful for those who already know the key players in their field and want to monitor their scientific output in a more digestible, progressive format. For instance, ResearchGate can notify you when someone you follow uploads a new publication, preprint or data set. It also generates curated suggestions on the basis of your reading habits, recommendations and profile interests. These help to surface work that might otherwise be missed. Unlike static e-mail alerts, these feeds evolve as your network grows, offering a dynamic way to stay informed.\n\nThis approach also has the advantage of reinforcing professional awareness. Associating papers with specific individuals or groups can help to contextualize findings, track thematic trajectories in laboratories and even identify potential collaborators or competitors. Some authors also post supplementary materials or tutorials that aren’t always accessible through conventional journals, adding important context.\n\nOf course, not all researchers upload their work promptly, and some don’t use these platforms at all. As with social media, the quality of your feed is only as strong as the network you build. Still, for those willing to invest the time, following the people behind the papers offers a valuable, filtered window into the scientific landscape. A good tip for getting started is to identify active users in your field and screen their followers and followings for inspiration.\n\nUse social media wisely\n\nResearchers increasingly use social-media platforms such as X and Bluesky to share their latest publications, discuss preprints, highlight interesting studies and comment on scientific developments. Following the right accounts can provide a curated stream of relevant papers and ideas, often before they appear in journals or search alerts. These platforms also allow you to interact with researchers you might otherwise meet only at conferences — or perhaps be too shy to approach in person.",

          "abstract": "Teamwork and hands-on learning underpins NMITE’s pedagogy ethos.Credit: NMITE\n\nEight hundred years ago, a group of scholars walked out of the University of Oxford after a bitter and violent dispute with local townspeople. At a fork in the road, the scholars might have turned left and founded a university in Hereford, a cathedral city 106 kilometres away. Instead, they turned right and established the University of Cambridge, triggering an academic rivalry between the two institutions that endures to this day.\n\nThe future of universities\n\n“It’s a fun ‘what if’,” said Jesse Norman of this apocryphal story about a university that might have been.\n\nNorman, the Member of Parliament for Hereford, UK, recounted the tale in May at the inaugural graduation ceremony of the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering (NMITE), which welcomed its first intake of 27 students to its Hereford campus four years earlier.\n\nThe institute is trying something rare in UK higher education. It is building a new kind of university from the ground up — one that promises to address the skills shortage in engineering, rebalance regional access to education and rethink how engineering is taught in a city with one of the lowest university participation rates in England.\n\n“Broadly speaking, the approach to learning at NMITE is directly against the traditional wisdom in the higher-education system,” says Norman, who campaigned for the university to be set up and became its chair in January. “We don’t chase international students. We focus on raising the skills and intellectual achievement of kids in Britain.”\n\nNMITE is not, and did not set out to be, a research-intensive institution; instead, it concentrates on undergraduate teaching, industry-led projects and preparing graduates for immediate employment.\n\nIt now has around 50 members of staff. Almost all live locally; most of the administrative staff members have long been based in the area, whereas most of the academic employees relocated to join the institute. NMITE offers a small number of specialist degrees — currently integrated bachelor’s and master’s in engineering. The latter is designed to meet the UK Engineering Council’s Chartered Engineer requirements and is delivered as an accelerated programme, taking three years instead of the usual four.\n\nIt’s about dealing with what James Newby, the chief executive, sees as a paradox at the heart of UK higher education: “There’s a national crisis, almost, in the UK in skills.”\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nThe problem has been documented for years: the Department for Education’s Employer Skills Survey 2022 found that UK skill shortages accounted for 36% of vacancies, up from 22% in 2017. At the same time, many graduates are in roles that do not require a degree. The expansion of higher education from 1997, under the government of then-prime minister Tony Blair, included a target of having 50% of young people at university, a milestone reached in 2017, ten years after Blair left office. But some critics argue that this placed too much emphasis on academic degrees as opposed to vocational training. In 2023, 20% of working-age UK graduates were in low-skilled employment.\n\n“We didn’t want a university that’s the same as all the others,” Newby says. “There’s plenty of capacity in the sector for people who want to do a traditional degree in the traditional way. We wanted that regional impact, but we definitely wanted to be a national higher education disruptor.”\n\nThe tried-and-tested model isn’t necessarily working for UK institutions: more than 43% of higher-education providers in England expect to run a financial deficit for 2024–25 (see go.nature.com/4n3s8m9), according to the UK Office for Students (OfS).\n\nThere are worries that the declining financial performance of universities, because of poor international student recruitment coupled with rising staff and infrastructure costs, could lead to institutions going bust. Could a more innovative model be what the sector needs?\n\nElena Rodríguez-Falcón (far left) with staff and students on NMITE’s opening day in 2021.Credit: NMITE\n\nThis backdrop prompted Norman to join with two local entrepreneurs to create the organization that became NMITE — and secure £15 million (US$20.4 million) in start-up funding from the Department for Education, with £8 million coming from the Marches Local Enterprise Partnership, a regional development fund. NMITE launched in 2013 as a company limited by guarantee (a business structure typically used by non-profit organizations). In 2020, it became a regulated higher-education provider under the OfS. In 2021, after the pandemic paused its opening by a year, NMITE welcomed its first students. Two years later, it was granted its own degree-awarding powers and attracted 55 students that year.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nNMITE’s first chief executive and president Elena Rodríguez-Falcón, who joined NMITE in 2018 from the University of Sheffield, UK, embodies what the institution aims to do. Originally from Monterrey, Mexico, she graduated in engineering and then became the only female employee in a factory of 200 blue-collar workers, where she recalls being teased for a couple of weeks. At the time, she described herself as an engineering graduate rather than an engineer. That distinction was reinforced during her time at Sheffield, where one of her roles was director of ‘enterprise education’ — an approach that encourages students to consider developing innovative products and services with economic and societal benefits. “Speaking to hundreds of companies, one thing they said to me was: you send us engineering graduates, and we have to train them again. They’ve done three years at university, and we still have to put them through a graduate scheme because they’re not engineers yet.” The realization shaped NMITE’s ethos: to produce work-ready graduates from day one.\n\nThe best way is to learn by doing, she says. “Authentic learning, experiential learning is the best pedagogy.”\n\nThe team looked for pedagogical inspiration globally, and a key influence was Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts. The college welcomed its first faculty members in 2000 and was established to address a dearth of engineering students with exposure to enterprise education, in a country where, according to Rick Miller, Olin’s founding president, students “are taught about engineering, not to be engineers”. Those who flunk out of engineering don’t do so because the subject is too hard, but because they’re bored, argues Miller, who led Olin for 21 years. An early experiment, he says, was asking a team of 18-year-olds to design, build and demonstrate a pulse oximeter, a device that measures pulse rates and oxygen saturation levels in blood. “They didn’t even know what it was. Five weeks later, they had it working,” says Miller.\n\nNMITE chose to focus on engineering because of its local relevance and national urgency. “The industrial ecosystem of the area is heavily based around engineering and technology,” says Newby, adding that many of the firms are small and medium-sized enterprises, including some in the defence and security sector.\n\nWhat’s more, Newby says, engineering is “the sector nationally that’s been most vociferously complaining about the quality and work readiness of the graduates the traditional sector produces”.\n\nNMITE’s model lends itself to people who think differently and want to be taught differently, says Rhys Morgan, director of education and skills at the Royal Academy of Engineering in London. The programme at NMITE is “not that kind of mathematically hardcore course” offered by the universities of Cambridge or Southampton or by Imperial College London, he adds. “It’s inherently more practical.”\n\nThat makes for more-flexible graduates, and a more-flexible workforce helps with pinch points across the system, he says.\n\nA new teaching model\n\nNMITE’s accelerated master’s programme is focused on learning by doing, with a curriculum co-designed with industry to prioritize real-world challenges.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nThe approach means that there are no conventional lectures and no drifting between classes — students spend their days in a single studio space, working in small teams with educators moving between them. Morgan describes the academics’ role as that of a “guide on the side” rather than a “sage on the stage”. The year is broken into three intensive terms of eight-week ‘sprints’ with short breaks in between, meaning that it resembles a professional schedule more than it does a campus calendar. Attendance is closely monitored — the minimum requirement is 80% — and studying remotely is agreed on only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nWhat’s more, the admissions process is designed to be inclusive. “We take the view that talent is evenly distributed around the country, but opportunity isn’t,” says Norman. “We select for drive, passion and resilience — not just grades.”\n\nUnusually for undergraduate engineering programmes, students don’t need to have mathematics and physics A-levels (the qualifications typically taken at age 18 at most UK secondary schools). “We’ve found that people without that academic preparation can still make great engineers,” he says.\n\nA graduation procession at NMITE earlier this year.Credit: NMITE\n\nThis policy could help to attract female candidates. In 2020–21, the proportion of female students enrolled in engineering and technology courses was just 18.5% at UK universities, and for other higher-education engineering and technology courses, such as diplomas, just 14.6%, according to research by the non-profit organization EngineeringUK in London (see go.nature.com/3jzr5yn). This under-representation is linked in part to subject choices at school — in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, female students make up only 23.1% of those taking A-level physics and 37.2% of those taking A-level maths.\n\nAt NMITE, women currently make up only 16% of its small student body, but that is “a work in progress” as the university gains momentum and reputation, Newby says. Enrolment of female students is expected to rise to more than 20% when the next cohort joins this month, following a substantial increase in applications from women.\n\nAnother of NMITE’s distinctive features is the use of block learning. Students focus intensively on one module at a time in eight-week sprints, rather than taking several modules at once, as in most institutions.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\n“They’re not working for two hours in the morning on one topic and then moving to the next that afternoon,” says Newby. The NMITE approach “just drives much faster learning gain”, according to Newby, and the students can “fail in a safe place, they break things, and they learn things”.\n\nDavid Helfand is an astrophysicist and block-learning pioneer who helped NMITE to adapt the model to engineering. “Some students who cannot operate in the ‘four or five courses at a time’ system just thrive in this system,” he says, adding that there are “precious few opportunities” at the moment to implement this approach in higher education.\n\nFrom day one, NMITE students also work closely with employers in small teams on hands-on projects. Effectively, the industrial partner becomes a client and the students work to the client brief.\n\nNMITE’s short teaching blocks allow educators to experiment and adapt quickly, creating space for innovation that conventional universities often struggle to accommodate. “It’s just very easy to slip into a routine,” says Helfand. “But the world, of course, changes around you and you can’t do that and remain relevant” and of value to students.\n\nAssignments range from presentations and reports to creating prototypes. “We don’t assess by traditional exam,” says Newby. “But we obsess about academic quality — we are academically rigorous and vocationally relevant at the same time.”\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led Newby and others at NMITE to conclude that its teaching had to be in person and hands-on. “Across the rest of the sector, universities developed and invested in ways of teaching at a distance,” he says, but he questions whether this delivers the right level of quality and student experience.\n\nRodríguez-Falcón summarizes the approach as “9 to 5, 5 days a week, 46 weeks a year — like a job. No lectures. No exams. No A-level maths requirement. You learn by working through problems.”\n\nWorking with industry\n\nThe integration with industry is not “a bit of curriculum enrichment, but absolutely embedded in the curriculum”, Newby says. NMITE works with more than 80 industry partners across its degree programmes, ranging from small to medium-sized enterprises to major infrastructure companies.

          "abstract": "Mitochondria (illustration) have their own DNA, which they expel into their environment if the molecules don’t meet their standards.Credit: Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library\n\nThe cellular batteries known as mitochondria sometimes dump DNA into their surroundings, which can contribute to inflammation during ageing. Now a study in mice reveals why this dumping occurs: mitochondria are expelling ‘tainted’ DNA1.\n\nScientists found that, in the cells of ageing mice with kidney inflammation, strands of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contained an excess of certain types of nucleotides — molecular building blocks — that can harm DNA. This excess prompted the mitochondria to eject the abnormal fragments of genetic code into the cytosol, a fluid that fills the cell, in which the free-roaming mtDNA kick-started key inflammatory pathways associated with ageing.\n\nThe study is exciting because it helps to explain why and how mitochondria throw away their DNA, says Timothy Shutt, a medical geneticist at the University of Calgary in Canada, who focuses on mitochondria. This insight could help researchers to better understand mitochondria’s contribution to inflammageing — the chronic inflammation that occurs as people get older, adds Shutt.\n\nThe findings were published 24 September in Nature1.\n\nOut with the rubbish\n\nMitochondria are energy-producing organelles that have their own genome. When the mtDNA is damaged or disrupted, the mitochondria kick it out, sending it into the cytosol. This can occur when the relative levels of certain nucleotides in the mtDNA become too high or low.\n\nThis oversupply problem, which stresses the mitochondria, can be caused by certain drugs and also seems to happen in ageing cells. But exactly how this nucleotide imbalance leads to mtDNA release and inflammageing had been unclear, says study co-author Thomas Langer, a cell biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, Germany.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nTo find out, Langer and his colleagues turned to mice engineered to lack an enzyme called MGME1. As these mice age, their kidneys usually become inflamed, making them useful models for studying inflammation. MGME1 ensures that the mitochondrial genome makes accurate copies of itself, but the connection between its loss and inflammation was unclear.",

          "abstract": "Colossal Biosciences as a company name was picked to engage children, says chief executive Ben Lamm.Credit: Colossal Biosciences\nThe meaning behind our moniker\n\nColossal Biosciences, in Dallas, Texas, describes itself as the world’s first de-extinction company. It aims to revive lost species using CRISPR gene-editing technology, including the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.). It attracted controversy when it announced it has ‘de-extincted’ the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago. Its co-founders are technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm, Colossal’s chief executive, and George Church, the company’s genetics adviser, who also holds academic research positions at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nIn the third article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Lamm describes how the name ‘Colossal Biosciences’ came about.\n\nThe fact that the world will lose up to 25% of all biodiversity between now and 2050 is a huge problem. At my company, we asked ourselves, how do we come up with a name that encompasses three elements: the problem, the solution and our flagship species, the mammoth?\n\nClimate change, biodiversity, CRISPR and gene editing, artificial intelligence, computational analysis and advanced embryology can be difficult concepts for the public to fully grasp. We came up with ‘Colossal Biosciences’ because losing species is a colossal problem, our solution is colossal and the mammoth is a colossal animal.\n\nWe felt that our brand and name should not only reflect the problem and solution, but also be approachable to children, including some who will grow up to read Cell, Nature and Science. Every week, we get little pictures of dodos and baby mammoths that kids draw, and their parents mail us physical letters, saying things such as: ‘Thank you so much for doing what you’re doing. My kid is excited about science. You’re making science cool.’\n\nA big, awesome name\n\nTo come up with Colossal, I worked with Chris Klee, executive vice-president of design at the company, and Chris Stevens, co-founder of Maven Creative, our branding agency, in Orlando, Florida.\n\nWe’ve worked together for the past 20 years. We had a list of seven or eight potential names — including ‘Huge’, ‘Macedon’ (an ancient kingdom) and ‘Footprint’ (because every species has a unique one). Everything was centred around the concept of ‘big and awesome’. Obviously, ‘Mammoth’ was on the list because the world is facing a mammoth challenge, but we felt that calling it that would have pigeonholed us to one species.\n\nWe also liked ‘Colossus’, and the idea of using ‘us’ to signify a team effort. But Colossus is a character in the Marvel Universe media franchise, and we didn’t want to be too Hollywood. We also considered names linked to evolution, and thought ‘Darwin’ could be a cool one. But when we said ‘Colossal’ out loud, we were like, ‘That’s it!’\n\nAlongside the name, there’s the brand — so before we decided on Colossal, we underwent a process to come up with a brand that encapsulated ‘Harvard University meets 1980’s MTV’.",

          "authors": "Carlos Garcia-Soto",
          "abstract": "The sea bed holds vast reserves of cobalt, nickel and other minerals, yet no international rules govern how such extraction might proceed or how its impacts should be contained. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is mandated to set those rules, but in its July session, it failed to agree on a mining code. Meanwhile, 30 contracts for resource exploration remain in force and are edging closer to industrial extraction. This contradiction is not accidental. It stems from how the authority works — licensing first, restraining later. Transparency and independent review are needed to restore the balance.\n\nGuess how much of the ocean floor humans have explored\n\nDecision-making is concentrated in the ISA Council, which is responsible for rule-making, licensing and oversight. In other multilateral policy settings, guardianship and licensing are separated and public reporting is mandatory. The council deliberates mainly in closed sessions. Scientists and civil-society representatives can attend as observers, but rule 75 restricts them to a seat without a vote — they are present in the room, yet absent from the decision-making.\n\nThree structural gaps currently erode the ISA’s credibility as a body to govern the sea bed on behalf of all humankind. A representation gap: decisions are dominated by states with mining interests, whereas nations without mining capacity — and independent scientists and civil-society groups — remain marginal. A mandate gap: safeguards are applied mainly as formalities, with weak links to science. And a legitimacy gap: baseline data produced largely by contractors are subject to little independent review or oversight — unlike in other governance regimes such as regional fisheries bodies or the International Whaling Commission.\n\nThese gaps date back to the 1990s, when the ISA’s architecture was designed — before deep-sea ecosystems were understood, before biodiversity was recognized as a pillar of sustainable development and before transparency became a norm in multilateral negotiations. The ISA was established in 1994 under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) with a dual mandate: to safeguard the sea bed as humanity’s common heritage and to regulate its exploitation for the benefit of all. Three decades on, that balance has tilted towards exploitation, with the authority pressed to consider mining applications before binding rules or environmental standards exist.\n\nFive priorities for a sustainable ocean economy\n\nIn July 2021, the state of Nauru triggered a clause in UNCLOS obliging the ISA to finalize a mining code within two years. When no code was adopted by July 2023, this period’s expiry entitled states to submit applications in the rules’ absence. Although negotiations and drafting of the code have advanced since, progress on environmental baselines and benefit-sharing mechanisms has stalled. In practice, the precautionary principle has been applied unevenly across ISA sessions, reflecting divergent legal interpretations, standards of evidence and political alignments.\n\nNorway’s January 2024 vote to allow exploratory sea-bed mining has heightened environmental concerns. Moreover, independent research usually arrives too late to shape outcomes, whereas data generated by contractors dominate the evidence base and raise doubts about independence. Proposals to embed independent review in ISA procedures have repeatedly stalled, leaving trust in the authority’s decisions fragile.\n\nThree gates would give the ISA enforceable checkpoints before any mining licence is granted. These focus squarely on institutional reform, not on individuals or countries, and would help the ISA to fulfil its mandate.",

          "title": "Public trust in science has declined since COVID — virologists need to unite around safety standards",
          "authors": "Melanie Ott, Olivier Schwartz, Alex Sigal",
          "abstract": "In an opinion piece published in The New York Times in March, two leading virologists argued that experiments on a coronavirus found in bats and similar to those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had been conducted without sufficient safety measures. The experiments involved infecting human cells with the live bat virus to see how the virus behaved1.\n\nRegulatory authorities in many countries where research on potentially dangerous viruses is conducted, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, would require such studies to be conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities. (There are four biosafety levels, with BSL-4 being the most stringent.) But for these experiments — which were approved by the equivalent authorities in China — the 25 researchers across 7 institutes and universities in China (including the Guangzhou National Laboratory and the Wuhan Institute of Virology) used BSL-2 procedures. They also used a negative pressure ventilation system designed to prevent microorganisms from spreading outside the laboratory.\n\nIn our view, this work and the discussion it has provoked highlights a broader and growing problem that the entire virology community needs to address. On the one hand, the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases is growing2,3 (see ‘A growing threat’), making investigations of potentially dangerous viruses more important. On the other hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in virology and science more broadly has declined and work on viruses has become more politicized.\n\nTo improve trust in science — and to ensure that essential work on viruses can continue — international, standardized and transparent biosafety guidance is urgently needed. Here, we lay out how such guidance might be developed.\n\nSource: Ref. 6\nPatchwork regulation\n\nOver the past 30–40 years, various protocols and procedures have been introduced to reduce the risk of viruses escaping from labs, or of people being infected by viruses used in research.\n\nToday, researchers in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States, can work on certain ‘dangerous’ viruses only if they use biosafety cabinets, personal protective equipment and strict standardized procedures for BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities. The use of negative pressure, which ensures that the air in a facility leaves through a filter that captures pathogens, and strict controls over access to the facility are also required.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nWhich viruses qualify as dangerous is decided by the government of each country, and is usually listed as an appendix to the regulations governing the work. In the United States, federal funding for research involving the enhancement of viruses that cause influenza, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — whether through the use of genetic manipulation or by harnessing natural evolutionary processes — was banned in 2014. The ban was lifted in 2017, but research is only permitted after a stringent review process and with the use of BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities4. These rules are likely to change again under the current US administration.\n\nIn China, national biosafety laws were updated in 2004 and 2020. These require investigators undertaking studies on potentially pathogenic living organisms to use BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities, among other strict precautions5. It is unclear exactly how these rules are enforced, however. They don’t seem to have been applied to the experiments on the MERS-like coronavirus found in bats, which were approved by the Wuhan Institute of Virology institutional biosafety committee.\n\nThe level of detail included in regulations also varies. For example, Canada uses the Canadian Biosafety Standard, which lays out exactly how containment is to be achieved. The United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have similar standards. Many other countries, however, do not provide such detailed information, although they might provide details of the containment levels necessary for certain pathogens.\n\nAvian influenza viruses can infect and spread among domestic poultry, including chickens.Credit: Andres Kudacki/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nThis patchwork regulation has led to confusion in the field. And the lack of transparency has probably made it easier for people to spread misinformation and fake news around the handling of live viruses in research.\n\nMore than five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the controversy about its origins shows no sign of abating. According to the lab-leak theory (now promoted by the administration of US President Donald Trump), research on bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the accidental infection of lab personnel, which in turn sparked the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the institute is known to have been doing research on coronaviruses before the pandemic, there is no firm evidence that it possessed or conducted work on a SARS-CoV-2 precursor virus. Meanwhile, findings indicating that the pandemic resulted from a natural ‘spillover’ event, the epicentre of which was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, continue to accumulate. (A spillover event is the transmission of what is called a zoonotic virus from other animals to humans.)\n\nTrump freezes ‘gain of function’ pathogen research ― threatening all US virology, critics say\n\nIn our experience, virologists are often reluctant to engage in discussions about work that involves the enhancement of live viruses — either genetically or through natural evolutionary processes — for fear of being caught in the crosshairs or of their own work being shut down, even if it is low risk. But now is not the time to lie low.\n\nThe number of outbreaks and deaths caused by viruses such as those that cause SARS, Ebola and mpox has been increasing. Data scientists predict that, if current trends continue, Nipah virus, Machupo virus, coronaviruses and filoviruses will, compared with 2020, cause 4 times as many spillover events and 12 times as many deaths by 2050 because of global travel, climate change, tropical deforestation, and wild-animal hunting and trade6,7.\n\nAnd although virologists now have various ways of studying viruses that can spread between animals and humans, besides growing fully functional zoonotic viruses in the lab, experiments involving live viruses are key to testing antiviral drugs and vaccines. It’s hard to imagine how it would have been possible for researchers to develop COVID-19 vaccines, for instance — estimated to have saved millions of lives since 2021 — without studies on live SARS-CoV-2 (and earlier work on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in animal models.\n\nGiven the crisis of mistrust in science and institutions, and an increasingly fractured geopolitical world, unified international guidelines are crucial for protecting essential research involving dangerous viruses.\n\nA global standard\n\nCentralized, standardized guidelines would be analogous to the guidelines for research on human embryos produced by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) — an organization that includes investigators in more than 80 countries. They would be similar to national regulations for research on dangerous viruses, but on a global level. They could lay out what factors might make the use of a particular virus or approach high risk or what benefit-to-cost ratio might justify a research project being pursued or blocked, for example.\n\nSome scenarios should not be allowed to happen. If an investigator is working on the H5N1 bird flu virus in a BSL-3 facility, for instance, they should take strict precautions to prevent viral strains that cause human seasonal flu from entering the facility, even though seasonal flu is not considered a dangerous virus. This is because strains of flu virus can exchange RNA fragments. Such exchange could make H5N1 more transmissible in humans.",

The ruling paves the way for a type of DNA analysis known as whole-genome sequencing — used to decipher ancient DNA in fossilized remains, for example — to be admitted as evidence in US criminal trials.\n\n“This is a big step forward for the use of DNA evidence, because it will allow comparisons and matches with evidence that was previously considered too minuscule, too old or too badly degraded to be considered useful,” says Nathan Lents, a biologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. “You can bet that cold-case units all over the country are going back through their evidence lockers to see if there are samples that can now be tested with a reasonable chance of success.”\n\nA technology matures\n\nThe Gilgo Beach killings were a series of murders that occurred in Suffolk County, New York, between 1993 and 2011. Many of the victims were sex workers, and the bodies of some of them were found near the eponymous beach. New York architect Rex Heuermann was charged with seven of the murders in 2023 and 2024 partly on the basis of hairs found on the victims.\n\nIn 2010, investigators concluded that there wasn’t enough genetic material in the hairs for conventional forensic technology to identify whose they were. But since then, genomic technology has matured at a fast pace.\n\nRex Heuermann appears in a New York court in 2023. Credit: James Carbone/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nForensic scientists still identify suspects from hair and other samples using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which can amplify snippets of DNA called short tandem repeats (STRs). Today, however, scientists can also sequence whole genomes and look at single-letter variations in the DNA to zero in on a person of interest. This technology has the added benefit of being able to analyse severely degraded samples — from Neanderthal remains to hairs in the Gilgo Beach case. But it has typically been used only during investigations, and the results have not been widely presented as evidence before juries.\n\nThe controversial company using DNA to sketch the faces of criminals\n\nThe prosecution in the Gilgo Beach case contracted the company Astrea Forensics in Santa Cruz, California, to analyse the hairs found on the victims. Because they were rootless, the hairs hadn’t yielded enough DNA for conventional STR profiling. (Rootless hairs are made mostly of keratin and don’t contain much genetic material, Lents says.)\n\nBut Astrea was able to sequence the small amount of genetic material in the hairs and then use statistical-analysis software to scan the DNA for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) — single-letter differences in people’s genetic codes. Even in a degraded sample, whole-genome sequencing followed by this statistical analysis can spot thousands of SNPs: enough to pinpoint an individual’s unique pattern, Lents says.\n\nNext, scientists at Astrea compared the SNP profiles they obtained with profiles stored in genealogy databases and looked for matches. People submit their DNA to genealogy services, such as 23andMe and Ancestry, and these companies return SNP profiles that people can then upload to websites such as GEDMatch to locate potential relatives. Users have the option to make the data available to forensic genealogists — and these data are what Astrea used to zero in on Heuermann and his family.\n\nSetting precedent\n\nThe defence team in the Gilgo Beach case initially challenged the validity of Astrea’s DNA-analysis methods — which were developed by palaeogenomics researcher Richard ‘Ed’ Green at the University of California, Santa Cruz. (Green declined to comment for this article, given the ongoing prosecution.) The defence argued that the statistical methods used by Astrea were unique, and questioned whether they had been sufficiently validated.",

Experience is often seen as key, with success coming from years of knowledge building and collaboration. This is certainly true for most Nobel Prize laureates, who have an average age of 58.\n\nHowever, research teams with high fractions of beginners — authors with no prior publication history — tend to be more disruptive and innovative, found a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 12 September1.\n\nActively integrating beginners into research groups could boost the disruptive and innovative qualities of the work by having fewer collaborators who are burdened by knowledge, the authors say. “Beginner scientists have less loyalty to prevailing assumptions, and they can take more intellectual freedom,” says co-author Raiyan Abdul Baten, a computational social scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nCan creativity in science be learnt? These researchers think so\n\nBeginner’s charm\n\nThis pattern was first noticed by researchers during a study of whether artificial intelligence can predict how innovative and disruptive a paper will be in its scientific domain2. In the new study, the team analysed more than 28 million articles from SciSciNet-v2, a data lake for the science of science research. These scientific papers spanned 146 fields and were published between 1971 and 2021.\n\nDisruption scores were calculated by comparing how many citations a paper has garnered compared with the papers that it referenced. A disruptive paper that was cited more times than were the papers it referenced could, for example, disprove an established theory and offer an alternative hypothesis.\n\nDuring the analysis, Baten and his colleagues noticed a link between a paper’s disruptiveness and the number of beginner authors, which led them to partition data by authors’ ‘career age’ — defined as the number of years since their first publication. Beginner authors were those with no previous publications.\n\nThey were surprised to find that papers with a higher proportion of beginner authors tended to be more disruptive than were papers with more early-career or senior authors. Disruption scores were highest when beginners made up the entire team, but they were also high when beginners were paired with co-authors with track records of producing disruptive work. Papers with the highest ratio of beginner authors consistently showed a positive correlation between disruption and citation count.\n\n“As the fraction of beginners increases in teams, the disruptivity and innovation go up,” says Baten. “Across team sizes, decades and disciplines, we found these results to be robust,” he adds.\n\nWhat makes a good PhD student?\n\nDiversity boosts scientific progress\n\nWhy do collaborations with more beginners tend to be more disruptive? The researchers speculate that these scientists offer new perspectives because they are less attached to previous theories and knowledge than are their more experienced colleagues. “Sometimes, it is difficult to unlearn the prevailing assumptions then adopt radically new ones,” says Baten. This could allow early-career scientists to be more receptive to new ideas and more likely to take risks by exploring experimental approaches, he says.",

          "abstract": "Crystalline sheets just a few atoms thick, known as 2D materials, are promising substances for building electronic devices at the sub-nanometre scale. However, to be integrated onto an electronic chip, 2D materials must be cleanly detached, or ‘delaminated’, from the substrate on which they are grown. The materials adhere very strongly to their substrates, so this is challenging to achieve without using chemicals that damage and contaminate the material. Writing in Nature, Zheng et al.1 report a technique that uses the repulsion between charged surfaces in a solution to spontaneously detach a 2D material. The authors’ approach enables clean, high-yield transfer of the 2D material at scales of several centimetres — large enough to build entire circuits. This is an important step towards the widespread integration of 2D materials into electronics.",

          "abstract": "The world urgently needs highly trained students and researchers to help solve global crises, from climate change to public-health emergencies. At the same time, universities globally are facing multiple pressures, from the financial burden of increased access to higher education (known as massification) to evolving technologies and changing political influences on academic freedom. Higher-education institutions need to be accessible places of learning, firmly embedded in their communities and society at large. Here, six scholars share how they’re working to improve one aspect of their institution.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nOne key disruption to research and education models in the past few years has been the emergence of widespread generative artificial intelligence (AI). It is not clear yet how ChatGPT and other such tools will change students’ learning and assessment, for example. As educators are grappling with how to ban, limit or embrace this rapidly evolving technology, AI researcher Ya-Qin Zhang at Tsinghua University in Beijing explores how it can be enlisted to speed up lengthy education processes, such as in medical training.\n\nAnother challenge that universities face — even as they aim to contribute to regional development and economic growth — is how to commercialize discoveries made in their laboratories. Academics are typically not trained to navigate the complex intellectual property and regulation systems involved, or to find suitable investors and industrial partners. Engineering researcher Ramesh Jagannathan tackles the gap between academia and markets through a platform that helps start-up firms at New York University Abu Dhabi.\n\nAt the same time, more demands are being made on universities to be places of learning that equip the broadest possible range of students with the skills they need in diverse workplaces. Students embarking on a PhD need assurance that it is a valuable qualification in the workforce beyond academia. This is not currently the case in Brazil, according to Denise Pires de Carvalho, president of the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education in Brasília, which endeavours to boost the employability of PhD holders on graduation.\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nOne crucial skill in workplaces and universities alike is creative thinking. Yet, traditionally, undergraduate science studies have done little to foster inventiveness. Physicist Lorna Dougan at the University of Leeds, UK, shares how encouraging physics undergraduates to explore current research for outreach projects can help them to experience the creativity of scientific research.\n\nBut it is not enough to prepare students for the workplace. Universities should also be nurturing environments in which students can thrive. At the SRM Institute of Science and Technology near Chennai, India, public-health researcher Bala Ganesh Pichamuthu is leading a programme to look after students’ well-being and mental health.\n\nTo foster strong links with their students and their communities, universities must be anchored in their local context. But in some regions, where institutions were built during the colonial era, the colonizing countries imported teaching philosophies and values instead. Amid discussions on the decolonization of universities, disability and gender researcher Sibonokuhle Ndlovu at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, explores how this would lower barriers for marginalized communities, including women with disabilities.\n\nYA-QIN ZHANG: Use AI to help speed up education\nYa-Qin Zhang (right) talks to Liu Yang about Agent Hospital, an AI tool developed in their lab.Credit: Tsinghua University\n\nPhD graduates and physicians will often have spent between 6 and 15 years in higher education, depending on fields and country of study. This long process is necessary for competency, but it can make it difficult for universities to ensure that they train a workforce that grows according to changing needs. At Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research, my colleagues and I turned to artificial intelligence to help speed things up.\n\nFocusing on medical education, and in particular the years of a physician’s residency — the equivalent of postgraduate research in academia — we developed a digital environment called Agent Hospital (J. Li et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/p5kh; 2024). It simulates how illnesses are treated in the real world from the time of disease onset, including the steps of triage by a nurse, registering to wait for a physician’s consultation, medical examination, diagnosis, treatment-plan recommendation and follow-up visits. In this simulation, AI physicians and AI patients are autonomous agents powered by large multimodal foundation models, which are derived from large language models and can process text and images as well as simulate movements.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nThe AI physicians are trained by being exposed to millions of cases — the equivalent of years of clinical experience for human practitioners. Their diagnoses of AI patients and of real people with real symptoms match those of human practitioners with an accuracy of 96% when tested on questions from the MedQA benchmark, which is derived from the US Medical Licensing Examination. This is a promising start.\n\nIn a trial scheme that started in July, Agent Hospital is being tested at Tsinghua University to train human physicians. AI patients convey their symptoms to human users through text, voice and simulated body movements. We are also working on simulating the tactile sensation of skin through wearable devices equipped with haptic sensors, which convey information through touch. We can imagine a future, perhaps not so far off, in which AI doctors will also be able to help train medical students, serving for example as ‘digital mentors’.\n\nOf course, AI tools cannot replace a trainee’s experience with human patients, supervised by human physicians. But used early in the training process, they can help students to acquire knowledge and skills rapidly and easily, free from concerns about harming real people in health-care settings.\n\nSuch simulations can be useful in other fields — beyond the host of administrative tasks, literature reviews or coding for which they are already being harnessed. The scientific community must ensure that these tools are developed, implemented and used ethically, without bypassing human judgement.\n\nRAMESH JAGANNATHAN: Strengthen links with local investors\nRamesh Jagannathan co-founded the platform startAD to boost commercialization of research at New York University Abu Dhabi.Credit: startAD\n\nDriving innovation is a core role of universities. However, having returned to academic research after spending 30 years in the photographic industry, I’ve seen how most universities lack a clear pathway to take ideas from the lab and develop them into products for the market.\n\nIt is complex to convert a discovery to a technology, then to a product and a business. A lack of understanding of the process, and of the actors involved at each step, is the main barrier. What really drives innovation is proximity. Universities need to strengthen connections and engage early with all parts of the commercialization ecosystem — government, entrepreneurs, companies, investors, researchers and the public. Matching start-up firms with local customer needs and challenges is crucial to minimize failure rates.\n\nWhen I joined New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi in 2009, the United Arab Emirates had just embarked on its shift from a fossil-fuel-based economy to a knowledge-based one. It was a place full of ambition, with a government committed to long-term investments in innovation and a campus populated with world-class researchers. But a pathway to market was missing.\n\nThat is why, in 2016, I co-founded startAD — a platform to boost research translation at NYU Abu Dhabi through joint programmes between government and corporations.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nEach year, startAD hosts a broad spectrum of education and training at the university, ranging from programmes on start-up accelerators and market access to workshops covering digital and AI literacy and the law, funded by corporate and government sponsors. These demystify the entrepreneurial process and connect researchers to potential investors and corporate partners. They also help academics to identify their targeted customers, as well as the market size for their products and their immediate competitors, and to develop their pitches for investors.\n\nSeveral programmes focus on accelerating translation directly from research at NYU Abu Dhabi. For example, the start-up technology firm Chatsign, led by university faculty members, has commercialized an AI-powered system for real-time translation between sign language and speech. Other programmes take a wider view. Last year, through its Conscious Investor Fellowship programme, startAD trained members of sovereign funds, corporations, philanthropies and government agencies — half of them women — to invest capital in the climate sector in line with regional priorities.\n\nDENISE PIRES DE CARVALHO: Boost the employability of PhD holders\nDenise Pires de Carvalho is working to shorten the time students spend earning a PhD in Brazil.Credit: Moisés Pimentel, UFRJ\n\nIn many countries, PhD students are trained mainly to enter academia rather than to take up jobs in industry or other roles in society. But this is particularly true in Brazil, where only 12.5% of PhD holders were employed in industry in 2021, compared with 43% in the United States. Narrow job prospects can discourage students from pursuing PhDs. For example, master’s and PhD enrolments in Brazil declined between 2017 and 2022, especially in engineering, which saw a drop of 36%.\n\nTogether with colleagues at the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES), I am working to change the university system to make postgraduates more employable.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\nOne priority is to shorten the time students spend earning their doctoral degrees. In Brazil, many undergraduates participate in programmes that offer early research experiences. Counting such work towards a doctorate would reduce the length of time it takes to get a PhD and could help to lower the average age at which doctorates are awarded. This would enable postgraduates to enter the workforce earlier — alleviating concerns that those individuals might have about starting to pay into social security or pension schemes much later than many people of the same age. To support this, CAPES is encouraging students and funding agencies to convert master’s scholarships into doctorates or to streamline the transition between these two stages.\n\nCloser relationships must also be forged between research universities and companies. Governments should boost investments in programmes that let graduate students work in industrial placements during their studies, and universities should revise their curricula in scientific fields to improve their alignment with industry requirements. Building bridges is the only way to meet societal demands in crucial fields such as energy and AI.\n\nLORNA DOUGAN: Nurture creativity in science\nLorna Dougan’s physics undergraduates collaborate on creative projects in their degree.Credit: University of Leeds\n\nCreativity is a crucial skill in the workplace. It underpins innovation and problem-solving and can help with grasping complex concepts. Some educational settings include the arts with science, technology, engineering and mathematics: STEAM, not STEM. But in universities, arts and STEM often remain separated, perpetuating the view that a student is either a ‘creative’ or a ‘science’ person.",

          "abstract": "After a mouse received treatment to eliminate immune cells called microglia, it was injected with human progenitor cells that developed into human immune cells (green, pink and blue) in the animal’s brain.Credit: M. M.-D. Madler et al./Nature\n\nA fresh supply of the immune cells that keep the brain tidy might one day help to treat a host of conditions, from ultra-rare genetic disorders to more familiar scourges, such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nIn the past few months, a spate of new studies have highlighted the potential of a technique called microglia replacement and explored ways to make it safer and more effective. “This approach is very promising,” says Pasqualina Colella, who studies gene and cell therapy at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “But the caveat is the toxicity of the procedure.”\n\nNew hope for Alzheimer’s: lithium supplement reverses memory loss in mice\n\nMicroglia are immune cells that patrol the brain, gobbling up foreign invaders, damaged cells and harmful substances. They can help to protect neurons — cells that transmit and receive messages to and from other tissues — during seizures and strokes, and they prune unneeded connections between neurons during normal brain development.\n\n“Microglia do a lot of important things,” says Chris Bennett, a psychiatrist who studies microglia at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “So, it’s not surprising that they are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases.”\n\nThose diseases include a suite of rare disorders caused by genetic mutations that directly affect microglia. Malfunctioning microglia have also been implicated in more familiar conditions with complex causes, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as ageing, says Bo Peng, a neuroscientist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.\n\nImmune-cell swap\n\nThis has led researchers to investigate a tantalizing possibility: that replacing disease-causing microglia could treat some brain conditions. But swapping out microglia poses special challenges. Physicians typically replace a person’s immune cells by performing a bone-marrow transplant, which provides a fresh supply of stem cells that shelter in the bone marrow and give rise to many immune cells. Microglia, however, reside almost exclusively in the central nervous system, and typically replenish themselves by dividing rather than relying on stem cells in the bone marrow to send in replacements.\n\nHow CRISPR gene editing could help treat Alzheimer’s\n\nPhysicians already use bone-marrow transplants to treat some rare diseases that affect microglia, such as a condition called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The treatment can be effective, says Marco Prinz, a neuropathologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, but the results are inconsistent and typically replace only a small percentage of the recipient’s natural microglia.\n\nIn July, Peng’s team used bone-marrow transplants to replace abnormal microglia resulting from a fatal brain disease called CAMP (CSF1R-associated microgliopathy). The treatment was a success both in mice and in a small trial of eight people with the rare disorder: none of the eight participants experienced a decline in their motor or cognitive abilities in the two years following the treatment1, whereas members of a control group who did not receive the procedure experienced a deterioration of both.\n\nOne possible reason for the success of the CAMP trial is the nature of the disease itself, says Bennett, because people with CAMP tend to produce relatively few microglia. This could leave space for the transplanted cells to thrive.\n\nOnerous regimen\n\nCreating that niche for the new microglia is a pivotal step in microglia replacement — and a source of concern. To make room for transplanted cells, physicians must first wipe out as many of the brain’s resident microglia as possible. This can entail high levels of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both of which can leave the recipient vulnerable to infection during the procedure and raise their long-term risk of cancer. That means that microglia replacement is, for the moment, too toxic to be used except in severe, rapidly progressing diseases such as CAMP, says Colella.",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "The US government invests in vaccine development to, in part, protect soldiers from dangerous pathogens in various parts of the world.Credit: Jon Cherry/Getty\n\nThe abrupt termination last month of nearly half a billion dollars in US government contracts for mRNA vaccine research rattled scientists working inside and outside industry. The cuts raised alarm about the country’s commitment to the Nobel-prizewinning technology, which is credited with saving millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and is regarded as essential for fighting viruses in the future.\n\nHow political attacks could crush the mRNA vaccine revolution\n\nYet not all large-scale research into mRNA vaccines in the United States is being dismantled. Nature has learnt that, even as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) — led by vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr — pulls back, the country’s military continues to bankroll parts of the same research.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries are programmes developing vaccines against some of the world’s deadliest pathogens, including the virus that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne disease that kills up to 40% of those infected. In the United States, the government considers such research crucial because these pathogens not only threaten soldiers deployed abroad, but could also ignite a global outbreak.\n\n“A lot of us are at least relieved the Department of Defense [DoD] is not abandoning mRNA research,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nStill, he cautions that the HHS’s rejection of the technology, combined with broader policy fractures across the government, threatens to hobble national — and global — readiness for emerging infectious threats.\n\n“The whole biodefence structure is completely derailed,” Adalja says. “I’ve never seen it be disconnected like this.”\n\nTurbulent times\n\nPeter Berglund learnt that his company’s federally backed vaccine programme was being cut the same way that many other affected firms did in a 5 August notice from the HHS’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which ordered an immediate shutdown of ongoing studies. For Berglund, chief scientific officer at HDT Bio in Seattle, Washington, the news was a gut punch, as he told colleagues at a conference on RNA-based therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts, this month.\n\nNIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?\n\nHDT had been developing a next-generation CCHF vaccine based on a form of RNA that can copy itself inside cells. The company had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, which it used first to test a shot in mice1 and monkeys2, and then to begin a human trial in Texas this July. The BARDA memo brought everything to a halt the very next month.\n\nBut “that was mommy”, Berglund says. “Then daddy calls.”\n\nWithin days, HDT executives heard from project managers at the DoD’s Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, which had been co-funding the CCHF vaccine research. HDT was told to restart its trial, with the JPEO pledging support through at least this first phase of clinical evaluation.\n\n“It’s been so turbulent,” Berglund says. The DoD funding, although substantial, is less than what had originally been pledged in conjunction with BARDA. “But, at least now we can advance it through phase I” and worry about the rest later, he adds.\n\nA ‘restructuring’ of resources\n\nOthers with projects co-funded by the JPEO also learnt of funding cuts and a “restructuring of collaborations” in the 5 August notice. But their situation is less clear.\n\nEarlier this month, AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, UK, began a human trial of two mRNA vaccines, despite the notice. Each is designed to protect against a different strain of avian influenza. Clinical-trial registries still list both BARDA and the JPEO as collaborators.\n\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson declined to comment on the US government’s role in funding the trial against bird flu — which has been infecting US poultry and dairy cattle and raising the spectre of a leap into humans. The JPEO did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard disputed suggestions that withdrawing from joint projects would weaken the nation’s pandemic preparedness, writing that “BARDA is prioritizing evidence-based, ethically grounded solutions”.\n\nLike its relative Ebola, Marburg virus can also cause haemorrhagic fever.Credit: NIAID/SPL\n\nThe JPEO and BARDA had also been jointly funding a preclinical-stage vaccine programme for biotechnology firm Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts3. The mRNA shot is aimed at Marburg virus — a close but even deadlier relative of Ebola — which caused an outbreak earlier this year in northwest Tanzania, resulting in ten deaths. Neither Moderna nor its collaborator, the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, responded to e-mails from Nature seeking comment on the project’s funding status.",

          "abstract": "Travis Oliphant: scientist, software developer, entrepreneur and now, subject of a documentary.Credit: Christi Norris/BYU\n\nIn 2005, Travis Oliphant was an information scientist working on medical and biological imaging at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, when he began work on NumPy, a library that has become a linchpin of scientific computing in the Python programming language.\n\nOliphant came across Python as a graduate student in 1998 and, as he wrote in the Guide to NumPy (2006), “quickly fell in love” with it. That “is a remarkable statement to make about a programming language”, he acknowledged. “If I had not seen others with the same view, I might have seriously doubted my sanity.”\n\nBut as he explained to Nature, Python has two particularly attractive features, even for a programmer who is conversant in more powerful languages: it’s easy to read — “executable English”, as he puts it — and extensible. Oliphant would go on to write or contribute to two of the language’s most crucial extensions: NumPy and SciPy.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of downloads per month, NumPy simplifies and standardizes the treatment of complex numeric arrays, enabling mathematical computations that are necessary to do science — including artificial intelligence (AI) — in the Python language. This is one reason why Python has become the go-to language of scientific computing. As a 2020 Nature research article pointed out1 , “NumPy underpins almost every Python library that does scientific or numerical computation, which includes SciPy but also Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn and scikit-image.” SciPy, in turn, is a collection of scientific algorithms, many of which Oliphant created.\n\nNow a technology entrepreneur and chief AI scientist at OpenTeams in Austin, Texas, Oliphant has gone from scientist to software developer to chief executive to venture capitalist — all thanks to NumPy, he says. “NumPy has been a driving force for my whole life.”\n\nNow, his career has taken him to the silver screen. Last month, the YouTube channel CultRepo, whose films tell the human stories behind technologies, released a movie about the programming language and its backstory. Fittingly, the official premiere for Python: The Documentary was held at PyCon Greece, a conference dedicated to the language, in Athens on 28 August.\n\nOliphant features in the 84-minute film, alongside Guido van Rossum, who created the language at the end of 1989. A separate featurette, also released last month, focuses on NumPy and SciPy, with Oliphant in a starring role.\n\nNature chose to mark the 20th anniversary of NumPy’s creation by asking Oliphant to reflect on two decades of array arithmetic.\n\nWhy did you develop NumPy?\n\nNumPy was a merger of two existing array libraries in the Python ecosystem. When I started using Python in 1998, a library called Numeric already existed. Numeric was written in 1995 by Jim Hugunin, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He was a pioneer and a brilliant technologist: he basically built an amazing ‘while-loop’, a block of code that executes as long as a specified condition remains true. And this while-loop did a bunch of things that made it easy to do mathematics using big arrays of numbers.\n\nAround 2000, computer scientists began writing a new library, called NumArray. NumArray was a replacement for Numeric, with more sophisticated querying and support for more expanded data types. But I saw it as a problem because SciPy worked only with Numeric — and people were starting to write libraries that worked only with NumArray. There was a library, called ndimage, that did image processing. And I liked image processing — that was a big part of my graduate research, and it worked only with NumArray.\n\nSo I saw this divided community. That’s what prompted me to spend a year writing NumPy: I wanted to merge NumArray and Numeric together, to make it easier for this fledgling ecosystem of scientists using Python. I needed to help myself, too, because I was also a user.\n\nWhat were some key innovations?\n\nLooking back on my work on NumPy, a few things stick out as really compelling. First, it was a blend of two array structures. And there was a whole lot of backward-compatibility work to make sure that every NumArray user and every Numeric user could still use NumPy, without having to make a lot of changes to their code.\n\nAnother innovation involves ‘typing’. Python uses ‘dynamic typing’, in which variables can be attached to different types of object. For instance, a variable can refer first to an integer but then be reassigned to a string of text. But each object itself has a definitive type. The innovation in NumPy was related to what is contained in the array. I introduced the concept of the data type, or dtype, which defines the type of thing inside the array — is it a 32-bit float? An 8-bit integer? It’s the detail of what the bits are inside the array.\n\nAnother breakthrough was the universal function, or how to perform operations on two arrays that are not the same shape. For example, it’s very easy to understand what to do if you have a 3 × 3 array and you want to add to another 3 × 3 array: just add each element. But what if I have a 1 × 3 array, and I want to add it to a 3 × 3 array — what do I do there? There’s something called broadcasting, in which you assume the 1 × 3 array is actually 3 × 3, and you just add them elementwise. NumPy exposed the broadcasting algorithm in such a way that anybody could build on it.\n\nHow has NumPy changed over 20 years?\n\nThe changes have been slow. And it’s a trade-off for success, actually. When nobody is adopting your library, you have all kinds of room to change it quickly. Once people start adopting it at scale, it’s really hard to make changes without creating a lot of disruption. So, you have to create a process for that. It’s expensive, actually.\n\nFor me, one question has been a big motivator: how do we pay for this? How do we create companies and alignment approaches that allow open-source software to be funded, developed, sustained, supported and innovated on?\n\nSo that’s how open source has taken me on a journey from scientist to software developer to chief executive to venture capitalist. It’s all tied to NumPy — NumPy has been a driving force for my whole life, actually. And I still feel very much a part of it.\n\nIn 2018, I created Quansight, a Python-focused consulting firm in Austin, and Quansight Labs, the firm’s public-benefit division, followed in 2019. And Ralf Gommers, a central maintainer of NumPy and SciPy, helped to do that. He just became the co-chief-executive of Quansight Public Benefit Corporation (formerly Quansight Labs), along with Tania Allard. Quansight now has people who work on NumPy, SciPy, Python and the rest of the ecosystem, funded by grants, customer projects and investment revenue.\n\nI'm very proud of Quansight because I left academia in 2007 to get into entrepreneurship and to work out how to fund NumPy and SciPy, and I now have a company that actually pays people to work on the products. It just took me a little while. I don’t know whether that means that I’m not very good at it, but it’s definitely passion driven.\n\nWhere does NumPy fall short?\n\nI would say there’s two things that NumPy didn’t add early enough to really be the fundamental ground on which everybody built their AI models. First, it didn’t support graphics processing units (GPUs). It worked on central processing units (CPUs), but modern machine learning and deep learning rely on GPUs for training. The shift to GPUs led to modern breakthroughs in the field; it’s why NVIDIA, a tech company in Santa Clara, California, that makes GPUs, is doing so well. The machine-learning libraries PyTorch and TensorFlow worked with GPUs from the beginning. But NumPy does not use GPUs natively, and that’s a big thing that’s caused it not to be as useful as it could have been.",

Credit: Diana Bagnoli/Getty\n\nScientists moved a step closer to understanding the complex causes of autism spectrum disorder this week. Although all of the headlines went to US President Donald Trump’s poorly evidenced statements that the painkiller acetaminophen is linked to the neurodevelopmental condition, his White House autism event brought welcome — and largely overlooked — news to scientists: the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is investing US$50 million in an unusual autism-research effort.\n\nTrump and Jayanta Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, announced on 22 September that 13 research groups will receive funding under the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI), a Trump-administration programme to fund studies that explore how interacting genetic and environmental factors contribute to autism. “This is where the field needs to be going in searching for the complex causes of autism,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, who studies autism at Boston University, Massachusetts.\n\nTrump team backs an unproven drug for autism — but does it work?\n\nThe funded projects range from studies on environmental exposures during pregnancy to experiments on brain cells. Funding was also awarded to efforts to replicate the projects’ results and so ensure that they are robust.\n\nResearchers, although pleased by the aims of the funded work and the rigour of the methods, have some concerns about the project. Several ADSI-funding recipients say that they are expected to complete their projects relatively quickly — within three years instead of the usual five — and some say that they are alert to political interference with their results. Trump prompted fierce pushback from scientists with his statements about acetaminophen — also known as paracetamol — earlier this week, given the lack of convincing evidence to support a link with autism. “We should wait until the research happens before announcing an answer,” says Jason Stein, a neuroscientist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who received an ADSI grant.\n\n“This is not political interference, but rather a bold, science-driven effort to deliver meaningful answers more quickly,” said a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS), which oversees the NIH.\n\nQuick turnaround\n\nThe NIH announced the ADSI in May and invited researchers to submit grant applications for research into the causes of autism, its growing prevalence and potential interventions. Some researchers expressed concern that applicants had only a month to submit proposals — much less time than usual — and it was unclear who was reviewing the grants and with what criteria. Some worried that the funding would be channelled to researching the discredited idea promoted by Trump’s health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr that vaccines are linked to autism. “Some people thought: maybe we should steer clear of this,” says Judith Miller, a psychologist who studies autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania\n\nIn the end, nearly 250 research teams applied, and no awards were granted to projects that focus explictly on autism and vaccines.\n\nSeveral of the projects will involve exposomics: the study of the array of environmental factors to which a person is exposed. Miller is leading a three-year, $4.3-million project combining genome and exposome data to seek factors associated with autism. The project will draw on previously collected data on more than 100,000 children, including about 4,000 autistic children, and connect those to maternal-health records. The research team plans to use information on where participants live to add in data on air quality, access to green spaces and other environmental markers. “We haven’t been able to bring this type of data all together in a clinical population” before, Miller says.\n\nReplication requirement\n\nStein and his team, by contrast, are examining autism using brain organoids grown from the stem cells of autistic and non-autistic children. The researchers plan to expose the tissue to substances that epidemiological studies have linked to autism — such as valproic acid, a drug used to treat epilepsy — and examine how this affects gene activity.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?",

          "abstract": "Engineer John Logie Baird used ventriloquist dummies in early experiments of his invention: the television.Credit: Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty\n\nLong before modern technology, the principle of the common good existed. It was not born with society itself, but later, with an awareness that if it were neglected, a society might collapse.\n\nPrinciples that promote social cohesion and well-being are found in most cultures. Early examples include the millennia-old Code of Hammurabi, which punished certain liars with a humiliating haircut1, and ancient Biblical law, which required landowners to leave part of their harvest for orphans, widows, foreigners and poor people.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nThe real difficulty has been recognizing the boundaries that humans tend to draw when applying such codes. Do we include others, or only our species, culture, country or family? That ambiguity is where the problems begin.\n\nLack of commitment to the common good is evident in many of today’s challenges — conflict, inequality, humanitarian crises and environmental degradation. And now, it clearly extends beyond the physical world, to the digital universe, in which people spend an ever-growing portion of their lives.\n\nIt’s a good time to take stock, 100 years after inventor John Logie Baird successfully transmitted human faces through television, paving the way for today’s countless streams of online content, shaped by algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAre we, as a society, ensuring that communication technologies preserve the common good, or at least do not harm it? I think we’re not, but we should. Here, I set out a manifesto calling for algorithms to be designed and used with the common good in mind.\n\nNew media, old problem\n\nIn the twentieth century, television stood out as one of the main technologies shaping people’s perception of reality. People nowadays associate the word ‘television’ with the device, but when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi first used the term in 1900, he was naming a broader idea: the transmission of images at a distance2.\n\nBuilding on that concept, the world of images that now surrounds us — from streaming to social media — can be considered as just one more evolution of television. Technological progress is clear, but social progress is stagnant.\n\nA man’s face transmitted in a public demonstration of television in 1926.Credit: Ann Ronan Pictures/Print Collector/Getty\n\nIn the early days of television, despite the many private interests surrounding it, there were concrete efforts, in several regions at least, to steer it towards the common good. Broadcasts were guided by principles such as public interest and public service.\n\nNow, however, these pursuits are increasingly being held hostage to algorithms, AI and a handful of private companies (legitimately driven by self-interest and profit). In many ways, this is far from what people experienced in the past century. Yet the pursuit of the common good must remain. After all — and this is not mere rhetoric — our future depends on it.\n\nFortunately, we have acquired a century of learning.\n\nThe great rewiring: is social media really behind an epidemic of teenage mental illness?\n\nThe habit of seeing images from afar is not new — it has been part of humanity since the first expressions of imagination and storytelling. Fireside stories and artworks in ancient times, for example, reveal not only the earliest seeds of television — in images conjured by the imagination — but also their dual potential. They either served the public by reinforcing social values and creating shared references, or they neglected that role in favour of private interests, by fostering exclusion or spreading misinformation.\n\nTelevision, and what followed, merely technologized this practice. On 2 October 1925, Baird reported a symbolic moment. He transmitted, in greyscale, the recognizable image of a face — first, a dummy’s head, and then the face of a young man called William Taynton. This was the first time that such a feat had been achieved3.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1960, television technology consolidated and acquired a social dimension. As more people used it, concerns arose about its role. Two models emerged, which shaped the evolution of television around the world, and drew on principles already established for radio, such as the BBC Royal Charter and the US Radio Act of 1927.\n\nThe public-service model — focused on citizens — aims to always promote social cohesion and well-being. This model was favoured in the United Kingdom, and still drives the ethos of the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation).\n\nCrowds gathered to watch the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969 on large television screens. Credit: CBS Photo Archive/Getty\n\nThe commercial model — focused on profit — aims not to compromise those values in the pursuit of gain. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) pioneered this service in the United States. Even using the commercial model, working for the common good cannot be ignored. Because these companies operate inside society, they are also expected to act in the public interest.\n\nThe lesson is this: it is up to society to ensure, through regulation, not only that the main players shaping our digital landscape do no harm, but also that they ‘pay back’ for occupying social space, through concrete actions in favour of the common good, at a local or global scale.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1990, the television set became one of the most influential objects in the world. A common idea of global reality began to take hold through mass audiences that watched global events, such as the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing and news reports from the Vietnam War. Yet, as the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO warned in a 1980 report4, the vision people got was sometimes incomplete, filtered by the producing countries. Although controversial then, from today’s perspective, this criticism seems less like calling out censorship and more like a plea for fairness.\n\nWhy we need mandatory safeguards for emotionally responsive AI\n\nA further lesson can be drawn: a freer, more globally connected and technologically dependent world must not seek to homogenize everything and everyone, but to ensure that all differences are seen, respected and heard.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, the generalist logic of television, in which large mixed audiences receive the same programming, was increasingly replaced by diverse and specialized interests in production and consumption — a trend that was tremendously amplified by the popularization of the Internet. It was the start of the transition to our current world, which is awash with information. Yet, as UNESCO also noted in 20055, one challenge was to ensure that all this information was not only accessible and respectful of freedom of expression, but also transformed into knowledge that benefited people and societies.\n\nToday, this remains a crucial challenge. Free access to the digital ecosystem and all that it offers is not enough. It is equally essential to ensure that its use serves the good of both the individual and the collective.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2025, users of smartphones and people with Internet access have increasingly shaped the media. To enhance that experience, other protagonists entered the scene, notably social-media algorithms and AI tools. Ideas, generality and predictability gradually gave way to emotion, personalization and randomness. The sense of community shifted: it no longer depends so much on physical space, but on shared interests, habits and online content.\n\nThe digital world is no longer separate from everyday life — it is officially part of it, with access required for schools, public services, banking and work. That changes everything. As UNESCO reminded us in 2023, respect for human rights must be the fuel of the digital world, not left at the doorstep6.\n\nThe concern of a century ago is not so different from now: to give social and democratic meaning to the images that surround us. In the past, those images were shaped by human hands. Today, non-human agents have entered the scene, filtering, organizing and directing much of what we see, read and hear.\n\nWe need a new ethics for a world of AI agents\n\nAt this stage, the most important question might no longer be: where is technological progress heading? Rather, after all this technological advancement, where does social and democratic progress stand? Is the idea of public service still included in social media and AI today?",

          "title": "What research might be lost after the NIH’s cuts? Nature trained a bot to find out",
          "authors": "Vera Nienaber, Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "Credit: adapted from Getty\n\nSoon after US President Donald Trump came to office in January, his administration began cutting funding for scientific research in areas it sees as related to ‘woke’ ideologies. Grants related to transgender health care, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and health disparities in minority groups have been some of the most targeted.\n\nIt’s impossible to know what the impact of these cuts will be on the science of the future: the research that might have emerged but that will now not exist. The administration would argue that’s a good thing; tax dollars are no longer being spent on projects it sees as antithetical to the US way of life.\n\nA machine-learning analysis by Nature Index attempts to give a sense of the value of the research that might have been lost, by trying to reproduce the rationale the National Institutes of Health (NIH) used to cancel grants, then applying that method to science that was in the pipeline around ten years ago.\n\nMachine learning reveals potential consequences of cuts to US research\n\nThere are, of course, limitations to the insights that such an analysis can provide. A decade ago, science was done in a different political context: it’s impossible to know what grants the Trump administration would have cancelled if it were in power back then. The model used was also trained on a relatively small amount of data and simply considers patterns and associations in grants cancelled this year.\n\nThe work suggests, however, that some highly impactful science — from breakthroughs in mapping the human genome to life-saving cancer-screening techniques — might have been at risk of not being funded had a similar process been followed a decade ago.\n\nThe exact method that the Trump administration has used to identify which research grants to cancel is a mystery. But, however the decisions have been made, the cuts have been deep, amounting to at least US$4 billion so far from just the NIH and National Science Foundation (NSF), the two largest federal research funders in the United States.\n\nMany of these cancellations have been tracked by Grant Witness, a website set up for this purpose. They have generally focused on research related to topics around DEI, race equity and gender studies, although other tranches of cancellations have targeted institutions — such as Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Grants related to other topics but were awarded as part of a racial-justice or equality initiative were also targeted.\n\nFor grants cancelled on the basis of their research topic, bibliometrics researchers have suggested that the administration circulated a list of 200 or so words or phrases — including ‘transgender’, ‘DEI’ and ‘disparities’ — that automatically flag grants for review. A similar list has been circulated to federal departments and these terms have been removed from messaging and websites, as reported by The New York Times in March.\n\nMore clues might be found in an account given by an ex-employee at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — the body set up by the Trump administration to cut public spending seen as excessive. The employee told investigative website ProPublica in June that he had used generative artificial intelligence (AI) to assess contracts for cancellation at the US Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAt scale\n\nThe lack of a transparent methodology for identifying grants for review was discussed in a June court hearing, at which a federal judge ordered the government to restore some of the cancelled grants (that ruling has since been superseded by a Supreme Court decision that allows the cuts to go ahead).\n\n“I think what may have been happening is that somebody, not a scientist, was sitting behind their computer and searching for keywords that they didn’t like,” says Scott Delaney, an environmental-health researcher and one of the founders of Grant Witness. Then they were cancelling grants without regard to the research involved or the impact that the grant might have, he adds. Until last week, Delaney worked at Harvard but he has now resigned because of the impact of the cancellations on his research.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nIn an attempt to reproduce the methodology for identifying NIH grants to cut, Nature Index’s editorial team worked with data scientists at Nature Research Intelligence, which manages the Nature Index database. The idea was to train a machine-learning algorithm using information on cancelled grants from the NIH’s Reporter database, Digital Science’s Dimensions database and Grant Witness. (Nature Index’s editorial team is editorially independent of Nature Research Intelligence, which is part of Springer Nature.)\n\nThe machine-learning model looked at keywords in the titles and abstracts of cancelled grants listed on Grant Witness to get an idea of what sorts of grant were targeted (see Supplementary information for methodology). It also considered the size of the grant and how much of the funding period was left.\n\nAfter training and evaluation, we deleted the training data and applied the model to all active NIH grants listed in the Dimensions database at the start of the year, assigning each a predicted risk of cancellation on the basis of these features. It predicted with an overall accuracy of 90%: nine out of ten times, it correctly predicted whether a grant was or wasn’t cancelled. Of those grants that we know were cancelled, it correctly predicted cancellation 70% of the time.\n\nAccording to the model, the phrases and words that were most likely to lead to cancellation included ‘gender-affirming care’, ‘assigned male at birth’, ‘affirming care’, ‘racial justice’, ‘LGBTQ’ and ‘hate speech’.\n\nHistory in the making\n\nTo get an idea of how such cuts can affect science, we applied the model to NIH grants that were active in 2014. We then identified papers that were funded by those grants and ranked them by the number of citations that they had accumulated (see ‘Lost effort’ and Supplementary information).\n\nThe algorithm found 1,287 grants — worth $1.9 billion — that it considered likely to be cancelled, of a total of around 48,000. Around 53,000 publications are related to those flagged grants. Although the grants were active in 2014, some had begun several years before that, and many of the associated papers were therefore published before 2014. The oldest grant — to train postdocs in translational neuroscience — started in 1977, and some of the papers date back to 2002.\n\nThe results show the damage that cuts in funding can do to research, and the unpredictable nature of the research process. Although the model was trained on grants that were ostensibly cancelled for ideological reasons, papers that ensued from similar grants that were active in 2014 were not all about transgender health or health inequities. Rather, they encompassed a wide range of research fields and topics.\n\nFor example, one grant that the model predicted would have been cancelled, partly on the basis of its repeated mentions of ‘diversity’, led to a paper1 that described a software technique to help genetics researchers to identify chimaeras — DNA sequences that can confound analyses of large pools of genetic material. The paper was among the most-cited in the analysis, with 10,400 citations.\n\n“It is quite common in biology for rather ho-hum methods to be more highly cited than important discovery papers. Everyone needs test tubes and pipettes,” according to Robert Edgar, an independent scientist and lead author of the chimaera paper.\n\nOther highly cited studies that might not have existed if their grant had been cancelled include a seminal paper showcasing the results of the Human Microbiome Project2, the result of a $10-million package over five years to increase the understanding of the human microbiome. The work was probably flagged by the algorithm because three of its supporting grants referenced the diversity of genetic populations.\n\nLost effort\n\nThese NIH grants that were active in 2014 were identified by a machine-learning model as likely to have been cancelled had a similar process to this year’s grant cuts been followed in the past. They are ordered by the total citations achieved by their associated research publications. Many grants share a name with the institute they were used to set up.\n\nGrant titleFunding amount (US$)Grant start dateNumber of publications associated with grantTotal citations collected by publications UCLA* Clinical and Translational Science Institute$57 million20113,316258,520Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute$48 million20132,358131,852Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center$58 million20122,22276,882North Carolina Translational & Clinical Sciences Institute$44 million20131,20376,356Michigan Center for Diabetes Translational Research$9 million20111,59170,076Framingham Heart Study/Fox$7 million201023762,735Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology$9 million200290356,430Defining the Human Microbiome$10 million20093847,094UCLA* Clinical and Translational Science Institute$15 million201148042,901San Diego Center for Systems Biology: From Maps to Models$23 million201027442,364*University of California, Los Angeles\n\n“It’s our whole field! Dammit,” says Ruth Ley, one of the co-authors of the human-microbiome paper and now the director of the department of microbiome science at the University of Tübingen in Germany.\n\n“That particular grant was a big multicentre thing, but it had amazing trickle-down effects,” she says. “The Human Microbiome Project was an enormous consortium — anyone who wanted to work with the data could.”\n\nThis meant, Ley says, that they needed to build a standardization process for how the data were shared and stored, what analysis techniques were used, and how the papers were written and published — all funded by that grant. “What came out of it for the whole field was how we should be doing this stuff,” she says.\n\n“It wouldn't have happened without that grant. No way. No way.”\n\nWider impact\n\nAnother grant flagged by the model was one that, in 2009, funded the long-term running of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, part of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to the tune of $57 million. The institute aims to train clinical scientists to run studies and ultimately to bring research into health care. The model found keywords in the grant, such as ‘expression’, that increased the chances of cancellation, as did the size of the grant.\n\nThe institute went on to produce more than 3,000 publications. Among the most highly cited of them, with 9,674 citations, was a 2011 study3 that found that lung-cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans was more effective than use of conventional radiography, and reduced death rates by 20%.",

          "abstract": "Semantic priming has been studied for nearly 50 years across various experimental manipulations and theoretical frameworks. Although previous studies provide insight into the cognitive underpinnings of semantic representations, they have suffered from small sample sizes and a lack of linguistic and cultural diversity. In this Registered Report, we measured the size and the variability of the semantic priming effect across 19 languages (n = 25,163 participants analysed) by creating the largest available database of semantic priming values using an adaptive sampling procedure. We found evidence for semantic priming in terms of differences in response latencies between related word-pair conditions and unrelated word-pair conditions. Model comparisons showed that the inclusion of a random intercept for language improved model fit, providing support for variability in semantic priming across languages. This study highlights the robustness and variability of semantic priming across languages and provides a rich, linguistically diverse dataset for further analysis.

          "abstract": "The awareness of individuals regarding their social network surroundings and their capacity to use social connections to their advantage are well-established human characteristics. Economic games, incorporated with network science, are frequently used to examine social behaviour. Traditionally, such game models and experiments artificially limit players’ abilities to take varied actions towards distinct social neighbours, thereby constraining their social networking agency. Here we designed an experimental paradigm that alters this agency and applied it to the prisoner’s dilemma (N = 735), trust game (N = 735) and ultimatum game (N = 735) to investigate cooperation, trust and fairness. Granting participants greater network agency led to more prosocial behaviour across all three economic games, resulting in higher wealth and lower inequality compared with control groups. These findings suggest that incorporating social networking agency into experimental designs better captures the prosocial potential of human behaviour.",

A recent international study using data from over 1.2 million adolescents across 43 countries found that this gap has grown particularly in more gender-equal countries not because boys’ mental health has improved, but because girls’ symptoms have worsened disproportionately1. Another longitudinal cross-cultural study that enrolled adolescents in Tokyo and London found that depressive symptoms among girls increased year by year between ages 12 (2012–2014) and 16 (2018–2020) with no comparable trends among boys — which has resulted in a widening gender gap, although age and calendar-year effects could not be disentangled2.\n\nTraditionally, suicide has been more prevalent among male individuals, both in Japan and internationally. The reversal of this long-standing pattern among children and adolescents in Japan represents a unique concern in youth mental health.",

To address the problem of unseen selective inference, researchers now use practices such as preregistration, data sharing and reproducible computing3.\n\nHowever, these means do not address an overlooked and far more prevalent issue: the failure to adjust for the multiple inferences that are evident in the published work.

The cultural logic of ‘honour’ is frequently studied in relation to conflict, but its role in competition and cooperation remains underexplored. The current study investigates how perceived normative and personally endorsed honour values predict competition and cooperation behaviours. In an online experiment testing preregistered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

A large literature documents the adverse impacts of ambient air pollution on human health. In contrast, there is a lack of comparable research studying the effects of air pollution on animal health. We fill this gap, utilizing 5 y of data on over seven million visits to veterinary practices across the United Kingdom. Leveraging within-city variation in daily monitor-measured air pollution levels, we find that increases in fine particulate matter (i.e., PM 2.5 ) are associated with significant increases in the number of vet visits for both cats and dogs. In aggregate, these estimates suggest that reducing ambient PM 2.5 levels to a maximum of 5 mg per cubic meter as recommended by the World Health Organization would result in a 0.7 to 2.5% reduction in vet visits.",

Although hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social function, their respective contributions to the process of social pain empathy have not been systematically characterized. To address this, we employed a multimethod approach, combining naturalistic fMRI, functional decoding, gene expression analysis, and pharmacological modulation using intranasal administration of OXT (24 IU) or AVP (20 IU) in a cohort of 163 participants. Our findings indicated that both OXT and AVP significantly enhanced pain empathy compared to placebo, with overlapping yet distinct neurofunctional and genetic modulation patterns. Specially, both neuropeptides engaged a shared perception-cognition-emotion network, including frontal regions, the insula, superior temporal sulcus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Crucially, they exhibited divergent mechanistic profiles: OXT preferentially influenced resting-state connectivity and perceptional-visual processing areas, while AVP exerted stronger modulation on perceptional-execution circuits. These differential effects aligned with their unique receptor expression patterns and interactions with distinct genetic systems. By delineating how OXT and AVP shape the multidimensional nature of social pain empathy, our findings provide a neurobiological framework for understanding these processes and offer potential pathways for targeted interventions in social cognition disorders.",

Yet in practice, prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, and even as prizes proliferate, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic’s historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners’ papers become more innovative than their matched peers. This difference widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to nonprizewinners, prizewinners’ collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The findings’ implications for innovation in science and the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.",

Recognizing nature’s diverse values in decisions is a fundamental lever for sustainability transformation. While economic valuation of nature has a long history, it has struggled to recognize the full suite of nature’s values, particularly the broad, relational, intrinsic, and shared values reflecting the complexity of human–nature relationships. We explore opportunities to expand the consideration of values within the economics of biodiversity by reviewing conventional and heterodox economic approaches. We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames. Our perspective transcends the dominant economic framing of nature as a passive, largely substitutable asset, to also consider nature as place, self, and harboring agency. This helps to overcome the limitations of conventional economic assumptions, better reflects peoples’ lived experiences, and supports transformations toward more just and sustainable futures.",

However, there is much less evidence on the inequitable consequences of water pollution and policies affecting water pollution gaps. This study uncovers the distributional impact of China’s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010), which triggered spatially differentiated water pollution abatement for a population of almost 1.3 billion. We document that the policy reduced water pollution overall, targeting areas based on pollution level. Since high pollution areas tend to be wealthier, this policy concentrated firm water pollution abatement and reductions in polluting firm entry in higher-SES areas. While pollution fell, the policy further widened the gap in health and economic outcomes, particularly for those without tap water access: Disparities in risks of tumor, cardiovascular disease, labor supply, and wages increased. Our findings demonstrate that policy-induced changes in water pollution can interact with unequal access to defensive infrastructure to exacerbate SES gaps in outcomes. The analysis also suggests that consideration of heterogeneous pollution vulnerability across the population may affect the overall benefits of a policy.",

A replicon, which was deleted in six genes (3a, 3c, E, 6, 7a, and 7b) was selected. Cells infected with the RR vaccine candidate led to the formation of virus-like particles that, due to the failure of being secreted, increase vaccine safety, in contrast to the wild type virions. The replicon maintained the production of RNAs encoding at least proteins S, M, and N for several days. Intranasal immunization with the RR of transgenic mice, expressing human ACE2, elicited respiratory mucosal immunity. Immunization protected against challenge with SARS-CoV-2, inducing IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike (S) protein, the receptor binding domain, N and M proteins, and cellular immune responses (CD4 + , CD8 + , and long-term memory T cells). Coinfection of cells with the RR vaccine and a full-length SARS-CoV-2 led to a significant inhibition of replication of full-length virus, increasing the safety of the RR vaccine. The RR vaccine induced a minor inflammatory reaction in the absence of major side effects and was stable at different temperatures. An updated RR expressing XBB.1.5 S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies against the homologous virus and provided full protection against recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

          "authors": "Shijia Peng, Aaron M. Ellison, Charles C. Davis",
          "abstract": "Climate change is altering the timing of species’ life-cycle events (i.e., phenology), but the rates of phenological shifts vary across taxa. These mismatches in phenological response may disrupt interactions between interdependent species, such as plants and their pollinators, which may lead to reduced plant reproduction via pollen limitation and thus contribute to secondary extinction risks for plants. However, secondary extinction risk is rarely assessed under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we used ca. 15,000 crowdsourced specimen records of Viola species and their solitary bee pollinators, spanning 120 y across the eastern United States, and integrated climate data, phenological information, and species distribution models to quantify the risk of secondary plant extinction associated with phenological mismatch with their bee pollinators. We further examined geographical patterns in secondary extinction risk for plants and explored how their interactions between plants and generalist versus specialist pollinators influence such risk. Secondary local extinction risk of Viola spp. increases with latitude, indicating that future climate change will pose a greater threat to plant–bee pollinator networks at northern latitudes. Additionally, the sensitivity of secondary local extinction risk to phenological mismatch with both generalist and specialist bee pollinators varies by latitude, with specialist bees showing a sharper decline at higher latitudes. Our findings demonstrate that existing conservation priorities based solely on primary extinction risk directly caused by climate change may be insufficient to support self-sustaining populations of plants. Thus, incorporating secondary extinction risk resulting from ecological mismatches between plants and pollinators into future global conservation frameworks should be carefully considered.",

          "abstract": "Modularity among traits is thought to drive morphological evolution and diversification, with more modular species often showing greater morphological disparity and faster evolutionary rates. However, recent studies suggest this pattern is not universal, as higher integration can sometimes be linked to faster rates of evolution. In adaptive radiation, modularity likely facilitates morphological divergence, but its specific role in trait diversification within these events remains uncertain. Antarctic icefishes (Perciformes: Notothenioidei) have undergone adaptive radiation in the frigid Southern Ocean, yet the role of modularity in their craniofacial evolution remains poorly understood. Emerging from a common ancestor 22 Mya, these fishes developed unique morpho-physiological adaptations, such as antifreeze glycoproteins, that contributed to their evolutionary success, but the contribution of cranial modularity to their diversification is still unexplored. Here, we analyze skull shape across 172 perciform species using micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to investigate the tempo and mode of skull evolution in 80 notothenioids versus 92 perciform relatives. Notothenioids exhibit considerable cranial shape diversity, with skull shapes ranging from short to long faces. Fast rates of skull shape evolution occurred in smaller subclades following the emergence of cranial elongation, a derived trait within notothenioids. They also exhibit elevated evolutionary modularity relative to their perciform relatives, with reduced covariation among skeletal elements over time, likely corresponding with Miocene cooling events and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We propose that greater phenotypic modularity in notothenioid skulls represents a pivotal innovation, facilitating their evolutionary response to new ecological opportunities in the Antarctic.",

Here, we report the creation of a mouse model of MEPAN with patient-similar compound heterozygous mutations in the Mecr gene. The MEPAN mouse recapitulates the major hallmarks of MEPAN, including a movement disorder, optic neuropathy, defects in protein lipoylation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the brain. MECR catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), and the mechanism by which loss of mtFASII leads to neurological disease is unknown. LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of Mecr mutant cerebella identified loss of subunits of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and subunits of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) complex. Native gels revealed altered OXPHOS complex and supercomplex formation and changes in binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to mitochondrial complexes. These results demonstrate that MECR plays a key role in the acylation of ACP which is necessary for ACP-LYRM-mediated supercomplex modulation and ISC biogenesis and suggest unique pathways for therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Diverse factors, including environmental features and cognitive processes, can drive animals’ movements and space use, with far-reaching implications. For example, repeated use of individual-level travel routeways (directionally constrained but imperfectly aligned routes), which results in spatial concentration of activity, can shape encounter-based processes including predation, mate finding, and disease transmission. However, how much variation in routeway usage exists across species remains unknown. By analyzing GPS movement tracks for 1,239 range-resident mammalian carnivores—representing 16 canid and 18 felid species from six continents—we found strong evidence of a clade-level difference in species’ reliance on repeatedly used travel routeways. Across the global dataset, tracked canids had a 15% (±7 CI) greater density of routeways within their home ranges than did felids, rising to 33% (±16 CI) greater in landscapes shared with tracked felids. Moreover, comparisons within species across landscapes revealed broadly similar home range routeway densities despite habitat differences. On average, canids also reused their travel routeways more intensively than did felids, with hunting strategies and spatial contexts also contributing to the intensity of routeway usage. Collectively, our results suggest that key aspects of carnivore routeway-usage have an evolutionary component. Striking interspecific and clade-level differences in carnivores’ reliance on reused travel routeways within home ranges identify important ways in which the movement patterns of real-world predators depart from classical assumptions of predator-prey theory. Because such departures can drive key aspects of human-wildlife interactions and other encounter-based processes, continued investigations of the relationships between movement mechanisms and space use are critical.",

To address this question, we took advantage of the invariant embryonic lineage and adult nervous system in Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate a double mutant between spr-5/Lsd1/Kdm1a (H3K4me1/2 demethylase) and met-2/Setdb1/Kmt1e (H3K9 methyltransferase). We demonstrate that spr-5; met-2 double mutant worms have a severe chemotaxis defect caused by the ectopic expression of germline genes in somatic tissues. Despite this behavioral defect, we observe few embryonic lineage alterations and the normal complement of neurons. This raised the possibility that the abnormal chemotaxis behavior may be due to ongoing defects in terminally differentiated cells rather than alterations in development. Consistent with this possibility, we find that shutting off the ectopic expression of germline genes specifically in neurons rescues chemotaxis in spr-5; met-2 mutants. Remarkably, shutting off the ectopic germline expression in spr-5; met-2 adult worms, that had a chemotaxis defect earlier in development, is also sufficient to rescue chemotaxis behavior. These results suggest that ongoing inappropriate transcription in neurons can block normal behavior despite the chemotaxis neurons being intact.",

          "abstract": "Canonical bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) detect cues by sensors with opposing kinase and phosphatase activities to alter the level of phosphorylation of cognate response regulators to mediate responses. We previously identified the Campylobacter jejuni BumSR TCS as the founding member of a bacterial TCS family in which the sensor solely functions as a phosphatase. Sensing specific intestinal metabolites inhibits BumS dephosphorylation of phospho-BumR (P-BumR) to impact BumR as a transcriptional regulator of genes influencing host colonization. Since BumS lacks kinase activity, BumR must depend upon a noncognate phosphodonor in the bacterium to form P-BumR. Through a genetic screen and selection, physiological assays, and biochemical analysis, we identified acetyl phosphate (AcP) and carbamoyl phosphate (CP) as natural in vivo phosphodonors for BumR. In C. jejuni , AcP and CP are products of metabolic pathways fueled by amino acids favored by the bacterium as carbon sources for growth. Producing and utilizing AcP and CP as bona fide BumR phosphodonors allows BumSR to integrate different types of inputs for signal transduction. Microbiota-generated gut metabolites are cues for BumS to control its phosphatase activity for P-BumR and inform about the spatial location of C. jejuni in host intestines. In contrast, AcP and CP are cues for BumR that directly influence P-BumR levels and activity and inform about the richness of favored carbon sources in intestinal niches for optimal energy generation and metabolism. Our study reveals how a bacterial TCS strategically integrates information from multiple cues through both essential components for optimal signal transduction.",

Wrapping NPs in cell-derived membranes has shown promise in improving targeted delivery, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Protein corona (PC) formation on NPs can significantly alter their biological identity to influence biodistribution, making its characterization on membrane-wrapped NPs (MWNPs) and unwrapped NPs crucial. In this study, we compared MWNPs incorporating membranes derived from megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 cells, which can accumulate in bone marrow (BM) and preferentially bind hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with unwrapped NPs. We investigated differences in PC composition, macrophage uptake, target cell uptake, and biodistribution in wild type (WT) mice and knockout mice that have low or absent expression of different opsonin proteins. In vitro, MWNPs with a PC exhibited increased target cell uptake and decreased macrophage uptake compared to unwrapped NPs with a PC. Proteomics revealed apolipoprotein B as the dominant opsonin on both NP types after incubation in mouse, bovine, or human serum, with other proteins like complement, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins also being present. Biodistribution studies indicated a complex interplay between the PC and targeting/clearance, where complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G adsorption on MWNPs led to macrophage clearance but also enabled HSPC targeting. Meanwhile, apolipoprotein E adsorption facilitated hepatocyte clearance but reduced immune cell uptake in the liver. Future research on PCs could determine whether these mechanisms are generalizable to other types of MWNPs, potentially revealing strategies to enhance their effectiveness as delivery systems.",

However, the potential of aGPCRs as targets for biologic therapeutics has not been extensively explored. CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells. We generated a panel of synthetic human antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of CD97, from which we identified an antibody that was efficiently internalized. This antibody binds to all isoforms of human CD97 but not to its close homolog, EMR2. Structure determination by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy revealed that this antibody targets the CD97 GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, whose presence is conserved in aGPCRs, through an unconventional binding mode where it extensively utilizes the light chain framework for antigen recognition. Screening of conjugation methods and payloads resulted in a stable ADC that effectively killed AML and GBM cell lines, as well as patient-derived GBM stem cells, with minimal cytotoxicity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting CD97, as well as the aGPCR GAIN domain in general, and uncovers a previously unrecognized surface that an antibody can utilize for antigen recognition.",

We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution. By linking genotype to phenotype via advanced molecular biology tools in a non-model species of conservation concern, this study highlights the need to fully integrate genomics and molecular experimental approaches in modern conservation biology.",

          "abstract": "T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen among vastly outnumbering noncognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen–TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multithread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multithread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.",

To test whether CA2-CA1 connections might facilitate the interaction of social and episodic memories, we used models of behaving mice and in vitro electrophysiology that allow prior activation of CA2 by either novel social interaction or electrical stimulation before inhibitory avoidance training or induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1. We show that social novelty promotes consolidation of CA1-associated memory, which was blocked by the selective chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting CA2 neurons. In both cases, CA2 priming was time-dependent, involved direct CA2-CA1 connections, increased expression of plasticity protein protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), and promoted associativity via synaptic tagging and capture.

Even more rare are empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to keep pace with environmental change. Here, we explore these connections by conducting an integrative study on the breeding range of the yellow warbler ( Setophaga petechia ). Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we first identify loci associated with variation in bill morphology and individual quality. We then employ gene–environment association (GEA) analyses and find that precipitation is a key environmental driver of putative selection on bill shape. Finally, we test whether contemporary individuals whose bill shapes deviate from the historical relationship with precipitation experience increased stress (measured by telomere length) as a result of maladaptation. We also use historical DNA to test whether local populations have shifted their ranges over the past century, confirming that the observed changes are not due to range shifts. Our results align with predictions from GWAS and GEA analyses, indicating that birds with shallower bills in increasingly arid regions suffer higher stress (i.e., shorter telomeres) because of maladaptation. Overall, this study links genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data with stress biomarkers to improve understanding of the process of local adaptation and the consequence of failing to keep pace with changing climate conditions.",

Here, we use FMAPB2 to precompute pair interaction energies and then use the latter to drive simulations of dense protein solutions. The resulting MAEPPI (many-protein atomistic energy from precomputed pair interaction) enables simulations of atomistic proteins at the speed of Lennard-Jones particles.

Under ambient conditions, we found differential regulation and splicing of developmental genes (homeobox and MADS-box clades) may play a role in the genomic determination of the haploid and diploid life stages. We generated a base pair-resolution methylome of a fern gametophyte, and determined that methylation patterns are remarkably similar between vegetative tissues despite their morphological and functional differences. We further explored the physiological and transcriptomic responses of gametophytes and sporophytes to freezing stress, the most likely abiotic factor limiting further range expansion of this invasive species. While controlled by the same genome, we show that life phases and tissues use alternative molecular pathways in response to freezing and greater physiological resilience in the gametophyte life stage to this stressor. Our results underscore the need to incorporate both life phases when developing effective mitigation strategies, as differential responses to environmental stressors between phases reveal opportunities for management approaches (e.g., targeting gametophytes in addition to sporophytes).

          "abstract": "Neuroscience has long relied on macaque studies to infer human brain function, yet identifying functionally corresponding brain regions across species and measurement modalities remains a fundamental challenge. This is especially true for the higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often nonhomologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a long-standing ambiguity by supporting a correspondence between macaque ML and human FFA and between AL and more anterior temporal cortex in humans. This result is consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.",

Insep is the Drosophila homologue of human IER3IP1 , a gene associated with Microcephaly, Epilepsy, and Neonatal Diabetes Syndrome-1 (MEDS-1). We show that Insep loss leads to early larval lethality with small brains and these phenotypes can be rescued by expressing IER3IP1 indicating that their biological function is conserved through evolution. The Insep deficient neuroblasts fail to complete cytokinesis and show excessive accumulation of Rab11 vesicles in the cytoplasm. Similarly, IER3IP1 depletion in human cells leads to cytokinesis failure and accumulation of Rab11 vesicles. Insep and IER3IP1 localize to Rab11 vesicles and interact with Rab11. The pathogenic mutations in IER3IP1 perturb its localization to Rab11 vesicles. These results suggest that Insep and IER3IP1 work along with Rab11 and may regulate fusion of Rab11 vesicles to the advancing furrow during cytokinesis.",

          "abstract": "The obligate intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii encodes a deubiquitinase called EmcB that prevents signaling by the host immune sensor Retinoic acid Inducible Gene I (RIG-I). The evolutionary relationship between EmcB and other deubiquitinases is currently unknown. Here, we show that EmcB defines a broad family of bacterial deubiquitinases divergently evolved from the eukaryotic Ovarian Tumor (OTU) family of deubiquitinases. Our data indicate that the emcB gene has an internal gene rearrangement that resulted in a circular permutation of the OTU fold. Proteins with a region homologous to the deubiquitinase domain of EmcB were identified in numerous members of the bacterial order Legionellales. Proteins with an EmcB-related deubiquitinase domain demonstrated cysteine protease activity that cleaved ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related modifiers. Most of the bacteria encoding EmcB-related proteins had components of the Dot/Icm Type IVB secretion system that delivers EmcB into host cells. Indeed, many of these EmcB-related proteins were translocated into eukaryotic cells by the Dot/Icm system of Legionella pneumophila , consistent with their predicted roles as bacterial effector proteins that target host pathways. Comparison of EmcB family deubiquitinases revealed a two-domain architecture of EmcB comprising a deubiquitinase domain and a ubiquitin binding module that confers enzyme specificity for certain polyubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin binding region in EmcB was found to be necessary for efficient inhibition of RIG-I signaling. Thus, these EmcB-related proteins represent a large family of deubiquitinating enzymes that arose by divergent evolution in Legionellales , likely enabling these bacteria to infect different host cells by targeting signaling pathways regulated by ubiquitin.",

          "abstract": "One of the most fascinating mysteries in the field of origins of life concerns the driving force that led to the selection of today’s 20 universal L -alpha amino acids in biology. An essential aspect of life’s emergence involves the formation of compartments, which offer encapsulation for target molecules and provide protection from hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Thus, polymers capable of assembly may have had a chemical evolutionary advantage over polymers that lacked this ability. We postulated that primordial peptide assembly could be one of the driving forces that led to the chemical selection of alpha amino acids in life today. To test this hypothesis, we generated depsipeptides, oligomers composed of ester bonds and peptide bonds that form readily under mild drying conditions, as model prebiotic peptides. However, it is unknown whether depsipeptides form assemblies in an aqueous environment similarly to peptides and proteins. To test the hypothesis that depsipeptides with alpha backbones will form assemblies more readily than beta backbones, we synthesized depsipeptides using a matrix of eight alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and six alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids. The reaction products were analyzed by microscopy and a physical stability analyzer to study assembly formation as well as various analytical techniques for chemical analysis. Our results demonstrate assembly formation in depsipeptide systems containing hydrophobic hydroxy acids and indicate that depsipeptide assemblies containing alpha hydroxy acid backbones are significantly more stable than beta analogs. Overall, our results offer an assembly-driven mode of selection for the alpha backbone in present-day biology.",

These structures further recruit cations to form anion–π–cation triads. Such assemblies mediate spontaneous oxygenation reactions through their electrochemical environments. This process provides a plausible prebiotic pathway for bioenergetics and molecular oxygen generation on early Earth, leading to the formation of primitive pigments via the oxidation of small molecules and the nontemplated selection of protocells through oxidation-dependent lipid degradation. Our findings highlight a simple yet functionally significant noncovalent interaction that introduces chemical functions into self-assembly and phase transition chemistry, delivering generalizable principles for engineering electrochemically active supramolecular assemblies and a conceptual framework in understanding abiotic evolution and selection.",

To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU , impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes.

Fast turnover of nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2) filaments is necessary to keep up with cell motility and shape changes. The turnover mechanisms are not fully understood and differ for two main mammalian paralogs—NM2A and NM2B—whereas paralog copolymerization adds complexity to this process by enabling the intrinsically fast NM2A to dynamize the intrinsically slow NM2B. Here, we show that the nonhelical tail, the C-terminal phosphorylation sites, and surprisingly, the motor domain of the NM2A heavy chain synergistically accelerate the turnover of NM2B in trans and cell motility, suggesting that these three mechanisms collectively control NM2A’s own dynamics. Conversely, the phosphomimetic NM2B tail facilitates only local turnover of endogenous wild type NM2B but not its global redistribution unless the NM2A motor is combined with the phosphomimetic NM2B tail. Collectively, we reveal the cooperation between the motor activity and the NM2 tail-targeting turnover mechanisms in regulating the NM2 filament turnover in trans and cell motility.",

These responses connect changes in heme homeostasis to mitochondrial function, including core metabolic processes such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as to enzymes involved in the control and storage of iron.

In this report, we show that FGF21 is induced by infection with influenza virus in both humans and mice. Mice lacking FGF21 had decreased food intake, body weight, and body temperature compared to wild-type mice following influenza virus inoculation, indicating reduced tolerance to the infection. Conversely, pharmacologic administration of FGF21 after viral infection protected mice against these pathologic changes. Pair feeding studies showed that neither the induction of FGF21 nor the hypothermia was secondary to decreased food intake. Notably, mice selectively lacking FGF21’s coreceptor protein, βKlotho, in noradrenergic neurons were also more susceptible to influenza virus infection, including hypothermia. We show that FGF21 acting on noradrenergic neurons, including those in the locus coeruleus region, stimulates energy expenditure and thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Our findings reveal an FGF21-regulated neuronal pathway that protects mice against influenza infection and suggest the potential utility of using FGF21 pharmacologically to improve outcomes after influenza infection.",

Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this, we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show that i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality. Overall, our findings illustrate the utility of the G. mellonella model system in conjunction with established in vivo models in studying infectious disease progression and treatment.",

Recycling REEs from industrial waste provides a sustainable alternative to mining, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impacts. The mainstay approaches for REE recovery, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods, can be inefficient, consuming high energy and generating large aqueous and acid waste streams. Here, we introduce flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl 2 ) as an efficient method for REE separation and recovery by capitalizing on the free energies of formation (ΔG form ) of the metal chlorides and the boiling points of those metal chlorides. FJH-Cl 2 enables high-purity (&gt;90%) and high-yield (&gt;90%) REE recovery from waste magnets in a single step. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis show that this process reduces the number of steps by 3× while reducing energy consumption by 87%, greenhouse gas emissions by 84%, and operating costs by 54% while eliminating water and acid use by 100% compared to traditional methods.

We report here our results of a follow-up analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a DS interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic DS candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, with the former being the second most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify, in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, a tentative feature ( S / N ∼ 2 ) indicative of the smoking gun signature of DSs: the He II λ 1640 absorption line. In view of ALMA’s recent identification of a probable O III nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated DS is unlikely.

Here, we identified glycosylated cannabinoids and their common intermediate olivetolic acid (OA) in various C. sativa tissues and cultivars. We moreover identified four UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from C. sativa with OA glycosylating activity. Enhancing the water solubility of cannabinoids through glycosylation holds potential for pharmaceutical development and cosmetic applications. However, glycosylation of pathway intermediates such as OA may divert metabolic flux away from cannabinoid production, complicating efforts to engineer glycosylated forms. To resolve this, we applied FuncLib design to an AlphaFold-predicted structure of one of the identified enzymes CsUGT14, generating active-site variants. Through functional screening, we identified mutants that display increased specificity toward cannabinoid end products over the OA intermediate. Moreover, we recognized a single point mutation that dictates OA positioning within the active site, thereby altering isomer formation. These findings expand the known repertoire of natural cannabinoids and provide a rare example of crystallography-free enzyme design to improve stability, substrate selectivity, and isomer specificity.

          "abstract": "RNA virus populations consist of complex and dynamic mutant spectra in which most individual genomes differ in one or more positions from the other genomes of the same population. This behavior, known as quasispecies dynamics, applies to SARS-CoV-2 which exhibits intrahost genetic and functional heterogeneity while evolving at a high rate in the human population. In the present study, we describe a remarkable reduction in mutant spectrum complexity (intrahost viral genome heterogeneity) in SARS-CoV-2 isolates of late relative to early COVID-19 waves, as they reached Madrid (Spain) from 2020 until 2022. In contrast, the consensus (average) sequence of the corresponding isolates displayed a continuing divergence from the initial Wuhan-Hu-1 virus as the pandemic advanced. The mutant spectrum complexity developed upon replication in Vero E6 cells of the isolates from the first and sixth COVID-19 waves, as well as of biological clones retrieved from them, was similar. Therefore, the mutant spectrum complexity reduction observed in vivo was not due to an increased accuracy of the viral replicative machinery, but rather to other factors related to viral epidemiology or pathogenesis. Such possible factors and their implications for viral trait modifications in the course of a viral pandemic are discussed. The results establish that mutant spectrum complexity of genetically variable viruses can be an epidemiologically evolvable trait.",

To further expand our understanding of structure–function relationships in this complex multiphase material system and provide a roadmap for transitioning this technology from a simple proof-of-concept to a viable large-scale energy storage alternative, we report insights into the nanoscale connectivity of the electrode’s conductive carbon network, explore different electrolyte compositions and material integration strategies, and highlight opportunities for device scaling. Through the use of FIB-SEM tomography, the electrode’s percolating fractal-like nano-carbon black network has been visualized at the nanoscale, providing insights into the theoretical energy storage capacity of this material. To reduce the required times for the production of functional electrodes, we also present a cast-in electrolyte approach, where centimeter-thick electrodes could be produced without the need for postcuring steps. In these prototypes, device performance scales linearly with electrode thickness and cell count, and a simple analytical model was developed to explain these scaling phenomena. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative ionic and organic electrolytes further contribute to improved electrochemical behavior, with the fabricated designs ultimately achieving a 10-fold increase in supercapacitor energy density compared to previous designs. Finally, we were able to fabricate a 12 V, 50 F supercapacitor module and a 9 V arch prototype that integrate energy storage into load-bearing architectural elements. These functional prototypes highlight the potential for real-time structural health monitoring, while demonstrating the potential of our ecˆ3 technology for the production of a scalable, high-voltage concrete energy-storing infrastructure.",

Compound screens revealed that the VCP inhibitor CB-5339 potently suppresses CCA proliferation in a panel of patient-derived organoids by inducing cellular senescence. It is known that senescent cells persist, and this can contribute to therapy resistance. To address this, we combined CB-5339 with senolytic agents (ABT-263 and conatumumab), which selectively eliminate senescent CCA cells, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical analysis showed that VCP overexpression in CCA patients correlates with poor prognosis.

By tracing the evolutionary history of cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase genes within the kynurenine aminotransferase family, we identified a gene duplication event in parasitoid wasps of the Chalcidoidea superfamily. Notably, a single-copy, highly conserved mitochondria-localized physiological gene underwent a significant duplication, resulting in one copy being recruited into the venom system and acquired cytotoxicity against wasps' hosts. Through this neofunctionalization process, we observed several key evolutionary changes, including loss of ancestral mitochondrial localization and enzyme activity, acquisition of a secretory signal peptide, shift in expression pattern, positive selection, and the establishment of evolutionary acquired protein–protein interactions. Additionally, we found that another duplicate copy was specialized in wasps' ovary and repurposed for oogenesis regulation. Our study offers a detailed insight into the genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive functional diversification during the evolution of gene families.",

Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green color. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris , develop as woven fibrillar structures, in contrast to the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibers, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue coloration. Our findings not only introduce a variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.",

However, the regulatory mechanisms and functional consequences of newly identified lysine acylation modifications in cancer therapy remain to be elucidated. Here, we established diverse preclinical tumor models resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and focused on histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as it exhibited more pronounced alterations compared to other acylations. Next, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 as a key regulator responsible for the resistance-associated decrease in crotonylation levels. Furthermore, integrated crotonylomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling, supplemented by gene manipulation studies, revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance resulted from transcriptional suppression of HNF1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were regulated by reduced histone H3 lysine 56 crotonylation. Importantly, through pharmacological screening, we identified a histone decrotonylase inhibitor that enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity by activating epigenetic reprogramming through the selective upregulation of histone Kcr levels across multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism driven by crotonylation that contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, highlighting the potential of modulating crotonylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.",

Driver proteins operate within complex interaction networks, and their activity is conditioned by neighbor proteins. Understanding the interplay between driver mutations and the expression of their neighbor proteins can provide insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets. We assessed associations between expression of neighbor proteins and driver mutation status, comparing both between and within cancer types. We further evaluated if neighbors were enriched in significant associations with multiple drivers and characterized the impact of neighbor expression on overall survival for all cancer types. We found a significant correlation between the number of driver associations (DA) a neighbor gene has and the number of sign-coherent survival associations, particularly for neighbors enriched in positive associations, where high neighbor expression correlated with increased driver mutations and poorer survival. We identified 119 neighbors enriched in positive DA with at least two unfavorable survival associations and 25 neighbors enriched in negative DA with at least two favorable survival associations. Our study systematically identified neighbors associated with driver mutation status. Complementary evidence from survival analysis and the literature suggests that neighbors enriched in DA can be further explored as drug target candidates.",

It can have a large impact on host–parasite interactions and investigating this effect is vital both for understanding current parasite distribution and epidemiology, and predicting how this will change in the future. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether temperature and precipitation have an overall effect on parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals. This is a phylogenetically controlled quantitative synthesis to assess parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals across contrasting temperatures and precipitation. We found large variation in the effect of temperature on parasite prevalence, precipitation on parasite prevalence, and temperature on infection intensity. This provides robust quantitative evidence against the controversial “warmer sicker world” hypothesis. There was no effect of climate on parasitism, irrespective of whether the parasite was an endoparasite or ectoparasite, or across different parasite lifecycles. Although some host and parasite taxa were understudied, we found no consistent taxonomic patterns. Importantly, we revealed large gaps in the literature, including the relationship between humidity, prevalence, and infection intensity. Ectoparasites and reptile hosts were also very underrepresented, and deserve further study. Focusing future research on these gaps will help to confirm whether certain types of host–parasite interactions are more or less sensitive to changes in climate, with implications for conservation.",

We previously developed a bispecific antibody (bsAb), iMab/D5_AR, directed toward both the gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR) that is exposed within the HIV-1 PHI and toward CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells. CD4-binding led to prepositioning of the bsAb at the site of viral fusion, enhancing its neutralization potency and achieving 95% breadth (IC80 &lt; 5 μg/mL) against a panel of 119 pseudotyped, multiclade HIV-1 viruses. In the current study, we engineered a bsAb against NHR that also targets CCR5, one of two HIV-1 coreceptors on T cells. This optimized bsAb design further improves neutralization potency and achieves 100% neutralization breadth against the 119-member pseudotyped virus panel, including those resistant to CD4-binding iMab/D5_AR. Considering that nearly all initial HIV-1 infections occur via CCR5-tropic viruses, we expect our redesigned bsAb targeting CCR5 to be an effective prophylactic agent. These findings further support the rationale for pursuing the NHR as a therapeutic target for HIV-1 and lay the groundwork for a new class of engineered broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis of two dinotoms at different plastidial levels: Durinskia capensis at the kleptoplastidy state, alongside its kleptoplastid-source diatom Nitzschia captiva , and its close relative Durinskia kwazulunatalensis at an early permanent state. We show that in both dinotoms, the diatom nucleus retains high transcriptional autonomy, but its expression profile is plastid biased, signaling early host influence. In contrast, only D. kwazulunatalensis exhibits striking signs of genomic reconfiguration in the diatom nucleus: intron insertions, increased guanine (G) and cytosine (C) content, and growing nucleotide similarity to host transcripts. These shifts suggest an incipient nucleomorph-like transformation. Metabolically, only D. kwazulunatalensis expresses a complete hexose phosphate export pathway, suggesting deeper metabolic integration, while both species retain simpler carbohydrate transport routes. Additionally, we propose that diatom karyokinesis might be controlled by a dual mechanism via suppression of key transcription factors at the G1-S checkpoint and nitrate availability. Together, our findings reveal a continuum of plastid integration degrees, from temporary organelle theft to genomic accommodation and metabolic codependence. Dinotoms thus serve not only as evolutionary artifacts but as living laboratories, illuminating how kleptoplastids inch toward permanence.",

          "abstract": "With the learning from living protein polymerization in nature, achieving living/controlled supramolecular assembly of biopolymers such as proteins in vitro is a longstanding challenge for material design. Herein, we provide a thiol-regulated interfacial protein aggregation (TRIPA) for unfolded protein systems with typical living polymerization features. By triggering globule proteins into the unfolded state through a reversible exchange reaction of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl agents (R-SH), protein monomers are partially unfolded and assembled at the air–water/solid–water interface (AWI/SWI) through the entropy-driven adsorption and conformation transition. The process could be well repeated over time to form a two-dimensional (2D) nanofilm at the interface by following a pathway of monomer-oligomer-2D assembly. Similar to living polymerization, the film thickness exhibited a linear increase with the assembly conversion ratio of the monomers. With the stepwise addition of native protein into the reaction system, the thickness periodically increased in a linear manner. Such living/controlled supramolecular polymerization (LCSP) of protein at the interface leads to the synthesis of a nanofilm with well-defined flat morphology, ultrahigh modulus, and nano- to macroscale controlled thickness. The resultant protein nanofilm could then attach onto a variety of flexible and rigid material surfaces to produce a stable structural color coating. Compelling evidence in the present work thus underlines a demonstration of LCSP of biopolymers in vitro. It may hold a solid impact by opening a window for living/controlled polymerization of versatile biospecies such as proteins, saccharides, nucleic acids, and cells.",

While continuum models for postyield plastic flow are well established, a unified framework connecting preyield avalanche dynamics to bulk rheology remains lacking. Here, we introduce a birefringent double-shear experiment that enables sustained probing of avalanche statistics and quasistatic flow behavior near the yielding transition. We find that the avalanche regime exhibits rate-weakening behavior, while the plastic regime is rate-independent, resulting in dual rheology under identical local shear rates and indicating hysteresis and mechanical instability. Within a stress-activated framework, we identify the mean normalized stress drop, a measure for mesoscale avalanche size, as a key field variable that bridges the two regimes. Incorporating this variable, we formulate a unified constitutive model that captures the entire yielding transition.

          "abstract": "Putative metazoan body fossils from the Precambrian are curiously lacking morphological characteristics that link them unambiguously to extant animal phyla, including sponges. Chemical fossils such as the rare C 30 hydrocarbons 24- iso -propylcholestane (24- i pc) and 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), however, have been proposed as evidence for the Neoproterozoic emergence of the Demospongiae (Porifera) due to their prevalence in rocks of this age and the occurrence of their sterol precursors in contemporary demosponges. However, there are alternative hypotheses which posit that diagenetic alteration products of algal sterols, or those from Rhizaria or other protists, account for the enigmatic steroid distributions observed in these ancient sedimentary rocks. Here, we report additional support for the Neoproterozoic rise of demosponges through the chemical characterization of two previously unrecognized C 31 hydrocarbons—24- n -butylcholestane (24- n bc) and 24- sec -butylcholestane (24- sec bc). Precursor C 31 sterols from contemporary demosponges, as well as a suite of synthesized C 31 sterol standards were reduced to their sterane counterparts. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and collisionally activated dissociation mass spectra confirmed the presence of 24- n bc and 24- sec bc in well-preserved early Ediacaran rocks, and the coelution of these compounds with synthetic standards enhances the robustness of these findings. Co-occurrence of abundant 24- i pc and 24- sec bc was found for numerous Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rock/oil samples, closely mimicking the abundance patterns and high structural selectivity of major C 30 and C 31 sterols detected in numerous species of modern demosponges. These findings support the hypothesized first emergence of sponges during the Neoproterozoic Era.",

          "abstract": "Twenty-four years of satellite observations from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System show a northern hemisphere (NH) minus southern hemisphere (SH) trend difference of 0.34 ± 0.23 Wm −2 dec −1 (5 to 95% CI) in absorbed solar radiation (ASR) and a weaker trend difference of 0.21 ± 0.21 Wm −2 dec −1 in outgoing longwave radiation. The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.",

          "abstract": "Technology development is an essential investment for policymakers to address contemporary global crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss, the energy transition, and emergent infectious diseases. However, investing limited resources in the development of new technologies is risky. The research and development process is unpredictable, with unknown timelines and outcomes. In addition, even after successful development, the effects of deploying a new technology remain uncertain. When confronted with these uncertainties, policymakers must determine how long they should allocate resources to developing new technologies. Informed decisions require anticipating possible successes and failures of both technology development and deployment, which is a challenging optimization task when managing dynamic systems, such as threatened ecological systems. Using an adaptive management approach from AI, we find a time limit new technologies should be developed for, which balances costs, benefits, and uncertainties during development and deployment. We extract clear and transparent general rules for investing in new technologies, building on an analytical approximation. Using Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as a case study, we demonstrate that the development time limit ranges between 0 to 45 y before surrendering. We also show how characteristics of an ecological system influence the optimal investment strategy. Our approach can inform the development of new technologies in multiple domains including biodiversity conservation, public health, energy production, and the technology industry more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Enhancing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in agricultural production can reduce fertilizer input, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and decrease water pollution incidence. However, improving NUE in farming systems without compromising food security remains challenging. Herein, we have successfully developed and applied selenium-based nanotechnology, which capitalizes on above- and belowground synergies to enhance field-scale NUE. Specifically, when N fertilizer application was reduced by 30%, foliar application of selenium nanomaterials significantly enhanced rice photosynthesis by 40.3% compared with reduced N fertilizer treatment (189 kg N/ha). This enhancement promoted carbohydrate synthesis and translocation, providing abundant carbon sources for rhizosphere processes. These abundant carbon sources modulated rhizosphere N transformation processes, stimulating ammonification and nitrification while suppressing denitrification, thereby reducing methane, ammonia, and nitrous oxide emissions by 18.8 to 45.6%. In addition, compared with controls (270 kg N/ha), our approach improved rice root growth and upregulated gene expression associated with N uptake and translocation, increasing rice NUE (48.3%). While maintaining comparable yields to conventional practice, we observed significant improvements in rice quality parameters including crude protein, amino acids, and Se content. Furthermore, the application of this above- and belowground synergistic nano-regulation technology reduced environmental negative impacts by 41.0% and increased economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice produced, relative to conventional practices. This work elucidates how nano-enabled agricultural regulation achieves reduced input, enhanced efficiency, and increased income, emphasizing the high potential of nanotechnology in agricultural applications, particularly in improving the utilization efficiency of N fertilizers.",

          "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form chromatin modifying complexes that stably repress lineage- or context-specific genes in animals, plants, and some fungi. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to assemble repressive chromatin. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3 deposition is regulated by the H3K36 methyltransferase ASH1 and components of constitutive heterochromatin including the H3K9me3-binding protein HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1). Hypoacetylated histones are a defining feature of both constitutive heterochromatin and PcG-repressed chromatin, but how histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to normal H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression within PcG-repressed chromatin is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen to identify HDACs required for repression of PRC2-methylated genes. In the absence of HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1 (HDA-1), PRC2-methylated genes were activated and H3K27me3 was depleted from typical PRC2-targeted regions. At constitutive heterochromatin, HDA-1 deficient cells displayed reduced H3K9me3, hyperacetylation, and aberrant enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. CHROMODOMAIN PROTEIN-2 (CDP-2) is required to target HDA-1 to constitutive heterochromatin and is also required for normal H3K27me3 patterns. Patterns of aberrant H3K27me3 were distinct in isogenic ∆ hda-1 strains, suggesting that loss of HDA-1 causes stochastic or progressive epigenome dysfunction. To test this, we constructed a new Δhda-1 strain and performed a laboratory “aging” experiment. Deletion of hda-1 led to progressive epigenome decay over hundreds of nuclear divisions. Together, our data indicate that HDA-1 is a critical regulator of epigenome stability in N. crassa.",

          "abstract": "Hyperuniformity and giant number fluctuations represent opposite ends in a spectrum of statistical correlations found in physical systems outside of thermal equilibrium. Dynamic phase transitions exhibit critical points that are hyperuniform, while anomalously large fluctuations are often quoted as a hallmark of active matter. Here, we show that the apparently disordered state of active nematic defects exhibits suppression of fluctuations on scales as large as the system size, reminiscent of what is seen for ordered lattices. Modeling the nematic defects in terms of continuum densities, we show that their distribution becomes asymptotically hyperuniform in the limit where their proliferation is solely driven by activity, rather than by thermal fluctuations. When both effects are at play, the resultant hyperuniform structure is limited to a finite range of length scales, ℓ &lt; ℓ × , with ℓ × → ∞ as thermal unbinding is suppressed. The system of active nematic defects can therefore be said to possess hidden order across scales provided ℓ is comparable to the system size. This organization is most pronounced when considering the subpopulation of either the positive or the negative defects, illustrating lack of multihyperuniformity. Our experimental findings are supported by hydrodynamic theory and agent-based simulations, which further allow elucidating the role of both creation/annihilation of defect pairs and of their mutual repulsion and attraction in achieving hyperuniformity.",

          "abstract": "Changes in bacterial colony morphology are common during chronic human infections and are thought to provide a survival advantage. In the human pathogen Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB), a unidirectional transition from a smooth (MAB S ) to rough (MAB R ) morphotype frequently occurs during chronic infection. This transition has profound clinical implications, as MAB R induces a heightened proinflammatory response, contributing to increased morbidity. To better understand this phenomenon, we used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes essential for the survival of MAB S and MAB R . Our analysis revealed distinct genetic requirements for growth in vitro, including several genes involved in responding to environmental stresses. Notably, some of these uniquely essential genes are therapeutic targets in mycobacteria. In a murine infection model, the divergence in essential gene profiles between MAB S and MAB R was even more pronounced, driven partly by the differing host immune responses elicited by each morphotype. These findings demonstrate that the transition from a smooth to rough morphotype not only impacts MAB’s survival strategies but also highlights the importance of considering morphotype-specific genetic and functional adaptations when developing therapeutic approaches. Our work underscores the critical need to incorporate morphotype conversion into the prioritization of drug targets, as targeting morphotype-specific vulnerabilities could improve treatment outcomes for infections caused by this pathogen.",

          "abstract": "The homeostatic link between the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitophagy plays a significant role in how cells respond to various physiological and pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia–reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.",

Yet, most functional genomic studies on soil bacteria have been performed without predation, thereby selecting for phenotypes impacting growth rather than survival and biasing our view on the ecological factors driving genomic evolution. Here, we study how predation by the ubiquitous amoebal predator Dictyostelium discoideum affects Bacillus subtilis ’ growth and survival using both a genome-scale mutant screen and de novo evolution of resistance. We show that predation-related genes (many not previously identified) promote survival by enabling filament or aggregate formation, thereby outsizing D. discoideum and slowing or preventing ingestion. Importantly, we find that predation resistance is costly, causing a trade-off between growth and survival. B. subtilis navigates this trade-off through switch-like adaptations, where cells switch back-and-forth between a slow-growing resistant state and a fast-growing susceptible state. These behaviors are controlled through both genotypic and phenotypic switches, with a central role for the Spo0A phosphorylation cascade, whose ancestral function may have been to evade or slow predation. Taken together, we uncover how the antagonist selection pressure imposed by predation is an important ecological driver of phenotypic heterogeneity in B. subtilis .",

The molecular basis for such kinetic coupling is incompletely understood, but one potential mechanism is through elongation rate–dependent alternative folding pathways of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). To search for RNA structures in nascent pre-mRNA, we modified Sequencing of Psoralen Crosslinked, Ligated And Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) [J. G. Ashley Aw et al. , Mol. Cell 62 , 603–617 (2016)] for use with C hromatin A ssociated R NA.

Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) disruption of several such duplexes that sequester splice sites has a major impact on AS outcomes, even though the ASOs do not directly disrupt splice sites. ASO disruption of these regulatory elements that we designate “RNA kinetic switches” modified AS of NISCH Exon 18, GAK Exon 7, and MEGF8 Exon 14 in a way that depends on the rate of transcription elongation. We propose that these switches mediate kinetic coupling via the effects of transcription speed on folding of nascent RNA structures that modulate AS and that many nascent RNA structures can thereby serve as targets for splice-modifying ASOs.",

Theoretically, by screening founder generation individuals based on the cell phenotypes resulting from gene knock-ins and leveraging the high fecundity of animals, heritable descendants with targeted knock-ins can be efficiently generated. Therefore, we utilized the high fecundity of Xenopus tropicalis and easily observable pigment phenotypes to construct a BRAF V600E -targeted mitf locus knock-in model. Results indicated that this approach enabled efficient generation of BRAF V600E knock-in X. tropicalis and produced a versatile frog model. The BRAF V600E knock-in induced the transdifferentiation of RPE cells into retinal cells, resulting in a symmetric retinal structure in the eyes of these frogs. The transformation of RPE cells ultimately leads to these frogs becoming eyeless frogs, which serve as a tool for retinal regeneration research. Additionally, in eyeless frogs the BRAF V600E knock-in led to the abnormal proliferation of both melanocytes and xanthophores into melanocytic and xanthocytic nevi respectively. Consequently, eyeless frogs provide a model for studying abnormal pigment cell proliferation, offering a platform for investigating pigment cell nevus formation. Furthermore, the cdkn2b -knockout eyeless frogs serve as a valuable xanthophoroma model for tumor biology research. Overall, the BRAF V600E -targeted knock-in X. tropicalis not only represents a strategy for constructing gene knock-in animal models but also serves as a versatile tool for research in retinal regeneration and tumor biology.",

However, in artificial agents, different intrinsic reward signals induce exploration strategies that respond differently to stochasticity. In particular, some strategies are vulnerable to the “noisy TV problem,” i.e., an attraction to irrelevant stochastic stimuli. Here, we ask whether humans exhibit a similar attraction to reward-free stochasticity. We design a multistep decision-making paradigm in which participants search for rewarding states in a complex environment containing a highly stochastic but reward-free subregion. We show that i) participants persistently explore the stochastic subregion, and ii) their decisions are best explained by a novelty-driven exploration strategy, compared to alternatives driven by information gain or surprise.

          "abstract": "Prior to ejaculation, mammalian sperm are stored in the epididymis in a “resting” metabolic state. Upon ejaculation, sperm must alter their metabolism to generate the energy needed to support the motility and maturation process known as capacitation to reach and fertilize the oocyte. How sperm regulate the capacitation-induced increase in carbon flux is unknown. Here, we use 13 C stable isotope labeling in mouse sperm isolated from the cauda epididymis to follow glucose metabolism through central carbon metabolic network before and after sperm activation. As sperm transition from resting to highly activated states, they boost energy yield by increasing flux through glycolysis at the expense of the pentose phosphate pathway. Increased glycolytic activity seems to be achieved via capacitation-induced stimulation of flux through aldolase. In the mitochondria-containing midpiece, glycolytically generated pyruvate feeds the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to further maximize energy yield via oxidative phosphorylation. In the mitochondria-free principal piece of the flagellum, pyruvate produced from glycolysis is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, which also serves to regenerate oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) ensuring a sufficient supply to support glycolysis. The resultant lactate is at least partially secreted. Finally, we find evidence that there is an as yet unknown endogenous source of energy in sperm, feeding the upregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. These studies provide the most complete picture of the metabolic shift which occurs in capacitating mouse sperm in glucose.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for improved prevention and diagnostic strategies for fungal pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Candida -related antibodies can be detected using glycan microarrays containing synthetic glycans to guide the discovery of oligosaccharide epitopes for diagnostics and vaccine design. Pure, synthetic mannans and β -glucans, resembling carbohydrates found on the surface of Candida spp., were employed to screen and compare sera from infected humans and mice with noninfected individuals. IgM antibodies directed toward β -glucans were observed shortly after infection, and after a longer time of infection, IgM and IgG antibodies that preferentially recognize mannans. Phosphodiester-linked mannosides and the β -(1,2)-mannose monomer help to distinguish different Candida spp. The tetrasaccharide antigen β -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man, and the pentasaccharide antigens α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,3)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man and β -(1,3)Glc- β -(1,3)Glc- β -(1,3)Glc-[ β -(1,6)Glc]- β -(1,3)Glc were identified as potential epitopes for detection, e.g., through monoclonal antibody lateral flow tests, and the development of glycoconjugate or monoclonal antibody vaccines against Candida.",

          "abstract": "Knowing the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter’s bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter’s atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential nonuniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter’s midlatitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A nonuniform water vapor distribution emerges in the midlatitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from subsolar to supersolar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter’s midlatitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a supersolar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the nonuniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Endogenous pathogens can constrain virulence to ensure survival in the host. Pathogenic state can be controlled by metabolic responses to the prevailing microenvironment; however, the coupling and effector mechanisms are not well understood. Flux through the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway can modulate virulence of the oral pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis , and here we show that this is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent differential partitioning of gingipain proteases. The OCM essential precursor pABA inhibits the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and consequently relieves inhibition of its cognate kinase, Ptk1. We found that in the absence of pABA, reduced Ptk1 kinase activity blocks extracellular release of gingipains. Surface retention of gingipains confers resistance to neutrophil mobilization and killing, and virulence in animal models of disease is elevated. Reciprocally, Ptk1 and gingipains are required for maximal flux through OCM, and Ptk1 can phosphorylate the OCM pathway enzymes GlyA and GcvT. Further, ALP, an alkaline phosphatase involved in synthesis of DHPPP, which combines with pABA to make DHP, is phosphorylated and activated by Ptk1. We propose, therefore, that although the primary function of Ptk1 is to maintain OCM balance, it mechanistically couples metabolism with tunable pathogenic potential through directing the location of proteolytic virulence factors.",

          "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs), ubiquitous mobile DNAs, are largely repressed by cellular mechanisms such as epigenetic silencing and RNA decay, yet some retain the ability to transpose. The Arabidopsis long terminal repeat retrotransposon Copia93 , also known as Evade , exhibits exceptionally high transpositional activity, but the mechanism underlying its extraordinary mobility remains unclear. Here, we identify an Element for Nuclear Expression (ENE) motif within the 3′ UTR of Evade that forms a triple helical RNA structure with the poly(A) tail, shielding the transcript from deadenylation and degradation. Deletion of the ENE motif significantly reduces Evade transcript stability, extrachromosomal DNA levels, and de novo insertions. Furthermore, we show that the mRNA deadenylase CCR4a directly binds Evade RNA to shorten its poly(A) tail, thereby suppressing transposition. Loss of CCR4a leads to Evade upregulation, while additional deadenylases contribute to its repression in the absence of CCR4a. Our findings uncover an RNA-based strategy that enhances transposon stability and mobility, illustrating a coevolutionary arms race between host silencing pathways and TE-encoded structural elements.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 plays a crucial role in regulating excitability of small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and is an emerging target for pain therapeutics. Using dynamic clamp, we systematically manipulated Nav1.8 conductance to assess its impact on action potential (AP) electrogenesis, rheobase, and repetitive firing in native rat DRG neurons and those expressing the gain-of-function Nav1.7L858H mutation which underlies inherited erythromelalgia, a human genetic pain disorder. Our findings reveal that the Nav1.8 contribution to net sodium current is highly correlated with AP voltage threshold. Nav1.8 conductance regulated AP overshoot and voltage threshold without significantly affecting undershoot or resting membrane potential. We identified two populations of wild-type DRG neurons: strong responders (50% of cells), which exhibited substantial rheobase modulation with alterations in Nav1.8 conductance, and weak responders (50% of cells), which remained largely unaffected. In hyperexcitable Nav1.7L858H-expressing neurons, partial Nav1.8 subtraction (50%) restored rheobase above control levels in 63% of cells. However, weak responders (37%) remained hyperexcitable. The effect of Nav1.8 subtraction in responsive neurons supports the conclusion that Nav1.8 inhibition can reduce neuropathic pain. However, the presence of weakly responsive DRG neurons suggests that other channels might need to be targeted for full pain relief.",

          "abstract": "Maximizing atomic utilization of noble metals is crucial for efficient industrial catalysis. We demonstrate that minimal platinum (Pt) loading for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can be achieved through atom abstraction. At low loadings of Pt with copper (Cu), reduction over silica or other oxide supports formed nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt mainly dispersed in the bulk. Addition of tin (Sn) to the alloy led to formation of surface Pt 1 Sn 1 dimers. The larger atomic radius of Sn compared to Cu drove it to the surface, and its stronger interactions with Pt abstracted it from the bulk. Single metallic Pt atoms were stabilized on fully open surfaces, resulting in nearly 100% surface exposure. This configuration reduced Pt usage by one order of magnitude for propane dehydrogenation and improved catalytic stability.",

Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures.

Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.",

By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.",

We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop.

Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.",

          "abstract": "The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.",

However, experimental evidence of short-range ordering is still lacking due to the challenge of characterizing atomic-scale ordering motifs. Here, we determined the presence of short-range order in a ternary GeSiSn semiconductor system using advanced energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and large-scale atomistic models generated by a machine learning neuroevolution potential of first-principles accuracy. This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets. Our findings not only confirmed the presence of short-range order but also directly revealed the actual atomic structure, demonstrating the potential for informed atomic order–based band engineering as a third degree of freedom beyond composition and strain tuning.",

In this study, we discovered a role for 7-deazapurines in protein modification within type IV cyclic oligonucleotide–based antiviral signaling system (CBASS) antiphage defense and defined functions for CBASS ancillary proteins Cap9 and Cap10 in nucleobase-protein conjugation. A structure of Cap10 revealed a transfer RNA transglycosylase family enzyme remodeled to bind a partner cGAS/DncV–like nucleotidyltransferase that is modified with an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase. A structure of Cap9 explained how this QueC-like enzyme co-opts a 7-deazapurine biosynthetic reaction to install NDG. We show that Cap9, Cap10, and protein deazaguanylation are essential for host defense against phage infection. Our results define a 7-deazapurine protein modification and explain how nucleobase biosynthetic machinery has been repurposed for antiviral immunity.",

In this study, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using recently introduced technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic primitive and derived features. Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification.

We conducted a globally replicated predation experiment at 21 sites on six continents to test how predator community, prey community, and visual environment influenced the predation risk of 15,018 artificial paper “moth” prey with cryptic or warning coloration. Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low. This study demonstrates how multiple mechanisms shape antipredator strategies, helping to explain the evolution and global distribution of camouflaged and aposematic animals.",

By investigating plasmids from clinically relevant bacteria sampled and isolated between 1917 and 1954 and comparing them to modern plasmids, we have captured over 100 years of evolution. We show that while virtually all PAE plasmids were devoid of resistance genes and most never acquired them, a minority evolved to drive the global spread of resistance to first line and last resort antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. Modern plasmids have evolved through complex microevolution and fusion events into a distinct group of highly recombinogenic, multi-replicon, self-transmissible plasmids that now pose the highest risk to resistance dissemination, and therefore to human health.",

Here, we investigated cooperation in mice and artificial intelligence systems, examining how they learn to actively coordinate their actions to obtain shared rewards. We identified key social behavioral strategies and decision-making processes in mice that facilitate successful cooperation. These processes are represented in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ACC activity causally contributes to cooperative behavior. We extended our findings to artificial intelligence systems by training artificial agents in a similar cooperation task. The agents developed behavioral strategies and neural representations reminiscent of those observed in the biological brain, revealing parallels between cooperative behavior in biological and artificial systems.",

This enzymatic platform integrates a range of asymmetric catalysis principles, including remote stereocenter construction, stereodivergent catalysis, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, achieving excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol over radical intermediates.

This study uses a statistical evaluation of new geochemical datasets to quantify the critical minerals that are mined annually in US ores but go unrecovered. Ninety percent recovery of by-products from existing domestic metal mining operations could meet nearly all US critical mineral needs; one percent recovery would substantially reduce import reliance for most elements that we evaluated.

          "abstract": "Mental health conditions like depression are associated with an elevated risk of cardiometabolic disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain poorly understood. Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.",

The human menstrual cycle has also a period close to that of the lunar cycle, and recent studies suggest a temporary synchrony between menstrual and lunar cycles. Nevertheless, lunar influence on human reproductive behavior remains controversial. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual records of individual women from the past 24 years and compared them with records from the past century. We show that women’s menstrual cycles recorded before the introduction of light-emitting diodes in 2010 and the extensive use of smart phones significantly synchronized with the Moon, while those after 2010 coupled to the Moon mostly in January. We hypothesize that the high gravimetric forces between the Moon, Sun, and Earth every January are sufficient for this coupling, while the increasing exposure to artificial light at night impinges on synchrony at other times.",

          "abstract": "Technology plays a central role in all human societies, from foraging to industrial economies. However, technological solutions come with associated costs, and in small-scale societies, technological complexity reflects this trade-off between efficiency and resource constraints. Here, we analyze this trade-off and show a sublinear scaling relationship between toolkit richness and tool part richness in ethnographic societies. This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.",

Leveraging nationwide health surveys and registers from Denmark, we investigated patterns of sleep problems from late adolescence to adulthood and explored early life-course determinants. We generated life-course embeddings using unsupervised machine learning on data from 2.2 million individuals born from 1980 to 2015. We used this landscape to identify neighboring factors of sleep problems. We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns. Specific childhood adversities, such as sibling psychiatric illness, foster care, and parental divorce, were shared factors across multiple sleep disorders such as insomnia and nightmares. These findings underscore the complex interplay between medical and psychosocial factors in sleep.",

The epigenetic mechanism underlying spatiotemporal gene regulation during in vivo neuron differentiation remains largely unknown.

Here, we show that Atoh1-Cre –mediated knockout (ACKO) of Kmt2d encoding the lysine methyltransferase KMT2D (MLL4) in cerebellar GC lineage inhibits the transition of GC progenitors to GCs while cell non-autonomously affecting other cerebellar cells. Kmt2d ACKO impaired cerebellum-associated behaviors and caused facial peculiarity, microcephaly, and reduced body size in mice. KMT2D temporally activated neuronal differentiation programs in cerebellar GCs. KMT2D-mediated activation of the key neuronal transcription factor genes En2 , Pax6 , and Myt1l via super-enhancer/enhancer programming was critical for GC differentiation. These findings reveal a unique epigenetic mechanism in which KMT2D temporally orchestrates gene expression required for cerebellar GC differentiation by programming neuronal enhancers.",

In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2 , which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle–mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline–deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet–induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.",

          "abstract": "High-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can assist in determining protein structure, but it requires time-consuming acquisition. Deep learning enables ultrafast reconstruction but is limited to spectra of up to three dimensions and cannot provide faithful reconstruction under unseen acceleration factors. Extending deep learning to handle higher-dimensional spectra and varying acceleration factors is desirable. However, scalability requires complex networks and more data, seriously hindering applications. To address this, we designed a network to learn data in one dimension (1D). First, time-domain signals were modeled as the outer product of 1D exponentials. Then, each 1D exponential was approximated with a rank-one Hankel matrix. Last, reconstruction error was corrected with a neural network. Here, we demonstrate robust 3D NMR reconstruction across acceleration factors (2 to 33) using one trained network. In addition, we find that reconstruction of 4D NMR is possible with artificial intelligence. This work opens an avenue for accelerating arbitrarily high-dimensional NMR. ",

LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.",

          "abstract": "Pulmonary surfactants reduce the work of breathing, enhance compliance, and prevent alveolar collapse. Yet, their role extends beyond that of a simple surfactant; otherwise, exogenous surfactant therapy would fully restore compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by increasing surface concentration alone. Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.",

          "abstract": "Landslides exhibit intermittent downslope movements over days to years before a possible collapse, commonly boosted by external events like precipitation. The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.",

Cryo-EM reveals a unique irregular triple-layer β solenoid cross-β fibril composed of a single protofilament.

RNA interference experiments showed that 85.7% (66 of 77) of the candidate genes with nonlethal knockdown effects influenced starvation resistance. Of these, 49 had sex-dependent effects, including 12 with sexually antagonistic effects—all increasing resistance in females but decreasing it in males. These patterns were not explained by sex-biased expression or knockdown efficiency. Analysis of the Lnk gene revealed that both nonsynonymous mutations and expression changes had sex-dependent effects.

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA.

Our proposed approach achieves a remarkable enhancement in the operational bandwidth of OECTs, reaching 26 kHz while preserving their high transconductance, notably using a commercially available conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). This is enabled by micro/nanostructured channel design that enhances ion accessibility and minimizes parasitic effects. This advancement allows for continuous, wide-frequency neural signal recording from peripheral nerves. This work offers a robust strategy for achieving both high transconductance and fast switching in OECTs, establishing a foundation for the development of next-generation, high-speed bioelectronic interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Temperate phages and prophages are well-known carriers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) facilitating their transmission. In contrast, lytic phages rarely harbor functional ARGs. However, by a lenient threshold search strategy combined with a machine learning approach based on structural similarity, here we identified 9419 potential ARGs within lytic phages. We showed that potential trimethoprim-resistance dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ) genes enriched in lytic phages could confer trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli . Sequence analysis revealed that lytic phages rarely transfer these potential dfrA genes into their bacterial hosts. Functional studies showed that these dfrA genes not only enhance phage reproduction in the presence of trimethoprim but also promote bacterial growth during phage infection. These results highlight that abundant functional ARGs were selected in evolution to improve lytic phage reproduction by promoting bacterial growth during infection, suggesting that dfrA genes play important roles in evolutionary mutualism between lytic phages and their hosts.",

The foregut and hindgut circuits of the C. elegans enteric nervous system (ENS) control feeding and defecation behavior, respectively. Here, we show that epithelial cells in the midgut integrate feeding state information to control these behavioral outputs by releasing distinct neuropeptidergic signals. In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.",

Our findings indicate that a topological transition occurs in response to modulation frequency increases, producing anomalous edge states with chirality within Floquet harmonic bandgaps. The open nature of the metasurface facilitates harmonic generation via Floquet edge states. Experimentally, we confirm the existence of Floquet harmonic bands and the robust unidirectional propagation of these edge states. In addition, we propose a large-scale coding scheme to dynamically reconfigure propagation paths through programmable binary states of the meta-units.

Multi-CBB aggregation generated rod-, triangle-, and diamond-shaped AggreBots, altering tissue geometry without sacrificing surface cilia density or inter-CBB boundary fidelity. The further introduction of CCDC39 -mutated CBBs as cilia-inactive modules enabled the generation of hybrid AggreBots with precision modulation of active cilia distribution, further empowering alterations to motility patterns.

We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism.

This reduction is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which have little to no α2,6-linked sialic acid. To understand how α2,6-linked sialic acid affects T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell–specific deletion of sialyltransferase gene St6gal1 . The lack of α2,6-linked sialic acid leads to reduced responsiveness in naïve T cells, leading to impaired T cell responses against Listeria monocytogenes infection and tumor growth. PD-1 pathway blockade partially restores St6gal1 -deficient T cells’ ability to control tumor growth. These findings suggest that α2,6-linked sialic acid is critical for maintaining long-term T cell responsiveness, and its loss may contribute to decreased T cell function with age.",

The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis . Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.",

In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain.

This multipass configuration also reduces the lasing threshold by nearly 70%, facilitates spectral broadening of pump pulses, and compresses the pulse duration of N 2 + lasing.

We leveraged the intrinsically high open probability ( P o ) of NMDARs composed of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, together with judiciously chosen mutants and ligands, to achieve conditions in which receptors had a P o near unity. Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured three activated receptor states, each with distinct conformations of the gate-forming M3 helices. Separately, we carried out single-channel electrophysiology, together with statistical modeling, to relate the cryo-EM structures to the gating reaction. NMDAR channel opening involves bending of the pore-forming M3 helices to produce a transient open-channel conformation, subsequently stabilized by new interactions between the D2-M3 linkers with the pre-M1 helices and the pre-M4 loops, to yield the stable open channel.",

We present a plug-and-play fiber-to-PIC solution using female multifiber termination push-on cables, with alignment counterparts additively fabricated on the chip via two-photon polymerization.

These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin.

Here, we integrate new seismic images with regional seismicity to investigate an actively fragmenting subduction system at northern Cascadia’s ridge-trench-fault triple junction where subduction termination is imminent. Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.",

Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL).

It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9.

NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal–induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.",

Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses.

Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.",

          "abstract": "T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) play a pivotal role in maintaining immune self-tolerance and prevention of autoantibody induction. However, the stages of Tfr formation have still not been clarified. Here, we found that 30 to 50% of circulating Tfr in human blood have a naïve-like phenotype (preTfr, CD45RA + CD45RO − Foxp3 + CXCR5 + ). PreTfr are expandable in vitro while retaining suppressive capacity. They are transcriptionally similar to naïve T regs (nT regs ) ex vivo, but after stimulation, they gain increased expression of Tfr-related suppressive molecules such as IL-1RA, suggesting that they are primed for full differentiation into mature Tfr. Further, we demonstrate that preTfr but not nT reg are significantly reduced in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and patients with sepsis and that this loss is correlated with increased anti–interferon-γ antibodies and activated atypical B cells. Together, these data suggest that Tfr are disrupted at the earliest stage of their formation during severe disease and may be an important therapeutic target in future vaccine developments.",

          "abstract": "In March 2024, a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b virus was identified in US dairy cows, with spillover to cats, poultry, and humans. Up to 30% of commercial pasteurized milk tested contained viral genome copies. The impact of residual viral remnants on host immunity is unknown. Orally ingested proteins can stimulate gut-associated lymphoid tissues, potentially inducing tolerance and altering responses to later infection. We found that milk pasteurization fully inactivated pandemic H1N1 and bovine H5N1 influenza viruses yet preserved hemagglutinin (HA) protein integrity. In mice, repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus did not alter mortality after H5N1 virus challenge. Preliminary data showed that naïve mice exposed to improperly pasteurized milk containing live H5N1 virus developed lethal infection, whereas prior H1N1 infection conferred protection. Mice with preexisting H1N1 immunity remained protected when challenged with bovine H5N1 virus after exposure to H5N1 pasteurized in milk. These findings suggest that pasteurized milk containing inactivated H5N1 virus poses minimal health risks.",

          "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by chronic inflammation and an unstable tear film. Stem cells have shown potential for DED treatment, but the main challenge lies in improving cell delivery effectiveness. Here, we developed eye drops for autoimmune DED treatment using porous arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD)–modified alginate microcarriers with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) (RGD-Alg@MSCs). These microcarriers provided a favorable microenvironment for large-scale cell expansion while maintaining stemness with ideal mechanical properties for ocular application. In vitro, RGD-Alg@MSCs demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic effects compared to conventional MSCs, including improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced release of immunomodulatory factors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these enhanced therapeutic effects. In the mouse model, RGD-Alg@MSCs exhibited prolonged ocular retention and enhanced tear production, promoted corneal healing, and suppressed inflammation by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and T H 17 differentiation. Our microcarrier system substantially improves stem cell delivery efficiency for treating autoimmune DED.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of fluidic vortex rings have long captivated researchers because of their complex behavior despite simple structure. Photonic toroidal vortices constitute a family of three-dimensional, spacetime nonseparable structured light fields carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, as solutions to the dispersive Maxwells’ equations, these wave packets do not survive nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by transverse and longitudinal OAM, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by longitudinal OAM. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion and induces topological transformations of vortex lines, characterized by annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. The renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor that frequently infiltrates surrounding brain tissue, causing therapy resistance and recurrence. The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.",
