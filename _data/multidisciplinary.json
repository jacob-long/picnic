          "title": "Science in 2050: the future breakthroughs that will shape our world — and beyond",
          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "The Roman sage Marcus Aurelius said we should never let the future disturb us. But then he never had a conversation with the futurologist Nick Bostrom about the state of the world in 2050.\n\n“There’s a good likelihood that by 2050, all scientific research will be done by superintelligent AI rather than human researchers,” Bostrom said in an e-mail. “Some humans might do science as a hobby, but they wouldn’t be making any useful contributions.”\n\nTime to rethink your career options, Nature readers!\n\n150 years of Nature — an anniversary collection\n\nTo adapt a cliché about computer models, predictions of the future are usually wrong, but some are interesting. And Nature has a long history of seeking stimulation in forecasts, projections and auguries about how research might unfold in the coming decades. Most notably, the journal marked the end of the twentieth century and the onset of the twenty-first with supplements dedicated to scientific soothsaying, and a bold prediction, from then-editor Philip Campbell, that life based on something other than DNA would be discovered by 2100. (It was a statement he called foolish then, but stands by today.)\n\nSo, with peer review suspended and Nature’s stated aim of discussing the “interpretation of topical and coming trends” firmly underlined, let’s set the controls of our (stubbornly still undiscovered) time machine for 2050 and take a cautious peek outside. Prepare for technological leaps, solving the puzzle of dark matter and perhaps being able to study enough people to wave goodbye to many diseases.\n\nHot times\n\nYou should probably brace yourself before opening the door. “It will be worse than we had anticipated in terms of climate change,” says Guy Brasseur, a modeller at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nThe world will have barrelled past the crucial threshold of 2 °C of average warming above pre-industrial levels by 2040, he suggests. (To avoid that, given the inertia in the climate system, the International Panel on Climate Change says that global emissions needed to peak in 2025 and then decline sharply; see go.nature.com/4prom5j.) So, by 2050, political debate on the reality of a warming world could have melted with the glaciers.\n\nArguments might rage instead about whether or not to try to cool the planet, most probably by injecting shiny particles into the upper atmosphere that keep sunlight from hitting the surface. Although this geoengineering technique is unproven and untested at significant scale, severe climate impacts by 2050 could encourage an affected nation or even a company to stage such an atmospheric intervention.\n\n“You could have some countries that are using it unilaterally,” Brasseur says, “just thinking that it will solve their problem without looking at the consequence for others.” The intervention could change rainfall patterns and disrupt other aspects of the weather, perhaps making the situation even worse. “I think it should be forbidden,” Brasseur says.\n\nGeopolitical tensions mean that forecasts of future climate to 2050 must increasingly account for more than atmospheric physics, Brasseur and his colleagues pointed out in a 2025 study1. A decade ago, climate scientists were celebrating global recognition of climate change with the Paris agreement. Today, those in the United States are being forced to delete the term from government reports and websites. Meanwhile, other priorities have taken over.\n\n“If we talk about climate science, people just don’t want to hear about it because they’re much more scared by other issues. They want food, they want peace,” he says. All of that points to the world in 2050 facing the prospect of 3 °C or more of warming by the end of the century.\n\nA plant in Iceland, run by Swiss firm Climeworks, pulls carbon dioxide from the air and stores it underground.

By 2050, removing carbon dioxide from the air could become such a business opportunity that companies find ways to draw down the circulating greenhouse gas and turn a profit in doing so.\n\n“We will make different stuff from carbon dioxide,” says Elina Hiltunen, a futures researcher at the National Defence University in Helsinki. “It could be plastics or fuels or medication. But they are all manufactured from air.”\n\nFuture shock\n\nThe vast gulf between these two possible scenarios illustrates the dilemma for futurologists and others who try to map progress and pitfalls beyond the next election cycle. How much can the future be projected from current trends? To what extent will it be driven by disruptive events and inventions that seem unlikely or haven’t been conceived yet? And at which point do predictions become, well, just a bit silly?\n\nFuturology — the systematic, interdisciplinary study of future trends — is best placed to imagine a time 10—15 years away, suggests Richard Watson, co-author of The Children’s Book of the Future (2024) and a former futurist in residence at Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\n“Under five years, you just get the gravitational pull of the present and you end up talking about next Tuesday,” he says. “Over about 20 years, it gets very sci-fi very quickly. I’ve run workshops for banks, and the minute you go to the 2050s you invariably get aliens living on the moon.”\n\nStill, 2050 is a prominent timestamp and a seductive deadline for those who want to set goals and steer investment to reach them. Space agencies, for example, routinely plan that far ahead because it can take a couple of decades for missions to be conceived, approved, designed, built and launched.\n\nThe European Space Agency, for one, has already canvassed the research community for ideas for projects for 2050. Submissions include an orbiting antimatter detector, bringing frozen samples of a comet’s icy body back to Earth and landing a robot explorer on the surface of Mercury.\n\nFuturists debate whether humans will reach Mars by 2050.Credit: JPL/NASA\n\nThen there’s Mars. US President Donald Trump restated a goal earlier this year for NASA to send humans to Mars well before 2050, whereas Elon Musk has claimed that his company SpaceX could send an uncrewed starship to the red planet as soon as 2026, as part of a plan to send people there in the 2030s.\n\nEmilia Javorsky, director of the Futures Program at the Future of Life Institute, a think tank in Campbell, California, that analyses transformative technologies, is sceptical about people making that trip, given the risks of space radiation and the long-term impacts of microgravity.\n\n“This is a field that’s driven predominantly by engineers, aerospace engineers, mechanical engineers that greatly underestimate the biological challenges,” she says. “Everyone assumes that we’ll find some material, some way to sort of hack ourselves out of it.”\n\nRise of the machines\n\nAny vision of the future has to try to account for the continuing ascent of artificial intelligence. But at what pace?\n\n“I could give you a relatively good view of what AI will look like in 2027, 2028. But I don’t know if I can be confident about where we’d be in 2030,” says Alex Ayad, co-founder of the London research and foresight company Outsmart Insight.\n\nThe picture beyond then is even fuzzier, but some in the AI field argue that by 2050, a machine-learning system could do science worthy of a Nobel prize.\n\nBostrom, who is based in Oxford, UK, and authored Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014), expects artificial general intelligence to arrive by 2050, and with it the capacity to answer “most of the questions that we are currently interested in, and that can in principle be answered by science”.\n\nEven without a superintelligence takeover, AI could make the process of science look very different by 2050. Combined with robotic experimenters, autonomous systems driven by algorithms will increasingly pursue biotechnology problems 24–7 in dedicated “lights out labs”, Ayad says — so named because no people would be involved.\n\nLessons from 150 years of science\n\nThat’s an example of a future determined by technologies that enable new types of scientific research and progress. In many cases, the knowledge generated would then feed into new and better technologies in a symbiotic relationship that unlocks more new science, and so on.\n\nAdvances in quantum science and cosmology could, for example, combine to make great strides by 2050, says Juan Carlos Hidalgo, a physicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Cuernavaca.\n\nBuilding on the Nobel-winning generation of attosecond laser pulses, researchers are currently developing ways to detect changes in the faint magnetic and electrical fields from single-electron and nuclear spins2. Incorporated into detectors for gravitational waves, such quantum sensors could allow cosmologists to identify smaller objects than is possible at the moment, including hypothetical primordial black holes, says Hidalgo.\n\nFormed soon after the Big Bang, these could hold mass that is currently unaccounted for in the Universe and, when combined with other observations, might unlock some cosmological conundrums. “All those will help us elucidate the nature of dark energy or even dark matter,” Hidalgo says.\n\nSuch a discovery, he suggests, could finally produce a successor to the generally accepted standard model of cosmology. which is already creaking under the weight of data, published in 2024, that called into question the model’s predicted rate of expansion of the Universe.\n\nAnd, in a cautious prediction that could finally silence the jibes about fusion energy always being 30 years away, Hidalgo adds that things look “promising” for the technology to finally come of age by 2050.\n\n“Certainly, nuclear fusion has progressed more in the last 5 years than it has in the previous 50,” he says.\n\nExternal factors\n\nThe scientific progress made in the past 75 years has emerged from broad public support for research, but that trend might not last.\n\nThe continued rise of populism and its lure of quick solutions to complex problems, for example, could leave the next generation of scientists struggling to justify the years of patient work needed to provide the foundation for advances that seem to be rapid.\n\nThe continued squeeze on public spending in sluggish economies, combined with political attacks on the value of science, could mean that researchers find themselves under increasing pressure to justify the expense of their work, says Patrick van der Duin, a foresight consultant based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and co-editor-in-chief of the journal Futures. “That’s not very good for the future of science.”\n\nIt could also tip the always-precarious balance between pure and applied research heavily towards science that governments see as explicitly supporting narrow political goals. With the population ageing in many countries, for example, governments will probably expand their investments in medical research aimed at curing and preventing chronic diseases. But technological progress alone can’t ensure these advances.\n\n“I think we’re going to embark on a decade of realizing that data is one of our big bottlenecks,” says Javorsky.",

          "authors": "Anne Gulland",
          "abstract": "Stop Chasing Happiness\n\nFrank Martela Allen & Unwin (2025)\n\nIn 2025, Nature searched for the world’s happiest PhD students, anticipating that they might be in Finland. The Nordic nation of long winters and, apparently, the most heavy-metal bands per capita globally is consistently crowned the world’s happiest country, according to the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre, UK. Happiness researcher Frank Martela explores what distinguishes the “land of quiet satisfaction” from others. Martela, based at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland, says his fellow Finns “accept life as it is, not making a fuss about what is bad or good” and shunning overt displays of wealth and success. His mantra is “energized contentment”, pursuing chosen projects but not chasing specific job titles or awards. A research career enables him to indulge a love of writing and to be part of a community that embraces discussions with the brightest minds.\n\nMartela urges us to stop caring what others think (being disliked by some, he says, proves “that you are exercising your freedom to be you”), expose ourselves to different viewpoints, not be ruled by our emotions and let go of our egos. Chasing success is also pointless. He quotes Iikka Kokko, a Finnish mathematics prodigy who started university at age 16. When asked what he wanted to accomplish, Kokko said that he would be happy with the life of an average researcher — for him, doing maths was an end in itself.\n\nNavigating the P.I.V.O.T.\n\nGertrude Nonterah Gertrude Nonterah (2025)\n\nIn 2018, Gertrude Nonterah lost a postdoctoral position after her laboratory leader’s research funding ran out. Later that year, the Ghanaian researcher landed a role at a biotechnology company, but she was laid off two months later. Losing two jobs in a year left the then 35-year-old despondent. But Nonterah turned what felt like a failure into a career opportunity. As an international researcher in the United States, her focus had been climbing the academic career ladder, gaining a second degree, then a PhD in microbiology and immunology. But having multiple degrees didn’t guarantee her anything.\n\nShe now works in medical communications and career counselling through the Bold PhD, a consultancy set up in 2021, and a podcast, which she launched in 2025. Nonterah helps researchers to step off the academic hamster wheel and seek opportunities beyond their specialty.\n\nThe first half of the book addresses “mindset” — avoiding the trap of thinking that your career is all about your degree. The second half focuses on the practical: how to network, learn industry language and build a portfolio that showcases your talents and skills.\n\nOne story she shares is that of Mary, who, after gaining a PhD in social psychology, realized that she did not want to stay in academia. As a lover of Japanese animation, she decided to apply for a data-analysis job for the California-based company Crunchyroll, one of the biggest streamers of anime. Although the role is a long way from her PhD, the research skills she learnt during her postgraduate study helped her to get the job.\n\nJust F**king Say It\n\nSusie Ashfield Elliott & Thompson (2025)\n\nLondon-based speech coach Susie Ashfield is lauded for transforming stuffy business executives into “TED Talk–style rockstars” and her first book aims to convince nervous public speakers that “speaking well, in any style, format or environment can be learnt, regardless of how unpleasant it might feel”. Ashfield boils the art of public speaking down to two words: care less. This mantra applies to making a fool of yourself, going red, saying the wrong thing — or whatever it is that stops you making yourself heard. The book’s 19 chapters each cover a type of storytelling, including job interviews (build rapport, remember the interviewers are on your side, ask questions and don’t be self-deprecating, is her advice), pay negotiations, networking events and panel talks. The book also covers how to disagree and communicate with difficult colleagues.\n\nAshfield’s two rules for delivering effective presentations are: know why you are speaking and sum everything up into a single sentence. Her example is a group of scientists seeking investment for their gene-testing kit. What’s their one-line take-home message? It’s simple, says Ashfield: this test will save lives. So don’t get bogged down explaining the underlying technology, but focus on its life-saving potential instead.\n\nConference-panel hosts need to remember that “this is not about you” and panellists are warned not to talk over the other guests. And if you don’t know the answer in a Q&A session, be honest. Ask the audience instead.\n\nThe Four Paths of Assertiveness\n\nScott Cooper & Naoki Yoshinaga Johns Hopkins University Press (2025)\n\nThis comprehensive manual includes advice on dealing with manipulative colleagues, standing up for yourself and advocating for what’s right. Its authors — Scott Cooper, a youth advocate in San Francisco, California, and Naoki Yoshinaga, a psychologist at the University of Miyazaki in Japan — break down assertiveness into: social, behavioural, emotional and mental assertiveness.\n\nSocial assertiveness, they say, is expressing what you want and how you feel but without steamrollering others. They offer tips on how to say no, seek a pay rise and tackle shyness and social anxiety. Sometimes, shrugging off a setback or taking responsibility for a mistake is needed, they add.\n\nThe behavioural assertiveness section recommends a daily to-do list, always including some that are enjoyable, and breaking down difficult tasks into smaller ones.\n\nPrioritizing personal values, such as helping others and pursuing hobbies, can help readers, the authors say. Rejecting values imposed by others, as Isaac Newton did when he chose physics even though his mother wanted him to be a farmer, proves that we are the ultimate judge of what’s right for us.\n\nThe emotional assertiveness section quotes happiness researcher Barbara Fredrickson, who says that people are more likely to perform well with a minimum three-to-one ratio of positive to negative communication. Finally, mental assertiveness is an acceptance of life’s ups and downs. If you’ve just made an error, don’t dwell on it but tell yourself: “Mistakes are part of life. I’ll learn from them and move on.”\n\nThe Not To-Do List\n\nRolf Dobelli Allen & Unwin (2025)\n\nSwiss entrepreneur Rolf Dobelli turns the self-help book into a manual for self-sabotage. Instead of telling you how to live a happy and successful life, his tongue-in-cheek tome lists actions that will make your life harder. The 52 pithy chapters include headings ranging from ‘Be Unreliable’ to ‘Trade Your Reputation for Money’ and ‘Cultivate a Victim Mentality’. ‘Be An Asshole’ recommends feeding your colossal ego by flaunting photographs of yourself on your office wall, to “be your own biggest fan — that way, you can be sure there’ll always be someone who likes you”.\n\nDobelli doesn’t claim to be the first business writer to use reverse psychology, but he says that we can learn much more from dissecting failure than success. In a chapter entitled ‘Get Stuck in Your Career’ he writes: “If you want a life devoid of prospects: choose your very first job as your lifelong career. Then stay in the industry for better or worse, even if it’s dying.” And in ‘Never Be Playful’, he recommends being sombre, uptight and joyless — cautionary figures include US theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who played bongo drums in his spare time.\n\nThe ‘Spin Multiple Plates’ chapter urges readers to start lots of projects and tasks but do them all badly because there’s too much going on. Dobelli namechecks the US computer scientist Cal Newport, author of the 2024 book Slow Productivity, who in an interview with Nature highlighted how the barrage of e-mails and Slack notifications many of us face hampers our effectiveness and contributes to feelings of burnout.\n\nPatriarchy Inc\n\nCordelia Fine Atlantic Books London (2025)\n\nMen still earn more, work fewer hours in the home and have more leisure time than women, says Cordelia Fine, a psychologist and workplace gender-equity researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Fine cautions against thinking (in richer Western countries at least) that the battle for equal rights has been won. Why, she asks, are 81% of film screenwriters male, when it is “a job seemingly custom-built for stereotypical feminine skills” and interests, such as language and people — an even steeper gender imbalance than that seen in PhD graduates in computer science and maths?\n\nFine highlights a study looking at bias against women in university science careers — the researchers found such a bias in only two metrics out of six and even a bias against men in one. “Institutions should get credit for the progress they have made,” the researchers said. But Fine points out that some criteria are hard to measure, such as invitations to speak on panels, opportunities to contribute to journals or work on editorial boards. These depend on relationships with senior scientists. People are biased towards others similar to them, so if senior scientists tend to be male, they are more likely to offer a leg-up to other men, she says. Fine concludes by calling for a society that rejects gendered job roles; accepts that all workers will have caring responsibilities at some point; and is alert to the “deeply embedded” gender system in childhood. She equates gender-specific toys to unequal division of labour at home.\n\nThe Twentysomething Treatment\n\nMeg Jay Simon & Schuster (2025)\n\nEighty per cent of life’s defining moments take place by the time a person is 35, says Meg Jay, a clinical psychologist in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her 20-something clients are living in a world of “peak uncertainty”, she adds, a sentiment that will doubtless resonate with early-career researchers worldwide. Jay cites the threat of climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of social media as factors contributing to this instability. Her book explains how “situational stressors” (such as exam preparation and relationship break-ups) often result in unhelpful diagnoses of depression. She encouraged one of her clients to talk to his professor after failing a class; the professor convinced him that a single academic setback didn’t make him a failure.\n\nHer remedy includes jumping into life and not talking yourself into depression or anxiety. Work, says Jay, “forces growth and change in a way that few of us can accomplish on our own” and your twenties are the key time to acquire skills and to learn from older, more experienced colleagues. Also, gaining skills can help in other aspects of life, from love to friendships.\n\nJay outlines how today’s 20-somethings are faced with a dizzying array of choices. To make sense of this, she advises the use of heuristics: “mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions without considering all the information”. She adds: “Rather than trying to factor everything in, we use a smaller number of variables to make up our minds.”\n\nThriving as an International Scientist",

          "title": "Why academics should do more consulting — and how to make it work",
          "authors": "Louise J. Slater, Weston B. Struwe, Christopher R. Vogel, Emma Walker, Regent Lee",
          "abstract": "Universities have three core missions: research, teaching and societal impact. The third is increasingly defined in commercial terms. The number of intellectual property licences has increased and more spin-out companies are being formed. This shift is supported by an independent review of spin-out practices1, standardized investment guidance2 and the professionalization of university technology-transfer offices3.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nBy contrast, academic consulting work, one of the most direct and scalable means by which academics can shape industry, government and civil society, remains underdeveloped (see ‘Consulting gap’).\n\nConsulting work and other routes for exchanging knowledge are often treated as administrative functions. Such activities are defined and measured inconsistently and receive limited recognition in evaluations of research-related innovation. At a time when universities are struggling financially and academic research is often seen as distant from people’s everyday concerns, that must change.\n\nHere, we call for universities to make it easier for academics to carry out consulting work. If the work is properly supported, it can diversify income, build enduring partnerships and ensure that research delivers a tangible impact.\n\nWhy consulting work matters\n\nThere are widespread benefits to academics offering their advice to outside organizations for a fee. For higher-education institutions, consulting work can provide a flexible stream of income at a time of financial strain. It can foster partnerships with industry and government that generate collaborative research, joint ventures and fresh sources of funding.\n\nIt reinforces universities’ reputation as engines of applied knowledge and economic and societal impact. For example, one small software team at the University of Southampton, UK, turned open-source verification tools into more than £600,000 (US$799,000) of consulting income by advising on safety-critical railway systems between 2014 and 2021 (see go.nature.com/44ueoch).\n\nFor academics, consulting also offers professional development, wider networks, financial reward and real-world experience. It creates career porosity between academia, industry and policy, opening routes into leadership roles. For example, consulting can underpin the spin-out-company model: an academic who created intellectual property might be engaged as a ‘fractional executive’ through a consulting contract, allowing them to contribute to the company and develop leadership skills. Consulting work also enriches the research culture of higher-education institutions, giving academics direct feedback on how their work is used in practice, informing grant proposals and strengthening career progression.\n\nSources: Value of consulting market, Office for National Statistics; Academic consulting, IP and spin-out data, Higher Education Statistics Agency\n\nFor society, consulting accelerates the application of knowledge to national priorities, such as clean energy, health and social policy. It provides a mechanism for organizations to benefit from publicly funded research. It also ensures university expertise is applied beyond the campus walls, and can feed back into teaching with real-world case studies that better prepare graduates for the workforce.\n\nHigher-education institutions could embed modules that simulate the practice of consulting engagements to enhance students’ understanding of work. In one example, industry-led consulting projects were developed at Henley Business School, UK, to give master’s students hands-on experience.\n\nConsulting, therefore, is one of the most immediate channels through which universities can deliver societal impact. These projects are typically shorter in duration and easier to set up than other routes to impact, such as spin-out companies. Yet, across most institutions, consulting receives limited attention.\n\nLost opportunity\n\nUsing data from the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency on the number of consultancy contracts and academic staff at nine universities, we found that less than 10% of academic staff, on average, engaged in consulting work. Academic consulting is worth roughly £500–600 million per year (£566 million in 2023–24). That’s equivalent to 0.6% of the UK management consulting market value (£92 billion according to the Office for National Statistics), or 2.8% of the sector, based on the definition of the London-based Management Consultancies Association (£20.4 billion).\n\nOver the past decade, the number of academic consulting contracts has fallen by 38% from around 99,000 in 2014–15 to fewer than 62,000 in 2023–24. Higher average values of contracts have driven some growth, with the linear trend in total academic consultancy income rising by 31% from 2014–15 to 2023–24. But that falls short of the trend in the UK management consulting sector, which was 51% over that period.\n\nSome institutions have demonstrated what is possible. In 2023–24, 17 UK universities earned more than £10 million annually from consulting work across a vast range of disciplines and industries, including drug-development advice, advanced materials testing, digital health evaluation, engineering analysis, and policy and socio-economic consulting.\n\nMedical parasitology consultant Wellington Oyibo reports on anti-malaria strategies.Credit: Adekunle Ajayi/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nData are less available for institutions in other countries; limited information (including personal communications with US technology-transfer offices) suggests that consulting income typically does not make up a large share of institutional turnover. This suggests a global underutilization of academic expertise through consulting, even among the world’s most research-intensive universities — and a lost revenue stream for higher education. Management consulting alone in the United States was valued at $407 billion in 2025, according to market research firm IBIS World.\n\nPrivate consultancy firms are increasingly moving into this underexploited market, capturing opportunities that universities neglect. Small-scale (under £5,000), fast-turnaround, one-off projects are commonly sidelined by university contract offices because they represent too small an income for strained institutional resources, creating space for contract-research organizations and technical consultancies with the agility to capture this demand. If universities do not act, global professional services firms will continue to dominate the space in which academic insight could deliver direct societal benefit.\n\nPolicy patchwork\n\nWeak institutional policies on consulting are one reason for this missed opportunity. We examined policies at 30 universities hosting at least 5 UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellows — a 7-year fellowship programme designed to develop research and innovation leaders in academia and business — supplemented by surveys of 76 fellows and interviews with technology-transfer staff at the same universities. Our analysis reflects practices across a subset of research-intensive institutions, including our own, and is intended to inform sector-wide discussion rather than prescribe a single model.\n\nGreat science happens in great teams — research assessments must try to capture that\n\nThe results reveal a fragmented system. Two-thirds of the universities we surveyed have publicly available policies, two of which prohibit private consulting. Permitted university-contracted time for consulting ranges from unlimited to 30 days or fewer per year, or to personal time only. Institutional charges range from 10–40% of consulting fees.\n\nWhen we conducted interviews with staff who manage academic consulting services across multiple UK universities, administrative delays and inconsistent incentives or recognition of consulting were often cited as common issues. The result is a patchwork of practice, in which opportunities depend less on expertise and more on institutional flexibility.\n\nThe financial outcomes for academics vary widely, from flexible fees agreed between client and academic to university-set day rates. Some academics choose to put their consulting income into research accounts at their institution to support their group or department, but whether this is permitted, and on what terms, varies between universities and even across departments in the same institution. At some organizations, up to 50% of an individual’s earnings can be diverted into institutional research funds.\n\nServices to support academic consulting also differ between universities and within them, with some departments or technology-transfer offices providing insurance, contracting and negotiation support, and other institutions providing none. Contract approvals range from a 24-hour turnaround to months of negotiations. Faced with these obstacles, some academics turn to private consulting conducted outside their employment contracts, often without legal cover and sometimes in breach of institutional terms.",

          "abstract": "After the Cataclysm, the humans brought in robots to clear the rubble. It was why the robots had been constructed. They were sturdy enough to withstand any further tremors and falling debris, and they were strong enough to lift the shattered pieces of buildings.\n\nTwobit worked tirelessly, like their fellow robots. Solar panels kept them energized, and the engineers had developed circulatory systems to keep their joints lubricated by filtering elements from the air and remixing them, the peak of intelligent design.\n\nIf the element mix was sometimes off, it rarely caused problems that were unsolvable.\n\nTwobit’s present task was within the remnants of an older building, one with a marble façade that had weakened in the years before the Cataclysm, as the changing climate had impacted air, earth and sea. The faults that had developed in the marble had caused it to cascade off the ruined structure like an avalanche, dusted with what could almost be mistaken for a fresh, powdery snow.\n\nNot that anyone living remembered what snow looked like. Twobit only had old recordings of what snow was, and they observed that this marble dust was not cold enough to be snow.\n\nBut those recordings also showed them what this building once looked like and how important it had been to humans.\n\nAnd that gave them an idea.\n\n*****\n\n“What’s that unit doing?” Jinj asked, studying Twobit on the feed.\n\n“Stacking rubble,” Chang replied.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Yes, I can see that, but aren’t they supposed to be stacking it in Sector 1?”\n\nChang hmmph-ed. “Right, I’ll send a reminder protocol.”\n\n“It looks like —” Jinj began. “— nah, why would a robot be trying to rebuild? That’s not what this crew is programmed for.”\n\n“You think it’s got a bad mix?”\n\n“The air there has heavier-than-standard percentages of calcium and carbon, but last I heard, we don’t have enough data to know what that means.”\n\nChang drummed her fingers on the desk, gaze unfocused as she thought. “Send the data to Mohini up in environmental. She has a theory about which elements are causing the units to go off their protocols. I’ll send the reminder to the unit.”\n\n“Copy. Wish we knew what’s going on in these units’ processors, though.”\n\n“Figure that out, and you can probably get reassigned from surveillance detail.” Chang grinned. “Get moved up to the lab with the engineers who’re tearing their hair out about causation and correlation.”\n\nJinj chuckled. “Livin’ the dream.”\n\n*****\n\nTwobit received the reminder protocol. “Move debris to Sector 1.”\n\nSector 1 was not where this building had stood, but perhaps it was near enough. And there were already materials available in that location.\n\nThey sent back an acknowledgement and got to work.\n\n*****\n\nMohini stared at the data. Calcium and carbon levels were 10% higher than they should have been in and around Sector 1. It was one of many reasons that humans descended from those who had survived the Cataclysm were still sequestered in subterranean bunkers, watching and controlling the robots.\n\nExcept, at the moment, they weren’t controlling the robots.\n\n“The records say that’s the old state building,” Jinj said. She hadn’t figured out what was going through the robots’ minds, but Mohini had requested her to come up to the environmental lab to brainstorm.\n\nMohini nodded. “Why that building, though?”\n\n“It was one of the bigger buildings.” Jinj scanned the text on her tablet, picking out some of the notes that grabbed her attention. “Impressive edifice, seat of government.”\n\n“But not currently usable, and —” Mohini trailed off. “I don’t think it looked like what they’re building.”\n\nThe entire crew around Sector 1 was working on this new building, roughly 200 metres west of its former location. They’d brought in lumber from other structures and were using it to contain smaller pieces of rubble on each course, with the lumber on alternating sides of the building.\n\n“It’s like a layer cake, but criss-crossed,” Jinj said.\n\n“Kath-kuni,” Mohini said. “Mātāmahī — my grandmother — called it ‘safe as houses’, but it really means wooden corners. They were everywhere in the town she lived in. The wood moves just enough when there’s an earthquake to keep everything standing, and the stone helps keep it warm and dry inside.”",

          "authors": "Jennifer A. Byrne",
          "abstract": "Hospitals, airlines and drug manufacturers are subject to oversight by external regulators, to ensure that consumers receive safe and high-quality services and products. In science too, regulators check that products from equipment manufacturers and reagent suppliers are fit for purpose. When I oversaw laboratories that used genetically modified organisms, the labs needed external certification to show that they had safe handling and storage processes. There’s nothing like knowing that an inspector could show up unannounced to focus people on safety standards.\n\nAI reviewers are here — we are not ready\n\nYet, one area of science is strangely devoid of independent checks — academic publishing.\n\nIn my view, external oversight could push journals and publishers to work harder to reduce integrity issues that are harming the scientific literature. These range from a lack of timely corrections and retractions for faulty papers, to a flood of manuscripts produced by artificial intelligence and paper-mill businesses that churn out fake or low-quality papers and sell authorships.\n\nI propose that academic journals submit to independent regulation through an international quality-management standard, known as ISO 9001. Organizations certified as ISO-9001-compliant must demonstrate operations that are customer-focused, committed to continual improvement and underpinned by systematic management approaches and evidence-based decision-making.\n\nISO 9001 is a widely adopted standard — one million companies and organizations in more than 180 countries are certified, including suppliers of cell lines and other reagents. It makes sense for journals to meet the same standard, sending a clear signal that they embrace the same regulations as many authors and readers do.\n\nWhy would it help? Journals and publishers are currently incentivized to meet authors’ expectations — but ISO 9001 compliance means also prioritizing the needs of readers. This shift in mindset could lead to more quality papers and faster corrections, as well as to journal subscriptions and article processing charges (APCs) delivering better value for money.\n\nInfluential list of highly cited researchers now shuts out more scientists: here’s why\n\nIt could add weight to existing regulations and incentives. For instance, when journals apply for membership of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) — which is seen as a mark of trustworthiness — they are assessed, to see whether they adhere to the organization’s principles. Journal indexing services remove journals from their indexes if quality criteria aren’t met. Yet, it’s rare that journals are de-indexed or subject to COPE sanctions. The reasons for de-indexing a journal are not always clear or disclosed. And sometimes links between these organizations and publishers leave room for the perception of possible conflicts of interests around such decisions.",

          "abstract": "The Eastern Zhou period (771–221 BC), characterized by social stratification, was marked by important inequality. Here the authors analyse 32 skeletons from Songzhuang Cemetery in Henan Province using sex-specific peptides, ancient DNA and isotopes to explore multidimensional inequality in sexes, diet and mobility. DNA and proteomic analyses show that young women were marginalized as sacrificial victims (22 out of 26 human sacrifices were female). Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses suggest dietary differences by social class, with the nobility consuming more high-protein and millet-based diets than sacrificial companions, who themselves show intra-group dietary variation (δ13Cbone,nobles = −8.6‰; δ13Cbone,human sacrifice group one = −10.9‰; δ13Cbone,human sacrifice group two = −14.1‰; δ15Nbone,nobles = 11.6‰; δ15Nbone,human sacrifice group one = 8.5‰; δ15Nbone,human sacrifice group two = 7.7‰). Enamel and dentin isotope data indicate that these dietary inequalities were established from childhood (δ13Cenamel,nobles = −1.5‰; δ13Cenamel,human sacrifice group one = −3.8‰; δ13Cenamel,human sacrifice group two = −6.9‰). Strontium and oxygen isotope evidence shows that a high proportion of the nobles were non-local migrants. Genetic analysis reveals a genealogy linking four noblewomen to a sacrificial victim, highlighting the importance of kinship and marital alliances in maintaining social status. Despite class rigidity, dental isotope sequences in M18 reveal that two individuals experienced childhood dietary shifts, indicating rare class mobility.",

Recent work has synthesized embodied cognition with cognitive load theory, and suggests that learning emerges as a sum of mental operations and the physical context in which they occur1. However, the way in which classrooms are designed around the world — including in Brazil, where I work — remains largely disconnected from these cognitive principles. In many of the classrooms I visit, walls are often overloaded with colourful posters, unrelated visual materials and competing information, a practice that is culturally perceived as enriching but is potentially counterproductive from a cognitive perspective.\n\nIn schools, the persistent use of classrooms with colourful decorations and walls filled with posters, charts and unrelated visual material may inadvertently impair children’s cognitive performance. Research has shown that excessive visual stimulation increases extraneous cognitive load, and consumes working memory resources that should be allocated to learning tasks2,3.",

          "abstract": "The decline of polygyny and the rise of monogamy among complex, stratified societies characterized by high wealth inequality present a long-standing puzzle in anthropology. Competing explanations suggest that monogamy either i) reduces reproductive inequality, fosters cooperation, and enhances success in intergroup competition, or ii) mitigates conflict over heritable wealth—especially land—under conditions of high social stratification and ecological constraints. Both frameworks are influenced by the history of Indo-European societies, where monogamy has long been normative and closely associated with land inheritance and state formation. However, normative monogamy is also found in many societies beyond this historical context. To evaluate these competing hypotheses, we formalized their causal structure and applied Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models to a global sample of 186 societies. Our results show that monogamy is strongly associated with land privatization and, in some regions, with ecological or demographic proxies for land scarcity—supporting the view that competition over heritable wealth promotes monogamy globally. In contrast, support for the intergroup competition model is inconsistent: While it may explain monogamy in some language families, these dynamics do not extend to most societies in our sample. Our findings suggest that monogamy arose repeatedly under similar socioecological conditions and cannot be fully explained by theories based primarily on Indo-European history.",

Here, we evaluated the socioeconomic trade-offs of China’s long-standing desertification reversal strategies and explored the potential benefits of innovative agricultural practices using high-resolution suitability models for major crops and cultivated pasture. Compared with a no-intervention baseline, continuing the Grain-for-Green Program and grazing exclusion under projected 2023–2050 warming and wetting trends would lead to reductions of up to 54 to 55% in grain output, 81% in livestock production, and 61% in agricultural income. Conversely, strategies emphasizing pasture cultivation and crop switching could substantially lower national expenditures on combating desertification while restoring ecosystems, enhancing agricultural productivity and incomes, and conserving water resources. These benefits would contribute 0.7%, 9.8%, and 3.8% toward global progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), respectively, while exhibiting trade-offs across multiple SDGs.

          "abstract": "Wild foods are critical to the food security of billions of people worldwide, yet the ecological mechanisms that promote wild food system stability remain poorly understood. Within complex food webs, ecological theory predicts that nonhuman consumers can maintain more stable consumption rates by foraging on multiple resources that vary asynchronously in their availability across space and time. These so-called portfolio effects may also sustain more stable harvest rates by humans in wild food systems. We analyzed wild food harvest patterns for 46 isolated rural communities in southern coastal Alaska that harvest a diversity of wild foods (96 taxa) across terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal, and marine habitats. We show that access to diverse wild foods across this heterogeneous landscape dampened variability in harvest through time and increased robustness to species declines by allowing communities to harness seasonal and interannual asynchronies in wild food availability. These results demonstrate how ecological mechanisms that stabilize ecosystems may also underpin the stability of human wild food systems. Managing landscapes to maintain access to diverse wild foods and adopting flexible governance that allows communities to adjust harvest as patterns of wild food availability shift through time are crucial to sustaining resilient wild food systems in a changing world.",

Here, we demonstrate that the D-clade type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2C-Ds) negatively regulate BR signaling by dephosphorylating key residues in the kinase activation loop of BRI1. The phosphatase activity of PP2C-D2 and D5 is activated through homo- or heterodimerization, a process antagonized by BR-induced BRI1 phosphorylation or SMALL AUXIN UP RNA15 (SAUR15) binding. BL treatment, BRI1-mediated phosphorylation, or SAUR15 binding disrupts dimerization, returning PPC2C-Ds to a monomeric, inactive state.

Mitigating productivity loss from interactions between these global change drivers requires a mechanistic understanding of the forces generating productivity benefits from species richness (i.e., overyielding). Progress has been limited by two challenges: i) individual mechanisms can be highly context-dependent, yet multiple mechanisms can produce similar responses to functional diversity loss or altered climate, and ii) most experiments test short-term weather events rather than sustained changes in precipitation. We address these limitations using direct tests of multiple mechanisms within a sustained, full factorial manipulation of plant richness, composition, and precipitation within experimental grasslands. Precipitation consistently increased overyielding, as yield declined in monocultures and increased in polycultures, consistent with greater specialist pathogen accumulation in mesic conditions. Resource partitioning and specialist pathogen dilution—estimated from physiochemical trait dissimilarity and soil pathogen dissimilarity—were positive predictors of overyielding, relationships that strengthened over time. Moreover, overyielding was best explained by the joint influence of resource acquisition traits and pathogen dissimilarities, indicating that multiple mechanisms generated productivity responses to richness. These two mechanisms can explain the robust findings across systems that productivity increases with plant biodiversity. Our findings predict that biodiversity loss will be most damaging in wetter climates, where pathogen dilution amplifies the benefits of diversity.",

          "authors": "Whitney Nicole Bergman, Marcelo Carlos Sousa",
          "abstract": "The β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) is an essential protein complex that folds and inserts outer membrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs) into the bacterial outer membrane. The BAM complex contains the essential BamA OMP with five soluble polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains, which scaffold the essential BamD lipoprotein and the nonessential lipoproteins BamB/C/E. The importance of each BAM component has been investigated primarily using cell-based phenotypic assays, and structural data have revealed insights into the role of the BamA β-barrel in OMP folding. However, in vitro quantitative analysis for the function of each BAM component has been challenging. We describe the development of a fluorescent reporter of OMP folding, bOmpA-A488, which we use to obtain single-turnover kinetic parameters for wild-type BAM complex in vitro. We observe a k fold of 0.78 ± 0.15 min −1 and approximate substrate affinity of 3.1 ± 1.1 µM consistent with estimates of in vivo requirements. Furthermore, we find that while BamA alone is inactive in Escherichia coli lipid liposomes, BamAB and BamAD subcomplexes have activities similar to that of the holoBAM complex. This suggests that OMP folding and insertion is catalyzed by BamA while the accessory lipoproteins maintain BamA in a catalytically competent conformation. We also find that, contrary to prevailing models, POTRA domain deletions that include POTRA3, which is essential in cells, do not drastically impact activity. This indicates that the first three POTRA domains do not play a major role in binding or folding OMPs under single-turnover conditions, suggesting a different role in cells.",

          "abstract": "Urolithin A is an anti-aging and anti-inflammatory gut bacterial metabolite derived from ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenol abundant in berries and nuts. The conversion of EA to urolithin A involves multiple chemically challenging phenol dehydroxylation steps that produce urolithins with varying bioactivities. Despite their biological and chemical significance, the bacterial enzymes responsible for urolithin production remain largely unidentified. Here, we use differential gene expression analysis, anaerobic protein production, and enzyme assays to identify members of two distinct molybdenum enzyme families (the DMSO reductase family and the xanthine oxidase family) capable of regioselective dehydroxylation and urolithin generation. These two enzyme families have distinct substrate requirements, suggesting they employ different catalytic mechanisms for phenol dehydroxylation. Multiomics analysis of a human cohort uncovers decreased levels of urolithin A and genes encoding urolithin A-producing enzymes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), implying reduced health effects of EA consumption in this setting. Together, this study elucidates the molecular basis of urolithin production, expands the known enzymatic repertoire of the human gut microbiome, and suggests a potential link between gut bacterial urolithin production and reduced host inflammation.",

          "abstract": "After consumption by herbivores, plant antimicrobial defense compounds may enhance herbivore immunity to pathogenic microbes. In conifer-bark beetle interactions, beetles ingest large quantities of phloem tissue containing high concentrations of antimicrobial phenolic glucosides, such as stilbenes and flavonoids. It is not known, however, if these compounds increase bark beetle resistance to pathogens. We showed that Eurasian spruce bark beetles ( Ips typographus ) attacking Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) hydrolyze phenolic glucosides to their corresponding aglucones increasing their antifungal activity. However, the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana , a natural fungal parasite of these beetles, detoxifies stilbene and flavonoid aglucones by forming methylglucoside derivatives. A two-step pathway involving a UDP-glycosyltransferase and an O -methyltransferase produces phenolic O -methylglucosides that are no longer toxic to B. bassiana and are stable to β-glucosidase action. Compared to wild-type strains of B. bassiana , mutant strains knocked out in the genes of this pathway exhibited decreased methylglucoside formation, slower growth on medium containing phenolic compounds, and reduced virulence toward bark beetles. Hence, methylglucosylation of plant-derived phenolics is a detoxification process that significantly increases the ability of B. bassiana to parasitize host insects consuming plant tissue high in phenolics, such as conifer phloem. This is one of the few examples of an entomopathogen that is able to resist the plant-derived defenses of an insect host.",

          "abstract": "Microtubules have been extensively studied for their interactions at the outer surface and ends, yet the regulatory mechanisms within the microtubule lumen, particularly in singlet microtubules, remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a proximity-labeling strategy to distinguish intraluminal from external proteins, enabling the systematic identification of key regulators residing within the singlet microtubule lumen. Among these, we focused on Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2), a conserved microtubule-binding protein. JPT2 binds directly to microtubules and localizes to the lumen in a C-terminal-dependent manner. Within this compartment, it modulates the distribution of the α-tubulin acetyltransferase MEC17 and contributes to luminal homeostasis. Notably, the luminal accessibility of JPT2 is highly sensitive to microtubule structural states and is markedly reduced by Paclitaxel treatment, suggesting that drug-induced conformational changes or steric hindrance can restrict luminal entry. Together, our findings identify JPT2 as a key organizer of the singlet microtubule lumen and provide a framework for the spatial and functional analysis of microtubule inner proteins. Beyond exogenous perturbations, our observations suggest that luminal protein distribution may also be modulated by steric competition or selective entry among intraluminal components, indicating a more intricate regulatory landscape within the microtubule interior.",

          "abstract": "Dormant bacterial spores germinate to become vegetative cells upon germinant exposure. Despite many germinants being energy sources, bioenergetic processes have been overlooked as germination can proceed, albeit slowly, without exogenous energy sources. Here, we apply remission spectroscopy to noninvasively measure energization of the electron transport chain (ETC) in germinating spores. In Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis , energization of cytoplasmic metabolism and the ETC occurs early in germination, before or alongside water ingress and bulk CaDPA efflux. The aa 3 -type oxidases (Qox, Cta) accumulate nonradical ferryl intermediates of their catalytic cycle, slowed by a high membrane potential. The Yth isoform of the bd oxidase, present in spores, allows rapid electron transfer to O 2 when the aa 3 -type oxidases are hindered, establishing a role for this enzyme. Deletion of Yth slows the initiation of “absorbance”/attenuance loss, directly linking bioenergetic processes to germination. We propose a powered germination model, where the Ger-mediated signaling cascade and bioenergetic processes occur in parallel and are mutually influenced by each other. This model explains why germination on energy-rich molecules (e.g., glucose) is often much faster than on energy-poor ones (e.g., KBr).",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulatory systems play an essential role in regulating brain states and functions. The canonical view is that the release of monoamines including norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) is high during wakefulness and attenuated during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas the cholinergic system is active during both wakefulness and REM sleep and quiescent during non–REM (NREM) sleep. Recent studies have revealed a slow and rhythmic release pattern of neuromodulators during NREM sleep that drives infraslow oscillation (ISO) (0.02 to 0.03 Hz) in the brain. A key question is whether/how the release of different neuromodulators during sleep is coordinated. In this study, we combined 2-site fiber photometry with electroencephalogram/electromyography recording to monitor the release of NE, 5-HT, and acetylcholine in the cortex and hippocampus during sleep and wake cycles. We found that the ISO of these neuromodulators is synchronized during NREM sleep. The synchrony between neuromodulatory systems increases in the oscillatory cycles leading to arousal. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of either the 5-HT or NE system eliminates the oscillation of other neuromodulators during NREM sleep. Optogenetic activation of 5-HT or NE neurons during NREM sleep induces the release of other neuromodulators in the absence of sleep-to-wake transitions. These results suggest that the rhythmic neuromodulator releases are highly coordinated in the brain. The synchrony among multiple neuromodulatory systems across brain regions provides a powerful neural mechanism to orchestrate sleep architecture and sleep-related neural processes.",

While some inflammatory responses may originate from mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), nonimmune cells vastly outnumber MNPs and may be an important source of inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that highly virulent EBOV induced a high and sustained pro-inflammatory response compared to less virulent ebolaviruses in non-MNPs through TLR4-independent NF-κB activation. We identified the EBOV matrix protein VP40 as a potent activator of NF-κB in non-MNPs, whose intrinsic inflammatory activation ability is higher than VP40 proteins from less virulent ebolaviruses. This suggests that VP40 is a virulence determinant inducing distinct degrees of pro-inflammatory responses among ebolaviruses. Mechanistically, VP40 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, primarily via TNFR1 using a ligand-independent mechanism. These findings reveal mechanisms that may drive systemic inflammation and promote EBOV pathogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate immune dysregulation in severe EBOV infections.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the factors that drive individuals in a population to conform to the same behavior or to exhibit behavioral diversity is crucial for understanding collective decision-making, information transmission, and culture, yet remains challenging. Here, we propose and test a conceptual model predicting a population’s position along a conformity–diversity (CD) spectrum based on two key axes shaping the CD landscape: an ecological axis, representing competition over depleted resources, which favors diversity over conformity (since resources are depleted sooner if all individuals conform to the same resource type), and a cognitive axis reflecting the relative ease of learning a behavior socially versus individually. Our experiments show that manipulating these two primary factors is sufficient to produce the full CD spectrum within a single species. Specifically, studying socially foraging house sparrows, we manipulated competition using depleted or nondepleted feeding wells and manipulated the relative ease of learning a task individually by manipulating levels of experience and task difficulty. As predicted by the model, sparrows exhibited strong conformity under the combination of “no food depletion” and “difficult individual learning” conditions, strong diversity under the combination of “food depletion” and “easy individual learning” conditions, and intermediate levels of conformity under mixed conditions. The results show that a population’s position along the CD spectrum is highly flexible and sensitive to ecological and task-related conditions. Accordingly, the demonstrated CD surface may be viewed as an evolving reaction norm, and hence as a baseline over which additional factors shaping social conformity and differentiation can be tested.",

Environmental changes associated with alternating wet/dry cycles during this critical interval in hominin evolution are recorded in isotopic profiles from lake sediments from Olduvai Gorge. The Olduvai Gorge Coring Project targeted the depocenter of Paleolake Olduvai, recovering a stratigraphic succession between the Bed I Basalt (~1.90 Ma) and Tuff IF (~1.80 Ma) datums that span hominin fossil horizons in nearby outcrops. Lacustrine claystones from the lower part of this interval are characterized by high C org (avg. 2.5 %). They display variations in δ 13 C org reflecting temporal changes in organic matter (OM) sources. Stratigraphic profiles for n -alkane δ 13 C values derived from plant waxes are consistent throughout wet/dry cycles indicating stability in savanna vegetation, refuting evidence for increased C 4 grasses during drier intervals. δ 13 C values for n -alkanes derived from aquatic macrophytes and for algal biomarkers increase during drier episodes, reflecting use of bicarbonate as a carbon source triggered by enhanced lake alkalinity. δ 13 C org profiles reflect variations in inputs of terrestrial vs. aquatic OM during wet/dry cycles, which are mirrored by δ 13 C values for hop-17(21)-ene derived from heterotrophic bacteria utilizing sedimentary OM. The δ 13 C records from Paleolake Olduvai sediments show temporal changes in OM sources rather than shifts in the proportion of C 3 and C 4 vegetation, indicating that precession-driven climate cycles primarily affected lake environments and associated aquatic resources. Thus, intervals of high climate variability did not necessarily cause changes in savanna vegetation affecting hominin habitats.",

Inhibition of CBP/p300 with two distinct small-molecule inhibitors suppresses T antigen expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . This shift promotes neuronal differentiation, associated with neurite outgrowth in MCC cells. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of genes involved in E2F, Myc, mTORC1 oncogenic signaling, as well as markers of the Merkel cell lineage including Sox2 and Atoh1. Notably, a rare MCC case exhibiting a mixed cellular composition, with loss of T antigen expression and neuroblastic phenotype, showed a transcriptomic profile resembling that of MCC cells treated with CBP/p300 inhibitors.

The regulation of metamorphosis has been well studied in model insects but determining the cue that initiates the physiological shift toward metamorphosis in other insects has been challenging. In most insects, the critical weight is a cue to initiate metamorphosis. Our goal was to determine the cue for metamorphosis in the solitary bee Megachile rotundata and to characterize the physiological mechanisms initiated by this cue. Larval bees were fed ad libitum (also termed “fed”) or had all food removed (also termed “starved”). We measured the time to initiate metamorphosis, juvenile hormone (JH) titers, and the abundance of transcripts involved in the endocrine response to metamorphosis. We experimentally manipulated JH by topically applying precocene, which interrupts JH production. We found that M. rotundata does not have a critical weight and that starvation through the removal of food triggered the initiation of metamorphosis. Food removal was associated with low JH titers, and the application of precocene mimicked the response to food absence. Food removal decreased transcripts associated with JH production, and increased transcripts involved in ecdysone synthesis and insulin/TOR signaling. Food absence is an ecologically relevant cue for a M. rotundata larva, which is provisioned a finite amount of food and is unable to forage for additional food. Despite having food removal as a cue for metamorphosis, the physiological mechanisms associated with metamorphosis are similar to those found in other insects.",

We propose a genomics-informed update to an existing framework enabling a more precise assessment of outbreeding depression risk and genetic rescue feasibility. We apply this approach to a butterfly species—the marsh fritillary ( Euphydryas aurinia )—which has faced severe range contractions and near-extinction in Denmark. We identify substantial inbreeding in the investigated populations (F ROH approaching 40%), historical gene flow, recent divergence times between populations, and low likelihood of local adaptation. Together, these results provide an example where genetic rescue could be undertaken successfully by transplanting individuals across populations with minimal outbreeding depression risks. Despite working with a scaffold-level assembly and moderate sample sizes, our analyses provide robust insights into population dynamics, demography, and local adaptation, demonstrating that even imperfect genomic data can inform conservation strategies. By refining an existing framework, we illustrate how genomics can enhance genetic rescue efforts and guide decision-making for threatened species.

Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase V max twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin’s off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.",

          "abstract": "Herbivory is destructive for crop production in many regions worldwide. The induced plant response to herbivores promotes resistance; therefore, characterizing the mechanisms underlying natural host resistance is highly important. However, the genetic components of resistance to herbivores in the staple food crop soybean remain elusive. Here, a key defense gene, GmMYC3 , was identified via joint linkage and association mapping in soybean. GmMYC3 encodes an MYC2 transcription factor that is rapidly activated after jasmonic acid treatment or herbivore attack and confers resistance to a major pest, the common cutworm (CCW), in soybean. GmMYC3 positively regulates multiple biotic stress-related genes, among which GmMYC3 triggers high expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors alongside its homolog GmMYC1 and downstream GmWRKY56 . GmMYC3 overexpression results in massive accumulation of trypsin inhibitors in soybean leaves, interferes with the protein digestion and absorption function in larvae that are fed these leaves, and retards larval and pupal development of the CCW. The results of the field tests of the transgenic plants corroborate the defense role of GmMYC3 . Evolutionary and population genetic analyses suggest that the elite haplotype of GmMYC3 contributes to resistance against the CCW without significant reduction in seed yield and quality. Notably, this haplotype appears at a low frequency in domesticated germplasms. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying plant resistance to the CCW and provides potentially valuable resources for breeding soybean plants with elevated resistance against this pest.",

          "abstract": "Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are the most common form of lower extremity ulceration, with a rising prevalence among the elderly. Despite their clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying VLU remain poorly defined. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptional atlas of VLUs, unveiling a widespread immunosuppressive microenvironment within the lesions. Specifically, stromal cells exhibited attenuated inflammatory responses coupled with enhanced fibrotic activity. Keratinocytes and endothelial cells demonstrated increased proliferative and angiogenic activity, respectively, yet both cell types showed markedly reduced antigen-presenting capacity. Immune cell compartments displayed profound dysfunction characterized by marked reductions and impaired functionality of dendritic cells, polarization of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and enrichment of T cell exhaustion signatures. Notably, cell–cell communication analysis revealed diminished crosstalk between immune and structural cell populations. Mechanistically, we identified NAMPT-mediated signaling as a critical regulator of myeloid-stromal crosstalk. Targeted depletion of NAMPT in macrophages disrupted fibroblast-mediated inflammatory responses and impaired wound healing, whereas exogenous NAMPT administration reactivated immune responses and promoted tissue repair in chronic wounds. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive molecular framework for understanding immune–stromal dysfunction in VLUs and position NAMPT as a central immune regulator and promising therapeutic target for chronic wound treatment.",

Circulating ATG7 enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis by directly interacting with IRS1 and modulating insulin signaling (IS) through liver–muscle crosstalk. Mechanistically, ATG7 binds to IRS1, promoting its activation and the propagation of downstream IS. Notably, we identify an ATG7-derived peptide (Aap2) that recapitulates ATG7’s insulin-sensitizing effects and improves glycemic control in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic mouse models. These findings establish ATG7 as a key regulator of IS and suggest that targeting ATG7 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for IR and diabetes.",

          "abstract": "The Niemann-Pick type 1 and 2 proteins (NPC1 and NPC2) coordinate cholesterol egress from late endosomes-lysosomes (LE/LY). Proper folding, trafficking, and localization of both NPC proteins are essential for normal LE/LY cholesterol handling. Accordingly, mutations in NPC genes cause Niemann–Pick type C (NPC) disease, a progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder. The routes by which NPC1 reaches the LE/LY compartment in mammalian cells are not fully elucidated. Therefore, to interrogate NPC1 trafficking, we developed genome-engineered HeLa cells expressing endogenous NPC1 mNeon . We demonstrate that endogenous NPC1 localizes to the LE/LY compartment and by using protein proximity-based approaches that NPC1 resides in the same membranes as Vacuolar Protein Sorting-associated protein 41 (VPS41), one of the two unique subunits of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex. Loss of VPS41 increases NPC1 and Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) abundance. Paradoxically, this results in marked accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol and induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein signaling. Mechanistically, using immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging in combination with a VPS41-dependent ectopic recruitment assay, we demonstrate that this is due to a shift in the localization of NPC1 and LAMP1 from LE/LY to biosynthetic vesicles called LAMP carriers. These vesicles have been recently described to transport lysosomal-destined cargo directly from the trans- Golgi (TGN) network to LE/LY. In conclusion, we identify NPC1 as a cargo for VPS41-dependent LAMP carriers that are instrumental for the delivery of NPC1 to LE/LY and maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have identified diverse hollow biomolecular condensates, characterized by biomolecule-depleted interiors surrounded by biomolecule-rich shells. Although several formation mechanisms have been proposed, a general thermodynamic driving force remains elusive. Here, we investigate a well-defined system in which the human transcription factor p53 and nonspecific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) form biomolecule-rich condensates. Introduction of dsDNA containing p53-binding motifs induces a morphological transition to hollow structures, accompanied by a material state transition from liquid-like to gel-like. In vitro assays indicate that the formation of hollow condensates is driven by p21 DNA–induced localized gelation at the condensate periphery. Guided by these findings, we developed a three-component phase-field model that quantitatively recapitulates the formation of hollow condensates. Simulations show that peripheral gelation leads to gradual depletion of protein and Random DNA from the condensate core, triggering spinodal decomposition and lumen formation inside condensates. Together, these results offer mechanistic insights into multicomponent hollow condensates.",

The specific factors that govern cellular heterogeneity in IFN induction potential during infection are not understood. To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within preinfection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, postinfection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection. Altogether, our findings reveal an important role for intrinsic expression of ISGs in promoting IFN induction and provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell heterogeneity in innate immune activation.",

While circular RNAs (circRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulatory molecules, their roles in AR signaling during PCa progression remain poorly understood. This study identified circUTRN , an AR-inhibited circRNA that is upregulated following neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and downregulated in PCa tissues. circUTRN inhibits proliferation in both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa. Mechanistically, circUTRN binds to acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and impairs the activity through both phosphorylation-dependent and independent pathways, thereby disturbing de novo fatty acid synthesis. The dynamic relation between circUTRN and ACC1 expression during PCa progression from treatment-naïve to therapeutic-resistant states highlights the metabolic vulnerability of fatty acid synthesis. Notably, we developed nanoparticles to deliver circUTRN in combination with AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs). This approach effectively suppressed CRPC xenograft tumor growth, even in models resistant to next-generation ARSIs. This study reveals an AR-regulated circRNA involved in PCa progression and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment-resistant PCa.",

          "abstract": "With approximately 4% of the world’s population using cannabis, there is a need to better understand its physiological effects. Cannabis consumption acutely promotes food intake (“the munchies”) via delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-mediated activation of cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1R); however, these appetitive effects have not been well characterized. We examined effects of cannabis vapor inhalation on energy and macronutrient intake patterns in human participants and then validated these findings in a translational rat model through which we explored behavioral and physiological mechanisms subserving this response. Vaporized cannabis acutely and robustly increased energy intake. In humans, this occurred in the first 30 min of snack and beverage access, irrespective of dose or gender. In rats, these effects were observed in the first 60 min of food access, irrespective of macronutrient content, satiation, or sex, and were a result of cannabis vapor reducing latency to eat and increasing feeding bout number. Also, cannabis vapor did not change the proportion of macronutrients consumed by human participants and abolished preexisting macronutrient-specific food preferences in rats. Our rat data indicate that cannabis vapor may override homeostatic appetite regulation by increasing motivation to eat and reducing food reward devaluation to promote energy intake. Finally, cannabis vapor did not alter circulating appetite-associated hormones, and these feeding effects were mediated by central, but not peripheral, CB1Rs. This study complements and builds upon previous literature to characterize the appetitive effects of vaporized cannabis and uses a translational approach to examine cannabis-driven energy and macronutrient intake patterns in humans and rodents.",

The unconventional AHE (with anomalous Hall conductivity ~10 5 Ω −1 cm −1 ) and a large positive magnetoresistance effect (&gt;1,000%) are shown to exhibit complex temperature dependencies, persisting to almost seven times the Néel temperature (~250 K). These effects are directly compared to elastic neutron scattering, inelastic neutron scattering, and neutron magnetic pair distribution function data, establishing unambiguous links between anomalous magnetotransport properties and directly probed short-range spin fluctuations. The latter occur over a notably broad temperature range due to geometrical magnetic frustration. Connecting to recent experimental and theoretical developments, these findings are discussed in terms of a temperature-dependent interplay between chiral spin order and chiral spin fluctuations, significantly elucidating the high-temperature anomalous magnetotransport in such compounds.",

N -glycosylated proteins undergo protein sequence editing by peptide: N -glycanase (NGLY1)-mediated conversion of N -glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartic acid. Nrf proteins are the only transcription factors that undergo sequence editing for transcriptional activation. However, the mechanism via which sequence editing regulates the transcriptional activity of Nrf1 has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrated that sequence editing of the ninth N -glycosylation site (Asn574) in human Nrf1 is required for proteasome gene expression in HeLa cells. Editing of Asn574 is essential for interaction with host cell factor C1 and O -GlcNAc transferase, which is required for Nrf1 chromatin binding and sufficient proteasome expression. Furthermore, sequence editing of N -glycosylation sites other than Asn574 is required for the interaction with the coactivator CREBBP/EP300, thereby enhancing Nrf1’s transcriptional activity. Unexpectedly, the expression of Nrf1 mutants that mimic proteolytic processing by DNA-damage-inducible 1 homolog 2 and sequence editing by NGLY1 markedly diminished the growth rate in HeLa cells, suggesting that the constitutive activation of Nrf1 exhibits cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study explains the strategy of on-demand Nrf1 activation for survival benefits. Nrf1 is synthesized as a proteasome-targeting protein and is highly glycosylated in the ER. Nrf1 is activated via sequence editing-dependent coactivator complex formation only when the proteasome needs to be compensated for.",

Different maturation states (mature and immature forms) of flavivirus particles have been observed to be released from infected cells and are infectious. To understand how an ultrapotent human antibody (HMAb) A9E can neutralize these Zika particles, we determined the cryoEM structures of the A9E Fab fragment complexed with mature (mZIKV) and immature (immZIKV) ZIKV to 2.8Å and 7.5Å, respectively. A9E binds to an epitope spanning Domain I (EDI), EDIII, and their linker in an E protein protomer in both immZIKV and mZIKV particles. A9E generally inhibited prior to or during virus attachment to cells, via virus aggregation, distortion of virus particles and inhibition of receptor binding. ImmZIKV is particularly sensitive to structural distortion by Fab A9E. The primary mode of infection used by ImmZIKV is via antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE)—the formation of virus complex with nonneutralizing or subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies, that leads to enhanced infection of Fcγ positive myeloid cells. IgG A9E, by itself displays poor ADE activity. When IgG LALA mutant or Fab A9E is added to other enhancing antibody (DV62.5):virus complexes, they can strongly reduce the overall ADE activity. This is likely due to their ability to distort virus particle structure, suggesting that HMAb A9E could be a potential prophylactic and therapeutic candidate against all maturation states of ZIKV.",

However, the spontaneous natural base pair opening behavior of native duplexes is still not understood. Hydrogen exchange (HX) experiments can measure the kinetic and equilibrium parameters of base pair opening reactions, but different approaches have led to discrepant datasets and opposing views of nucleic acid structural dynamics. Here, I reexamine the data and resolve these long-standing contradictory views. The conclusion is that the seemingly contradictory datasets characterize two different modes of base pair opening reactions that, for identifiable reasons, are selectively accessed by the different methods and molecular models used. H-T exchange of DNA, duplex RNA, and long synthetic duplexes is dominated by large multi-base-pair openings with reclosing times of milliseconds (kcl ~20/sec) and surprisingly high population (Kop ~10 −2 ). H-H exchange measured by NMR relaxation is limited to the study of small rapidly tumbling oligonucleotides. Their HX is dominated by single base pair openings with reclosing times of microseconds and extremely low population (Kop ~10 −6 ). The different openings are seen selectively by the different methods because small oligonucleotides cannot host the extensive openings, while in large polynucleotides, the minimal population of single base pair openings makes no perceptible contribution to measured HX. The unexpected kinetics, equilibrium occupation, and size of DNA base pair openings are suggestive of rapidly migrating traveling loop wave packets known as solitons that dynamically scan and expose candidate recognition sites.",

To track the evolution of colistin resistance within a host, we performed sequential oropharyngeal infections in immunocompetent or immune-depleted mice in the presence of inhaled colistin. Both resistant and heteroresistant A. baumannii strains emerged with pmrB mutations that efficiently competed with the susceptible parent in the presence of colistin. These pmrB mutants had a fitness cost in the absence of colistin treatment but retained their ability to colonize the host. In contrast, LOS-deficient A. baumannii mutants removed the target of colistin, but such mutants were unable to colonize the lung. The two pathogenic pmrB mutants showed clear evidence of LOS modification, which was linked to increased transcription of LOS modification enzymes, including the product of the cryptic eptA gene. Spontaneous insertion mutations that caused hyperexpression of eptA allowed the heteroresistant mutant to develop clinically significant colistin resistance. Insertion mutations upstream of the eptA gene or those disrupting hns , which encodes a small histone-like protein, resulted in increased eptA transcript, linking expression of this protein to clinically significant resistance. A resistant variant derived from the heteroresistant parent was stable in the absence of drug, but continued passaging selected for colistin-resensitized pseudorevertants that were largely due to disruption of the LOS modification enzymes. Therefore, colistin heteroresistance is an early stage in the stepwise acquisition of stable colistin resistance in A. baumannii .",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) involves several excision pathways, including those mediated by exonuclease 1 (Exo1) and by the flap endonuclease Rad27 (human FEN1) coupled with DNA polymerase δ. Simultaneous inactivation of both excision mechanisms causes an MMR defect that is at most 5 to 13% of that caused by complete inactivation of MMR. Here, we reconstituted nicked-strand-specific MMR with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Msh2-Msh6 or Msh2-Msh3, DNA polymerase ε, RFC, PCNA, RPA, and Mlh1-Pms1 (human Mlh1-Pms2) under conditions lacking Exo1, Rad27, or strand-displacement synthesis by DNA polymerase δ. These reactions required the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity, its activation by RFC and PCNA, and its recruitment by Msh2-Msh6 or Msh2-Msh3. MMR was mediated by nicked-strand-specific excision by Mlh1-Pms1 through formation of single-strand DNA gaps having a broad range of sizes. This reaction is consistent with genetic data demonstrating redundancy between the Exo1, Rad27, and Mlh1-Pms1 excision pathways in MMR.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility relies on the continuous accumulation and integration of sensory evidence to guide adaptive behavior. In natural environments, behaviorally relevant information unfolds sequentially over time and is constantly evaluated against prior knowledge, task rules, and current demands. Integration of these inputs poses a computational challenge: How is temporally unfolding, predictive information integrated into a stable representation, while preserving the discriminability and flexibility to map individual stimuli to competing context-specific actions? Using large-scale human intracranial electroencephalography, we assessed how neural population activity integrates behaviorally relevant information across multiple sensory events that sequentially unfold over time and jointly determine the current context. The results uncover that the population geometry supports the emergence of conjunctive coding subspaces that integrate prior information with current sensory evidence and jointly define the temporal context that mediates behavioral benefits. Evidence accumulation diversifies the population responses distributed across the cortex, increasing the representational space that embeds context-dependent stimulus-action mappings. Hence, context-dependent sensory coding might constitute the neural basis underlying adaptive human behavior. In sum, these results demonstrate how neural population activity balances integrating predictive information with preserving stimulus discriminability to enable flexibility, while minimizing interference.",

          "authors": "Ergan Shang, Yuting Wei, Kathryn Roeder",
          "abstract": "Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is critical for advancing our understanding of gene regulation. While single-cell CRISPR perturbation assays such as Perturb-seq provide direct measurements of gene function, the scale of these experiments is limited by cost and feasibility. This motivates the development of computational approaches that can accurately infer responses to unmeasured perturbations from related experimental data. We introduce dbDiffusion, a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder. Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that approximate data distributions by reversing a Markovian diffusion process, progressively denoising Gaussian noise into structured outputs. By exploiting biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations, dbDiffusion enables the conditional generation of gene expressions for previously unobserved perturbations. In contrast to competing approaches, dbDiffusion does not rely on Large Language Model or foundation models, which have been found to yield unsatisfactory results. Rather, it leverages embeddings derived from measured perturbations to generalize to unseen perturbations, effectively transferring information across related experimental conditions. In benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods on Perturb-seq datasets, dbDiffusion demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting perturbation responses. A methodological innovation of dbDiffusion is the integration of prediction-powered inference, which corrects for biases inherent in generative models and enables statistically rigorous downstream tasks, including the identification of differentially expressed genes. By combining deep generative modeling with principled inference, dbDiffusion establishes a scalable computational framework for predicting and analyzing transcriptomic perturbation responses, significantly extending the utility of Perturb-seq experiments.",

          "abstract": "Aging is closely associated with cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cardiovascular aging. Most of the heart’s ATP is produced at the cristae, specialized subcompartments where oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) takes place. In this study, we used multiple-scale electron microscopy approaches to evaluate age-related mitochondrial and ultrastructural alterations of cristae in human and mouse hearts. We found that aged patients’ hearts displayed reduced cristae density as seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), even before any significant decline in the expression of cristae-shaping proteins. Similarly, a multiscale approach that included TEM and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) showed that in aged mice’s hearts, cristae undergo ultrastructural remodeling processes, resulting in a decrease in cristae density and width. Electron tomography suggests an apparent decline in cristae connectivity and an increase in fenestration size. These changes were linked to Opa1 downregulation, accompanied by reduced maximal OXPHOS respiration, but unrelated to alterations in the abundance of OXPHOS core subunits and ATP synthase assembly. Altogether, this indicates that alterations in cristae structure alone are sufficient to impair oxidative metabolism, which highlights its potential as an early signal of cardiac aging, even before noticeable changes in mitochondrial morphology occur.",

          "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila , the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, utilizes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) to translocate effectors into host cells, modulating diverse cellular processes to create a replication-permissive niche. Here, we characterize Ceg10, a T4SS-translocated effector, as a nucleus-targeting acetyltransferase that interferes with host ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression. Structural analysis reveals that Ceg10 harbors a conserved Cys-His-Asp (CHD) catalytic triad required for its acetyltransferase activity. Upon nuclear import mediated by the host transport adaptor HEATR3, Ceg10 selectively acetylates the ribosomal protein RPS20 at Thr64, Thr65, and Arg66, which have not been annotated as posttranslational modification sites. This acetylation impairs RPS20’s interaction with RPS29 and 18S rRNA, two components critical for 40S ribosomal subunit assembly, leading to translation inhibition and G1/S cell cycle arrest. These host perturbations are essential for efficient early-stage intracellular replication of L. pneumophila . Our findings identify a distinct mechanism by which a bacterial effector co-opts nuclear import machinery and directly modifies ribosomal proteins to subvert host biosynthesis and cell cycle control, highlighting ribosomal protein acetylation as a hitherto unrecognized role in host–pathogen interactions.",

We validate PackDock through side-chain packing, redocking, and cross-docking experiments, demonstrating its ability to address protein flexibility challenges. In a real-world application, PackDock identified nanomolar affinity compounds with unreported scaffolds for the protein of interest. Additionally, it revealed key amino acid conformational changes, offering insights into protein–ligand interactions.
