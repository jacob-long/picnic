          "abstract": "Motor skill repertoire can be stably retained over long periods, but the neural mechanism that underlies stable memory storage remains poorly understood1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Moreover, it is unknown how existing motor memories are maintained as new motor skills are continuously acquired. Here we tracked neural representation of learned actions throughout a significant portion of the lifespan of a mouse and show that learned actions are stably retained in combination with context, which protects existing memories from erasure during new motor learning. We established a continual learning paradigm in which mice learned to perform directional licking in different task contexts while we tracked motor cortex activity for up to six months using two-photon imaging. Within the same task context, activity driving directional licking was stable over time with little representational drift. When learning new task contexts, new preparatory activity emerged to drive the same licking actions. Learning created parallel new motor memories instead of modifying existing representations. Re-learning to make the same actions in the previous task context re-activated the previous preparatory activity, even months later. Continual learning of new task contexts kept creating new preparatory activity patterns. Context-specific memories, as we observed in the motor system, may provide a solution for stable memory storage throughout continual learning.",

          "abstract": "Unravelling the volcanic history of the enigmatic lunar farside is essential for understanding the hemispheric dichotomy of the Moon1-3. Cratering chronology established for the lunar nearside has been used to suggest long-lived volcanism on the farside of the Moon3,4, but without sample verification. Here we report two newly recognized episodes of basaltic volcanism with Pb-Pb dating for basalt fragments returned by the Chang’e-6 mission. One high-Al basalt fragment dated at 4,203 ± 4 million years ago (Ma) has a source 238U/204Pb ratio (µ value) of ~1,620, implying a KREEP-rich (K, rare earth elements, and P) source for this oldest-known occurrence of basaltic volcanism among returned samples. The main volcanic episode of the Chang’e-6 basalt documents a surprisingly young eruption age of 2,807 ± 3 Ma, which is not recognized from the nearside of the Moon. The initial Pb isotope compositions of these younger basalts indicate derivation from a source with a µ value of ~360, indicating a KREEP-poor mantle source. Mare volcanism on the lunar farside thus persisted for >1.4 billion years even with a shift to a source depleted in heat-producing elements. The consistency between the 2.8-billion-year basalt age and its crater-counting age indicates that the cratering chronology model established for the lunar nearside is also applicable to the farside of the Moon.",

          "abstract": "The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics 1 . Quantum systems out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental paradigm owing to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalization can be strongly suppressed 2–5 . Here we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation in a two-dimensional tilted Bose–Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy, we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of manifestations of Hilbert space fragmentation involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, that is, two-, one- and zero-dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics. Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalizing chequerboard state, we observe highly anisotropic, subdimensional dynamics, an immediate signature of their fractonic nature 6–9 . An interface between localized and thermalizing states in turn shows dynamics depending on its orientation. Our results mark the observation of Hilbert space fragmentation beyond one dimension, as well as the concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems.",

          "abstract": "Pangenomes are collections of annotated genome sequences of multiple individuals of a species1. The structural variants uncovered by these datasets are a major asset to genetic analysis in crop plants2. Here we report a pangenome of barley comprising long-read sequence assemblies of 76 wild and domesticated genomes and short-read sequence data of 1,315 genotypes. An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found. Expansion of a family of starch-cleaving enzymes in elite malting barleys was linked to shifts in enzymatic activity in micro-malting trials. Deletion of an enhancer motif is likely to change the developmental trajectory of the hairy appendages on barley grains. Our findings indicate that allelic diversity at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants to adapt to new selective regimes in agricultural ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Climate change affects marine organisms, causing migrations, biomass reduction and extinctions 1,2 . However, the abilities of marine species to adapt to these changes remain poorly constrained on both geological and anthropogenic timescales. Here we combine the fossil record and a global trait-based plankton model to study optimal temperatures of marine calcifying zooplankton (foraminifera, Rhizaria) through time. The results show that spinose foraminifera with algal symbionts acclimatized to deglacial warming at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19–21 thousand years ago, ka), whereas foraminifera without symbionts (non-spinose or spinose) kept the same thermal preference and migrated polewards. However, when forcing the trait-based plankton model with rapid transient warming over the coming century (1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C relative to pre-industrial baseline), the model suggests that the acclimatization capacities of all ecogroups are limited and insufficient to track warming rates. Therefore, foraminifera are projected to migrate polewards and reduce their global carbon biomass by 5.7–15.1% (depending on the warming) by 2100 relative to 1900–1950. Our study highlights the different challenges posed by anthropogenic and geological warming for marine plankton and their ecosystem functions.",

NCT04196413 (ref. 3) administered one intravenous (IV) dose of autologous GD2-CART to patients with H3K27M-mutant pontine (DIPG) or spinal DMG (sDMG) at two dose levels (DL1, 1 × 106 kg−1; DL2, 3 × 106 kg−1) following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Patients with clinical or imaging benefit were eligible for subsequent intracerebroventricular (ICV) intracranial infusions (10–30 × 106 GD2-CART). Primary objectives were manufacturing feasibility, tolerability and the identification of maximally tolerated IV dose. Secondary objectives included preliminary assessments of benefit. Thirteen patients enroled, with 11 receiving IV GD2-CART on study (n = 3 DL1 (3 DIPG); n = 8 DL2 (6 DIPG, 2 sDMG)). GD2-CART manufacture was successful for all patients. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred on DL1, but three patients experienced dose-limiting cytokine release syndrome on DL2, establishing DL1 as the maximally tolerated IV dose. Nine patients received ICV infusions, with no dose-limiting toxicities. All patients exhibited tumour inflammation-associated neurotoxicity, safely managed with intensive monitoring and care. Four patients demonstrated major volumetric tumour reductions (52, 54, 91 and 100%), with a further three patients exhibiting smaller reductions. One patient exhibited a complete response ongoing for over 30 months since enrolment. Nine patients demonstrated neurological benefit, as measured by a protocol-directed clinical improvement score.

          "abstract": "Radioactive nuclei with lifetimes on the order of millions of years can reveal the formation history of the Sun and active nucleosynthesis occurring at the time and place of its birth 1,2 . Among such nuclei whose decay signatures are found in the oldest meteorites, 205 Pb is a powerful example, as it is produced exclusively by slow neutron captures (the s process), with most being synthesized in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars 3–5 . However, making accurate abundance predictions for 205 Pb has so far been impossible because the weak decay rates of 205 Pb and 205 Tl are very uncertain at stellar temperatures 6,7 . To constrain these decay rates, we measured for the first time the bound-state β − decay of fully ionized 205 Tl 81+ , an exotic decay mode that only occurs in highly charged ions. The measured half-life is 4.7 times longer than the previous theoretical estimate 8 and our 10% experimental uncertainty has eliminated the main nuclear-physics limitation. With new, experimentally backed decay rates, we used AGB stellar models to calculate 205 Pb yields. Propagating those yields with basic galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and comparing with the 205 Pb/ 204 Pb ratio from meteorites 9–11 , we determined the isolation time of solar material inside its parent molecular cloud. We find positive isolation times that are consistent with the other s -process short-lived radioactive nuclei found in the early Solar System. Our results reaffirm the site of the Sun’s birth as a long-lived, giant molecular cloud and support the use of the 205 Pb– 205 Tl decay system as a chronometer in the early Solar System.",

However, the sugar content of commercial varieties is generally low, as it is inversely correlated with fruit size, and growers prioritize yield over flavour quality5,6,7. Here we identified two genes, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) calcium-dependent protein kinase 27 (SlCDPK27; also known as SlCPK27) and its paralogue SlCDPK26, that control fruit sugar content. They act as sugar brakes by phosphorylating a sucrose synthase, which promotes degradation of the sucrose synthase. Gene-edited SlCDPK27 and SlCDPK26 knockouts increased glucose and fructose contents by up to 30%, enhancing perceived sweetness without fruit weight or yield penalty. Although there are fewer, lighter seeds in the mutants, they exhibit normal germination. Together, these findings provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling fruit sugar accumulation in tomato and offer opportunities to increase sugar content in large-fruited cultivars without sacrificing size and yield.",

          "abstract": "The dangerous chemical hydrogen fluoride sits at the apex of the fluorochemical industry, but the substantial hazards linked to its production under harsh conditions (above 300 degrees Celsius) and transport are typically contracted to specialists. All fluorochemicals for applications, including refrigeration, electric transportation, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, are prepared from fluorspar (CaF 2 ) through a procedure that generates highly dangerous hydrogen fluoride 1–5 . Here we report a mild method to obtain fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar, bypassing the necessity to manufacture hydrogen fluoride. Acid-grade fluorspar (more than 97 per cent CaF 2 ) is treated with the fluorophilic Lewis acid boric acid (B(OH) 3 ) or silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), in the presence of oxalic acid, a Brønsted acid that is highly effective for Ca 2+ sequestration. This scalable process carried out in water at low temperature (below 50 degrees Celsius) enables access to widely used fluorochemicals, including tetrafluoroboric acid, alkali metal fluorides, tetraalkylammonium fluorides and fluoro(hetero)arenes. The replacement of oxalic acid with sulfuric acid gave comparable results for B(OH) 3 , but was not as effective when the fluorophilic Lewis acid was SiO 2 . A similar process also works with the lower-purity metspar. The production of fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar offers the possibility of decentralized manufacturing—an attractive model for the fluorochemical industry. With the renewed interest in innovative methods to synthesize oxalic acid via carbon dioxide capture and biomass 6,7 , and the challenges posed by our dependence on fossil fuels for sulfur and therefore sulfuric acid supply 8,9 , our technology may represent a departure towards a sustainable fluorochemical industry.",

Trapped polar molecules have been proposed as a promising quantum computing platform, offering scalability and single-particle addressability while still leveraging inherent complexity and strong couplings of molecules1,2,3,4,5. Recent progress in the single quantum state preparation and coherence of the hyperfine-rotational states of individually trapped molecules allows them to serve as promising qubits6,7,8,9,10,11, with intermolecular dipolar interactions creating entanglement12,13. However, universal two-qubit gates have not been demonstrated with molecules. Here we harness intrinsic molecular resources to implement a two-qubit iSWAP gate using individually trapped X1Σ+ NaCs molecules. By allowing the molecules to interact for 664 μs at a distance of 1.9 μm, we create a maximally entangled Bell state with a fidelity of 94(3)% in trials in which both molecules are present. Using motion–rotation coupling, we measure residual excitation of the lowest few motional states along the axial trapping direction and find them to be the primary source of decoherence. Finally, we identify two non-interacting hyperfine states within the ground rotational level in which we encode a qubit. The interaction is toggled by transferring between interacting and non-interacting states to realize an iSWAP gate. We verify the gate performance by measuring its logical truth table.",

Here, to better understand the intercellular signalling between cancer and stromal cells directly in PDAC tumours, we developed a multidimensional proteomic strategy called TMEPro. We applied TMEPro to profile the glycosylated secreted and plasma membrane proteome of 100 human pancreatic tissue samples to a great depth, define cell type origins and identify potential paracrine cross-talk, especially that mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation. Temporal dynamics during pancreatic tumour progression were investigated in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Functionally, we revealed reciprocal signalling between stromal cells and cancer cells mediated by the stromal PDGFR–PTPN11–FOS signalling axis. Furthermore, we examined the generic shedding mechanism of plasma membrane proteins in PDAC tumours and revealed that matrix-metalloprotease-mediated shedding of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase ectodomain provides an additional dimension of intercellular signalling regulation in the PDAC TME. Importantly, the level of shed AXL has a potential correlation with lymph node metastasis, and inhibition of AXL shedding and its kinase activity showed a substantial synergistic effect in inhibiting cancer cell growth. In summary, we provide TMEPro, a generically applicable clinical functional proteomic strategy, and a comprehensive resource for better understanding the PDAC TME and facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",

Yet current pharmacological approaches require conjugation of multiple receptor agonists to achieve both effects2,3,4, and so far, no safe energy-expending option has reached the clinic. Here we show that activation of neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R) is sufficient to suppress appetite centrally and increase energy expenditure peripherally. We focused on NK2R after revealing its genetic links to obesity and glucose control. However, therapeutically exploiting NK2R signalling has previously been unattainable because its endogenous ligand, neurokinin A, is short-lived and lacks receptor specificity5,6. Therefore, we developed selective, long-acting NK2R agonists with potential for once-weekly administration in humans. In mice, these agonists elicit weight loss by inducing energy expenditure and non-aversive appetite suppression that circumvents canonical leptin signalling. Additionally, a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp reveals that NK2R agonism acutely enhances insulin sensitization. In diabetic, obese macaques, NK2R activation significantly decreases body weight, blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, and ameliorates insulin resistance. These findings identify a single receptor target that leverages both energy-expending and appetite-suppressing programmes to improve energy homeostasis and reverse cardiometabolic dysfunction across species.",

We introduce a task-agnostic controller that assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network. By estimating both hip and knee moments in-the-loop, our approach provided multi-joint, coordinated assistance through our autonomous, clothing-integrated exoskeleton. When deployed during 28 activities, spanning cyclic locomotion to unstructured tasks (for example, passive meandering and high-speed lateral cutting), the network accurately estimated hip and knee moments with an average R2 of 0.83 relative to ground truth. Further, our approach significantly outperformed a best-case task classifier-based method constructed from splines and impedance parameters. When tested on ten activities (including level walking, running, lifting a 25 lb (roughly 11 kg) weight and lunging), our controller significantly reduced user energetics (metabolic cost or lower-limb biological joint work depending on the task) relative to the zero torque condition, ranging from 5.3 to 19.7%, without any manual controller modifications among activities. Thus, this task-agnostic controller can enable exoskeletons to aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities, a necessity for real-world viability.",

Unfortunately, safely resectable residual tumour is found in the majority of patients with glioma after surgery, causing early recurrence and decreased survival4,5,6. Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast (<10 s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4 million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n = 220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1 ± 0.9%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n = 129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries.

The ionospheric total electron content varies in response to Earth’s space environment, interfering with Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) signals, resulting in one of the largest sources of error for position, navigation and timing services 2 . Networks of high-quality ground-based GNSS stations provide maps of ionospheric total electron content to correct these errors, but large spatiotemporal gaps in data from these stations mean that these maps may contain errors 3 . Here we demonstrate that a distributed network of noisy sensors—in the form of millions of Android phones—can fill in many of these gaps and double the measurement coverage, providing an accurate picture of the ionosphere in areas of the world underserved by conventional infrastructure. Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe. We also show that the resulting ionosphere maps can improve location accuracy, which is our primary aim.

Such receptors would have extensive clinical potential to regulate the activity of engineered therapeutic cells, but to date only receptors against cell surface targets have approached clinical translation1. To address this gap, we developed a receptor architecture called synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptor (SNIPR), that has the added ability to be activated by soluble ligands, both natural and synthetic, with remarkably low baseline activity and high fold activation, through an endocytic, pH-dependent cleavage mechanism. We demonstrate the therapeutic capabilities of the receptor platform by localizing the activity of CAR T cells to solid tumors where soluble disease-associated factors are expressed, bypassing the major hurdle of on-target off-tumor toxicity in bystander organs. We further applied the SNIPR platform to engineer fully synthetic signaling networks between cells orthogonal to natural signaling pathways, expanding the scope of synthetic biology. Our design framework enables cellular communication and environmental interactions, extending the capabilities of synthetic cellular networking in clinical and research contexts.",

CO2 emissions will continue to drive warming until fully balanced by active anthropogenic CO2 removals. For practical reasons, however, many greenhouse gas accounting systems allow some “passive” CO2 uptake, such as enhanced vegetation growth due to CO2 fertilisation, to be included as removals in the definition of net anthropogenic emissions. By including passive CO2 uptake, nominal net zero emissions would not halt global warming, undermining the Paris Agreement. Here we discuss measures addressing this problem, to ensure residual fossil fuel use does not cause further global warming: land management categories should be disaggregated in emissions reporting and targets to better separate the role of passive CO2 uptake; where possible, claimed removals should be additional to passive uptake; and targets should acknowledge the need for Geological Net Zero, meaning one tonne of CO2 permanently restored to the solid Earth for every tonne still generated from fossil sources. We also argue that scientific understanding of net zero provides a basis for allocating responsibility for the protection of passive carbon sinks during and after the transition to Geological Net Zero.",

This mode of ontogeny is thought to be essential for the acquisition of advanced cognitive capabilities in a socially complex environment while the brain is still growing2. Key information about when and how this pattern evolved can be gleaned from the teeth of fossil hominins because dental development informs about the pace of life history3,4,5. Here we show that the first evolutionary steps towards an extended growth phase occurred in the genus Homo at least 1.77 million years ago, before any substantial increase in brain size. We used synchrotron phase-contrast tomography6 to track the microstructural development of the dentition of a subadult early Homo individual from Dmanisi, Georgia. The individual died at the age of 11.4 ± 0.6 years, shortly before reaching dental maturity. Tooth growth rates were high, similar to rates in living great apes. However, the Dmanisi individual showed a human-like delayed formation of the posterior relative to the anterior dentition, and a late growth spurt of the dentition as a whole. The unique combination of great-ape-like and human-like features of dental ontogeny suggests that early Homo had evolved an extended growth phase before a general slow-down in life history, possibly related to biocultural reproduction7 rather than brain growth.",

The skull of Navaornis is toothless and large-eyed, with a vaulted cranium closely resembling the condition in crown birds; however, phylogenetic analyses recover Navaornis in Enantiornithes, a highly diverse clade of Mesozoic stem birds. Despite an overall geometry quantitatively indistinguishable from crown birds, the skull of Navaornis retains numerous plesiomorphies including a maxilla-dominated rostrum, an akinetic palate, a diapsid temporal configuration, a small cerebellum and a weakly expanded telencephalon. These archaic neurocranial traits are combined with a crown bird-like degree of brain flexion and a bony labyrinth comparable in shape to those of many crown birds but substantially larger. Altogether, the emergent cranial geometry of Navaornis shows an unprecedented degree of similarity between crown birds and enantiornithines, groups last sharing a common ancestor more than 130 million years ago 2 .

One such modification, histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub), needs to be re-established by the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) E3 ligase to restore the silent Polycomb domain2,3. However, the exact mechanism behind this restoration remains unknown. Here, combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional approaches, we characterize the read–write mechanism of the non-canonical PRC1-containing RYBP (ncPRC1RYBP). This mechanism, which functions as a positive-feedback loop in epigenetic regulation4,5, emphasizes the pivotal role of ncPRC1RYBP in restoring H2AK119Ub. We observe an asymmetrical binding of ncPRC1RYBP to H2AK119Ub nucleosomes, guided in part by the N-terminal zinc-finger domain of RYBP binding to residual H2AK119Ub on nascent chromatin. This recognition positions the RING domains of RING1B and BMI1 on the unmodified nucleosome side, enabling recruitment of the E2 enzyme to ubiquitinate H2AK119 within the same nucleosome (intra-nucleosome read–write) or across nucleosomes (inter-nucleosome read–write). Collectively, our findings provide key structural and mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay of epigenetic regulation, highlighting the significance of ncPRC1RYBP in H2AK119Ub restoration to sustain repressive chromatin domains.",

A key challenge is to discover how interactions among fire-regime components, drought and land tenure shape wildfire impacts. The globally unprecedented3,4 2019–2020 Australian megafires burnt more than 10 million hectares5, prompting major investment in biodiversity monitoring. Collated data include responses of more than 2,000 taxa, providing an unparalleled opportunity to quantify how megafires affect biodiversity. We reveal that the largest effects on plants and animals were in areas with frequent or recent past fires and within extensively burnt areas. Areas burnt at high severity, outside protected areas or under extreme drought also had larger effects. The effects included declines and increases after fire, with the largest responses in rainforests and by mammals. Our results implicate species interactions, dispersal and extent of in situ survival as mechanisms underlying fire responses. Building wildfire resilience into these ecosystems depends on reducing fire recurrence, including with rapid wildfire suppression in areas frequently burnt. Defending wet ecosystems, expanding protected areas and considering localized drought could also contribute. While these countermeasures can help mitigate the impacts of more frequent megafires, reversing anthropogenic climate change remains the urgent broad-scale solution.",

Upon photoexcitation, these derivatives populate their π,π* singlet states that undergo a series of structural rearrangements leading to an overall permutation of the cyclic system and its substituents. This means that once the initial heteroaromatic scaffold has been prepared, it can then function as an entry point to access other molecules by selective structural permutation. This approach operates under mild photochemical conditions which tolerate complex scaffolds and chemically distinct functionalities. Preliminary findings also indicate the potential for extending this method to other azole systems, including benzo[d]isothiazole, indazole, pyrazole and isoxazole.

          "abstract": "The bone marrow microenvironment is a critical regulator of haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and fate 1 . Although it is appreciated that ageing, chronic inflammation and other insults compromise bone marrow function and thereby negatively affect haematopoiesis 2 , it is not known whether different bone compartments exhibit distinct microenvironmental properties and functional resilience. Here we use imaging, pharmacological approaches and mouse genetics to uncover specialized properties of bone marrow in adult and ageing skull. Specifically, we show that the skull bone marrow undergoes lifelong expansion involving vascular growth, which results in an increasing contribution to total haematopoietic output. Furthermore, skull is largely protected against major hallmarks of ageing, including upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipogenesis and loss of vascular integrity. Conspicuous rapid and dynamic changes to the skull vasculature and bone marrow are induced by physiological alterations, namely pregnancy, but also pathological challenges, such as stroke and experimental chronic myeloid leukaemia. These responses are highly distinct from femur, the most extensively studied bone marrow compartment. We propose that skull harbours a protected and dynamically expanding bone marrow microenvironment, which is relevant for experimental studies and, potentially, for clinical treatments in humans.",

          "abstract": "Making adaptive decisions in complex environments requires appropriately identifying sources of error1,2. The frontal cortex is critical for adaptive decisions, but its neurons show mixed selectivity to task features3 and their uncertainty estimates4, raising the question of how errors are attributed to their most likely causes. Here, by recording neural responses from tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) performing a hierarchical decision task with rule reversals, we find that the mediodorsal thalamus independently represents cueing and rule uncertainty. This enables the relevant thalamic population to drive prefrontal reconfiguration following a reversal by appropriately attributing errors to an environmental change. Mechanistic dissection of behavioural switching revealed a transthalamic pathway for cingulate cortical error monitoring5,6 to reconfigure prefrontal executive control7. Overall, our work highlights a potential role for the thalamus in demixing cortical signals while providing a low-dimensional pathway for cortico-cortical communication.",

          "abstract": "Rising carbon dioxide emissions are provoking ocean warming and acidification 1,2 , altering plankton habitats and threatening calcifying organisms 3 , such as the planktonic foraminifera (PF). Whether the PF can cope with these unprecedented rates of environmental change, through lateral migrations and vertical displacements, is unresolved. Here we show, using data collected over the course of a century as FORCIS 4 global census counts, that the PF are displaying evident poleward migratory behaviours, increasing their diversity at mid- to high latitudes and, for some species, descending in the water column. Overall foraminiferal abundances have decreased by 24.2 ± 0.1% over the past eight decades. Beyond lateral migrations 5 , our study has uncovered intricate vertical migration patterns among foraminiferal species, presenting a nuanced understanding of their adaptive strategies. In the temperature and calcite saturation states projected for 2050 and 2100, low-latitude foraminiferal species will face physicochemical environments that surpass their current ecological tolerances. These species may replace higher-latitude species through poleward shifts, which would reduce low-latitude foraminiferal diversity. Our insights into the adaptation of foraminifera during the Anthropocene suggest that migration will not be enough to ensure survival. This underscores the urgent need for us to understand how the interplay of climate change, ocean acidification and other stressors will impact the survivability of large parts of the marine realm.",

          "abstract": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity 1,2 . However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes 3,4 . Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Robotic exoskeletons that aid leg movements hold tremendous potential for improving the everyday lives of people by augmenting their ability to move through their environment. However, most exoskeletons support only a narrow range of specific movement types — either cyclic motion, such as walking and running, or non-cyclic, such as sit-to-stand transitions and squatting, but rarely both. Therefore, exoskeleton designs have not addressed large parts of the vast landscape of human movement. Writing in Nature, Molinaro et al.1 tackle this shortcoming by introducing a task-agnostic control framework that assists both cyclic and non-cyclic motions, adapting to changes in a person’s movements in real time. This exciting advance brings us closer to exoskeletons that can seamlessly adapt to wearers’ diverse needs in real-world environments, with promising implications for health care, industrial labour and beyond.",

Genetic linkage makes it difficult to alter one gene without affecting the other. This is true for the key characteristics of fruit sweetness and size in tomato plants2, a crop that is grown worldwide. Writing in Nature, Zhang et al.3 report how they improved tomato sweetness without affecting fruit size by targeting a gene encoding a protein that drives the degradation of a sugar-producing enzyme.",

Although energy intake is solely the result of the food that we eat, energy expenditure is a combination of various factors, including physical activity and the basal metabolic rate necessary to maintain vital physiological functions. Most drugs currently used to treat obesity aim to decrease appetite, but increasing basal energy expenditure at the same time to create a calorie deficit has remained a long-lasting quest. In the past few years, obesity-treatment approaches have successfully intervened on both sides of the energy-balance equation by concomitantly targeting different receptors1, but attempts to target a single receptor with one drug have so far failed2. Writing in Nature, Sass et al.3 unveil a single receptor as a pioneering therapeutic target that not only suppresses appetite but also enhances energy expenditure in animal models.",

We used linear mixed models and meta-analyses to examine the association between Internet use and mental health among 87,559 adults aged ≥50 years from 23 countries.

For two countries (the USA and England) with genetic data available, positive associations between Internet use and mental health were observed across three genetic risk categories. For three countries (the USA, England and China), a higher frequency of Internet use was related to better mental health. Our findings are relevant to public health policies and practices in promoting mental health in later life through the Internet, especially in countries with limited Internet access and mental health services.",

          "abstract": "The history of people’s movements and interactions shapes both genetic and linguistic variation. Genes and languages are transmitted separately and their distributions reflect different aspects of human history, but some demographic processes can cause them to be similarly distributed. In particular, forms of societal organization, including movements in and out of a community, may have shaped the transmission of both genes and languages. If children were more likely to learn their mother’s language than their father’s when their parents were from populations that spoke different languages or dialects, then language variation might show a closer association with maternally transmitted genetic markers than autosomal ones; this association could be further reinforced if children reside with predominantly maternal kin. We analyze the worldwide relationship between linguistic and genomic variation, leveraging the sex-biased transmission of X chromosomes to assess whether language has tended to be preferentially transmitted along the male or female line. In addition, we measure the effects of postmarital residence with female kin, matrilineal descent, and endogamy on the covariation of mitochondrial DNA and languages, using mtDNA because genomic data were available for very few populations with these ethnographic traits. We find that while there is little evidence for a consistent or widespread sex bias in the transmission of language, such biased transmission may have occurred locally in several parts of the world and might have been influenced by population-level ethnographic characteristics, such as female-based descent or residence patterns. Our results highlight the complex relationships between genes, language, ethnography, and geography.",

          "abstract": "Although the theoretical foundations of the modern field of cultural evolution have been in place for over 50 y, laboratory experiments specifically designed to test cultural evolutionary theory have only existed for the last two decades. Here, we review the main experimental designs used in the field of cultural evolution, as well as major findings related to the generation of cultural variation, content- and model-based biases, cumulative cultural evolution, and nonhuman culture. We then identify methodological advances that demonstrate the iterative improvement of cultural evolution experimental methods. Finally, we focus on one common critique of cultural evolution experiments, the appropriate individual learning control condition needed to demonstrate cumulative culture, and present an original experimental investigation relevant to this critique. Participants completed a combinatorial innovation task allowing for cumulative improvement over time in one of four commonly used experimental designs/conditions: social learners in chains, social learners in groups, individual learners experiencing an extended session lasting the same accumulated time as an entire chain or group, and individual learners experiencing repeated sessions adding up to the same total time. We found that repeated individual learning resulted in superior performance to any other condition. We discuss these findings in light of the relevance of the specific criticism of previous experimental studies that purport to have demonstrated cumulative culture. We also use our findings to discuss the broad trade-offs that participants face when learning individually and socially in different contexts, including variable acquisition costs, redundancy of effort in groups, and cognitive and motivational fatigue.",

The nature and timing of transitions in markets and institutions in response to growing climate risks will shape prospects for future socioeconomic well-being. As property insurance markets in the United States face higher levels of turmoil, policymakers are weighing various interventions to stabilize not only insurance but also housing and mortgage markets. We identify policy lessons based on the investigation of three bounding scenarios designed to address the question of how near-term (1 to 3 y) policy and regulatory choices surrounding insurance markets in Florida could influence medium-term (3 to 15 y) risk levels, disaster recovery, housing markets, and local economic outcomes. Since our policy choices today have a profound impact on future outcomes, careful consideration of the longer-term impacts of today’s policy choices is required to secure more effective and equitable adaptation decisions and pathways.",

Pörtner et al. , Science 380 , eabl4881 (2023)]. However, governments commonly focus on single issues, incentivizing land use change via “Flat-Rate” subsidies offering constant per hectare payments, uptake of which is determined by the economic circumstances of landowners rather than the integrated environmental outcomes that will be delivered [G. Q. Bull et al. , Forest Policy Econ. 9 , 13–31 (2006)]. Here, we compare Flat-Rate subsidies to two alternatives: “Land Use Scenario” allocation of subsidies through consultation across stakeholders and interested parties; and a “Natural Capital” approach which targets subsidies according to expected ecosystem service response. This comparison is achieved by developing a comprehensive decision support system, integrating new and existing natural, physical, and economic science models to quantify environmental, agricultural, and economic outcomes. Applying this system to the United Kingdom’s net zero commitment to increase carbon storage via afforestation, we show that the three approaches result in significantly different outcomes in terms of where planting occurs, their environmental consequences, and economic costs and benefits. The Flat-Rate approach actually increases net carbon emissions while Land Use Scenario allocation yields poor economic outcomes. The Natural Capital targeted approach outperforms both alternatives, providing the highest possible social values while satisfying net zero commitments.",

These studies incorporated cultural transmission and its interaction with genetics in contributing to patterns of human variation. Neither CE nor GCC results were consistent with racist claims of ubiquitous genetic differences between socially defined races. We summarize how genetic data refute the notion of racial substructure for human populations and address naive interpretations of race across the biological sciences, including those related to ancestry, health, and intelligence, that help to perpetuate racist ideas. A GCC perspective can refute reductionist and determinist claims while providing a more inclusive multidisciplinary framework in which to interpret human variation.",

          "abstract": "Cultural evolution applies evolutionary concepts and tools to explain the change of culture over time. Despite advances in both theoretical and empirical methods, the connections between cultural evolutionary theory and evidence are often vague, limiting progress. Theoretical models influence empirical research but rarely guide data collection and analysis in logical and transparent ways. Theoretical models themselves are often too abstract to apply to specific empirical contexts and guide statistical inference. To help bridge this gap, we outline a quality-assurance computational workflow that starts from generative models of empirical phenomena and logically connects statistical estimates to both theory and real-world explanatory goals. We emphasize and demonstrate validation of the workflow using synthetic data. Using the interplay between conformity, migration, and cultural diversity as a case study, we present coded and repeatable examples of directed acyclic graphs, tailored agent-based simulations, a probabilistic transmission model for longitudinal data, and an approximate Bayesian computation model for cross-sectional data. We discuss the assumptions, opportunities, and pitfalls of different approaches to generative modeling and show how each can be used to improve data analysis depending on the structure of available data and the depth of theoretical understanding. Throughout, we highlight the significance of ethnography and of collecting basic cultural and demographic information about study populations and call for more emphasis on logical and theory-driven workflows as part of science reform.",

          "abstract": "Modern cultural evolution theory adopts a variety of concepts and methods developed in mathematical biology, in particular population genetics theory. In addition to forward-looking approaches such as two-locus models, backward-looking approaches such as coalescent theory, which describe ancestral states of the current population, have played an important role in population genetics. Here, we show how forward and backward approaches can be applied to two examples in cultural evolution. The first example deals with the number of cultural traits, which can be analyzed by a backward approach. Cultural coalescent theory illustrates many unique aspects of cultural processes such as information transfer (i.e., social learning) from many donors (“cultural parents”), including or excluding the biological parents. Theory predicts that many cultural traits of intermediate (or higher) frequency (popularity) can exist that are surprisingly old. Many unsolved issues remain, however, such as how to incorporate social structure as well as natural and/or cultural selection, which we believe to be an urgent agenda. The second example is the punishment of sibling incest, a problem to which cultural coalescent theory cannot currently be usefully applied. By analyzing forward recursions, we show that punishment is ineffective in suppressing incest, unless the incestuous inclination is diminished by the presence of punishers. Based on these examples, we discuss the merits and demerits of forward and backward approaches.",

          "abstract": "Cultural evolutionary processes can often lead to a statistical association between neutral and adaptive traits during episodes of population dispersal and the introduction of a beneficial technology in a geographic region. Here, we examine such cultural hitchhiking processes using an individual-based model that portrays the cultural interaction between a migrant and an incumbent population. Our model is loosely based on the interaction between farming and foraging populations during the initial stages of the adoption and diffusion of agricultural practices. The two populations are characterized by different variants for their neutral and adaptive cultural traits, with the latter set providing a reproductive advantage for the migrant communities over the incumbent ones. We explore how the neutral traits of the migrant population spread and how this process is conditioned by the following factors: 1) the possibility of transmission of the adaptive traits; 2) the extent of the increased reproductive advantage provided by the adaptive variants of the migrant population; 3) postmarital residence rules; and 4) how and when neutral traits are transmitted. Our results reveal a diverse range of outputs, highlighting the relevance of factors such as the nature of postmarital resocialization and the specific combination of postmarital residence rules and sex-biased transmission.",

Recent studies on the modes of transmission in hunter-gatherers are reviewed before presenting an analysis of five modes of transmission described by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman [L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, M. W. Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach (1981)] but not previously evaluated in hunter-gatherer research. We also present two modes of group transmission, conformist transmission, and concerted transmission, seldom mentioned in hunter-gatherer social learning research, and propose a unique mode of group transmission called cumulative transmission. The analysis of the additional modes of transmission indicated that cultural evolutionary signatures of vertical transmission, such as the conservation of cultural traits, have been underestimated because previous studies have seldom considered remote generations or distinguished intrafamilial from extrafamilial horizontal and oblique transmission. However, field data also indicate that hunter-gatherer children interacted with and learned from many nongenetically related individuals; about half of children’s and adolescents’ horizontal and oblique social learning came from nongenetically related individuals. Intimate living conditions of hunter-gatherers provide opportunities for group transmission, and ethnographic evidence presented demonstrates that at least three types of group transmission exist. All three forms of group transmission theoretically contribute to the conservation of culture, homogeneity of intracultural diversity, and high intercultural diversity. Analysis of additional modes of oblique and horizontal transmission and discussion of previous and unique modes of group transmission demonstrate the various mechanisms by which hunter-gatherer children learn and how cultures are conserved and contribute to cumulative culture.",

Despite a burgeoning body of research on misinformation, it remains largely unclear who is susceptible to misinformation and why. To address this, we conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 US-based participants across 31 experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from response bias, that is, the tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). Across all studies, participants were well above-chance accurate for both true (68.51%) and false (67.24%) news headlines. We find that older age, higher analytical thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Additionally, older age and higher analytical thinking skills are associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency (alignment of participants’ ideology with news), motivated reflection (higher analytical thinking skills being associated with a greater congruency effect), and self-reported familiarity with news are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety). We also find that experiments on MTurk show higher discrimination ability than those on Lucid. Displaying sources alongside news headlines is associated with improved discrimination ability, with Republicans benefiting more from source display. Our results provide critical insights that can help inform the design of targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Cultural practices perceived to be adaptive—from clearing land for food production to medical innovations—can disseminate quickly through human populations. However, these same practices often have unintended maladaptive effects. A particularly consequential effect is the emergence of diseases. In numerous instances, a cultural change is followed by the appearance of a new pathogen. Here, we develop mathematical models to analyze the population processes through which cultural evolution precipitates the emergence of a new disease. We find that when a risk-bearing cultural practice spreads, emergence can be an unavoidable cost even if a safer alternative practice eventually evolves from the original. Social learning and a fitness advantage associated with the evolving practice drive early disease emergence but the two factors have distinct effects on the time to mutation of the pathogen and significant stochastic variation is observed. For example, a disease can take longer to emerge in a population that adopts the risk-bearing practice quickly than in a population that is slow to transition. Extending the model to explore the effects of an alternative practice evolving from the original, we find a nonmonotonic relationship between relative risk of the two practices and the median time to disease emergence. Our findings contribute to understanding how cultural evolution can shape pathogen evolution and highlight the unpredictability of disease emergence.",

We test its validity and applicability by using daily data on state-level COVID-19 responses in the United States. Social distancing via shelter-in-place (SIP) strategies and wearing masks emerged as the most effective nonpharmaceutical ways of combatting COVID-19. In the United States, choices about these policies are made by individual states. We develop a game-theoretic model of such choices and test it econometrically, confirming strong interdependence in the implementation of these policies. If enough states engage in social distancing or mask wearing, others will be tipped to follow suit. Policy choices are influenced mainly by the choices of other states, especially those of similar political orientation and to a lesser degree by the number of new COVID-19 cases. The choice of mask-wearing policies is more sensitive to peer choices than the choice of SIP policies, and Republican states are much less likely than Democratic to introduce mask-wearing policies. The choices of policies are influenced more by political than public health considerations. These findings emphasize strategic interdependence in policy choice and offer an analytical framework for these complex dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Sugar is the largest agricultural crop by mass and has seen a rapid increase in consumption around the world. There are widespread public health efforts to curb sugar intake through targeted policies given its association with noncommunicable diseases. Although curbing sugar intake aligns with sustainable diets that meet essential environmental and health targets, such a shift may be challenging from a political economy perspective. Utilizing sugar for other purposes such as the production of microbial protein, biofuels, and bioplastics, or using sugar lands to grow other food items, or rewilding could provide health and environmental win–wins that could be more politically palatable. Here, we explore several potential scenarios to illustrate the option space from which national and international stakeholders could choose locally appropriate pathways for alternative utilization of sugar or its lands. While beneficial, such alternative pathways would require the integration of environmental, economic, and health policies to provide a smoother diet transition that reduces stakeholder tensions. Given the trade in sugar as a commodity crop, international approaches that compensate sugar producers for avoided production or incentivize them for redirecting sugars to other uses will be needed. Such approaches could borrow concepts from Just Transition Partnerships that have been applied to energy system transitions in ensuring a transition for major exporters of sugar cash crops across low- and middle-income nations.",

          "abstract": "How do people search for information when they are given the opportunity to freely explore their options? Previous research has suggested that people focus on reducing uncertainty before making a decision, but it remains unclear how exactly they do so and whether they do so consistently. We present an analysis of over 1,000,000 information-search decisions made by over 2,500 individuals in a decisions-from-experience setting that cleanly separates information search from choice. Using a data-driven approach supported by a formal measurement framework, we examine how people allocate samples to options and how they decide to terminate search. Three major insights emerge. First, predecisional information search has at least three drivers that can be interpreted as reducing three types of uncertainty: structural, estimation, and computational. Second, the selection of these drivers of information search is adaptive, sequential, and guided by environmental knowledge that integrates prior expectations, task instructions, and personal experiences. Third, predecisional information search exhibits substantial interindividual heterogeneity, with individuals recruiting different drivers of information search. Together, these insights suggest that human information search is complex in ways that cannot be fully explained by monolithic accounts of information search, including proposals focused on estimation uncertainty or cost–benefit analysis. We conclude that broader theories of human information-search behavior are necessary.",

Nevertheless, our understanding of the ways in which stably transmitted, evolutionarily relevant human cultural traits might interact with the human genome is incomplete, and methods to detect such interactions are limited. Here, we describe some rules of cultural transmission which could pertain to both humans and cultural nonhuman animals that could lead to the formation and maintenance of stable associations between cultural and genetic traits. Next, we show that, in the presence of such associations, a process analogous to genetic hitchhiking is possible in gene–culture systems. These could leave signatures in the human genome similar to, and perhaps indistinguishable from, those left by selection on genetic traits. Finally, we model selective interference between cultural and genetic traits. We show that selective interference between a cultural trait under selection and a genetic trait under selection can reduce the efficacy of natural selection in the human genome, both in terms of the probability of fixation of beneficial alleles and the dynamics of selective sweeps. We then show that the efficiency of selection at genetic loci can, however, be increased in the presence of strong cultural transmission biases. This implies that the signatures of gene–culture interactions in genetic data may be complex and wide-ranging in gene–culture coevolutionary systems.",

          "abstract": "Genomic structural variants (SVs) play a crucial role in adaptive evolution, yet their average fitness effects and characterization with pangenome tools are understudied in wild animal populations. We constructed a pangenome for House Finches ( Haemorhous mexicanus ), a model for studies of host-pathogen coevolution, using long-read sequence data on 16 individuals (32 de novo - assembled haplotypes) and one outgroup. We identified 887,118 SVs larger than 50 base pairs, mostly (60%) involving repetitive elements, with reduced SV diversity in the eastern US as a result of its introduction by humans. The distribution of fitness effects of genome-wide SVs was estimated using maximum likelihood approaches and revealed that SVs in both coding and noncoding regions were on average more deleterious than smaller indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms. The reference-free pangenome facilitated identification of a &gt; 10-My-old, 11-megabase-long pericentric inversion on chromosome 1. We found that the genotype frequencies of the inversion, estimated from 135 birds widely sampled temporally and geographically, increased steadily over the 25 y since House Finches were first exposed to the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum and showed signatures of balancing selection, capturing genes related to immunity and telomerase activity. We also observed shorter telomeres in populations with a greater number of years exposure to Mycoplasma . Our study illustrates the utility of long-read sequencing and pangenome methods for understanding wild animal populations, estimating fitness effects of genome-wide SVs, and advancing our understanding of adaptive evolution through structural variation.",

As a demonstration, we modeled the liver with 3DPDs consisting of a pair of parallel millifluidic channels that function as portal-venous (PV) and hepatobiliary (HB) structures. Perfusion of medium or whole blood through the PV channel supports the hepatocyte-containing HB channel. Device computer-aided design was optimized for structural stability, after which 3DPDs were 3D printed in a polyethylene(glycol) diacrylate photoink by digital light processing and evaluated in vitro. The HB channels were subsequently seeded with hepatic cells suspended in a collagen hydrogel. Perfusion of 3DPDs in bioreactors enhanced the viability and function of rat hepatoma cells and were maintained over time, along with improved liver-specific functions. Similar results were observed with primary rat hepatocytes, including significant upregulation of cytochrome p450 activity. Additionally, coculture experiments involving primary rat hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells in 3DPDs showed enhanced viability, broad liver-specific gene expression, and histological features indicative of liver tissue architecture. In vivo implantation of 3DPDs in a rat renal shunt model demonstrated successful blood flow through the devices without clot formation and maintenance of cell viability. 3D printed designs can be scaled in 3D space, allowing for larger devices with increased cell mass. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of 3DPDs for clinical translation in hepatic support applications.",

          "abstract": "Animals chain movements into long-lived motor strategies, exhibiting variability across scales that reflects the interplay between internal states and environmental cues. To reveal structure in such variability, we build Markov models of movement sequences that bridge across timescales and enable a quantitative comparison of behavioral phenotypes among individuals. Applied to larval zebrafish responding to diverse sensory cues, we uncover a hierarchy of long-lived motor strategies, dominated by changes in orientation distinguishing cruising versus wandering strategies. Environmental cues induce preferences along these modes at the population level: while fish cruise in the light, they wander in response to aversive stimuli, or in search for appetitive prey. As our method encodes the behavioral dynamics of each individual fish in the transitions among coarse-grained motor strategies, we use it to uncover a hierarchical structure in the phenotypic variability that reflects exploration–exploitation trade-offs. Across a wide range of sensory cues, a major source of variation among fish is driven by prior and/or immediate exposure to prey that induces exploitation phenotypes. A large degree of variability that is not explained by environmental cues unravels hidden states that override the sensory context to induce contrasting exploration–exploitation phenotypes. Altogether, by extracting the timescales of motor strategies deployed during navigation, our approach exposes structure among individuals and reveals internal states tuned by prior experience.",

          "abstract": "Human hearing is robust to noise, but the basis of this robustness is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that the auditory system adapts to sound components that are stable over time, potentially achieving noise robustness by suppressing noise-like signals. Yet background noise often provides behaviorally relevant information about the environment and thus seems unlikely to be completely discarded by the auditory system. Motivated by this observation, we explored whether noise robustness might instead be mediated by internal models of noise structure that could facilitate the separation of background noise from other sounds. We found that detection, recognition, and localization in real-world background noise were better for foreground sounds positioned later in a noise excerpt, with performance improving over the initial second of exposure to a noise. These results are consistent with both adaptation-based and model-based accounts (adaptation increases over time and online noise estimation should benefit from acquiring more samples). However, performance was also robust to interruptions in the background noise and was enhanced for intermittently recurring backgrounds, neither of which would be expected from known forms of adaptation. Additionally, the performance benefit observed for foreground sounds occurring later within a noise excerpt was reduced for recurring noises, suggesting that a noise representation is built up during exposure to a new background noise and then maintained in memory. These findings suggest that noise robustness is supported by internal models—“noise schemas”—that are rapidly estimated, stored over time, and used to estimate other concurrent sounds.",

We propose three general selection mechanisms for phototactic microswimmers, and biophysical modeling demonstrates their effectiveness. Perturbation and high-speed imaging experiments show that of these three mechanisms, the “photoresponse inversion mechanism” is implemented in E. gracilis : a fast, light-intensity-dependent switching between two flagellar beat states responsible for swimming and turning causes positive vs. negative phototaxis at low vs. high light intensity via run-and-tumble vs. helical klinotaxis strategies, respectively. This coordinated beat-switching mechanism then also accounts for a larger set of previously reported E. gracilis behaviors; furthermore, it suggests key design principles for other natural as well as synthetic microswimmers.",

Yet, research has mainly considered external and internal attention in isolation. We used magnetoencephalography to compare the neural dynamics of shifting attention to visual contents within vs. between the external and internal domains. Participants performed a combined perception and working-memory task in which two sequential cues guided attention to upcoming (external) or memorized (internal) sensory information. Critically, the second cue could redirect attention to visual content within the same or alternative domain as the first cue. Multivariate decoding unveiled distinct patterns of human brain activity when shifting attention within vs. between domains. Brain activity distinguishing within- from between-domain shifts was broadly distributed and highly dynamic. Intriguingly, crossing domains did not invoke an additional stage prior to shifting attention. Alpha lateralization, a canonical marker of shifting spatial attention, showed no delay when cues redirected attention to the same vs. alternative domain. Instead, evidence suggested that neural states associated with a given domain linger and influence subsequent shifts of attention within vs. between domains.

          "abstract": "Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium linked to periodontal disease. Remarkably, P. gingivalis thrives in an inflamed environment rich in activated neutrophils. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognition is required for P. gingivalis to evade innate immune killing; however, the mechanisms through which P. gingivalis uncouples host inflammation from bactericidal activity are only partially known. Since integrin activation and alternative signaling are implicated in P. gingivalis TLR2-mediated immune escape, we explored the role of CD47, a widely expressed integrin-associated protein known to suppress phagocytosis and implicated as an interacting partner with other innate immune receptors. We found that CD47 associates with TLR2, and blocking CD47 leads to decreased intracellular P. gingivalis survival in macrophages in a manner dependent on the bacterial major fimbria. In vivo, CD47 knock-out mice cleared P. gingivalis more efficiently than wild-type mice. Next, we found increased expression and secretion of the CD47 ligand thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) following P. gingivalis infection. Secreted TSP-1 broadly protected P. gingivalis and other periodontitis-associated bacterial species from neutrophil bactericidal activity. Therefore, CD47-TLR2 cosignaling in response to P. gingivalis induces TSP-1 that in turn suppresses neutrophil activity, an effect that can explain how species such as P. gingivalis survive in an inflamed environment and cause dysbiosis.",

These DNAAFs localize in cytosolic foci thought to form via liquid–liquid phase separation. However, the functional significance of DNAAF foci formation and how the production and assembly of multiple components are so efficiently coordinated, at such enormous scale, remain unclear. Here, we unveil an axonemal dynein production and assembly hub enriched with translating heavy chains (HCs) and DNAAFs. We show that mRNAs encoding interacting HCs of outer dynein arms colocalize in cytosolic foci, along with nascent HCs. The formation of these mRNA foci and their colocalization relies on HC translation. We observe that a previously identified DNAAF assembly, containing the DNAAF Lrrc6 and cochaperones Ruvbl1 and Ruvbl2, colocalizes with these HC foci, and is also dependent on HC translation. We additionally show that Ruvbl1 is required for the recruitment of Lrrc6 into the HC foci and that both proteins function cotranslationally. We propose that these DNAAF foci are anchored by stable interactions between translating HCs, ribosomes, and encoding mRNAs, followed by cotranslational molecular condensation of cochaperones and assembly factors, providing a potential mechanism that coordinates HC translation, folding, and assembly at scale.",

With a Young’s modulus of less than 1 kPa, the ultrasoft microrobot adapts its shape within narrow blood vessels, ensuring a uniform distribution of MSCs within the corpus cavernosum. Our findings showed that compared with traditional MSC injections, the MSC delivery microrobot (MSC-Rob) significantly enhanced MSC retention and survival. In both rat and beagle ED models, MSC-Rob treatment accelerated the repair of corpus cavernosum tissue and restored erectile function. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that MSC-Rob treatment facilitates nerve and blood vessel regeneration in the corpus cavernosum by increasing the presence of regenerative macrophages.

          "abstract": "Rhodopsin, the prototypical class-A G-protein coupled receptor, is a highly sensitive receptor for light that enables phototransduction in rod photoreceptors. Rhodopsin plays not only a sensory role but also a structural role as a major component of the rod outer segment disc, comprising over 90% of the protein content of the disc membrane. Mutations in RHO which lead to structural or functional abnormalities, including the autosomal recessive E150K mutation, result in rod dysfunction and death. Therefore, correction of deleterious rhodopsin mutations could rescue inherited retinal degeneration, as demonstrated for other visual genes such as RPE65 and PDE6B. In this study, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 adenine base editing strategy to correct the E150K mutation and demonstrate precise in vivo editing in a Rho -E150K mouse model of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and the G-protein activation assay, we characterized wild-type rhodopsin and rhodopsin variants containing bystander base edits. Subretinal injection of dual-adeno-associated viruses delivering our base editing strategy yielded up to 44% Rho correction in homozygous Rho -E150K mice. Injection at postnatal day 15, but not later time points, restored rhodopsin expression, partially rescued retinal function, and partially preserved retinal structure. These findings demonstrate that in vivo base editing can restore the function of mutated structural and functional proteins in animal models of disease, including rhodopsin-associated RP and suggest that the timing of gene-editing is a crucial determinant of successful treatment outcomes for degenerative genetic diseases.",

Traditional anthropological divisions of “foragers” and “farmers” have shaped our understanding of ancient cultivation practices but have several limitations, including how people stewarded and managed nondomesticated species. To investigate the long-term effects of plant management in the Pacific Northwest, this study focuses on beaked hazelnut ( Corylus cornuta ) which has a long, precolonial history of management, transportation, and cultivation in British Columbia (BC, Canada). In particular, isolated hazelnut populations in northwestern BC are thought to be the result of historical transplanting and management. We sampled individual hazelnuts (n = 219) representing three distinct regions in and assessed 9,650 genome-wide SNPs identified with nextRAD genotyping-by-sequencing libraries to test for population genetic structure. We used linear measurements of individuals to assess morphological phenotypes and to identify variation between individuals and lineages. These data reveal shared genetic clusters in distant and disjunct northwestern and interior regions consistent with the movement of humans across the landscape. We also find several small genetically distinct populations in the northwestern region. The Genetic structure of hazelnut in the previously labeled “disjunct” region in Gitxsan, Ts’msyen, and Nis g a’a homelands is consistent with the enduring influence of people on the distribution of purportedly “wild” plant species. Our results support the hypothesis that hazelnut was likely transplanted long distances and also managed in situ. This study highlights the often-overlooked agency of Indigenous Peoples in shaping species range distributions in North America.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells often display errors in chromosome segregation, some of which result from improper chromosome alignment at the spindle midplane. Chromosome alignment is facilitated by different rates of microtubule poleward flux between sister kinetochore fibers. However, the role of the poleward flux in supporting mitotic fidelity remains unknown. Here, we introduce the hypothesis that the finely tuned poleward flux safeguards against lagging chromosomes and micronuclei at mitotic exit by promoting chromosome alignment in metaphase. We used human untransformed RPE-1 cells depleted of KIF18A/kinesin-8 as a system with reduced mitotic fidelity, which we rescued by three mechanistically independent treatments, comprising low-dose taxol or codepletion of the spindle proteins HAUS8 or NuMA. The rescue of mitotic errors was due to shortening of the excessively long overlaps of antiparallel microtubules, serving as a platform for motor proteins that drive the flux, which in turn slowed down the overly fast flux and improved chromosome alignment. In contrast to the prevailing view, the rescue was not accompanied by reduction of overall microtubule growth rates. Instead, speckle microscopy revealed that the improved chromosome alignment in the rescue treatments was associated with slower growth and flux of kinetochore microtubules. In a similar manner, a low-dose taxol treatment rescued mitotic errors in a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma cell line OVKATE. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of targeting microtubule poleward flux to modify chromosome instability and provide insight into the mechanism through which low doses of taxol rescue certain mitotic errors in cancer cells.",

Even though interesting physico-chemical properties of microdroplets have been reported, “sessile” droplets’ inherent mobility, which has been implicated as a driving force for curious chemistry, has not been well established. This paper seeks to answer the question: Can adsorbed microdroplets be mobile at the nanoscale? This is a tantalizing question, as almost no measurement technique has the spatiotemporal resolution to answer it. Here, we demonstrate a highly sensitive technique to detect nanometric motions of insulating bodies adsorbed to electrified microinterfaces. We place an organic droplet atop a microelectrode and track its dissolution by driving a heterogeneous reaction in the aqueous continuous phase. As the droplet’s contact radius approaches the size of the microelectrode, the current versus time curve remarkably displays abrupt changes in current. We used finite element modeling to demonstrate these abrupt steps are due to nanometric movements of the three-phase boundary, where the nonaqueous droplet meets the aqueous phase and the electrode. Furthermore, the velocity with which the liquid interface moves can be estimated to tens-to-hundreds of nanometers per second. Our results indicate that processes that are driven by contact electrification and the frictional movement of bodies on a surface may be at play even when a droplet seems quiescent.",

Accordingly, it is urgent to develop reliable biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis treatment. Here, we identified REGγ as a potential biomarker of osteoporotic populations through proteomics analysis. Next, we demonstrated that REGγ deficiency increased osteoclast activity and triggered bone mass loss in REGγ knockout (KO) and bone marrow-derive macrophage (BMM)-conditional REGγ KO mice. However, the osteoclast activity decreased in BMM-conditional REGγ overexpression mice. Mechanistically, we defined that REGγ-20S proteasome directly degraded TRAF6 to inhibit bone absorption in a ubiquitin-independent pathway. More importantly, BMM-conditional Traf6 KO with REGγ KO mice could “rescue” the osteoporosis phenotypes. Based on NIP30 (a REGγ “inhibitor”) dephosphorylation by CKII inhibition activated the ubiquitin-independent degradation of TRAF6, we selected TTP22, an inhibitor of CKII, and defined that TTP22 could alleviate osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our study reveals a unique function of NIP30/REGγ/TRAF6 axis in osteoporosis and provides a potential therapeutic drug TTP22 for osteoporosis.",

The enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar ( S. ) Typhimurium triggers inflammation in the large intestine to ultimately reduce microbiota density and bloom, but it is unclear how the pathogen gains a foothold in the homeostatic gut when SCFA-producing commensals are abundant. Here, we show that S. Typhimurium invasion of the ileal mucosa triggers malabsorption of dietary amino acids to produce downstream changes in nutrient availability in the large intestine. In gnotobiotic mice engrafted with a community of 17 human Clostridia isolates, S. Typhimurium virulence factors triggered marked changes in the cecal metabolome, including an elevated abundance of amino acids. In an ex vivo fecal culture model, we found that two of these amino acids, lysine and ornithine, countered SCFA-mediated growth inhibition by restoring S. Typhimurium pH homeostasis through the inducible amino acid decarboxylases CadA and SpeF, respectively. In a mouse model of gastrointestinal infection, S. Typhimurium CadA activity depleted dietary lysine to promote cecal ecosystem invasion in the presence of an intact microbiota. From these findings, we conclude that virulence factor–induced malabsorption of dietary amino acids in the small intestine changes the nutritional environment of the large intestine to provide S. Typhimurium with resources needed to counter growth inhibition by microbiota-derived SCFAs.",

In the present study, by using a metabolomics approach, we identified the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) as a therapeutic target for HSD-mediated gut barrier dysfunction. Specifically, 16-week feeding on an HSD caused gut barrier dysfunction, such as colon inflammation and tight junction impairment in a murine model. A metabolomics analysis of mouse colon tissue showed a decrease in the 5(6)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid [5(6)-EET] level and an increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is related to HSD-mediated injuries to the gut barrier. The mice treated with a chemical inhibitor of sEH and the mice with genetic intervention by intestinal-specific knockout of the sEH gene significantly attenuated HSD-caused intestinal injuries by reducing HSD-mediated colon inflammation and improving the impaired tight junction caused by an HSD. Further, in vitro studies showed that treatment with 5(6)-EET, but not its hydrolytic product 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHET), significantly ablated high sucrose-caused intestinal epithelial inflammation and impaired tight junction. Additionally, 5(6)-EET is anti-inflammatory and improves gut epithelial tight junction while 5,6-DiHET cannot do so.

          "abstract": "Many enveloped viruses bud from the plasma membrane that is tightly associated with a dense and thick actin cortex. This actin network represents a significant challenge for membrane deformation and scission, and how it is remodeled during the late steps of the viral cycle is largely unknown. Using superresolution microscopy, we show that HIV-1 buds in areas of the plasma membrane with low cortical F-actin levels. We find that the cellular oxidoreductase MICAL1 locally depolymerizes actin at budding sites to promote HIV-1 budding and release. Upon MICAL1 depletion, F-actin abnormally remains at viral budding sites, incompletely budded viruses accumulate at the plasma membrane and viral release is impaired. Remarkably, normal viral release can be restored in MICAL1-depleted cells by inhibiting Arp2/3-dependent branched actin networks. Mechanistically, we find that MICAL1 directly disassembles branched-actin networks and controls the timely recruitment of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport scission machinery during viral budding. In addition, the MICAL1 activator Rab35 is recruited at budding sites, functions in the same pathway as MICAL1, and is also required for viral release. This work reveals a role for oxidoreduction in triggering local actin depolymerization to control HIV-1 budding, a mechanism that may be widely used by other viruses. The debranching activity of MICAL1 could be involved beyond viral budding in various other cellular functions requiring local plasma membrane deformation.",

          "abstract": "One driver of the high failure rates of clinical trials for therapeutic cancer vaccines is likely the inability to sufficiently engage conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), the antigen-presenting cell (APC) subset that is specialized in priming antitumor T cells. Here, we demonstrate that, relative to vaccination with an injectable mesoporous silica rod (MPS) vaccine alone (Vax), combining MPS vaccines with CD122-biased IL-2/anti-IL-2 antibody complexes (IL-2cx) drives ~3-fold expansion of cDCs at the vaccination sites, vaccine-draining lymph nodes, and spleens of treated mice. Furthermore, relative to Vax alone, Vax+IL-2cx led to a ~3-fold increase in the numbers of CD8 + T cells and ~15-fold increase in the numbers of NK cells at the vaccination site. Notably, with both the model protein antigen OVA as well as various peptide neoantigens, Vax+IL-2cx induced ~5 to 30-fold greater numbers of circulating antigen-specific CD8 + T cells relative to Vax alone. We further demonstrate that Vax+IL-2cx leads to significantly improved efficacy in the MC38 colon carcinoma model relative to either monotherapy alone, driving complete regressions in 50% of mice in a cDC-dependent manner. Relative to vaccine alone, Vax+IL-2cx led to comparable numbers of CD8 + T cells, but markedly greater numbers of NK cells and activated cDCs in the B16F10 melanoma tumor microenvironment post-therapy. Taken together, these findings suggest that the administration of factors that engage both the cDC-CD8 + T cell and cDC-NK cell axes can boost the potency of therapeutic cancer vaccines.",

          "abstract": "Sulfur is an essential element for life. Bacteria can obtain sulfur from inorganic sulfate; but in the sulfur starvation–induced response, Pseudomonads employ two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases (TC-FMOs) from the msu and sfn operons to assimilate sulfur from environmental compounds including alkanesulfonates and dialkylsulfones. Here, we report binding studies of oxidized FMN to enzymes involved within the P. fluorescens enzymatic pathway responsible for converting dimethylsulfone (DMSO 2 ) to sulfite. In this catabolic pathway, SfnG serves as the initial TC-FMO for sulfur assimilation, which is investigated in detail by solving the 2.6-Å resolution crystal structure of unliganded SfnG and the 1.75-Å resolution crystal structure of the SfnG ternary complex containing FMN and DMSO 2 . We find that SfnG adopts a (β/α) 8 barrel fold with a distinct quaternary configuration from other tetrameric class C TC-FMOs. To probe the unexpected tetramer arrangement, structural heterogeneity is assessed by chromatography and light scattering to confirm ligand binding correlates with a tetramer. Binding of FMN and DMSO 2 accompanies ordering of the active site, with DMSO 2 bound on the si -face of the flavin. A previously unobserved protein backbone conformation is found within the oxygen-binding site on the re -face of the flavin. Functional assays and the positioning of ligands with respect to the oxygen-binding site are consistent with use of an N5-(hydro)peroxyflavin pathway. Biochemical endpoint assays and docking studies reveal SfnG breaks the C–S bond of a range of dialkylsulfones.",

In samd7 −/− retinas, red cones are transformed into hybrid red/ultraviolet (UV) cones, green cones are absent, the number of blue cones is approximately doubled, and the number of rods is greatly reduced. We also find that mouse Samd7 represses S-opsin expression in dorsal M-cones—analogous to its role in repressing UV cone genes in zebrafish red cones.

          "abstract": "As a unique type of glycosylation, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) on Ser/Thr residues of proteins was discovered 40 y ago. O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by two enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which add and remove O-GlcNAc, respectively. O-GlcNAcylation is an essential glycosylation that regulates the functions of many proteins in virtually all cellular processes. However, deep and site-specific characterization of O-GlcNAcylated proteins remains a challenge. We developed an ultradeep O-GlcNAc proteomics workflow by integrating digestion with multiple proteases, two mass spectrometric approaches (i.e., electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation [EThcD] and HCD product-dependent electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation [HCD-pd-EThcD]), and two data analysis tools (i.e., MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer). The performance of this strategy was benchmarked by the analysis of whole lysates from PANC-1 (a pancreatic cancer cell line). In total, 2,831 O-GlcNAc sites were unambiguously identified, representing the largest O-GlcNAc dataset of an individual study reported so far. Unexpectedly, in addition to confirming known sites and identifying many other sites of Ser/Thr modification, O-GlcNAcylation was found on 121 tyrosine (Tyr) residues of 93 proteins. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that OGT catalyzes the transfer of O-GlcNAc onto Tyr residues of peptides and OGA catalyzes its removal. Taken together, our work reveals widespread O-GlcNAcylation on Tyr residues of proteins and that Tyr O-GlcNAcylation is mediated by OGT and OGA. As another form of glycosylation, Tyr O-GlcNAcylation is likely to have important regulatory roles.",

          "abstract": "The gut microbiota has a significant impact on the development and function of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) by modifying bile acid (BA) metabolites. Recently, specific gut microbiome-derived BAs, such as 7-oxo-deoxycholic acid (7-oxo-DCA) and isodeoxycholic acid (isoDCA), have been identified to be shifted inversely in colitis and hepatic liver diseases. Although the responsible gut microbes have been identified, metabolites’ effects on IECs remain largely unclear. We found that although high-fat diet treatment in mice elevated both 7-oxo-DCA and isoDCA levels, during intestinal tumorigenesis, 7-oxo-DCA levels rise while isoDCA levels decrease. Interestingly, 7-oxo-DCA promotes cancer cell growth, while isoDCA suppresses it. Moreover, 7-oxo-DCA promotes whereas isoDCA inhibits the proliferation of intestinal stem cells in organoids derived from WT and APC Min/+ mice, as well as in patient-derived colon cancer organoids. The APC Min/+ mice administered with 7-oxo-DCA heightened gut permeability and increased tumor burden, whereas isoDCA protected gut barrier and reduced tumor loads. Both BAs reshape the BA pool and shifted gut microbiome. Mechanistically, we identified 7-oxo-DCA as a natural antagonist of Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) to downregulate FXR signaling, as opposed to isoDCA, which is a potent FXR agonist to upregulate FXR signaling. In conclusion, we unveiled the opposing roles of 7-oxo-DCA and isoDCA to promote or inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis, respectively. Manipulating the BA–FXR axis during tumor initiation and progression holds great promise for developing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

          "abstract": "Electrical motor cortex stimulation can produce corticospinal system plasticity and enhance motor function after injury. We investigate molecular mechanisms of structural and physiological plasticity following electrical neuromodulation, focusing on identifying molecular predictors, or biomarkers, for durable plasticity. We used two neuromodulation protocols, repetitive multipulse stimulation (rMPS) and patterned intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), incorporating different stimulation durations and follow-up periods. We compared neuromodulation efficacy in promoting corticospinal tract (CST) sprouting, motor cortex muscle evoked potential (MEP) LTP-like plasticity, and their associated molecular underpinnings. Only iTBS produced CST sprouting after short-term neuromodulation (1 d of stimulation; 9-d survival for sprouting expression); both iTBS and rMPS produced sprouting with long-term (10-d) neuromodulation. Significant mTOR signaling activation and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein deactivation predicted axon growth across all neuromodulation conditions that produced significant sprouting. Both neuromodulation protocols, regardless of duration, were effective in producing MEP enhancement. However, persistent LTP-like enhancement of MEPs at 30 d was only produced by long-term iTBS. Statistical modeling suggests that Stat3 signaling is the key mediator of MEP enhancement. Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) alone did not affect baseline molecular signaling. Whereas iTBS and rMPS after SCI produced strong mTOR activation and PTEN deactivation, only iTBS produced Stat3 activation. Our findings support differential molecular biomarkers for neuromodulation-dependent structural and physiological plasticity and show that motor cortex epidural neuromodulation produces molecular changes in neurons that support axonal growth after SCI. iTBS may be more suitable for repair after SCI because it promotes molecular signaling for both CST growth and MEP plasticity.",

          "abstract": "While increased mutation rates typically have negative consequences in multicellular organisms, hypermutation can be advantageous for microbes adapting to the environment. Previously, we identified two hypermutator Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates that rapidly develop drug resistance due to transposition of a retrotransposon, Cnl1. Cnl1-mediated hypermutation is caused by a nonsense mutation in a gene encoding an RNA interference (RNAi) component, ZNF3 , combined with a tremendous transposon burden. To elucidate adaptive mechanisms following RNAi loss, two bioinformatic pipelines were developed to identify RNAi loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in a collection of 387 sequenced C. neoformans isolates. Remarkably, several RNAi-loss isolates were identified that are not hypermutators and have not accumulated transposons. To test whether these RNAi LOF mutations can cause hypermutation, the mutations were introduced into a nonhypermutator strain with a high transposon burden, which resulted in a hypermutator phenotype. To further investigate whether RNAi-loss isolates can become hypermutators, in vitro passaging was performed. Although no hypermutators were found in two C. neoformans RNAi-loss strains after short-term passage, hypermutation was observed in a passaged Cryptococcus deneoformans strain with an increased transposon burden. Consistent with a two-step evolution, when an RNAi-loss isolate was crossed with an isolate containing a high Cnl1 burden, F1 hypermutator progeny inheriting a high transposon burden were identified. In addition to Cnl1 transpositions, insertions of a gigantic DNA transposon KDZ1 (~11 kb) contributed to hypermutation in the progeny. Our results suggest that RNAi loss is relatively common (7/387, ~1.8%) and enables distinct evolutionary trajectories: hypermutation following transposon accumulation or survival without hypermutation.",

          "abstract": "Fracture networks are preferential flow paths playing a critical role in a wide range of environmental and industrial problems. Their complex multiscale structure leads to broad distributions of fluid travel times, affecting many biogeochemical processes. Yet, the relationship between the fracture network structures, their hydrodynamic properties, and the resulting anomalous transport dynamics remains unclear. We use a large database of fracture network models to investigate the factors controlling fluid velocity and travel-time distributions across a wide range of networks, from synthetic to field-calibrated models, with aperture variability at both fracture and network scales. Analysis reveals that transport statistics have generic properties across investigated networks, including notably heavy-tailed travel time distributions. Networks of increasing complexity and heterogeneity lead to broader velocity distributions and more channeled velocity fields, where flow concentrates in a narrow channel web in the three-dimensional (3D) fracture structure. While heterogeneity in point-velocity statistics increases travel-time variability, channeling tends to reduce it. This counterintuitive phenomenon challenges current theories, which assume that long travel time power law exponents are determined solely by point-velocity statistics. By analyzing velocity and travel time statistics for different flow structures, we develop a coupled Continuous Time Random Walk framework capturing the unexpected control of the velocity field’s spatial structure on anomalous transport in fracture networks. This leads to a unique class of random walk models capturing the respective roles of velocity heterogeneity and spatial structure on transport in networks. These findings open a prospective for characterizing, modeling, and predicting transport dynamics in complex networks, with potential applications to geological, biological, and engineered networks.",

However, the mechanisms by which the totipotent state is established and properly interpreted by pioneer factors to allow orderly ZGA remain unknown. Here, we identify the H3.3-specific chaperone HIRA as a factor involving establishing totipotent-state chromatin in Drosophila early embryos. Through cophase separation with HIRA, the pioneer factor GAGA factor (GAF) efficiently binds to H3.3-marked nucleosomes to activate major-wave zygotic genes. Importantly, dPCIF1, a chromatin-associated protein, antagonized the GAF–HIRA interaction by competitively binding to HIRA, thereby restricting GAF on earlier chromatin and avoiding premature ZGA. Hence, the coordinated action of HIRA and dPCIF1 ensures sequential ZGA from the minor to major wave in early embryos. This study provides insights into understanding how a totipotent state is established and properly controlled during ZGA.",

The combined results from multiple characterizations reveal that the structure-property-activity relationship of SSCA in carbon oxidation reaction (COR).

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are treated primarily by chemotherapy and lack clinically validated therapeutic targets. In particular, inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, abnormally activated in many breast cancers, failed to achieve clinical efficacy in TNBC due to the development of adaptive drug resistance, which is largely driven by the transcriptomic plasticity of TNBC. Expression of CDK8/19 Mediator kinases that control transcriptional reprogramming correlates with relapse-free survival and treatment failure in breast cancer patients, including TNBC. We now investigated how CDK8/19 inhibitors affect the growth of TNBC tumors and their response to mTOR and AKT inhibitors. In contrast to the effects of most anticancer drugs, all the tested human TNBC models (including patient-derived xenografts) responded to CDK8/19 inhibitors in vivo even when they did not respond in vitro. Furthermore, CDK8/19 inhibition extended the host survival of established lung metastases in a murine TNBC model, where the primary tumors were not significantly affected. CDK8/19 inhibitors synergized with an mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus and a pan-AKT inhibitor capivasertib in vitro and strongly potentiated these drugs in long-term in vivo studies. Transcriptomic analysis of tumors that responded or became adapted to everolimus revealed that drug adaptation in vivo was associated with major transcriptional changes in both tumor and stromal cells. Combining everolimus with a CDK8/19 inhibitor counteracted many of these changes and induced combination-specific effects on the expression of multiple genes that affect tumor growth. These results warrant the exploration of CDK8/19 Mediator kinase inhibitors as a new type of drugs for TNBC therapy.",

          "abstract": "The distinctive characteristics of water, evident in its thermodynamic anomalies, have implications across disciplines from biology to geophysics. Considered a valid hypothesis to rationalize its unique properties, a liquid–liquid phase transition in water below the freezing point, in the so-called supercooled regime, has nowadays been observed in several molecular dynamics simulations and is being actively researched experimentally. The hypothesis of ferroelectric phase transition in supercooled water can be traced back to 1977, due to Stillinger. In this work, we highlight intriguing and far-reaching implications of water: The ferroelectric and liquid–liquid phase transitions can be designed as two facets of the same underlying phenomenon. Our results are based on the analysis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations and are explained in the context of a classical density functional theory in mean-field approximation valid for a polar liquid, where dipolar interaction is treated perturbatively. The theory underpins the potential role of ferroelectricity in promoting the liquid–liquid phase transition, being the density-polarization coupling inherent in the dipolar interaction potential. The existence of ferroelectric order in supercooled low-density liquid water is confirmed by the observation in molecular dynamics simulations of collective modes in space-time polarization correlation functions, traceable to spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry. Our work sheds light on water’s supercooled behavior and opens the door to experimental investigations of the static and dynamic behavior of water’s polarization.",

However, the regulatory molecular mechanisms underlying RNA virus-activated type I IFN signaling pathway remain incompletely understood. Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) serves as a negative regulator of the type I IFN signaling pathway by interacting with MAVS and catalyzing monomethylation of arginine 232 (R232me1) in MAVS. RNA virus infection leads to the downregulation and dissociation of PRMT7 from MAVS as well as the decrease of R232me1 methylation, enhancing MAVS/RIG-I interaction, MAVS aggregation, type I IFN signaling activation, and antiviral immune responses. Knock-in mice with MAVS R232 substituted with lysine ( Mavs R232K -KI) are more resistant to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus infection due to enhanced antiviral immune responses. PiPRMT7-MAVS, a short peptide inhibitor designed to interrupt the interaction between PRMT7 and MAVS, inhibits R232me1 methylation, thereby enhancing MAVS/RIG-I interaction, promoting MAVS aggregation, activating type I IFN signaling, and bolstering antiviral immune responses to suppress RNA virus replication. Moreover, the clinical relevance of PRMT7 is highlighted that it is significantly downregulated in RNA virus-infected clinical samples, such as blood samples from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ebola virus, as well as H1N1-infected bronchial epithelial cells. Our findings uncovered that PRMT7-mediated arginine methylation plays critical roles in regulating MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immune responses, and targeting arginine methylation might represent a therapeutic avenue for treating RNA viral infection.",

In fact, existing probabilistic models in phylogeography or spatial population genetics generally do not provide an adequate framework to define velocity in a relevant manner. For instance, the very concept of instantaneous speed simply does not exist under one of the most popular approaches that models the evolution of spatial coordinates as Brownian trajectories running along a phylogeny. Here, we introduce a family of models—the so-called Phylogenetic Integrated Velocity (PIV) models—that use Gaussian processes to explicitly model the velocity of evolving lineages instead of focusing on the fluctuation of spatial coordinates over time. We describe the properties of these models and show an increased accuracy of velocity estimates compared to previous approaches. Analyses of West Nile virus data in the United States indicate that PIV models provide sensible predictions of the dispersal of evolving pathogens at a one-year time horizon.

Monomethylmercury and dimethylmercury are neurotoxins and a significant environmental concern as they bioaccumulate and biomagnify within the aquatic food web. Microbial Hg methylation involves two proteins, HgcA and HgcB. Here, we show that HgcA and HgcB can be heterologously coexpressed, and the HgcAB complex can be purified. We demonstrated that HgcA is a membrane-associated cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase and HgcB is a ferredoxin-like protein containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters. Further, spectroscopic and kinetic results demonstrate that S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) donates the methyl group to Hg in a two-step reaction involving a methylcob(III)alamin intermediate including Co-thiolate ligation from a conserved Cys residue. Our findings uncover a biological role for SAM in microbial Hg methylation.",

Yet, no study to date has directly measured the energy expenditure associated with this process. We examined the metabolic cost of color change in octopuses by measuring oxygen consumption in samples of excised octopus skin during periods of chromatophore expansion and contraction and then modeled metabolic demand over the whole octopus as a function of octopus mass. The metabolic demand of the fully activated chromatophore system is nearly as great as an octopus’s resting metabolic rate. This high metabolic cost carries ecological and evolutionary implications, including selective pressures in octopuses that may influence the adoption of nocturnal lifestyles, the use of dens, the reduction of the chromatophore system in deep-sea species, and metabolic trade-offs associated with foraging.",

Here, we study how cave life in the Mexican tetra ( Astyanax mexicanus ) has affected an identified giant multisensory neuron, the Mauthner neuron (MN). Because this neuron is crucial in driving rapid escapes, the absence of predation risk in the cave forms predicts a massive reduction in this neuron. Moreover, the absence of functional eyes in the A. mexicanus Pachón form predicts an even stronger reduction in the cell’s large ventral dendrite that receives visual inputs in sighted fish species. We succeeded in recording in vivo from this neuron in the blind cavefish and two surface tetra ( A. mexicanus and Astyanax aeneus ), which offers unique chances to simultaneously study evolutionary changes in morphology and function in this giant neuron. In contrast to the predictions, we find that cave life, while sufficient to remove vision, has neither affected the cell's morphology nor its functional properties. This specifically includes the cell's ventral dendrite. Furthermore, cave life did not increase the variance in morphological or functional features. Rather, variability in surface and cave forms was the same, which suggests a complex stabilizing selection in this neuron and a continued role of its ventral dendrite. We found that adult cavefish are potent predators that readily attack smaller fish. So, one of the largely unknown stabilizing factors could be using the MN in such attacks and, in the young fish, escaping them.",

In addition, data from several small-scale societies show that humans evolved exceptionally high resting, activity, and total metabolic rates apparently by overcoming tradeoffs between resting and active energy expenditures that constrain other primates.

Abnormal regulation of this pathway has been linked to various human diseases. While previous studies have focused on how Ci is regulated in the cytoplasm, the control of nuclear Ci remains poorly understood. In this study, we have found that the transcriptional cofactor Taiman (Tai) functions as an inhibitor of the Hh pathway. Tai interferes with the response of Hh signal, rather than Hh secretion. Our epistatic analyses reveal that Tai works in parallel with Ci to reduce its activity, thereby counteracting organ overgrowth and the activation of target genes caused by Ci overexpression. Specifically, Tai interacts with Ci to decrease its binding to target gene promoters. The Hh signal weakens the interaction between Ci and Tai, releasing the inhibition on Ci. Importantly, this regulatory mechanism is conserved from Drosophila to mammalian cells. Moreover, NCOA1-3 are the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila protein Tai, but only NCOA2 plays a similar role in inhibiting the Hh pathway.

          "abstract": "Reactive inhibitory control is crucial for survival. Traditionally, this control in mammals was attributed solely to the hyperdirect pathway, with cortical control signals flowing unidirectionally from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to basal ganglia output regions. Yet recent findings have put this model into question, suggesting that the STN is assisted in stopping actions through ascending control signals to the striatum mediated by the external globus pallidus (GPe). Here, we investigate this suggestion by harnessing a biologically constrained spiking model of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuit that includes pallidostriatal pathways originating from arkypallidal neurons. Through a series of experiments probing the interaction between three critical inhibitory nodes (the STN, arkypallidal cells, and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons), we find that the GPe acts as a critical mediator of both ascending and descending inhibitory signals in the CBGT circuit. In particular, pallidostriatal pathways regulate this process by weakening the direct pathway dominance of the evidence accumulation process driving decisions, which increases the relative suppressive influence of the indirect pathway on basal ganglia output. These findings delineate how pallidostriatal pathways can facilitate action cancellation by managing the bidirectional flow of information within CBGT circuits.",

Oxygen level is a critical microenvironmental parameter to maintain cellular or tissue functions and modulate their behaviors. Current organ-on-a-chip setups are oftentimes subjected to the ambient incubator oxygen level at 21%, which is higher than most if not all physiological oxygen concentrations. Additionally, the physiological oxygen level in each tissue is different ranging from 0.5 to 13%. Here, a closed-loop modular multiorgan-on-chips platform is developed to enable not only real-time monitoring of the oxygen levels but, more importantly, tight control of them in the range of 4 to 20% across each connected microtissue-on-a-chip in the circulatory culture medium. This platform, which consists of microfluidic oxygen scavenger(s), an oxygen generator, a monitoring/controller system, and bioreactor(s), allows for independent, precise upregulation and downregulation of dissolved oxygen in the perfused culture medium to meet the physiological oxygen level in each modular microtissue compartment, as needed. Furthermore, drug studies using the platform demonstrate that the oxygen level affects drug metabolism in the parallelly connected liver, kidney, and arterial vessel microtissues without organ–organ interactions factored in. Overall, this platform can promote the performances of organ-on-a-chip devices in drug screening by providing more physiologically relevant and independently adjustable oxygen microenvironments for desired organ types on a single- or a multiorgan-on-chip(s) configuration.",

Synthetic chemotaxis provides key physical descriptions of simplified systems that can be used in biological models, or in the creation of advanced responsive material systems. In this article, we provide a quantitative framework for understanding synthetic chemotaxis of microparticles which involves a competition between phoresis and osmosis. We present separate quantitative measurements of phoresis and osmosis acting on individual taxing particles, finding that phoresis follows the long-predicted v ∼ 1 / r 2 scaling while the osmotic contribution depends on the geometry and details of the system, and must be solved on a case-by-case basis. Through this, we are able to develop a more accurate picture of particle transport at the single particle level. Equipped with this approach, we go on to describe how high concentrations of particles in a symmetric chemical gradient grow close-packed hives that reach a steady-state size tunable through light intensity or particle size. Last, we demonstrate that mixed particles experiencing the same chemical gradient will selectively migrate toward or away depending on the nature of the particle surface, thereby locally sorting out a particular species. We anticipate these results will be important in describing both biological and synthetic chemotaxis in phoretic systems and should bring a wealth of studies that take advantage of competing osmotic flows to illicit unexpected dynamic active behavior.",

Particularly, a specific subset of CD4 + T cells coexpressing the T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 markers has demonstrated remarkable antitumor potential. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the differentiation of these cells and their subsequent antitumor responses remain incompletely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reanalysis demonstrated the presence of Th 17 1 cells within tumors. Subsequent trajectory analysis found that these Th 17 1 cells are initially primed under Th17 conditions and then converted into IFN-γ-producing cells. Following the in vivo differentiation trajectory of Th 17 1 cells, we successfully established in vitro Th 17 1 cell culture. Transcriptomic profiling has unveiled a substantial resemblance between in vitro-generated Th 17 1 cells and their tumor-infiltrating counterparts. Th 17 1 cells exhibit more potent antitumor responses than Th1 or Th17 cells. Additionally, Th 17 1chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells eradicate solid tumors more efficiently. Importantly, Th 17 1 cells display an early exhaustion phenotype while retaining stemness. Mechanistically, Th 17 1 cells migrate faster and accumulate more in tumors in an extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1)-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that IFN-γ up-regulated IRF7 to promote the type I interferon response network and ECM1 expression but decreased the exhaustion status in Th 17 1 cells. Taken together, our findings position Th 17 1 cells as a great candidate for improving targeted immunotherapies in solid malignancies.",

However, making direct comparisons between different imaging modalities, particularly spanning living and fixed tissue, has remained challenging. For example, comparing brain-wide neural dynamics across experiments and aligning such data to anatomical resources, such as gene expression patterns or connectomes, requires precise alignment to a common set of anatomical coordinates. However, reaching this goal is difficult because registering in vivo functional imaging data to ex vivo reference atlases requires accommodating differences in imaging modality, microscope specification, and sample preparation. We overcome these challenges in Drosophila by building an in vivo reference atlas from multiphoton-imaged brains, called the Functional Drosophila Atlas. We then develop a registration pipeline, BrIdge For Registering Over Statistical Templates (BIFROST), for transforming neural imaging data into this common space and for importing ex vivo resources such as connectomes. Using genetically labeled cell types as ground truth, we demonstrate registration with a precision of less than 10 microns.

In this study, we explored the role of XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) long noncoding RNA in ovarian cancer stemness and plasticity through in silico and in vitro analyses. We found that XIST is significantly down-regulated in ovarian tumors, with low XIST expression linked to a higher stemness index and lower overall survival. Knocking down XIST in ovarian cancer cells enhanced stemness, particularly increasing mesenchymal-like CSCs, and under hypoxic conditions, it promoted epithelial-like CSC markers.

By exposing cells to various physiologically relevant light conditions and applying temporal illumination sequences, we find that the light-induced network morphodynamics follows dynamic rules similar to temporal low-pass filtering. We develop a mathematical formalism to model the light-regulated behavior, exposing the relevant timescales of the morphodynamic response. Moreover, confocal microscopy reveals that the unusual reticulated morphology exhibits properties similar to auxetic metamaterials, facilitating the rapid and drastic deformation necessary for the light-avoidance motion, confined by the cell wall. This mechanism reduces the effective chloroplast area under high light conditions, minimizing light absorption and preventing photodamage. Our findings demonstrate that the intricate connection between the chloroplasts topologically complex structure and active dynamics enables the dinoflagellate’s dynamic adaptation to changing light environments, thereby supporting essential life-sustaining processes.",

We trained a multitask long short-term memory model for total P (TP) using data from 430 rivers across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Trend analysis of reconstructed daily records (1980–2019) shows widespread decline in concentrations, with declining, increasing, and insignificantly changing trends in 60%, 28%, and 12% of the rivers, respectively. Concentrations in urban rivers have declined the most despite rising urban population in the past decades; concentrations in agricultural rivers however have mostly increased, suggesting not-as-effective controls of nonpoint sources in agriculture lands compared to point sources in cities. TP loss, calculated as fluxes by multiplying concentration and discharge, however exhibited an overall increasing rate of 6.5% per decade at the CONUS scale over the past 40 y, largely due to increasing river discharge.

In the north temperate zone, increased nest failure along edges of forest fragments is hypothesized to play a major role in the disappearance of bird species from disturbed landscapes. However, we lack comprehensive syntheses from tropical latitudes, where biodiversity is highest and increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and disturbance. We assembled data from five decades of field studies across the global tropics (1,112 populations of 661 species) and used phylogenetic models to evaluate proposed predictors of nest success. We found significant effects of several traits, including adult body mass and nest architecture. Contrary to results from many temperate locations, anthropogenic habitat disruption did not consistently reduce nest success; in fact, raw nest success rates were lower in large tracts of primary forest than in disturbed or fragmented landscapes. Follow-up analyses within species, using a subset of 76 species for which we had estimates of nest survival in habitats with different levels of disruption, confirmed that neither disturbance nor fragmentation significantly influenced nest success. These results suggest that nest predation alone cannot explain observed declines in avian biodiversity in tropical forest fragments, raising new questions about the demographic processes that drive extinction in the tropics.",

NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome assembly is initiated by the binding of a single NAIP to its cognate ligand, but a subset of bacterial flagellins or T3SS structural proteins are thought to evade NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome sensing by not binding to their cognate NAIPs. Unlike other inflammasome components such as NLRP3, AIM2, or some NAIPs, NLRC4 is constitutively present in resting macrophages and not known to be induced by inflammatory signals. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling up-regulates NLRC4 transcription and protein expression in murine macrophages, which licenses NAIP detection of evasive ligands. In contrast, TLR priming in human macrophages did not up-regulate NLRC4 expression, and human macrophages remained unable to detect NAIP-evasive ligands even following priming. Critically, ectopic expression of either murine or human NLRC4 was sufficient to induce pyroptosis in response to immunoevasive NAIP ligands, indicating that increased levels of NLRC4 enable the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to detect these normally evasive ligands. Altogether, our data reveal that TLR priming tunes the threshold for the murine NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome to enable inflammasome responses against immunoevasive or suboptimal NAIP ligands. These findings provide insight into species-specific TLR regulation of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation.",

          "abstract": "The last two decades have seen great advances in the study of social learning (learning from others), in part due to efforts to identify it in the wild as the basis of behavioral traditions. Theoretical frameworks suggest that both the dynamics of social tolerance and transmission biases (or social learning strategies) influence the pathways of information diffusion in social groups. Bearded capuchins ( Sapajus libidinosus ) inhabiting the semiarid seasonal caatinga biome of the Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP) form highly tolerant societies that possess the largest “tool-kit” described for monkeys, a feat likely facilitated by social learning. Here, we used social network analysis and an open diffusion experiment using an extractive foraging task to identify the occurrence of social learning and describe the pathways of social transmission of information in two wild primate populations. The dynamics of social tolerance outside of task introductions predicted opportunities for social learning, but it was tolerance during task introductions that predicted the actual pathways of social information diffusion. Our results also indicated that the capuchins mainly learned from others via direct observation and naïve individuals exhibited an observation bias toward successful males. This study supports the claims of cultural transmission in robust capuchins and empirically supports the role of social tolerance and social learning strategies in human and nonhuman primate cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Variability within species is key for adaptability and biological evolution. To understand individualities in the context of animal movement, we focused on one of the most remarkable migrations—the journey of the endangered European eel from their birthplace in the Sargasso Sea to freshwater environments. Laboratory observations unveiled a continuum of diverse phenotypes of migrating eels: Some displayed a heightened tendency to swim against a constant water flow, while others a greater propensity to climb obstacles. Looking for the biological underpinnings of this migratory diversity, we characterized the eels’ individual differences in traits of four key domains: life history, physiology, behavior, and cognition, among which we found significant variance and interconnectedness. Upon reducing this variance to its primary multivariate axes, we found that these predict the migratory types. Eels with 1) low exploration, high activity, low boldness, and high lateralization; 2) strong lateralization, enhanced quantitative abilities, short problem-solving time, high boldness, and low growth rates; or 3) enhanced problem-solving, reduced spatial learning, high cognitive flexibility, and shorter time to solve the cognitive tasks were more likely to display the climbing migratory type. Field sampling revealed how specific traits’ combinations seemed to influence the distribution of eels once they begin to settle in the freshwater environment. Our study underscores the impressive diversity of individuals during this critical migration, emphasizing an intrinsic connection to multidomain trait variance. Preserving this diversity becomes paramount, as it likely contributes to the resilience and adaptability of endangered migratory species.",

          "abstract": "Animal behavior is organized into nested temporal patterns that span multiple timescales. This behavior hierarchy is believed to arise from a hierarchical neural architecture: Neurons near the top of the hierarchy are involved in planning, selecting, initiating, and maintaining motor programs, whereas those near the bottom of the hierarchy act in concert to produce fine spatiotemporal motor activity. In Caenorhabditis elegans , behavior on a long timescale emerges from ordered and flexible transitions between different behavioral states, such as forward, reversal, and turn. On a short timescale, different parts of the animal body coordinate fast rhythmic bending sequences to produce directional movements. Here, we show that Sublateral Anterior A (SAA), a class of interneurons that enable cross-communication between dorsal and ventral head motor neurons, play a dual role in shaping behavioral dynamics on different timescales. On a short timescale, SAA regulate and stabilize rhythmic bending activity during forward movements. On a long timescale, the same neurons suppress spontaneous reversals and facilitate reversal termination by inhibiting Ring Interneuron M (RIM), an integrating neuron that helps maintain a behavioral state. These results suggest that feedback from a lower-level cell assembly to a higher-level command center is essential for bridging behavioral dynamics at different levels.",

In this paper, we explored the idea to design protein degraders based on the section of ligands that cause protein destabilization, hence that facilitate the cellular breakdown of the target. Our studies present covalent agents targeting Pin1, a cis–trans prolyl isomerase that plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Our design strategy entailed iterative optimizations of agents for potency and Pin1 destabilization in vitro. Biophysical and cellular studies suggest that the agents may act like molecular crowbars , displacing protein-stabilizing interactions that open the structure for recognition by the proteasome degradation machinery. This approach resulted in a series of potent and effective Pin1 degraders with potential applications in target validation and in therapeutic development. We propose that our design strategy can identify molecular degraders without engineering bifunctional agents that artificially create interactions between a disease-causing protein and a ubiquitin ligase.",

More recently, scRNAseq has been used to map DA neuron diversity at the level of gene expression. These studies have revealed a higher than expected molecular diversity in both mouse and human DA neurons. However, whether different molecular expression profiles correlate with specific functions of different DA neurons or with their classical division into mesolimbic (A10) and nigrostriatal (A9) neurons, remains to be determined. To address this, we have developed an approach termed TARGET-seq (Tagging projections by AAV-mediated RetroGrade Enrichment of Transcriptomes) that links the transcriptional profile of the DA neurons with their innervation of specific target structures in the forebrain. Leveraging this technology, we identify molecularly distinct subclusters of human DA neurons with a clear link between transcriptome and axonal target-specificity, offering the possibility to infer neuroanatomical-based classification to molecular identity and target-specific connectivity. We subsequently used this dataset to identify candidate transcription factors along DA developmental trajectories that may control subtype identity, thus providing broad avenues that can be further explored in the design of next-generation A9 and A10 enriched DA-neurons for drug screening or A9 enriched DA cells for clinical stem cell-based therapies.",

Using time-course analyses, bone marrow chimeras, and fate tracing models, we found that the complete elimination of embryo-derived LCs at steady state results in their repopulation from circulating monocytes. However, monocyte-derived LCs inefficiently replenished the epidermal niche. Instead, these cells preferentially migrated to skin-draining lymph nodes. Mechanistically, we show that the enhanced migratory capability of monocyte-derived LCs is associated with higher expression of CD207/Langerin, a C-type lectin involved in the capture of skin microbes.

          "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are one of the most common causes of acute viral hepatitis, annually causing over 3 million symptomatic cases and 70,000 deaths worldwide. Historically, HEV was described as a hepatotropic virus, but has recently been associated with various extrahepatic manifestations including neurological disorders such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and neuralgic amyotrophy. However, the underlying pathogenesis of these neurological diseases remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate extrahepatic HEV manifestations in a neuronal model system using human-induced primary neurons (iPNs). Renal epithelial cells from human urine were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells to generate neuronal progenitor cells, which were subsequently differentiated into iPNs over 21 d. These iPNs supported HEV infection preferentially in neurite-bearing cells. Transcriptional profiling of the neuronal development process as well as viral infection dynamics in iPNs uncovered a lack of antiviral innate immune responses to HEV infection with only an intrinsic expression of distinct interferon-regulated genes and signaling molecules. Viral open reading frame 2 encoded capsid protein could be visualized by volumetric three-dimensional reconstitution within the neurites, which were reduced in length in an HEV inoculation-dependent manner. In conclusion, this neuron-derived human model system provides a powerful tool for studying extrahepatic manifestations of HEV infection. It further indicates a potential mechanism of pathogenesis driven by the interaction between host and viral factors.",

Loss or inhibition of PARG results in replication stress and sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents. PARG inhibitors are now undergoing clinical development for patients having tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as cancer patients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 -mutations. PARP inhibitors kill BRCA-deficient cancer cells by increasing single-stranded DNA gaps (ssGAPs) during replication. Here, we report that, like PARP inhibitor (PARPi), PARG inhibitor (PARGi) treatment also causes an accumulation of ssGAPs in sensitive cells. PARGi exposure increased accumulation of S-phase-specific PAR, a marker for Okazaki fragment processing (OFP) defects on lagging strands and induced ssGAPs, in sensitive cells but not in resistant cells. PARGi also caused accumulation of PAR at the replication forks and at the ssDNA sites in sensitive cells. Additionally, PARGi exhibited monotherapy activity in specific HR-deficient, as well as HR-proficient, patient-derived, or patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived organoids of ovarian cancer, and drug sensitivity directly correlated with the accumulation of ssGAPs. Taken together, PARGi treatment results in toxic accumulation of PAR at replication forks resulting in ssGAPs due to OFP defects during replication. Regardless of the BRCA/ HRD - status, the induction of ssGAPs in preclinical models of ovarian cancer cells correlates with PARGi sensitivity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) may be a useful model system for testing PARGi sensitivity and functional biomarkers.",

Short- and long-term cold exposure is registered via parallel transcriptional shutdown and Polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana major flowering repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ). The cold-induced antisense transcripts ( COOLAIR ) determine the dynamics of FLC transcriptional shutdown, but the thermosensory mechanisms are still unresolved. Here, through a forward genetic screen, we identify a mutation that perturbs cold-induced COOLAIR expression and FLC repression. The mutation is a hypomorphic allele of SUPPRESSORS OF MEC-8 AND UNC-52 1 (SMU1), a conserved subunit of the spliceosomal B complex. SMU1 interacts in vivo with the proximal region of nascent COOLAIR and RNA 3′ processing/cotranscriptional regulators and enhances COOLAIR proximal intron splicing to promote specific COOLAIR isoforms. SMU1 also interacts with ELF7, an RNA Polymerase II Associated Factor (Paf1) component and limits COOLAIR transcription. Cold thus changes cotranscriptional splicing/RNA Pol II functionality in an SMU1-dependent mechanism to promote two different isoforms of COOLAIR that lead to reduced FLC transcription. Such cotranscriptional mechanisms are emerging as important regulators underlying plasticity in gene expression.",

Consequently, the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) is extremely uniform in modern horse breeds. The majority of stallions worldwide carry MSY haplotypes (HT) attributed to an only ~1,500-y-old, so-called, “Crown” haplogroup. The predominance of the Crown in modern horse breeds is thought to represent a footprint of the vast impact of stallions of “Oriental origin” in the past millennium. Here, we report the results of a fine-scaled MSY haplotyping of large datasets of patrilines comprising 1,517 males of 189 modern horse breeds, covering a broad phenotypic and geographic spectrum. We can disentangle the multilayered influence of Oriental stallions over the last few hundred years, exposing the intense linebreeding and the wide-ranging impact of Arabian, English Thoroughbred, and Coldblood sires. Iberian and New World horse breeds contain a wide range of diversified Crown lineages. Their broad HT spectrum illustrates the spread of horses of Oriental origin via the Iberian Peninsula after the Middle Ages, which is commonly referred to as the “Spanish influence.” Our survey also revealed a second major historical dissemination of horses from Western Asia, attributed to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Our analysis shows that MSY analysis can uncover the complex history of horse breeds and can be used to establish the paternal ancestry of modern horse breeds.",

          "abstract": "Primates are known for their exceptional ability to recognize faces. However, we still have much to learn about how their brains process faces when they are partially hidden. When we cover parts of a face, it affects how our brains respond, even though we still perceive the face as a whole. This suggests that complex brain networks are at work in understanding partially hidden faces. To explore this further, we studied two brain regions, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), while showing primate images of faces with parts occluded. We found that vlPFC neurons were more active when faces were partially covered, while ITC neurons preferred fully visible faces. Interestingly, the ITC seemed to process occluded faces in a separate phase after the vlPFC responded. Our research revealed a coordinated effort between these brain regions based on the level of facial obstruction. Specifically, the vlPFC seemed to play a crucial role, driving the representation of occluded faces in the later phase of ITC processing. Importantly, we also found that the brain processes occluded faces differently from those that are fully visible, suggesting specialized mechanisms for handling these situations. These findings highlight the importance of feedback from the vlPFC in understanding occluded faces in the ITC region of the brain. Understanding these neural processes not only enhances our understanding of how primates perceive faces but also provides insights into broader aspects of visual cognition.",

Semaglutide was attached to hydrogel microspheres by a cleavable linker with an expected in vivo release half-life of about 1 mo. After a single subcutaneous dose, the pharmacokinetic parameters of released semaglutide and bodyweight loss were determined in mice, and results were used to estimate the dosing and pharmacokinetics of the released semaglutide in humans. The in vivo half-life of released semaglutide was ~36 d, and a single dose in diet-induced obese mice resulted in a lean-sparing body weight loss of 20% over 1 mo, statistically the same as semaglutide dosed twice daily. Simulations indicated the microsphere-semaglutide would permit once-monthly administration in humans; moreover, it could maintain the therapeutic minimum concentration (C min ) of once-weekly semaglutide with only 75% of the once-weekly maximum concentration (C max ), a feature that could reduce adverse side effects or allow higher dosing.

Despite the high abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation events detected on metabolic enzymes in high-throughput mass spectrometry-based studies, functional characterization of tyrosine phosphorylation sites has been limited to a subset of enzymes. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is dysregulated across human diseases, including cancer, understanding the consequences of metabolic enzyme tyrosine phosphorylation events is critical for informing disease biology and therapeutic interventions. To globally identify metabolic enzyme tyrosine phosphorylation events and simultaneously assign functional significance to these sites, we performed parallel phosphoproteomics and polar metabolomics in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the absence or presence of the EGF receptor inhibitor erlotinib. We performed an integrated analysis of the phosphoproteomic and metabolomic datasets to identify tyrosine phosphorylation sites on metabolic enzymes with functional consequences. We identified two previously characterized (pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme, phosphoglycerate mutase 1) and two uncharacterized (glutathione S-transferase Pi 1, glutamate dehydrogenase 1) tyrosine phosphorylation sites on metabolic enzymes with purported functions based on metabolomic analyses. We validated these hits using a doxycycline-inducible CRISPR interference system in MCF10A cells, in which target metabolic enzymes were depleted with simultaneous reexpression of wild-type, phosphomutant, or phosphomimetic isoforms. Together, these data provide a framework for identification, prioritization, and characterization of tyrosine phosphorylation sites on metabolic enzymes with functional significance.",

Transcriptional responses of MR in the absence of GR result in fewer regulated genes. In contrast, coexpression of GR potentiates MR-mediated transcription, particularly in response to aldosterone, both in cell lines and in the more physiologically relevant model of mouse colon organoids. MR chromatin binding is altered by GR coexpression in a locus- and ligand-specific way. Single-molecule tracking of MR suggests that the presence of GR contributes to productive binding of MR/aldosterone complexes to chromatin.

Model studies have revealed efficient lubricity by single-component lipid bilayers; synovial joints, however (e.g. hips and knees), comprise over a hundred different lipids, raising the question of whether this is natural redundancy or whether it confers any lubrication benefits. Here, we examine lubrication by progressively more complex mixtures of lipids representative of those in joints, using a surface forces balance at physiologically relevant salt concentrations and pressures. We find that different combinations of such lipids differ very significantly in the robustness of the bilayers to hemifusion under physiological loads (when lubrication breaks down), indicating a clear lubrication synergy afforded by multiple lipid types in the bilayers. Insight into the origins of this synergy is provided by detailed molecular dynamics simulations of potential profiles for the formation of stalks, the essential precursors of hemifusion, between bilayers of the different lipid mixtures used in the experiments. These reveal how bilayer hemifusion—and thus lubrication breakdown—depends on the detailed lipid bilayer composition, through the corresponding separation into domains that are better able to resist stalk formation. Our results shed light on the role of lipid-type proliferation in biolubrication synergy, point to improved treatment modalities for common joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, and indicate how lipid-based interfacial modification in a materials context may be optimized.",

          "abstract": "Cooperative spin crossover (SCO) compounds are one of the most promising molecular bistable solids due to their intriguing thermal hysteresis phenomena around room temperature. It is well known that hysteresis is an essential kinetic effect, however, accurate assessment of the spin transition kinetics of SCO nanomaterials remains scarce. Herein, we developed a thermal-optical methodology to image the thermally induced spin transition kinetics of single SCO nanoparticles in a quantitative, repeatable, and high-throughput manner. Single-particle measurement revealed an intrinsic nucleation-dominated spin transition mechanism, where a highly stochastic nucleation process was clearly observed during the repeatable measurements. By quantifying the dependence of nucleation time on temperature, the activation energy barriers for nucleation were further extracted at a single particle level. Based on this foundation, the high throughput of the optical imaging not only contributed to uncovering the significant nanoparticle-to-nanoparticle heterogeneity, with implications for a negative correlation between apparent activation energy barriers for nucleation and size of the SCO nanoparticles, but also facilitated identifying a minority with high activation energy at least twice the average value. The extraordinary performance was then attributed to the fewer defects within their structures, as confirmed by further results from the in situ creation of defects by thermal ablation, thereby setting the lower limit for the intrinsic activation energy of ideal SCO crystals and promising their potential for future applications in high-performance molecular devices.",

This study investigated the impact of G1 phase extension on resource allocation, metabolic functions, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in yeast, along with the potential for enhancing the production of lipophilic compounds. In brief, the regulation of the G1 phase was achieved by deleting CLN3 (G1 cyclin) in various yeast strains. This modification resulted in a 83% increase in cell volume, a 76.9% increase in dry cell weight, a 82% increase in total protein content, a 41% increase in carotenoid production, and a 159% increase in fatty alcohol production. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of multiple metabolic pathways involved in acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A) synthesis, ensuring an ample supply of precursors for the synthesis of lipophilic products. Furthermore, we observed improved protein synthesis, attributed to UPR activation during the prolonged G1 phase. These findings not only enhanced our understanding and application of yeast’s capacity to synthesize lipophilic compounds in applied biotechnology but also offered unique insights into cellular behavior during the modified G1 phase, particularly regarding the UPR response, for basic research. This study demonstrates the potential of G1 phase intervention to increase the yield of hydrophobic compounds in yeast, providing a promising direction for further research.",

In this study, we realized an ultralow-friction and long-distance wear-free state, defined as structural superlubricity (SSL), between sliding electrical interfaces under ambient conditions. A conductive SSL can be implemented in experiments with single-crystal graphite flakes on flattened metals, such as Au and Ni films. Furthermore, we found that depositing a 2 to 3-nm-thick diamond-like carbon (DLC) film on a nickel alloy can lead to an even lower resistivity than that of metals alone. In addition, we revealed the mechanism by which DLC films can improve the conductivity between graphite and metals through density functional-theory simulations. In addition, we prepared a prototype of the SSL slip ring and proved that it possessed ultralow friction, was wear-free, and had no intermittent failures. Consequently, our results demonstrate a unique type of electrical-contact interface for applications requiring conduction while sliding. Thus, we opened the door for SSL electromechanical coupling.",

Here, we report on experimental observation of pumping of a light beam in a genuinely continuous incommensurate photorefractive quasicrystal emulated by its periodic approximants. We observe a universal character of the transport which is determined by the ratio between periods of the constitutive sublattices, by the sliding angle between them, and by Chern numbers of the excited bands (in the time-coordinate space) of the approximant, for which pumping is adiabatic. This reveals that the properties of quasiperiodic systems determining the topological transport are tightly related to those of their periodic approximants and can be observed and studied in a large variety of physical systems. Our results suggest that the links between quasiperiodic systems and their periodic approximants go beyond the pure mathematical relations: They manifest themselves in physical phenomena which can be explored experimentally.",

Here, we demonstrate the existence of elastic SOI in helical WG. We prove that the torsion and curvature of helical WG induces synthetic gauge potentials in describing the elastic vibrations. Through analytical theory and simulations, we unveil the interplay among elastic SAM, intrinsic OAM, and extrinsic OAM, impacted by the elastic SOI.

Analyzing trends and patterns in consumption can aid in developing policies to mitigate the burden of antimicrobial resistance and global disparities in access to antibiotics. Using pharmaceutical sales data licensed from IQVIA, we estimate national-level trends in antibiotic consumption in 67 countries during 2016–2023 and analyze the effects of economic growth and the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we estimate global human consumption and project growth through 2030 assuming current trends. We find that estimated antibiotic consumption in reported countries increased 16.3% from 29.5 to 34.3 billion defined daily doses (DDDs) from 2016 to 2023, reflecting a 10.6% increase in the consumption rate from 13.7 to 15.2 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Increases were most pronounced in upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced consumption globally, this was most pronounced in high-income countries, and in these countries, reductions in antibiotic use in 2020 were sharper, and lasted longer, than in other countries. By 2030, we project that, without reductions in rapidly developing nations, such as investments to improve infrastructure, particularly water and sanitation, along with improved access to vaccination, global antibiotic consumption will increase by 52.3% from an estimated 49.3 billion in 2023 to 75.1 billion DDDs.",

Density functional theory calculations show that the FM stability between Co 2+ ions is very weak.

Moreover, our calculations illustrate enhanced FM interactions between Co Ti + V O complexes with additional oxygen vacancies.

          "abstract": "In the late spring to summer season of 2023, Canada witnessed unprecedented wildfires, with an extensive burning area and smoke spreading as far as the East Coast of the United States and Europe. Here, using multisource data analysis and climate model simulations, we show that an abnormally warm North Atlantic, as well as an abnormally low Barents Sea ice concentration (SIC), are likely key climate drivers of this Canadian fire season, contributing to ~80% of the fire weather anomaly over Canada from June to August 2023. Specifically, the warm North Atlantic forms an anomalous regional zonal cell with ascending air over the Atlantic and descending air encircling Canada, creating hot and dry local conditions. Meanwhile, reduced Barents SIC leads to a high-pressure center and reinforces the dry northern winds in Canada through Rossby wave dynamics. These exacerbated dry and hot conditions create a favorable environment for the ignition and spread of fires, thus contributing to the prolonged and extreme fire season in Canada. These teleconnections can extend to decadal scales and have important implications for understanding and predicting decadal fire activity in Canada and the surrounding regions.",

We demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use it as a mechanical qubit and demonstrate initialization, readout, and single-qubit gates.

Under peak sunlight of about 920 watts per square meter, our emitter reaches a temperature that is about 2.5°C below ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature reduction of about 4.3° and 8.9°C compared with a silica-polymer hybrid radiative cooler and commercial white paint, respectively.",

          "abstract": "Carbon capture can mitigate point-source carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, but hurdles remain that impede the widespread adoption of amine-based technologies. Capturing CO 2 at temperatures closer to those of many industrial exhaust streams (&gt;200°C) is of interest, although metal oxide absorbents that operate at these temperatures typically exhibit sluggish CO 2 absorption kinetics and instability to cycling. Here, we report a porous metal–organic framework featuring terminal zinc hydride sites that reversibly bind CO 2 at temperatures above 200°C—conditions that are unprecedented for intrinsically porous materials. Gas adsorption, structural, spectroscopic, and computational analyses elucidate the rapid, reversible nature of this transformation. Extended cycling and breakthrough analyses reveal that the material is capable of deep carbon capture at low CO 2 concentrations and high temperatures relevant to postcombustion capture.",

However, the precise mechanism(s) of action for many microbiota species and molecules have not been fully elucidated, limiting the development of microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics. In this Review, we highlight innovative chemical and genetic approaches that are enabling the dissection of microbiota mechanisms and providing causation in health and disease. Although specific microbiota molecules and mechanisms have begun to emerge, new approaches are still needed to go beyond phenotypic associations and translate microbiota discoveries into actionable targets and therapeutic leads to prevent and treat diseases.",

Ribozyme cleavage generates distinct 2′,3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini that resemble substrates for recently characterized RNA repair pathways in cells. We report that ribozyme cleavage of two separate mRNAs activated their scarless trans-ligation and translation into full-length protein in eukaryotic cells, a process that we named StitchR (for Stitch RNA). Optimization of StitchR activity in mammalian cells resulted in a ~900-fold increase in protein expression that approached levels observed for genes expressed from single vectors. We demonstrate that StitchR can be harnessed for effective dual adeno-associated virus gene therapies to correct muscular dystrophies by restoring large functional muscle proteins to endogenous levels in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic requirements vary during development, and our understanding of how metabolic activity influences cell specialization is incomplete. Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In β-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved metabolic adaptation that could potentially be leveraged to treat common red blood cell disorders.",

The Chang’e-6 (CE-6) spacecraft collected samples from the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin on the farside and brought them to Earth. We use lead-lead and rubidium-strontium isotope systems to date low-titanium basalt in a CE-6 sample, finding a consistent age of 2830 ± 5 million years. We interpret this as the date of volcanism in SPA and incorporate it into lunar crater chronology. Strontium, neodymium and lead isotopes indicate the volcanic magma was from a lunar mantle source depleted in incompatible elements and containing almost no KREEP component.",

In this study, we experimentally tested passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of woody plants within 52 tree islands established in an oil palm landscape. Large tree islands and higher initial planted diversity catalyzed diversity recovery, particularly functional diversity at the landscape level. At the local scale, results demonstrated that greater initial planting diversity begets greater diversity of native recruits, overcoming limitations of natural recruitment in highly modified landscapes. Establishing large and diverse tree islands is crucial for safeguarding rare, endemic, and forest-associated species in oil palm landscapes.",

Using detailed global and regional plastics datasets coupled with socio-economic data, we employ machine learning to predict that, without intervention, annual mismanaged plastic waste will nearly double to 121 Mt (100 - 139 Mt 95% CI) by 2050. Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system are projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 Gt CO 2 equivalent (3.09 - 3.54 CO 2 e) over the same period. The United Nations plastic pollution treaty presents a unique opportunity to reshape these outcomes. We simulate eight candidate treaty policies and find that just four could together reduce mismanaged plastic waste by 91% (86% - 98%) and gross plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions by one third.",

We present an extreme gradient–boosting model for predicting the occurrence of PFAS in groundwater at the depths of drinking water supply for the conterminous United States.

The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ∼ 1 .52×10 12 cm −2 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.",

The mechanism of Pi efflux, activated by inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs), has remained unclear. This study presents cryo–electron microscopy structures of XPR1 in multiple conformations, revealing a transmembrane pathway for Pi export and a dual-binding activation pattern for PP-IPs. A canonical binding site is located at the dimeric interface of Syg1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domains, and a second site, biased toward PP-IPs, is found between the transmembrane and SPX domains. By integrating structural studies with electrophysiological analyses, we characterized XPR1 as an inositol phosphates (IPs)/PP-IPs–activated phosphate channel. The interplay among its transmembrane domains, SPX domains, and IPs/PP-IPs orchestrates the conformational transition between its closed and open states.",

We use two paleoecological records from the Bass Strait islands to identify the initiation of anthropogenic landscape transformation associated with ancestral Palawa/Pakana land use.

Here, we assessed the skill of an operational continental heat-cold-health forecasting system. We used state-of-the-art temperature-lag-mortality epidemiological models to transform bias-corrected ensemble weather forecasts into daily temperature-related mortality forecasts. We found that temperature forecasts can be used to issue skillful forecasts of temperature-related mortality. However, the forecast skill varied by season and location, and it was different for temperature and temperature-related mortality due to the use of epidemiological models. Overall, our study demonstrates and quantifies the forecast skill horizon of heat-cold-health forecasting systems, which is a necessary step toward generating trust among public health authorities and end users.",

In the past three decades, bioarchaeological studies have highlighted the concept of “frailty,” operationalizing it as increased risk of mortality or cumulative phenotypes. Using data from medieval London cemeteries, we integrate these two approaches to frailty in past populations. First, we estimate the risks of mortality and survivorship (hazard and survival analyses) associated with 10 biomarkers and use these results to construct population-specific frailty and resilience indices. Then, we apply the indices to adult individuals to explore frailty and resilience differentials between males and females in medieval London. Findings suggest that the male-female morbidity-mortality paradox observed in modern populations may not have existed in this context, which may be explained by preferential cultural buffering of men in this patriarchal, urban setting.",

We studied the naturally arising antibiotic-resistant L22* ribosome variant of Bacillus subtilis and identified a Mg 2+ -dependent physiological cost. Coculture competition experiments show that Mg 2+ limitation hinders the growth of the L22* variant more than the wild type (WT), even under antibiotic pressure. This growth disadvantage of L22* cells is not due to lower ribosome abundance but rather due to reduced intracellular Mg 2+ levels. Coarse-grained elastic-network modeling of ribosome conformational dynamics suggests that L22* ribosomes associate more tightly with Mg 2+ when compared to WT. We combined the structural modeling and experimental measurements in a steady-state model to predict cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels, which also depend on Mg 2+ . Experiments confirmed a predicted ATP drop in L22* cells under Mg 2+ limitation, while WT cells were less affected. Intracellular competition for a finite Mg 2+ pool can thus suppress the establishment of an antibiotic-resistant ribosome variant.",

Upon interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells, CD40 delivers costimulatory signals alongside B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling to regulate affinity maturation and antibody class switch. Mutations affecting CD40-CD40L interactions cause abnormal antibody responses in immunodeficiencies known as X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIgM). Here, we study the CD40-mediated mechanotransduction in B cells, which likely occurs during their physical contacts with T cells. We found that CD40 forms catch bond with CD40L that lasts longer at larger forces, both B and T cells exert tension on CD40-CD40L bonds, and force enhances CD40 signaling and antibody class switch. X-HIgM CD40L mutations impair catch bond formation, suppress endogenous tension, and reduce force-enhanced CD40 signaling, leading to deficiencies in antibody class switch. Our findings highlight the role of mechanotransduction in CD40 function and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying X-HIgM syndrome.",

Köhler’s theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on Köhler’s theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplet interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms, while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes. Our approach allows for multimodal cloud’s droplet size distributions supported by laboratory experiments, offering a different perspective on haze-to-cloud transition and small cloud formation.",

Vacuolar K + /H + exchangers of the NHX (Na + ,K + /H + exchanger) family control luminal pH and, together with K + and H + transporters at the plasma membrane, have been suggested to also regulate cytoplasmic pH. We show the regulation of vacuolar K + /H + exchange by cytoplasmic pH and the calmodulin-like protein CML18 in Arabidopsis. The crystal structure and physicochemical properties of CML18 indicate that this protein senses pH shifts. Interaction of CML18 with tonoplast exchangers NHX1 and NHX2 was favored at acidic pH, a physiological condition elicited by K + starvation in Arabidopsis roots, whereas excess K + produced cytoplasmic alkalinization and CML18 dissociation. These results imply that the pH-responsive NHX-CML18 module is an essential component of the cellular K + - and pH-stats.",

          "abstract": "Early-life experience influences subsequent maturation and function of the adult brain, sometimes even in a sex-specific manner, but underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We describe here how juvenile experience defines sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity in the adult Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system. Starvation of juvenile males disrupts serotonin-dependent activation of the CREB transcription factor in a nociceptive sensory neuron, PHB. CREB acts through a cascade of transcription factors to control expression of an atypical cadherin protein, FMI-1/Flamingo/CELSR. During postembryonic development, FMI-1 promotes and maintains synaptic connectivity of PHB to a command interneuron, AVA, in both sexes, but a serotonin-dependent transcriptional regulatory cassette antagonizes FMI-1 expression in males, thereby establishing sexually dimorphic connectivity between PHB and AVA. A critical regulatory node is the CREB-target LIN-29, a Zn finger transcription factor that integrates four layers of information: sexual specificity, past experience, time and cell-type specificity. Our findings provide the mechanistic details of how an early juvenile experience defines sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity.",

We report magneto-optical (MO) bound states in the continuum (BICs) with a symmetry-preserved planar photonic crystal. We achieve intrinsic C points at Γ point that are robust against variation in both structural geometry and external magnetic field. MO coupling between two modes induces Zeeman splitting, leading to MO BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates for high- Q chiral responses. Furthermore, switchable C point handedness and circular dichroism are enabled by reversing the magnetic field. These findings unveil BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates and on-demand control of C points, paving the way for advanced chiral wave manipulation with enhanced light-matter interaction.",

This work investigates past and future changes in North Atlantic TC activity, focusing on interannual variability and evaluating the contributions from anthropogenic forcing. We show that interannual variability of Atlantic TC activity has already increased, evidenced by an increase in the occurrence of both extremely active and inactive TC seasons. TC-resolving general circulation models project a 36% increase in the variance of North Atlantic TC activity, measured by accumulated cyclone energy, by the middle of the 21st century. These changes are the result of increased variability in vertical wind shear and atmospheric stability, in response to enhanced Pacific-to-Atlantic interbasin sea surface temperature variations. Robust anthropogenic-forced intensification in the variability of Atlantic TC activity will continue in the future, with important implications for emergency planning and societal preparedness.",

Molecular clock analyses have invariably estimated a Cryogenian or Tonian origin of animals while unequivocal animal fossils first occur in the Ediacaran. However, redating of key Ediacaran biotas and the discovery of several Ediacaran crown-Metazoa prompt recalibration of molecular clock analyses. We present revised fossil calibrations and use them in molecular clock analyses estimating the timescale of metazoan evolutionary history. Integrating across uncertainties including phylogenetic relationships, clock model, and calibration strategy, we estimate Metazoa to have originated in the early Ediacaran, Eumetazoa in the middle Ediacaran, and Bilateria in the upper Ediacaran, with many crown-phyla originating across the Ediacaran-Cambrian interval or elsewise fully within the Cambrian. These results are in much closer accord with the fossil record, coinciding with marine oxygenation, but they reject a literal reading of the fossil record.",

However, electrically switchable chiral nonlinear optics has not yet been realized because of the difficulty in electrically manipulating chiral structures. Here, we demonstrate that chiral second-harmonic generation (SHG) can be electrically induced and switched in an achiral biaxial ferroelectric 2D RPP. We observe reversible and continuous electrical switching of SHG circular dichroism and large nonlinear chiroptical activity. Polarization-resolved SHG imaging reveals that electrical poling induces the ferroelectric multidomain structure arising from the biaxial nature of the material, and the planar chirality appears. Our findings show a simple electrical control of the nonlinear chiroptical responses and establish chiral nonlinear optics based on ferroelectric 2D RPPs.",

Observations suggest that SIC-SNAO relationships mainly come from the East Siberian to Arctic Canada (ESAC) region where a weak atmospheric jet stream exists in summer. Twelve CMIP6 models with the most realistic atmospheric climatologies over the North Atlantic and Europe agree well with reanalyses on relationships between SIC and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation. CMIP6 model data indicate that ESAC SIC influences the SNAO with a lead time of several weeks. However, AMIP simulations do not reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation when observed sea ice is prescribed. Rossby wave analyses do though support observed ESAC SIC influences on the SNAO.

Variability in the shelf-basin exchange of the remaining particles closely follows the number of tip jet wind events on seasonal and interannual timescales.

Targeting TET2 in CAR T cells provides therapeutic benefit; however, TET2’s role in exhausted T cell (T EX ) development is unclear. In chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, TET2 drove conversion from stem cell–like T EX progenitors toward terminally differentiated and effector (T EFF )–like T EX . TET2 also enforced a terminally differentiated state in the early bifurcation between T EFF and T EX , indicating broad roles for TET2 in acquisition of effector biology. To exploit the therapeutic potential of TET2, we developed clinically actionable TET2- targeted CAR T cells by disrupting TET2 via knock-in of a safety switch alongside CAR knock-in at the TRAC locus. TET2 -targeted CAR T cells exhibited restrained terminal exhaustion in vitro and enhanced antitumor responses in vivo. Thus, TET2 regulates fate transitions in T EX differentiation and can be targeted with a safety mechanism in CAR T cells for improved tumor control.",

We show that the toxSAS FaRel2 inspects the tRNA acceptor stem to specifically select tRNA Gly and tRNA Thr . The first, second, fourth, and fifth base pairs of the stem act as the specificity determinants. We show that the toxSASs PhRel2 and CapRel SJ46 differ in tRNA specificity from FaRel2 and rationalize this through structural modeling: While the universal 3′-CCA end slots into a highly conserved CCA recognition groove, the acceptor stem recognition region is variable across toxSAS diversity. As phages use tRNA isoacceptors to overcome tRNA-targeting defenses, we hypothesize that highly evolvable modular tRNA recognition allows for the escape of viral countermeasures through tRNA substrate specificity switching.",

This study introduces a CO 2 capture, storage, and mineralization approach with the utilization of biobased biodegradable chelating agents and seawater. An acidic chelating agent solution is used to increase effective porosity and permeability through enhanced mineral dissolution. For instance, applying an acidic N , N -Bis(carboxymethyl)- L -glutamate solution to a porous basalt increased effective porosity by 16% and permeability by 26-fold in 120 hours. Subsequently, alkaline chelating agent–containing seawater improves CO 2 capture and storage by inhibiting mineralization, thus maintaining injectivity while providing ions for mineralization and further expanding storage space. Last, controlled mineralization is achieved by adjusting chelating agent biodegradation. Promising CO 2 storage and mineralization capacities two orders higher than current techniques, this approach reduces required reservoir volume while enhancing efficiency.",

SMIS showed that m 6 A-modified reporter mRNAs dynamically enriched into SGs under arsenite stress and gradually partitioned into the cytosol as SG disassembled. SMIS revealed that knockdown of YTHDF2 contributed to SG disassembly, resulting in the fast redistribution of mRNAs from SGs and rapid recovery of stalled translation. The mechanism is that YTHDF2 can regulate SG stability through the interaction with G3BP1 in m 6 A-modified RNA-dependent manner.

Screens in Drosophila identified genes responsible for the development of body segments, including the “pair-rule” genes (PRGs), which subdivide embryos into double-segment units in a previously unexpected pre-patterning step. Here we show that the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus also uses a pair rule for embryo subdivision but Oncopeltus employs different genes for this process. We identified the gene Blimp1 as an Oncopeltus PRG based on its expression pattern, tested its function with RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9, and generated the first PR mutant in this species. Although it does not have PR function in Drosophila , like Drosophila PRGs, Blimp1 encodes a transcription factor required for embryonic viability. Thus, pair-rule subdivision of the insect body plan is more highly conserved than the factors mediating this process, suggesting a developmental constraint on this pre-patterning step.",

Using reanalysis datasets and climate simulations, here, we show that changes in the relative amount of scattering and absorbing aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes, manifested as long-term decreasing trends in aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA), have played an important role in driving the widening and weakening trends of the NH Hadley circulation (HC) since the early 1980s. Decreasing SSA in the NH middle and high latitudes can notably warm the troposphere there, thus reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, increasing static stability in mid-latitude regions, and leading to the widening and weakening trends of NH HC. Further analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) aerosol forcing–only simulations also supports the importance of SSA trends in perturbing NH HC through the above mechanism.",

To overcome these obstacles, an acoustofluidic RR-based tweezing method is developed to manipulate micro-sized particles that can enhance particle trapping through the resonance interaction of acoustic waves with high Q factor (&gt;3000), more than 20 times greater than traditional acoustic transducers. Particles can be precisely manipulated within the RR by adjusting the signal phase, with trapping amplified by enlarging the connected waveguide. Rapid particle mixing is achieved when particles are placed between the waveguide and RR. The signal path is strengthened by strategically positioning the RR in a two-dimensional plane. Acoustofluidic RR tweezers have immense potential for advancing applications in biosensing, mechanobiology, lab-on-a-chip, and cell-cell communication research.",

A key question is whether the disease is caused by gain-of-function effects on INF2 or loss of function (haploinsufficiency). Despite established roles in multiple cellular processes, neither INF2 knockout mice nor mice with a disease-associated point mutation display an evident kidney or neurologic phenotype. Here, we compared responses to puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)–induced kidney injury between INF2 R218Q and INF2 knockout mice. R218Q INF2 mice are susceptible to glomerular disease, in contrast to INF2 knockout mice. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation analyses, and cellular actin measurements showed that INF2 R218Q confers a gain-of-function effect on the actin cytoskeleton. RNA expression analysis showed that adhesion and mitochondria-related pathways were enriched in the PAN-treated R218Q mice. Both podocytes from INF2 R218Q mice and human kidney organoids with an INF2 mutation (S186P) recapitulate adhesion and mitochondrial phenotypes. Thus, gain-of-function mechanisms drive INF2-related FSGS and explain this disease’s autosomal dominant inheritance.",

This “mechano-gradient” is used for the cell competition–driven correction of noisy morphogen gradients. Naturally and artificially generated unfit cells, producing noisy Wnt/β-catenin gradients, induce local deformation of the mechano-gradients that activate mechanosensitive calcium channels in the neighboring fit cells, which then secrete annexin A1a to kill unfit cells.

Here, we have exploited engineered stiff viscoelastic protein hydrogels to show that, contrary to current models of cell-ECM interaction, substrate viscous energy dissipation attenuates mechanosensing even when cells are exposed to higher effective rigidity. This unexpected behavior is however readily captured by a pull-and-hold model of molecular clutch–based cell mechanosensing, which also recapitulates opposite cellular response at low rigidities. Consistent with predictions of the pull-and-hold model, we find that myosin inhibition can boost mechanosensing on cells cultured on dissipative matrices. Together, our work provides general mechanistic understanding on how cells respond to the viscoelastic properties of the ECM.",

Using metabolic glycan engineering click bioorthogonal chemistry, PD-L1 expressed on tumor cell membranes was labeled with highly active azide groups. This enables covalently binding of the clickable inhibitor with PD-L1 and subsequent PD-L1 degradation. A pH-activatable nanoparticle responding to extracellular acidic pH of tumor was subsequently used to deliver the clickable PD-L1 inhibitor into extracellular tumor microenvironment for depleting PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cell and macrophage membranes in vivo. We further demonstrated that a combination of the clickable PD-L1 inhibitor with radiotherapy (RT) eradicated the established tumor by inhibiting RT–up-regulated PD-L1 in the tumor tissue.

B cell–specific deletion of BCAP in mice leads to decreases in antigen-specific responses through defects in BCR-antigen endocytosis. BCAP is necessary to orchestrate actin reorganization around the antigen for efficient endocytosis through BCR and intracellular processing of antigens. Therefore, loss of BCAP from B cells leads to defects in antigen endocytosis, hampering the propagation of antigen-derived signals and decreasing the ability of B cells to present antigens to T cells.

Here, we build DNA nanopores with programmable diameters and nup arrangements to model the constricted and dilated NPCs.

Furthermore, importin-β1 substantially changes the dynamics of Nup62 assemblies and facilitates the passage of HBV capsids through the 60-nm NPC mimics containing Nup62 and Nup153.

However, while these mechanisms are well understood for second-period elements, involving those of the third period and beyond can introduce unorthodox reactivity. Combining crossed molecular beam experiments with electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, we provide compelling evidence on an exotic insertion of an unsaturated sigma doublet radical into a silicon-hydrogen bond as observed in the barrierless gas-phase reaction of the D1-ethynyl radical (C 2 D) with silane (SiH 4 ). This pathway, which leads to the D1-silylacetylene (SiH 3 CCD) product via atomic hydrogen loss, challenges the prerequisite and fundamental concept that two reactive electrons and an empty orbital are required for the open shell, unsaturated radical reactant to insert into a single bond.",

However, glucose levels fluctuate in the brain during sleep or circuit activity, posing major metabolic stress. Here, we demonstrate that the mammalian brain uses pyruvate as a fuel source, and pyruvate can support neuronal viability in the absence of glucose. Nerve terminals are sites of metabolic vulnerability, and we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is a critical step in oxidative ATP production in hippocampal terminals. We find that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation, which, in turn, modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Our data reveal that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier regulates distinct steps in neurotransmission, namely, the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic vesicle release and the efficiency of vesicle retrieval—functions that have profound implications for synaptic plasticity. In summary, we identify pyruvate as a potent neuronal fuel and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake as a critical node for the metabolic control of neurotransmission in hippocampal terminals.",

However, conventional electrostatic doping methods exhibit limitations, particularly in addressing electric field–induced drift and subsequent diffusion of electrons, which restrict nanoscale doping. Here, we present a tip-induced nanospectroscopic electric pulse modulator to dynamically control nanoscale electron density, thereby facilitating precise measurement of nano-optoelectronic behaviors within a MoS 2 monolayer. The tip-induced electric pulse enables nanoscale modulation of electron distribution as a function of electric pulse width. We simultaneously investigate spatially altering photoluminescence quantum yield at the nanoscale region. We model the extent of electron depletion region, confirming a minimum doping region with a radius of ∼265 nanometers for a 30-nanosecond pulse width. Our approach paves the way for engineering local electron density and in situ nano-optical characterization in two-dimensional materials, enabling an in-depth understanding of doping-dependent nano-optoelectronic phenomena.",

Understanding viral adaptions in humans is difficult in organs such as the heart, where primary infected material is not routinely collected. In search of asymptomatic infections with accompanying host adaptions, we mined for cardio-pathogenic viruses in the unaligned reads of nearly 1000 human hearts profiled by RNA sequencing. Among virus-positive cases (~20%), we identified three robust adaptions in the host transcriptome related to inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling and posttranscriptional regulation by the p38-MK2 pathway. The adaptions are not determined by the infecting virus, and they recur in infections of human or animal hearts and cultured cardiomyocytes. Adaptions switch states when NF-κB or p38-MK2 is perturbed in cells engineered for chronic infection by the cardio-pathogenic virus, coxsackievirus B3. Stratifying viral responses into reversible adaptions adds a targetable systems-level simplification for infections of the heart and perhaps other organs.",

The widespread areas of application could even be increased if resolution was improved, which the famous Abbe diffraction limit now restrains. Super-resolution techniques can break the diffraction limit but most rely on fluorescent labeling. This makes them incompatible with (sub)femtosecond temporal resolution and applications that demand the absence of labeling. Here, we introduce harmonic deactivation microscopy (HADES) for breaking the diffraction limit in nonfluorescent samples. By controlling the harmonic generation process on the quantum level with a second donut-shaped pulse, we confine the third-harmonic generation to three times below the original focus size of a scanning microscope. We demonstrate that resolution improvement by deactivation is more efficient for higher harmonic orders and only limited by the maximum applicable deactivation-pulse fluence. This provides a route toward sub-100-nanometer resolution in a regular nonlinear microscope.",

Membrane technology applied for CO 2 capture offers several advantages in terms of energy savings, simple operation, and easy scale-up. Glassy membranes are associated with low gas permeability that negatively affect on their industrial implementation. Oppositely, rubbery membranes offer high permeability, but their selectivity is low. Here we report rubbery organic frameworks (ROFs) combining the high permeability of soft matrices with the high sieving selectivity of molecular frameworks. The best performing membranes provide a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity up to 104 with a CO 2 permeability up to 1000 Barrer, representing relevant performances for industrial implementation. Water vapors have a positive effect on CO 2 permeability, and the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity is higher than in dry conditions, as most of CO 2 gas emissions are present in fully humidified gas streams. The synergetic high permeability/selectivity performances are superior to that observed with current state-of-the-art polymeric membranes.",

By using asymmetric ionic unit–driven covalent groups orienting and rigidity-flexibility coupling dual strategy, we successfully design and synthesize four NCS pnictides: [Sr 4 Br] 2 [M II 3 Si 25 P 40 ] (M II = Mg, Cd) and [Ba 3 Br][M III Si 10 P 16 ] (M III = Ga, In), which exhibit strong second harmonic generation effects (5.2 to 7.5 × AgGaS 2 ), wide bandgaps (1.81 to 1.90 electron volts), and moderate birefringence (0.030 to 0.051). An unprecedented NCS structure-inducing mechanism analysis revealed that the (Sr 4 Br) and (Ba 4 Br) ionic units featuring the diamond-like electrostatic force field effectively break inversion symmetry and trigger uniform arrangement of the covalent tetrahedron groups. Furthermore, the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties and birefringence can be remarkably tuned by the secondary covalent building blocks (M II/III P 4 tetrahedra) with distinct bond flexibility providing a broader space for regulating the key parameters. This work might expand chemical space for exploiting high-performance pnictide NLO materials.",

This challenge is closely related to the discrimination of quantum states, and proof-of-principle demonstrations of the latter have already been realized using optical photons. However, the experimental demonstration of discriminating general quantum operations, including both unitary and nonunitary operations, has remained elusive. In general quantum systems, especially those with high dimensions, the preparation of arbitrary quantum states and the implementation of arbitrary quantum operations and generalized measurements are nontrivial tasks. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal unambiguous discrimination of up to six displacement operators and the unambiguous discrimination of nonunitary quantum operations. Our results demonstrate powerful tools for experimental research in quantum information processing and are expected to stimulate a wide range of valuable applications in the field of quantum sensing.",

PARPi exert their cytotoxic effect by both trapping PARP1 on the damaged DNA and by restraining its enzymatic activity (PARylation). How PARP1 is recruited and trapped at the DNA damage sites and how resistance to PARPi could be overcome are still matters of investigation. Here, we described PARP1 as a substrate of the deubiquitinase USP1. At molecular level, USP1 binds PARP1 to remove its K63-linked polyubiquitination and controls PARP1 chromatin trapping and PARylation activity, regulating sensitivity to PARPi. In both Pt/PARPi-sensitive and -resistant cells, USP1/PARP1 combined blockade enhances replicative stress, DNA damage, and cell death. Our work dissected the biological interaction between USP1 and PARP1 and recommended this axis as a promising and powerful therapeutic choice for not only sensitive but also chemoresistant patients with ovarian cancer irrespective of their HR status.",

We evaluate HistoXGAN across 29 cancer subtypes and demonstrate that reconstructed images retain information regarding tumor grade, histologic subtype, and gene expression patterns.

In in vivo models of melanoma and lymphoma, antitumor T cells conditioned ex vivo with exogenous H 2 S or overexpressing CBS demonstrated superior tumor control upon adoptive transfer. Further, T cells with high Golgi content exhibited unique metabolic and glycation signatures with enhanced antitumor capacity.

Seven genomic loci with significant gene-environment interactions (G×E) on regional gray matter volumes were identified, with enriched biological functions related to metabolic process, inflammatory process, and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, genetic overlapping results with behavioral and disease-related phenotypes indicated shared biological mechanism between maternal education modified neurodevelopment and related behavioral traits. Finally, by decomposing the multidimensional components of maternal education, we found that socioeconomic status, rather than family environment, played a more important role in modifying the genetic effects on neurodevelopment.
