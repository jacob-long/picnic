          "abstract": "Many children from low-income backgrounds worldwide fail to master school mathematics1; however, some children extensively use mental arithmetic outside school2,3. Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P < 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths.",

          "abstract": "The integration of Indigenous perspectives and knowledge with biomedical approaches in neurosciences can significantly broaden the understanding of the human brain and mind. Drawing upon the writings of Elders in Canada, we refer to this integration as Two-Eyed Seeing or Etuaptmumk. We discuss how Two-Eyed Seeing and other dual perspectives can bring both breadth of knowledge and humility to the development of research and clinical practices for brain health. In this forward-looking discussion, we include both traditional academic and non-academic traditions and the work of Indigenous scholars on methodologies, life, health, culture, language and history. To describe challenges and consider solutions, we offer broad strategies for allyship, humility and universalism and situate them in four specific examples pertaining to disability, suicide, migration and the environment. We further advance the power of Two-Eyed Seeing in the context of new considerations for communication and public engagement. Two-Eyed Seeing, per se, is only one approach, but as neuroscience becomes ever more global, inclusive and ethically proactive, it must universally see the world of brain and mental health through the eyes of both reductionism and holism.",

          "abstract": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity 1,2 . Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT) 3,4 . For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm 5 —to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations 6 . As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis is the aberrant activation of lung fibroblasts into pathological fibroblasts that produce excessive extracellular matrix1,2,3. Thus, the identification of key regulators that promote the generation of pathological fibroblasts can inform the development of effective countermeasures against disease progression. Here we use two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis to show that LEPR+ fibroblasts that arise during alveologenesis include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts as a major constituent. These alveolar fibroblasts in turn contribute substantially to CTHRC1+POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts. Genetic ablation of POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts attenuates fibrosis. Comprehensive analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data reveal that RUNX2 is a key regulator of the expression of fibrotic genes. Consistently, conditional deletion of Runx2 with LeprcreERT2 or Scube2creERT2 reduces the generation of pathological fibroblasts, extracellular matrix deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, LEPR+ cells that include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts are a key source of pathological fibroblasts, and targeting Runx2 provides a potential treatment option for pulmonary fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "Fossils representing Cretaceous lineages of crown clade birds (Aves) are exceptionally rare but are crucial to elucidating major ecological shifts across early avian divergences. Among the earliest known putative crown birds is Vegavis iaai1,2,3,4,5, a foot-propelled diver from the latest Cretaceous (69.2–68.4 million years ago)6 of Antarctica with controversial phylogenetic affinities2,7,8,9,10. Initially recovered by phylogenetic analyses as a stem anatid (ducks and closely related species)1,2,11, Vegavis has since been recovered as a stem member of Anseriformes (waterfowl)7,8,9, or outside Aves altogether10. Here we report a new, nearly complete skull of Vegavis that provides new insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds. Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth and reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum and ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that of any other known anseriform but like that of other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons). The Cretaceous occurrence of Vegavis, with a feeding ecology unique among known Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl), is further indication that the earliest anseriform divergences were marked by evolutionary experiments unrepresented in the extant diversity3,11,12,13.",

          "abstract": "The genetic code is conserved across all domains of life, yet exceptions have revealed variations in codon assignments and associated translation factors1,2,3. Inspired by this natural malleability, synthetic approaches have demonstrated whole-genome replacement of synonymous codons to construct genomically recoded organisms (GROs)4,5 with alternative genetic codes. However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code. Here we describe construction and characterization of Ochre, a GRO that fully compresses a translational function into a single codon. We replaced 1,195 TGA stop codons with the synonymous TAA in ∆TAG Escherichia coli C321.∆A4. We then engineered release factor 2 (RF2) and tRNATrp to mitigate native UGA recognition, translationally isolating four codons for non-degenerate functions. Ochre thus utilizes UAA as the sole stop codon, with UGG encoding tryptophan and UAG and UGA reassigned for multi-site incorporation of two distinct non-standard amino acids into single proteins with more than 99% accuracy. Ochre fully compresses degenerate stop codons into a single codon and represents an important step toward a 64-codon non-degenerate code that will enable precise production of multi-functional synthetic proteins with unnatural encoded chemistries and broad utility in biotechnology and biotherapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Cancer genome alterations often lead to vulnerabilities that can be used to selectively target cancer cells. Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach 1–3 . Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO , for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD , a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37  (also known as  SKIC3 ), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD .",

          "authors": "Claire Kokontis, Timothy A. Klein, Sukrit Silas, Joseph Bondy-Denomy",
          "abstract": "Bacteriophages use diverse mechanisms to evade antiphage defence systems. ΦKZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery1,2,3,4. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), a conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2 and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized protein 1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces of Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice.",

          "abstract": "The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.",

Here we report a multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, which shows metallic out-of-plane charge transport with high electrical conductivity. The material comprises columnar π arrays with an interlayer distance of 3.59 Å and periodic rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals significant electron delocalization in the 2DPANI lattices. First-principles calculations indicate the in-plane 2D conjugation and strong interlayer electronic coupling in 2DPANI facilitated by the Cl-bridged layer stacking. To assess the local optical conductivity, we used terahertz and infrared nanospectroscopy to unravel a Drude-type conductivity with an infrared plasma frequency and an extrapolated local d.c. conductivity of around 200 S cm−1. Conductive scanning probe microscopy showed an unusually high out-of-plane conductivity of roughly 15 S cm−1. Transport measurements through vertical and lateral micro-devices revealed comparable high out-of-plane (roughly 7 S cm−1) and in-plane conductivity (roughly 16 S cm−1). The vertical micro-devices further showed increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature, demonstrating unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour. By using this multilayer-stacked 2D conducting polymer design, we predict the achievement of strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions, potentially reaching three-dimensional metallic conductivity6,7.",

Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change. Genomic surveys are expanding our knowledge of the true biodiversity of the fungal kingdom, and genome-editing tools make it possible to imagine harnessing these organisms to fuel the bioeconomy.

          "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens1,2,3,4,5,6. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient’s tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones. Moreover, T cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC.",

However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies 2,3 . Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that 291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these ( MC4R , PCSK1 , POMC , CALCR , BSN and CORO1A ) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders.",

Here we report the discovery of a highly significant millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, ultraviolet and X-ray outburst beginning in 20186,7. The QPO was detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on a scale of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical quasi-periodic eruptions. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over 2 years with a decelerating period evolution (\\(\\ddot{P}\\) greater than zero). To our knowledge, this evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar-mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational-wave emission.",

Over the past 15 years, synthetic lethal cancer target discovery approaches have led to clinical successes of PARP inhibitors2 and ushered several next-generation therapeutic targets such as WRN3, USP14, PKMYT15, POLQ6 and PRMT57 into the clinic. Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interaction between the PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO–HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO–HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.",

North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. During the Eneolithic period, a wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga area7 bypassed local foragers to mix in equal parts with Trypillian farmers, forming the people of the Usatove culture around 4500 bce. A temporally overlapping wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga blended with foragers instead of farmers to form Serednii Stih people7. The third wave was the Yamna—descendants of the Serednii Stih who formed by mixture around 4000 bce and expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 bce). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka, Ukraine (3635–3383 bce), a site of archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic–Bronze Age transition and a likely epicentre of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves of migration propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders, a flexible strategy that may explain the success of the peoples of the North Pontic in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3,4,5,8,9,10.",

Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade.",

Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2,3,4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Fermín festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, ρs, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of ρs markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of ρs to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of ρs in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of ρs at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature ρs and the superconducting transition temperature Tc, reminiscent of Uemura’s relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.",

Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions 3 in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition 4 . Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis 5–7 in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution.

The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants 1,2 . These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments 1,3 . In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity.",

Conventional semiconductor superlattices with designable potential modulation in one dimension has enabled high-electron-mobility transistors and quantum-cascade lasers. More recently, a diverse set of superlattices has been constructed through self-assembly or guided assembly of multiscale building units, including zero-dimensional nanoclusters and nanoparticles6,7, one-dimensional nanorods and nanowires8,9, two-dimensional nanolayers and nanosheets10,11,12,13, and hybrid two-dimensional molecular assemblies14,15,16,17. These self-assembled superlattices feature periodic structural modulation in two or three dimensions, but often lack atomic precision owing to the inevitable structural disorder at the interfaces between the constituent units. Here we report a one-pot synthesis of multi-dimensional single-crystalline superlattices consisting of periodic arrangement of zero-, one- and two-dimensional building units. By exploiting zirconium (IV) metal–organic frameworks as host templates for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices through a coordination-assisted assembly strategy, we synthesize a family of single-crystalline porous superlattices. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly resolve the high-order superlattice structure with deterministic atomic coordinates. Further treatment with selected amine molecules produces perovskite-like superlattices with highly tunable photoluminescence and chiroptical properties. Our study creates a platform of high-order single-crystalline porous superlattices, opening opportunities to tailor the electronic, optical and quantum properties beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids.",

However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies3,4,5,6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas7,8,9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures10,11,12,13,14,15,16. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 105.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi] emission that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000 solar masses per year. These data provide a large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 105 kelvin and 106 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it18.",

Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired2. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains3,4,5,6. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations3,7,8. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests ‘slidetronics’ device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays9.",

          "abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) show potential to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in humans 1 . However, there are limited data on the antibody concentrations required to prevent infection. Clinical trials of bNAb prophylaxis have demonstrated partial efficacy 2 , but the sampling frequency typically does not allow precise timing of infection events and concurrent antibody levels. Here, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, we show that although potent bNAbs can delay the onset of acute viremia, subclinical infections occur while bNAb levels remain high. Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that ‘viral blips’—low and transient plasma viremia—often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- to 400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials.",

However, topological water-wave forms, especially their ability to manipulate particles, have not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe the controllable generation of topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, in gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate the efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping the particles in the high-intensity field zones and controlling their orbital and spinning motion due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the water waves.

If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 2–4 . Here we show, with a detailed US state-specific carbon cycle analysis constrained by resource provision, that EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.16–0.30 GtCO 2 yr −1 by 2050, rising to 0.25–0.49 GtCO 2 yr −1 by 2070. Geochemical assessment of rivers and oceans suggests effective transport of dissolved products from EW from soils, offering CDR on intergenerational timescales. Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100–150 tCO 2 −1 by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR. Although EW cannot be a substitute for emission reductions, our assessment strengthens the case for EW as an overlooked practical innovation for helping the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals 5,6 . Public awareness of EW and equity impacts of EW deployment across the USA require further exploration 7,8 and we note that mobilizing an EW industry at the necessary scale could take decades.",

However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities.",

          "abstract": "The Yamnaya archaeological complex appeared around 3300 bc across the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and by 3000 bc it reached its maximal extent, ranging from Hungary in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus–lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer1 ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer2 ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry3 along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 bc and grew rapidly after 3750–3350 bc. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite4,5. We therefore propose that the final unity of the speakers of ‘proto-Indo-Anatolian’, the language ancestral to both Anatolian and Indo-European people, occurred in CLV people some time between 4400 bc and 4000 bc.",

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear 1,2 . Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti- Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication 3–5 . Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions.",

Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains6. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (‘Higgs’) mode7. These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes.",

          "abstract": "Granzymes are a family of serine proteases mainly expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and innate-like lymphocytes1. Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected and tumor cells, accumulating evidence indicates certain granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates1. Recently, we found that the majority of tissue CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and in inflamed organs across other diseases express granzyme K (GZMK)2, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving C2 and C4. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In RA synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the major producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Further, Gzmk-deficient mice have less severe arthritis and dermatitis with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is entirely driven by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts.",

          "abstract": "Elizabeth Holmes (second from left) was convicted of conspiracy and defrauding investors in her company, Theranos, after overhyping the science behind her work.Credit: Nic Coury/AP/Alamy\n\nSharing scientific discoveries requires as much care as uncovering them, a fact I didn’t fully appreciate until I moved from academia to public relations. Missteps in communication — whether intentional or not — can undermine trust and even harm the reputation of entire fields.\n\nI started working in science communication as a postdoctoral fellow at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and I spent time in the policy and communications office at the NIH’s National Institute of Nursing Research. When the COVID-19 pandemic shut down non-urgent research on the NIH campus, I decided to start exploring careers in communication. I took a position supporting medical and scientific communications for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funds US biomedical research. In 2021, I transitioned into public relations through an account role at an agency called LifeSci Communications, in New York City; a year later, I shifted to specialize in scientific storytelling at Syneos Health Communications, also in New York.\n\nIn public relations, we shape how people perceive a company or a product, working across many communication platforms: websites, press releases, social media and more. In my role, I focus on creating a compelling narrative to help biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies communicate their scientific approach to investors, the media and consumers. For me, distilling complex topics into messages that resonate is a welcome challenge.\n\nWhether helping a client to explain why the science behind their treatment is unique, or combating vaccine misinformation, I’ve found that the temptation to misrepresent, inflate or otherwise hype data is ever present, as are the dangers that come with doing so.\n\nConsider Theranos, the biotech start-up in Palo Alto, California. The company’s bold claims about revolutionizing blood testing captured public and investor interest, but its refusal to acknowledge technical limitations or share transparent data led to one of the most notorious scandals in science and technology. Ultimately, the company was shut down in 2018, and founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in 2022.\n\n‘Blood, sweat and tears’: Building a network for Black scientists\n\nThe fallout left scientists questioning whether the benefits of other scientific innovations had been over-inflated, and many called for more rigorous peer-reviewed evidence before funding new ventures. This ripple effect shows the stakes of miscommunication – it can undermine public trust in legitimate breakthroughs, spinning fact into fiction.\n\nThe temptation to ‘sell out’ is present across the science-communications industry, in which the pressure to stand out might overshadow the responsibility to communicate with integrity. Overselling findings, cherry-picking data or making claims that the evidence does not yet support can seem like a quick route to funding or to recognition. But these shortcuts come at a cost: eroded trust, scepticism about future work and, in some cases, damage to a field’s reputation.\n\nKisha Greer works in public relations, helping companies to honestly and ethically communicate their scientific approach.Credit: Julia Johnson Photography\n\nThe lessons from Theranos are clear: hype and secrecy are a dangerous combination. But how can scientists avoid these pitfalls and communicate their work responsibly? Here are some strategies for selling science without crossing the line into spin.\n\nSet realistic expectations\n\nScience is inherently exciting; it offers new possibilities and solutions to pressing challenges. But that excitement should never come at the expense of honesty. Research is rarely foolproof, and overselling it by exaggerating its impact or downplaying its limitations can backfire, leading to disappointment and scepticism when the full picture emerges.\n\nOne way to set realistic expectations is to ask yourself, “If this statement was taken out of context in a headline, would it still accurately represent the research?” This exercise helps to identify overly broad or optimistic phrases, which should be replaced with precise, contextual language such as ‘early-stage research’ or ‘preclinical findings’.\n\nAnother approach is to emphasize the scientific journey rather than just the destination. Instead of saying, “On the basis of the early clinical data, this treatment could cure cancer,” highlight the next step forwards: “Early clinical data suggest this treatment has the potential to improve outcomes for people with cancer. To explore this further, we’ve initiated a phase II study to better understand its effects and expect to see initial results by the end of the next year.” This statement highlights progress while acknowledging that the research is ongoing.\n\nClear communication ensures that audiences understand the iterative nature of science. Research evolves. Setting realistic expectations from the start fosters trust and enthusiasm that will last beyond the initial headlines.\n\nKnow your audience’s needs\n\nA message that resonates with one group might fall flat with another. Tailoring communication to your audience is critical.\n\nFor instance, if you’re writing a grant application for research on stem-cell responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI), focus on feasibility, potential impact and measurable goals to show how the work could fill a gap in TBI treatments. When presenting your findings at a scientific conference, highlight the methodologies and technical details that underpin your results. Discuss, for example, which imaging techniques were used to track the integration of stem cells and the strategies for quantifying stem-cell responses.\n\nIf, instead, you are communicating to the general public, focus on why your research matters to society and what people can expect as a result. Avoid boring them with too many technical details. This might require simplifying your message, so that more people can understand it: “My research explores how the brain can heal itself by using its own cells to repair damage.”\n\nBy aligning your message with your audience’s needs, you can prevent misunderstandings and ensure that the most relevant information comes through. Clear, targeted messaging builds credibility, creating a foundation for long-term engagement.\n\nUse data transparently to build trust\n\nTransparency is more than an ethical responsibility; it’s the foundation of trust. People respect honesty, especially when it includes uncertainties and setbacks.\n\nData are at the core of science and should be used thoughtfully and generously to support your points. Highlighting only favourable results can give a skewed picture of the research, leading audiences to overestimate its impact. Instead, aim for a balanced view, showing both supportive and contrasting data and acknowledging any limitations.\n\nWhen preparing to present data, I often start by asking, “What’s the most important takeaway, and what context does the audience need to fully understand it?” For example, if a study on Parkinson’s disease showed positive results in a small subgroup of participants with mild neurocognitive decline but mixed outcomes in the overall study group, craft your messaging to reflect that variability.\n\nEmphasize how the findings added to the scientific understanding of the disease. Rather than focusing solely on the positive results found in the subgroup, this approach provides the context needed to position the study as an important step forwards without overstating its immediate implications for people with Parkinson’s.\n\nSuch transparency builds trust with your audience and amplifies the impact of your science.",

Wanyama, a 29-year-old in Nairobi who was born HIV-positive, is one of millions of people worldwide whose life-saving treatment is funded by a US foreign-aid programme.\n\nThe HIV clinic that Wanyama visits has managed to continue delivering medications — although many clinics aren’t, say researchers. But drug supplies are being rationed.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\n“We patients who are HIV-positive, we are really panicked,” says Wanyama, whose two children do not carry the virus. He’s lost his job mentoring other HIV-positive people at a US-funded facility, and is worried about continued access to medication. “The way things are going, I feel like I have worked so much for nothing.”\n\nAs the Trump administration announces drastic policy changes, nowhere is the shock more palpable than in the field of global health. Scientists, medics and health officials say that the outsize US influence on battling disease globally will be difficult to quickly replace.\n\nUS actions such as the foreign-aid freeze and its exit from the World Health Organization will affect billions of dollars in annual funding for battling HIV, malaria and other areas in global health. That will cost lives and threaten global security, say researchers. “It will make the world a less safe place,” says Peter Horby, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\n‘High anxiety moment’: Biden’s NIH chief talks Trump 2.0 and the future of US science\n\nFunding freeze\n\nAfter the Trump administration announced a three-month freeze on foreign aid last month, effects have rippled throughout the global-health community. Programmes supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) — in which many employees have been furloughed, according to news reports — fund research, prevention and care for diseases such as HIV and malaria, and work on other global-health priorities.\n\n“People haven’t had a chance to get alternative funding because of the abrupt nature of this,” says Salim Abdool Karim, director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, in Durban. The centre was due this week to enrol the first participant in a USAID-funded trial of HIV vaccines, which is now on hold. It is using its reserve funds to continue a trial testing whether a vaginal insertion can prevent HIV transmission.\n\nHIV clinics in Kenya and elsewhere have been affected by the freezes on US aid money.Credit: Pedro Ugarte/AFP via Getty\n\n“It is chaos,” says an HIV researcher in Africa, who runs a clinic that treats thousands of people supported by a US programme called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — they asked not to be named because of fears of reprisal. More than 20 million people, mostly in Africa, including more than one million children and pregnant people, receive antiretroviral drugs through the US$6.5-billion programme.\n\nThe clinic has had to suspend staff, which were funded by PEPFAR, and its patients are still receiving drugs only because of volunteer efforts. Last night, the clinic received a waiver from the US government that seems to allow it to resume HIV treatment, but uncertainty abounds.\n\nHIV treatments threatened\n\nIn South Africa, where the government provides the bulk of HIV care using some PEPFAR funding, the impact of the aid freeze will be minimal, says Abdool Karim. But in many other African countries, “if PEPFAR services stop, the effect will be catastrophic. The governments can’t just step in to meet the shortfall.”\n\nStopping antiretroviral treatment causes virus levels to rebound, making it possible for a person to transmit HIV — including through pregnancy to unborn children — and facilitating the evolution of drug resistance. “I’m hoping that someone somewhere sees sense and does not continue this abrupt ending of AIDS-treatment programmes,” says Abdool Karim.",

          "abstract": "The 42-day ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, which took effect on 19 January, provides a vital opportunity to begin to address the devastation from the 15-month war, scientists there have told Nature. The ceasefire might yet prove temporary, and whether or not it holds, the long-term future for the territory and its citizens remains highly uncertain.\n\nWhile daily bombing is suspended, international organizations can complete a detailed assessment of Gaza’s water, food, health and infrastructure needs, the researchers say.\n\n“There’s a need to document what has been happening here in Gaza and to publish [the results] with other researchers worldwide,” says neuroscientist Khamis Elessi, head of the Evidence-Based Medicine Unit at the Islamic University of Gaza, who now spends most of his time treating injured people at the Ahli Arab hospital.\n\nThis knowledge is needed to guide those undertaking recovery and rebuilding in Gaza, during the ceasefire and when the war is over. “Research is critical [at this stage]” adds Samer Abuzerr, who studies water-borne diseases at the University College of Science and Technology in Gaza.\n\nElessi and Abuzerr are among more than ten scientists who spoke to Nature for this article. These scholars managed to continue their research, and some even published their results, despite facing homelessness, recurrent displacement and a dearth of food and basic necessities.\n\nLeft: Neuroscientist Khamis Elessi receives an award (left) in 2022 from Liz Grant, director of the Global Health Academy at the University of Edinburgh, UK.

Some 47,500 people have been killed as a result of Israel’s retaliation. These figures are according to data reported to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nResearchers and specialists in humanitarian assistance estimate that 90% of Gaza’s 2.2-million population is homeless. Systems ensuring food, supplies, water, sanitation, education, health care, energy and the broader economy have been destroyed or are critically endangered, requiring rebuilding.\n\nAnother urgent need, the researchers say, is removal of debris from bomb damage. According to a preliminary assessment by the UN Environment Programme published in June, for every square metre of the Gaza Strip, there is an estimated 100 kilogrammes of debris, such as concrete, iron and steel, as well as residue from exploded and unexploded bombs, asbestos and human remains.\n\n“More than 97% of Gaza’s water comes from a groundwater aquifer,” says Ahmed Hilles, head of the National Institute for Environment and Development in Gaza. “The porosity [of the aquifer’s layers] is very high, so the potential of [groundwater] contamination is also very high,” he adds.\n\nUniversities, too, will need to be rebuilt. Fifteen of Gaza’s 21 universities, university-colleges and community colleges have been either severely damaged or destroyed, according to September data from the UN science and cultural agency UNESCO.\n\nIn a written response sent to Nature, an Israel Defense Forces representative explained that, as part of its efforts to dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities, “there has been an operational need, among other things, to strike or raid buildings” where Hamas “placed some of its terror infrastructure”. The representative added: “Hamas systematically uses public buildings that are supposed to be used for civilian purposes only, including educational institutions and universities.”\n\nSewage in the streets\n\nEven before the war, just 10% of Gazans had access to safe water. That is now 4%. Thirty per cent have access to a sewage network, compared with 70% pre-war, according to a November report of Gaza's reconstruction needs1 authored by Hilles who also lectured at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. “There is sewage water collected in the streets. Repairing the sewage system is urgent, so people will not get water-borne diseases,” Elessi adds.\n\nAround half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are not functioning, and the rest are only partially operational, according to the World Health Organization. Gazans are experiencing high rates of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, skin rash, scabies and viral hepatitis, according to a study co-authored by Abuzerr, published last November2.\n\n“We have 350,000 patients with chronic diseases who have not been followed for the last 16 months. We have 11,000 cancer patients,” says Elessi. “They are all in pain and deteriorating because there is no therapy nor referral abroad. These patients should be dealt with urgently.”\n\n‘Expedite reconstruction’\n\nElMashharawi studied the impact of displacement on almost 200 staff members at her university. “Establishing temporary shelters and expediting the reconstruction of houses is a top priority,” she says.\n\nAya ElMashharawi: ‘I remain committed to my academic journey.’Credit: Aya ElMashharawi- UCAS\n\n“Four floors above us were bombed, killing 30 people,” says ElMashharawi, who is now in the Nuseirat refugee camp. “It was an incredibly terrifying experience that I can’t even describe, but by the grace of God, we survived,” she recalls.",

          "abstract": "Languages including Farsi are members of the globe-spanning Indo-European language family.Credit: Tina Manley/Alamy\n\nAncient-genomics researchers have pinpointed the homelands of a nomadic tribe that transformed the culture and genetics of Europe and Asia, revealing a potential source for the Indo–European language family, spoken by much of the world.\n\nGenomes from more than 400 individuals suggest that the Yamnaya — Bronze Age herders from the steppes of present-day Russia and Ukraine — emerged along the northern shores of the Black Sea. The findings are published on 5 February in Nature1,2.\n\n“I think they are truly groundbreaking,” says Kristian Kristiansen, an archaeologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. “This really solves two big unresolved questions.” The first is the origin of the Yamnaya.\n\nThe second was posed in the eighteenth century, when scholars noticed similarities between classical Greek and Latin and Sanskrit, an ancient language from South Asia, and suggested a common origin.\n\nNearly half the world’s population speaks at least one of the roughly 400 Indo–European languages. These include nearly all European and Central Asian languages, as well as those from South Asia and Iran.\n\n“This Indo–European story has been mystery for 200 years, and now step by step, we are coming closer to the solution,” says Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki.\n\n‘Tracer dye’\n\nFor decades, the leading theory for the ubiquity of Indo–European languages was that early farmers, living in a region known as Anatolia, which includes present-day Turkey, exported languages in the family as the agricultural revolution spread starting around 9,000 years ago.\n\nThe ‘Anatolian hypothesis’ took a blow in 2015, when two blockbuster ancient-genomics papers identified a migration of Yamnaya herders across Eurasia beginning 5,500 years ago3,4. This and subsequent work showing the arrival of ‘steppe’ ancestry in most places that Indo–European languages are spoken was ammunition for the ‘steppe hypothesis’ that Yamnaya were responsible for seeding Indo-European languages far and wide.\n\n“Yamnaya ancestry is like a tracer dye whose spread you can connect with Indo–European language spread,” says David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who co-led the latest studies.\n\nThe region around the Caucasus mountains, between Europe and Asia, was home to people who spoke the earliest Indo-European languages.Credit: Yuriy Pozdnikov/Alamy\n\nBut even with the genetic evidence, the steppe hypothesis had a major problem: how to explain the Anatolian branch of Indo–European — some scholars use the term Indo–Anatolian — which includes Hittite, a language used by a civilization that flourished in modern-day Turkey in the second millennium bc. Geneticists have failed to find Yamnaya ancestry in ancient Anatolian speakers.\n\nIn search of that connection, Reich and his colleagues hoped to identify the genetic origins of the Yamnaya. This has been a challenge because of the group’s rapid expansion of a nearly identical genetic signature. “It looks like a kind of cancer tumour, and you can’t say where the origin of the tumour is because it expanded so fast,” says Reich.\n\nTo overcome this, Reich and his colleagues, including scientists in Russia and Ukraine, generated genome data from 428 ancient individuals, including hundreds of Yamnaya people and individuals who predated them living across the steppe and further southeast along the Caucasus mountains.\n\nRoute to Anatolia\n\nThe approach identified a genetic signature in people living in a region between the Caucasus mountains and the lower Volga River to the north that connects the earliest Yamnaya and ancient Anatolians. Reich’s team found that the Yamnaya emerged when people with Caucasus-Lower Volga ancestry moved west around 6,000 years ago and mixed with a diverse group of hunter-gatherers living along the Black Sea. The same Caucasus-Lower Volga ancestry also appeared in ancient Anatolia around this time.\n\nBased on this evidence, the researchers think that the earliest Indo-European languages were spoken by people living in the Caucasus–Lower Volga, who then carried them to Anatolia and to the Black Sea steppe, where the Yamnaya and their descendants spread them still further.\n\nThe geneticists stress that migrations aren’t the only way languages transmit, and that their work provides a hypothesis for others to test. “This is a very good case for the solution to the Indo-European problem,” says Iosif Lazaridis, a Harvard population geneticist who co-led the studies. “But we can’t prove these people spoke Anatolian language because they’re not buried with tablets saying I’m an Anatolian speaker.”",

          "abstract": "Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which put a spotlight on US health disparities, led to increased domestic helicopter research in the country.Credit: Scott Hurd/Alamy\n\n‘Helicopter research’ doesn’t happen just when researchers from rich countries swoop in and exploit the resources of low-income ones — rich universities are increasingly taking advantage of poorer institutions in the same country, and often in the same neighbourhood.\n\nMarylin Fraser, the head of the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, a non-profit organization in New York City that focuses on community health and education, has experienced this at first hand. Several times a year, she says, researchers at prestigious US institutions come to her asking to recruit study participants from her community.\n\nFraser turns many away for neglecting to consider the community’s input or failing to recognize and compensate the work that the institution would contribute by facilitating collaboration. She now accepts only the proposals that share funding and project leadership with researchers at Arthur Ashe. It’s exhausting, says Fraser. “You feel as though you are always in a constant fight.”\n\nThis experience is not unique. Around the world, many resource-poor institutions that support marginalized communities, such as Indigenous peoples or Black and Latine groups, are courted by staff and researchers at nearby well-off institutions who lack the understanding to create equitable partnerships. “The issue is that a privileged person is taking advantage of a less-privileged one. It can be very patronizing,” says Adriana Romero-Olivares, a microbial ecologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.\n\nDescribed as ‘domestic helicopter research’ in Cell last year1, the term refers to a well-documented scenario in which scientists from wealthy countries conduct research in low- or middle-income countries with little to no involvement of local communities and researchers. The “helicopter” or “parachute” collaborators leave, taking data and expertise from local people instead of working to ensure that they are engaged with and benefit from the research.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nDomestic helicopter research — often focused on race, ethnicity or genetic ancestry — occurs when unequal partnerships form between researchers in the same country. It results in the “erosion of trust between researchers and the communities they aim to serve”, wrote Marcus Lambert, a public-health epidemiologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in New York City, and his co-authors in the Cell commentary. A major concern, he says, is that the practice seems to be on the rise in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nHarmful effects\n\nOne damaging aspect of domestic helicopter research is that it “saps funding” from poorer institutions, Lambert and his co-authors say. In the past three years, less than one-third of funding from the US National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities — a department that aims to address health challenges faced by minority racial and ethnic groups, rural populations and those with low socio-economic status — has gone to the poorer institutions that serve these communities.\n\nResearchers are also concerned that such work often doesn’t serve the people who were asked to participate, and can sometimes harm them.\n\nA 2020 paper led by Brandon Brown, a public-health researcher at the University of California, Riverside, describes a case study in which a community leader had agreed to work with a researcher from a US university on a survey about HIV and ageing2. The local leader was expected to recruit participants and pay for a space to conduct the survey. He then had to fight to get access to the resulting survey material, which he discovered contained stigmatizing and outdated terminology. He also found out that there were no plans to disseminate the data or results in a way that might help the participants or their wider community.\n\nWhen Brown presented the paper at a conference, he received criticism from some attendees for naming the researchers involved. “I responded that this is why it keeps happening — because it’s invisible,” he says.\n\nLambert and his colleagues say that the COVID-19 pandemic — which brought US health disparities into sharp focus — has led to an increase in domestic helicopter research across the country. Health-equity studies gained more funding as a result of the pandemic, and the recipients sought out more researchers and participants from poorer communities. This has led to surging cases of domestic helicopter research, the Cell commentary states.\n\nThere are no data on the incidence of domestic helicopter research worldwide, but Fernanda Adame, an environmental scientist at Griffith University in Nathan, Australia, says that it’s likely to be more common in countries that have large wealth disparities. “If you don’t address it, your research is not going to be as good, as you will have limited information and limited impact,” she adds. “If you didn’t speak to the people involved [in the research], they are less likely to use that information.”\n\nPositive changes",

          "abstract": "The headquarters of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.Credit: Getty\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has mandated that all scientific manuscripts produced by its researchers that are under review at a journal be withdrawn so that certain language relating to gender can be stripped from them.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe directive, sent by the agency’s chief science officer to some staff members on 31 January, is meant to bring the CDC into compliance with an executive order issued that month by US President Donald Trump seeking to restore “biological truth” to the federal government by recognizing only two sexes: male and female. Executive orders can direct agencies inside the federal government but cannot change existing laws.\n\nAccording to a copy of the e-mail, shared in the newsletter Inside Medicine, manuscripts must not include any mention of terms including ‘gender’, ‘transgender’, ‘pregnant person’, ‘transsexual’ or ‘non-binary’. CDC scientists who co-author papers originating from outside the agency that include these terms are also expected to rescind their authorship.\n\nIt’s unclear how many scientific reports will be affected by the mandate, which applies to all manuscripts written or co-authored by CDC researchers and includes papers that are being prepared for submission, in revisions with journal editors or have been accepted for publication but not yet posted online. It is also uncertain whether journals, which have their own rules for discussing gender and sex, will comply with the directive. Fields such as public health, which have embraced gender identity as an aspect of research in topics including health disparities, are likely to be affected the most by the rules.\n\n“This announcement is mind-boggling in its implications,” says Thomas Babor, an emeritus professor of public health at UConn Health in Farmington, Connecticut. “Because of the enormous impact the CDC has in the United States and globally, the instruction to remove mentions of ‘forbidden terms’ could stifle the usefulness of scientific research for years to come.”\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which is the parent agency to the CDC, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe importance of language\n\nGendered terms such as ‘man’, ‘woman’ and ‘non-binary’ have been widely embraced across scientific disciplines because, unlike terms related to biological sex (for example, male and female), they provide cultural, social and psychological context for a person’s lived experience.\n\n‘Never seen anything like this’: Trump’s team halts NIH meetings and travel\n\nThe CDC mandate, however, will erase mention of queer, intersex and transgender individuals from future literature and seems to legitimize “scientific sexism”, says James Mungin, a biomedical scientist at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, who identifies as transgender. Under the new rules, CDC researchers would be unable to share basic demographic data, such as gender identity or sexual orientation, about study participants — omissions that could lead to inaccuracies or ethical breaches if scientists are barred from disclosing why certain participants were removed from a study, Mungin says. Furthermore, gender identity and sexual orientation are nearly impossible to exclude when it comes to the study and treatment of conditions such as HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n“If you’re working in basic science, you might get away with just references to sex, but gender is everywhere in public health,” says Ayden Scheim, a social epidemiologist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who identifies as trans and studies the health care of marginalized communities. “Unfortunately, I see two things happening: a lot of these withdrawn papers will never be published” because collaborators outside the CDC aren’t going to agree to omit data, Scheim says, “and in the long term, a lot of research that focuses on health inequities for women or LGBTQ+ people will disappear”.",

          "authors": "Dean Falk",
          "abstract": "In November 1924 — on the day they were hosting a wedding at their Johannesburg home in South Africa — Australian anatomist and physician Raymond Dart and his wife Dora noticed two men staggering up the drive with two large boxes. According to Dart’s memoirs, written decades later1, Dora had bemoaned the fact that the fossils Dart had been expecting had arrived on this day “of all days”. She had begged him not to “go delving in all that rubble until the wedding [was] over and everybody [had] left”.\n\nThe boxes contained what would become one of the world’s most famous fossils, the Taung Child.\n\n100 years of Australopithecus\n\nIn just a few weeks — astonishingly — Dart was able to use this one individual to surmise the broad course of human evolution as we understand it today. Previous evidence for human ancestry made use of fossils that bore a closer resemblance to modern humans. Dart’s description was astounding because it was of a species that was more apelike than humanlike, a revelation that in turn suggested that humanity’s evolutionary path had originated in Africa.\n\nDart’s report of the fossilized skull and matching endocast — an internal cast of the braincase formed from sediments that had accumulated in it — was published2 in Nature on 7 February 1925. Both the discovery and Dart’s insights deserve to be celebrated. There were, however, things that Dart could not have known and details that he misconstrued. Today — a century on — the fossil is still prompting questions about human evolution.\n\nFresh finds\n\nIn his Nature paper, Dart argued that the Taung Child belonged to a previously unknown group of bipedal human ancestors that he called ‘man-apes’ or more formally, Australopithecus africanus, meaning southern ape from Africa.\n\nDart’s find was described in newspapers all over the world, and he became famous overnight. But it took decades and the discovery of more australopithecine fossils in South Africa before scientists began to accept his controversial ideas about human evolution. At the time, several fellows of the Royal Society of London thought that a specimen found in the village of Piltdown in East Sussex, UK, known as Piltdown Man (which was later exposed as a hoax), belonged to the oldest ancestor leading to modern humans.\n\nBut Dart’s ideas were eventually accepted. In fact, his announcement in 1925 nailed the big picture of hominin evolution as it is understood today. His claim that Taung belonged to a previously unrecognized group of early hominins that shared features of both humans and other living apes still holds. So does his inference that Taung was bipedal because of where the spinal cord entered the bottom of the skull. He also speculated correctly that the genus Homo arose from Australopithecus and that, as Charles Darwin had predicted3, the cradle of humanity was in Africa rather than in England or Asia.\n\nDart judged Taung to be a six-year-old child with a cranial capacity (a proxy for brain size) of 520 cubic centimetres4. He also estimated the fossil’s age to be about one million years. However, in the mid-1920s, few comparisons had been made of the development of humans and other apes after birth and during infancy and other life-history stages. Moreover, Dart did not have access to imaging technologies available today, which enable scientists to ‘see’ inside fossilized bones5, or to the techniques now used to date fossils.\n\nPalaeoanthropologist Phillip Tobias (right) points out a feature on Taung’s endocast to Ramond Dart (left) and the author (D.F.) in 1984.Credit: Dean Falk\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Taung’s age at death has been revised by researchers who study the evolution of growth and development in part by evaluating dental development and brain growth in an expanding record of fossil hominin juveniles6. We now know that Taung was around 3.8 years old when it died, with a brain of near-adult size and developmental maturity beyond that of a human of the same age6. (Some scientists think Taung was female because the best current estimate for its adult cranial capacity, around 405 cubic centimetres, is low for australopithecines, and female australopithecines had smaller braincases than males did7.) Another study indicates that Taung dates to about 2.58 million years ago, which is well within the range of 3.6 million to 2 million years ago for all of the Australopithecus specimens found in South Africa8.\n\nOut of Africa: celebrating 100 years of human-origins research\n\nThese are not trivial revisions. On the contrary, they raise important questions about when, why and how an unusual life-history stage — namely childhood — evolved and what other changes (such as in brain size) accompanied its emergence.\n\nMost ape infants can cling onto their mothers’ bodies actively by a few months after their birth, whereas human babies are slower to mature and remain dependent on their parents or carers for much longer. Indeed, most apes do not have a childhood — a period during which individuals who are weaned continue to be nurtured, mainly by their elders.\n\nIn her assessment of Taung’s baby teeth and first permanent molars, biological anthropologist B. Holly Smith concluded that Taung was maturing at the rate of a non-human ape and was well accustomed to solid foods, although it might still have received a low level of nursing. According to Smith, “Taung died at, or did not long survive, the transition to independent feeding, as a ‘weanling’.” It was not a “‘child’ in any scientific sense”6.\n\nHumans evolved for distance running — but ancestor ‘Lucy’ didn’t go far or fast\n\nThe revised estimates, suggesting an ape-like rate of development, indicate that — ironically — the Taung Child never had, and would never have had (even had it survived), a childhood6.\n\nChildhood is probably a crucial innovation in human evolution because it creates the opportunity for offspring to learn much more from their nurturing elders than would otherwise be possible. In fact, the emergence of a prolonged period of dependency or ‘helplessness’ in human ancestors is widely thought to have produced conditions conducive to cognitive evolution.\n\nAt first blush, it might seem puzzling that australopithecines matured at an apelike pace even though they were bipedal. But unlike later hominins, australopithecines spent much of their time in trees and, like other apes, probably slept there. They would have needed the faster-developing apelike anatomy to climb and move through trees. The apelike development of Taung and other australopithecines suggests that delayed growth and childhood emerged only after the descendants of australopithecines had begun to live fully on the ground and had lost numerous arboreal adaptations. As terrestrial bipedalism became more habitual, evolutionary tweaks that slowed down and elaborated the development of nervous, skeletal and muscular systems probably repurposed much of the anatomy that had been needed for arboreal locomotion.\n\nInto the unknown\n\nSmith and others have suggested that, rather than emerging in australopithecines, childhood probably evolved in Homo erectus — possibly along with increased body size, brain size and cognitive capacities. Meanwhile, some researchers have found that the rate of dental growth in an approximately 1.77-million-year-old Homo fossil from Dmanisi, Georgia, was relatively high9 — similar to the rate of dental growth found in Taung and living great apes6. In this specimen, however, the formation of the posterior teeth was delayed, as it is in modern humans. Because Dmanisi individuals had brains that were not much bigger than those of great apes or australopithecines, some have suggested that this delay might have been associated with the emergence of childhood before a large brain evolved9.",

But it also opens new questions about how changes in the core could affect the length of our 24-hour day, Earth’s magnetic field and more.\n\nHas Earth’s inner core stopped its strange spin?\n\n“After decades of research and debates, we are coming to an ever-clearer picture of the changing inner core,” says Xiaodong Song, a seismologist at Peking University in Beijing who was not involved in the work.\n\nResearchers made the discovery by analysing how seismic waves from earthquakes travelled from the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean to seismometers in Alaska and Canada, on the other side of the planet. The waveforms, or shapes, of some of the seismic signals changed between 2004 and 2008. Those shifts occurred because the waves briefly penetrated Earth’s inner core — which was changing shape, the scientists say.\n\n“For the first time we’re seeing that it’s deforming,” says John Vidale, a seismologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

          "authors": "Gretchen T. Goldman",
          "abstract": "When asked in 1787 whether the fledgling United States would be a monarchy or a republic, founding father Benjamin Franklin replied, “a republic, if you can keep it”. Today, the republic is composed of US federal agencies filled with scientists tasked with advancing the nation’s health, safety, security and competitiveness — through forecasting storms, preventing the spread of food-borne illnesses and making roads safer.\n\nUntil last month, when Donald Trump became US president, I was one of those scientists. I know what it means to take the oath of federal service and to take pride in being a public servant. And I know that there are several steps that the scientific community — both inside and outside the US government — should be prepared to take in the light of the second Trump presidency.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nI’ve spent much of my career tracking the use and misuse of science in policy decisions. In 2021, I was called up to the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, and in 2023, I became the climate-change research and technology director at the US Department of Transportation. The passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2021), the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) and the CHIPS and Science Act (2022) represented an opportunity for the nation to meet its greatest challenges, from clean energy to industrial innovation and artificial intelligence. I wanted to be a part of it.\n\nI wasn’t alone. Hundreds of technical specialists also said yes to government work, driving our nation’s responses to climate change, societal inequities and more. In the past few years, the United States has made remarkable progress, investing billions of dollars in projects across all the states.\n\nNow, the Trump administration has moved to undo that progress. Week-one executive orders have led to the furlough and firing of government staff who work in environmental justice and equity. Many people in these jobs will watch their hard-won work get dismantled before their eyes. An unlucky few will be tasked with dismantling it themselves. Others might choose to leave federal service.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nBut despair is not an option. It is important to remember that notable gains have been made in federal scientific-integrity protections in the past two decades. And, as recent years attest, many researchers are willing and able to engage in policy conversations through advocacy, public commentary and demonstrations (A. D. Ross et al. Sci. Commun. 40, 228–245; 2018).\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists and others have developed policies to strengthen scientific integrity, which have since been implemented by federal agencies and Congress. More than 20 agencies have executed or bolstered their scientific-integrity policies and hired specialists, covering hundreds of thousands of people across the federal workforce.\n\nAs a result, federal scientists now have more rights and protection from political interference than ever. For example, many can speak to the media about their science without approval from their supervisors, and can publicly note a differing scientific opinion for their work. Procedures for adjudicating allegations are being implemented.\n\nThese protections provide a solid foundation for the defence of science. Combined with a more scientific-integrity-savvy workforce, these put federal scientists on higher ground than was the case under earlier administrations.",

          "authors": "Giorgia Guglielmi",
          "abstract": "An ongoing trial of Zepbound (tirzepatide) is testing effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.Credit: Shelby Knowles/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAs appetite for blockbuster weight-loss drugs grows worldwide, scientists are developing the next crop of medications that, they hope, will improve the performance of these drugs and offer benefits beyond weight loss.\n\n“It’s going to be another year where, every week, there’s going to be something really cool,” says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nNew obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health\n\nDrug makers are building on the success of medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, helping to regulate blood-sugar levels and appetite.\n\nBut most of these medications are costly, require weekly injections and need to be taken long-term to prevent weight regain. These are some of the issues that companies hope alternative drugs will address.\n\nNature looks at the weight-loss medicines being tested in 2025 and what they have to offer.\n\nTirzepatide: cuts heart weight and surrounding fat\n\nTirzepatide — sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound and given by injection — mimics GLP-1 and another hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which is involved in fat metabolism. In trial results published in November, it helped participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight over 72 weeks and reduced the risk of diabetes, compared with a placebo. People taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lose up to 15% of their body weight. Participants who took tirzepatide also had a beneficial reduction in heart weight and in fat surrounding the heart, improved mobility and lower blood pressure and inflammation compared with people on a placebo.\n\nOne trial expected to conclude in 2025 is examining tirzepatide’s effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.\n\nRetatrutide: trial participants report major weight loss\n\nRetatrutide, which has not yet received regulatory approval for weight loss, activates receptors for GLP-1, GIP and glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Developed by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, it has shown even more promising results than tirzepatide and semaglutide, with trial participants losing an average of 24% of their body weight over 11 months. The drug also helped to reduce blood-sugar levels in people with diabetes, and it’s now being tested in phase III trials that are expected to conclude by 2026.\n\nAnti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis\n\nResearchers are excited about combination therapies such as retatrutide, says Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who notes that obesity’s complexity makes targeting multiple pathways the most promising approach.\n\nOrforglipron: oral drug shows promise\n\nOrforglipron, an oral small-molecule drug candidate also developed by Eli Lilly, showed similar results to GLP-1 injections in rodents, and led to a weight loss of about 10% over 26 weeks in people with obesity, improving blood pressure and levels of circulating fatty molecules. Like Ozempic, orforglipron is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but whereas Ozempic requires injection, orforglipron comes as a daily pill.\n\nLilly expects to complete phase III trials in 2025, and orforglipron could receive US regulatory approval in 2026, according to Lilly’s chief executive Dave Ricks.\n\n“The wild card is the oral small molecules,” says Randy Seeley, an obesity specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. Many companies are working on this approach, because pills might be more appealing and cost-effective than injections, but progress has been slower than expected owing to dosing challenges, he says. “If one of them finally breaks through, it has the ability to alter the landscape pretty considerably.”\n\nMariTide: weight-loss maintenance\n\nBiopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, is planning a phase III trial of its drug candidate MariTide, which activates GLP-1 receptors while reducing GIP’s activity. The medication can be taken monthly by injection and resulted in an average weight loss of up to 20% over 52 weeks, according to data released by the company.\n\nUnlike other treatments, MariTide has shown the ability to maintain weight loss for several months after the last dose. When people stop taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, they tend to regain weight quickly, but that doesn’t seem to happen with MariTide, which might encourage more people to have the treatment, says Seeley, who consults for and receives funding from Amgen and other companies developing obesity drugs.\n\nCagriSema: combination drug outperforms semaglutide",

          "abstract": "OpenAI’s chief executive Sam Altman announced the release of its ‘deep research’ tool.Credit: Franck Robichon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nTech giant OpenAI has unveiled a pay-for-access tool called ‘deep research’, which synthesizes information from dozens or hundreds of websites into a cited report several pages long. The tool follows a similar one from Google released in December and acts as a personal assistant, doing the equivalent of hours of work in tens of minutes.\n\nMany scientists who have tried it are impressed with its ability to write literature reviews or full review papers and even identify gaps in knowledge. Others are less enthusiastic. “If a human did this I would be like: this needs a lot of work,” says Kyle Kabasares, a data scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Moffett Field, California, in an online video review.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nThe firms are presenting the tools as a step towards AI ‘agents’ that can handle complex tasks. Observers say that OpenAI’s deep research tool, released on 2 February, is notable because it combines the improved reasoning skills of the o3 large language model (LLM) with the ability to search the Internet. Google says its Deep Research tool is, for now, based on Gemini 1.5 Pro, rather than on its leading reasoning model 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nReview writing\n\nMany users are impressed with both tools. Andrew White, a chemist and AI expert FutureHouse, a start-up in the San Francisco, California, says that Google’s product is “really leveraging Google’s advantages in search and compute” to get users up to speed on a topic quickly, while o3’s reasoning skills add sophistication to OpenAI’s reports.\n\nDerya Unutmaz, an immunologist at the Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, Connecticut, who has free access to ChatGPT Pro granted by OpenAI for medical research, says the OpenAI deep research reports are “extremely impressive”, “trustworthy” and as good or better than published review papers. “I think writing reviews is becoming obsolete.”\n\nWhite anticipates that AI systems like these could be used to update human-authored reviews. “Authoritative reviews cannot feasibly be updated [by humans] every 6 months.”.\n\nBut many caution that all LLM-based tools are sometimes inaccurate or misleading. OpenAI’s website admits that its tool “is still early and has limitations”: it can get citations wrong, hallucinate facts, fail to distinguish authoritative information from rumors and fail to convey its uncertainty accurately. The company expects the issues to improve with more usage and time. Google’s Deep Research has a disclaimer that simply reads “Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it”.\n\nHow China created AI model DeepSeek and shocked the world",

He remembered being diagnosed with an inoperable glioblastoma, and Peggy agreeing without hesitation to the his-n-hers cryogenics package — Find Your Future in the Future!\n\n“My wife’s cryopod —”\n\n“Yours was processed first. When you woke up, we had to suspend operations …”\n\nHayden lost track of what the man was saying because the movement of his lips didn’t match the words he heard, as if they were trapped in a poorly dubbed foreign film.\n\nSensing his confusion, the man motioned towards the cube on the table. “A language translator. It took us time to reconstruct a grammar for twenty-first-century English.

You freezer-boomers throw yourselves into cryopods because you’re riddled with cancer, degenerative heart failure and inflated self-importance, and then expect us to thaw you out and cure what ails you?”\n\n“Well …”\n\n“A suitable analogy: you buy a house in the suburbans. A year later the previous owner appears from the basement and expects to sleep in your bed and eat your tasty snacks.”\n\nThat didn’t seem a fair comparison to Hayden.\n\n“It’s taken 300 years to fix your generation’s mess. Only in the past decayed have we been able to go outside without respirators or prospective suits.”\n\nHayden didn’t like the man’s tone. As a simple small-claims lawyer, he didn’t have any influence or power over things like that.\n\n“Right, right. You were just an innocent sick man who was hoping to wake up in a brighter future after a cure for your cancer had been found.”\n\n“Has it?”\n\n“Have you been hearing? You have been charged with a serious crime —”\n\n“Crime?” Hayden sat up straight.\n\n“Yes. I’m your barista.”\n\n“My what?”\n\nThe man frowned as he reconsidered his words. “Your advocate in legal proceedings — your barista.”\n\n“You mean my barrister? My lawyer?”\n\n“That is what I said. You are charged with temporal trespass. As a society of laws, we held administrative proceedings, found all you freezer-boomers guilty, and were carrying out the down-powering sentence.

You face the termination penalty, but we hope you will consider — how do you put it — ‘policing an entreaty’.”\n\nStuck on the prospects of a ‘termination penalty’, Hayden struggled to keep up. “Are you offering a plea bargain?”\n\nWith a flourish, the man tapped the cube. The tabletop lit up, displaying a digital document. “The court is willing to accept a plea to disorderly conduct. That does not carry a termination penalty.”\n\n“Alive is good,” Hayden conceded.\n\n“The sentence is solitary incarceration for not fewer than 100 years and not to exceed your natural life. If you’ll just notate …” The man pointed to the bottom of the form.",

The discovery, published on 5 February in Nature1, contrasts with previous studies that have found crowds to move in more-chaotic ways.\n\n“I was like, what is this? Why 18 seconds?” says study co-author François Gu, referring to how often the circular motion repeated itself. The finding, which was the outcome of a computer analysis of video footage, was so puzzling that he spent more than a month double-checking the methods, says Gu, a physicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, France. He then realized that the swirling was clearly visible in videos of the event, once the footage was sped up.\n\nTracking of individual heads in this footage of the crowd reveals gradual circular movements.Credit: Bartolo lab, ENS de Lyon\nNo bull here\n\nThe Feast of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, is famous for its running of the bulls, in which participants put themselves in harm’s way as the angry animals are released into the city’s streets. But Gu and his collaborators focused instead on the opening of the festival, in which thousands of people gather in the Plaza Consistorial.\n\nGu and his colleagues set up cameras on balconies overlooking the plaza, and used computer models to analyse the videos. To understand the crowd’s behaviour, they modelled it as a dense continuum, akin to a fluid made up of particles (most previous studies have instead modelled crowds as made up of discrete, individual agents). They found that, as the area filled up in the morning, the crowd reached a critical density of around four people per square metre, beyond which it started — initially very slowly and almost imperceptibly — to form rotating vortices that pushed against one another, each involving hundreds of people.\n\nCrowd crush: Could fluid dynamics save lives?",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world.Credit: imageBROKER/Alamy\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) — one of the world’s largest private funders of basic biomedical research — has abruptly cancelled a US$60-million initiative aimed at boosting diversity in science at universities. It has also scrubbed mention of the programme from its website.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nIn doing so, the funder has terminated grants to 104 US universities approximately in the middle of a six-year funding cycle without any explanation. The move has unsettled many scientists, who are reeling after US President Donald Trump issued a stream of orders in the past few weeks targeting “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and funding across the country, saying that they diminish “the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society”. In the wake of these orders, US science agencies have ordered staff members to strip DEI mentions from government websites and are scrutinizing federal research grants that violate the decrees with an eye towards revising or cancelling them.\n\nThat such a massive private funder, which doesn’t receive federal funding, is cutting support at such a sensitive time “is so disappointing”, says Danielle Beckman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis. “Now is the time that we need private funders to fill the gap that the new administration has left” by threatening public science funding.\n\nAn HHMI spokesperson confirmed that the institution terminated the initiative, called Inclusive Excellence 3, on 5 February, adding that HHMI “remains committed to supporting outstanding scientists and talented students training to become scientists” through its other programmes. The spokesperson did not respond to Nature’s queries about why IE3 was cancelled, why HHMI deleted all its webpages referencing the programme or about scientists’ distress over the termination.\n\nA ‘safe haven’?\n\nWith a $24 billion endowment, HHMI is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world. Its prominent Investigators programme offers each of its awardees $11 million over a renewable seven-year term to conduct groundbreaking research.\n\nRNA biologist loses disability case against Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n\nIts IE3 initiative arranged its awardee universities into seven different ‘learning communities’ to encourage collaboration on projects. Each community of about 15 US institutions received nearly $9 million and was tasked with deciding how and where it wished to invest that money. For example, one of these communities was working to build more robust peer-mentoring programmes that would help to boost student outcomes.\n\nAlthough HHMI did not say why it ended IE3, Trump’s 21 January order on DEI might have played a role. In it, he calls for US agencies to encourage the private sector to end “illegal DEI discrimination”. He directed each agency, within four months, to produce a list of up to nine companies, non-profit organizations, “foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more” or other private institutions for possible civil-compliance investigations.\n\nTo understand the importance of IE3, Nature reached out to nine researchers listed as a principal investigator on one of the programme’s grants. Some did not respond, and the others either declined to comment or requested anonymity because they feared drawing attention to their university in the current political climate.\n\nIn the United States, “we know we have a problem retaining STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] students, especially with how COVID interrupted schooling”, and this money helped to bring institutions together to address the problem, says one of the researchers. “All the momentum we had built — gone.”\n\nThe decision has left scientists in a bind, because it appears that federal funding for research related in any way to diversity and inclusion will dry up after Trump’s crackdown. “There were rumours this would happen to federally funded grants, but many people thought that private foundations might be a safe haven from all that,” the same researcher says.\n\nThe fact that HHMI not only ended the programme but also wiped IE3 off its website was particularly disheartening, Beckman says. “It’s like it never existed.” Sometime in the past six months, HHMI also deleted a landing page where it stated its commitment to DEI and posted demographic data about its grantees and staff members.",

          "title": "Are the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Adrian Ward had been driving confidently around Austin, Texas, for nine years — until last November, when he started getting lost. Ward’s phone had been acting up, and Apple Maps had stopped working. Suddenly, Ward couldn’t even find his way to the home of a good friend, making him realize how much he’d relied on the technology in the past. “I just instinctively put on the map and do what it says,” he says.\n\nWard’s experience echoes a common complaint: that the Internet is undermining our memory. This fear has shown up in several surveys over the past few years, and even led one software firm to coin the term ‘digital amnesia’ for the experience of forgetting information because you know a digital device has stored it instead. Last year, Oxford University Press announced that its word of the year was ‘brain rot’ — the deterioration of someone’s mental state caused by consuming trivial online content.\n\n“What you’ll see out there is all kinds of dire predictions about digital amnesia, and ‘we’re gonna lose our memory because we don’t use it anymore’,” says Daniel Schacter, who studies memory at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAI hallucinations can’t be stopped — but these techniques can limit their damage\n\nIn fact, various studies paint a more complicated picture. Some do suggest that the Internet and digital technologies impair or otherwise alter performance on specific learning and memory tasks: people who use GPS devices to navigate seem worse at recalling routes, for instance. Ward, who is a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, has found that Googling information gives people an inflated sense of their own knowledge1. But there is no convincing evidence that the technology is having a broader detrimental effect on memory, researchers say. Claims, such as ‘Google is making us stupid’, are “overstatements”, says Elizabeth Marsh, a memory researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) is raising a host of questions. Large language models (LLMs) that power tools such as ChatGPT are rapidly being incorporated into search engines and other software, which means they are becoming part of everyday experiences for most people. And they could affect learning and memory in more profound ways than conventional Internet searching. “This whole ChatGPT thing is another level of technology that’s really different from just typing into a Google browser, ‘What’s the capital of Madagascar?’” says Marsh.\n\nResearchers have suggested, for example, that chatbots and other AI tools could make people cognitively lazy and even seed their minds with realistic false memories. Already, generative AI is being used to create ‘deadbots’ — digital avatars of dead people, who can say things that the living person never said. “It’s kind of reassembling a past that we never experienced,” says Andrew Hoskins, who studies AI and memory at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nThe Google effect\n\nPeople have been using technology to aid their memories for centuries — from the printing press to photographs and video cameras. But the idea that the Internet is eroding human memory gained ground after a 2011 study2 by psychologist Betsy Sparrow, who was then at Columbia University in New York City, and others. In the first of a series of experiments, they reported that people presented with difficult questions instinctively thought about the Internet and computers, as if they were itching to search for answers.\n\nIn other tests, participants seemed to be worse at remembering trivia statements they’d typed into a computer if they’d been told that the machine would save, rather than erase, their notes. They often remembered the folder they’d saved facts in better than the information itself. The study popularized the idea of a ‘Google effect’ — that people are using the Internet as an external memory bank and therefore weakening their own.\n\nBut some researchers later questioned the reliability of these results. A study3 in 2018 failed to replicate the first experiment in Sparrow’s 2011 study — differences that Sparrow argued could be explained4. Then, a second attempt to replicate the same experiment also failed to mirror the original results5. “‘Google effects’ are plausible and have garnered significant attention,” says Guido Hesselmann, a psychologist at the Berlin Psychological University who did the second replication attempt. But he adds that “a higher standard should be applied when researching these ideas”.\n\nStudies have shown that people remember a route less well after using GPS to navigate it.Credit: Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty\n\nWard was a PhD student with one of Sparrow’s co-authors, Daniel Wegner at Harvard University, and remains convinced by the 2011 study. The results fit with a widely accepted concept6 called transactive memory that Wegner proposed in the 1980s. This says that people lessen the burden of remembering information by sharing it with others — a spouse or colleague, for example.\n\nWhen the other party in the transaction is the Internet, however, we’re potentially relieved of having to know much at all. “Why put it in my head, when I have a smartphone in my pocket and sometimes searching Google is faster than searching your own mind?” Ward says. This is a form of ‘cognitive offloading’, in which people use anything from lists to calendars to phones to lessen the demands on their brains.\n\nSome of the strongest data to support cognitive offloading, says Carey Morewedge, who studies decision-making at Boston University, Massachusetts, are from a 2010 study of GPS navigation7. Participants in a driving simulator travelled a route either with or without the assistance of GPS. Then they were asked to drive the same route from memory. Those who had used GPS were as bad at navigating as people who’d never travelled the route at all.\n\nA later study8 of virtual navigation skills suggested that the spatial memory of people who used GPS extensively deteriorated faster than that of those who used it less. In a similar vein, a few studies have suggested that taking photos can reduce memories of the photographed objects — at least in certain situations.\n\nWhat’s so special about the human brain? A graphical guide\n\nCognitive offloading makes adaptive sense, researchers say, because it frees up limited brain bandwidth to attend to other business. A study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, demonstrated this effect. They asked students to study a document of words, and then randomly assigned some to save it. Those who saved the first file were better able to memorize words in a second file9.\n\nOther studies support the idea that people rely on the Internet as a surrogate memory — so much so, that they confuse it with their own. In Ward’s study1, he asked people to answer a series of trivia questions using Google or on their own. Those who used Google later rated themselves as having more confidence in their own memory, on average, than those who didn’t use the search engine. Searching for answers, it seemed, didn’t remind them of their ignorance; it made them think that the online knowledge had been theirs all along.\n\n“I think less of our knowledge is internal and more of it is stored externally — and we’re accessing it and feeling like it’s our own,” Ward says.\n\nMarsh says this false confidence inspired by searching “might be one reason that you’re so surprised if you later can’t remember something”. Her experiments10 suggest the phenomenon might stem from search results that are displayed as a list of web links with a snippet of information about the page. Glimpsing these previews and then selecting a page creates a feeling of familiarity with the page’s content — a form of what psychologists call ‘priming’ — even before reading it. This effect might lead people to overestimate their own knowledge. Researchers don’t yet know whether these types of misconception could worsen now that search engines provide AI-generated summaries at the top of search results.\n\nInformation overload\n\nSchacter, who reviewed11 studies on technology use and memory in 2022, says that, taken together, there is convincing research from studies so far that the Internet and technology can affect memory performance for specific tasks, such as remembering a route or a photographed item.",

          "authors": "Emily Sohn",
          "abstract": "Credit: Iryna Veklich/Getty\n\nRelationships are central to the human experience. Over the course of a lifetime, most of us have, want, lose or think about them. But the study of romance, dating and relationships is not as romantic as it might sound. People are complicated; couples even more so. Funding is scarce, statistics are tricky and media reports tend to oversimplify findings with the unrealistic goal of providing clear advice for people who want to find a love match.\n\n“We’re doing research that we know touches the hearts of so many people from so many walks of life,” says evolutionary biologist Justin Garcia, executive director of Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, which was established in 1947 to research issues around sexuality, gender and reproduction. “Whether that’s marriage, infidelity or romantic, sexual and relationship satisfaction, we can be talking about some of the most exciting and rewarding aspects of someone’s life and some of the most challenging and difficult ones. The power of romantic bonds across time and place is a great human unifier,” he says. Garcia’s latest research straddles the oddly separate worlds of relationship research and sex research, and includes work on consensual non-monogamy and distinctions between social and sexual monogamy.\n\nNature spoke to four scientists who study relationships, including Garcia. They shared what they love about studying love, what obstacles they face in the process — and how they navigate their own romantic lives.\n\nKENNETH TAN: Studying love across cultures\n\nPsychologist at Singapore Management University.\n\nI started becoming interested in thinking about relationships when I was doing my military service in Singapore. I enlisted at the age of 19, completed my service and started university at 21. It was a time when many young guys had relationship issues; their partners left them for other folks in university while we were away in the army. I gave a lot of advice and shared a lot of similar stories with my friends. We spent many late nights just talking.\n\nA decade of love: mapping the landscape of romantic love research through bibliometric analysi\n\nEarly in my career, I went abroad to the United States to do a three-month training programme, which exposed me to the scientific study of close relationships. I had a partner at the time, and was thinking, ‘How do people navigate long-distance relationships?’ In Singapore, it’s something that you never think about because it’s a small country, so there is no travelling for three hours to see someone. It was a new experience for me and made me wonder how people maintain relationships. A big focus of my work has been understanding commitment.\n\nI get questions from students and the public seeking personal advice about red flags, and how to get into — and out of — relationships and what to look for in a potential partner. They ask, ‘How many dates should I go on? Do I give this person a chance?’ It’s empowering to be asked, but it’s also challenging because you don’t want to give people the wrong answers. I try to tell students, ‘On average, this is what the work has shown, but everyone is different.’\n\nWhen we’re trying to publish our work in US and international journals, we get pushback if we only have a sample from Singapore. We’re often asked to show similarities and differences with other cultures, regardless of whether we have any hypothesis on whether they’re different. On the one hand, it makes you think, ‘They’re not requesting that for US samples, so why do they want it for an Asian sample?’ But on the other hand, I think that ultimately, having that diversity and collecting data from multiple places enriches the science.\n\nCome mate with me\n\nThe cross-cultural work is still fresh, and there’s a lot more discovery waiting to happen. These are exciting times to be researching relationships and singlehood. Currently, I’m just one of two researchers studying the psychology of relationships in Singapore. I think that there are two or three others in southeast Asia. I spent six years in the United States, and I definitely miss the huge research network there. One of my goals is to build up the field in Singapore. As the work grows, hopefully the media will include an empirical angle in stories as well.\n\nOne thing about commitment is that you start to think of your own relationship as special. A lot of times, when I tell my wife during an argument, ‘Oh, this is what the science says about relationships, and this might be happening to us,’ she’ll say things such as, ‘We’re beyond the science. We’re not your science.’\n\nJUSTIN GARCIA: People tell me things\n\nEvolutionary biologist and executive director of the Kinsey Institute, Bloomington, at Indiana University and scientific adviser to Match.com.\n\nMy interests have always been in the evolution of monogamy. I’m part sex researcher, part relationship researcher. I go back and forth between these two worlds, and people are often surprised to hear that they’re separate fields. In the human sciences, you’ll hear people talking about social monogamy, also called pair bonding, as a relationship structure. It’s different from sexual monogamy, which is fidelity or sexual exclusivity. My colleagues and I had a whole section in a recent paper about distinctions between social and sexual monogamy.\n\nIt can be hard to get funding to study people’s romantic and sexual lives. The federal agencies are often worried about the word ‘sex’ in the title or the abstract of a paper. A lot of relationship scientists also don’t use the word ‘love’ in their studies. In the 1970s, a US senator criticized relationship and sex research as absurd government spending. That is very much a part of the history of these fields.\n\nI came to the Kinsey Institute as a postdoc in 2011, and I have been scientific adviser to Match.com, the online dating service based in Dallas, Texas, since 2010. The late anthropologist Helen Fisher and I started a project with the company, called Singles in America. It’s an annual scientific study of more than 5,000 single people. We use a demographically representative sample to understand the attitudes and behaviours of more than 100 million single people — about one-third of the adult population in the United States. These are people who are moving in and out of romantic and sexual relationships at all stages of life. We’ve published a lot from that project over the years. The company doesn’t control what we publish, and its funding means that we avoid the challenge of getting federal grants. It has been a really rewarding collaboration.\n\nJustin Garcia at an event with American-German sex therapist ‘Dr Ruth’, Ruth Westheimer.Credit: Kinsey Institute Library & Special Collections.\n\nI’ll never forget the time that one of my senior colleagues on campus invited me for a coffee. She was a distinguished faculty member, and I thought, ‘Oh this is great, maybe it’s some kind of collaboration.’ I got there, and within two minutes, she took out her phone, turned it to face me and said, “Can you help me with my dating profile?”\n\nOne of the mistakes that she was making, and this happens a lot, was just thinking about what she was searching for. But courtship is about both searching and being found. You need a profile that someone can ask questions about, that they can engage with, that gives potential dates an opportunity to get to know you. So, they can say, ‘Oh, is that a picture of you hiking at Machu Picchu? I’ve always wanted to go there.’\n\nPeople have told me about challenges in their relationships. I often remind them that I’m not a sex or couples therapist. I’ve been asked, ‘Don’t you get exhausted? You’re at a cocktail party and you’ve heard about everyone’s marital issues.’ But I take it as an honour that someone is willing to share an intimate piece of their life with me. And I think — what can we learn from it?\n\nThe fun of the work is that it’s interdisciplinary. It’s about the body, our brains, how we communicate, where we live, our development. I think that knowing more about ourselves makes us appreciate our relationships and the power of love even more. The challenge is that everyone has opinions about what you’re asking and concluding. They want to know, ‘How could you say that, because that’s not what happened to my cousin Billy and his divorce?’\n\nSARAH STANTON: Steer clear of the love languages\n\nSocial psychologist and relationship researcher at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nI study romantic relationships and how to make them better. I also investigate how to improve relationship experiences for people who struggle with them, either because they’re uncomfortable with intimacy or because their worries get in the way of them enjoying those connections. And I explore how relationships affect short- and long-term health and well-being.\n\nLove: Neuroscience reveals all\n\nSometimes, the gap between the science and what’s written about it for the public is wide; findings often get misrepresented or overly simplified. People want to mention the five love languages as if they’re the solution to all relationship issues. The 5 Love Languages is a book first published in 1992 that assumes that each person has a preferred love language and that couples are more satisfied when partners speak one another’s preferred language. It’s such a bugbear of mine, because love languages are not formally based in science. They’re just some guy’s opinions. I am constantly being asked about them. Now I don’t even wait for it to be a question in my undergraduate classes. In lecture one, I say: “Disabuse yourself of this notion.”",

          "title": "Can this revolutionary plastics-recycling plant help solve the pollution crisis?",
          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "The world is miserable at recycling plastics. Currently, just 10–15% of the plastic waste we generate annually is recycled — with the rest incinerated, buried in landfill or dumped as litter1,2.\n\nA big part of the problem is that much of the waste is a dirty jumble of different plastics contaminated with food, inks and labels. It’s expensive to clean and sort this mess into streams of single-polymer, uncontaminated plastic — the kind that is generally needed for conventional ‘mechanical’ recycling, in which plastic is shredded, melted and re-formed into pellets, ready for new products.\n\nThat explains the excitement around a chemical plant that will start commercial operations this year in northeast England. In principle, it can take any kind of plastic waste, including mixed plastics deemed ‘unrecyclable’, and break it down into chemicals that are similar to those extracted from crude oil. With further processing, these chemicals can be turned back into fresh plastic. If successful, it could be a powerful example of a circular manufacturing process — in which plastic is used and reprocessed over and over again — potentially curbing the world’s dependence on fossil resources to make virgin plastics.\n\nHow to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work\n\nThe facility, near Redcar, uses a variation on a concept called chemical recycling, which breaks plastics apart into smaller chemical building blocks. Its main rival in this approach is pyrolysis: heating plastics to temperatures above 450 °C in a reactor without oxygen. But pyrolysis is energy-intensive and inefficient, with much of the plastic being turned into useless sooty char.\n\nBy contrast, the new plant uses water at high temperatures and pressures to break down plastic waste more gently and cleanly. Mura Technology, the London-based company behind the facility, says it is the first commercial-scale plant in the world to recycle plastic in this way. There’s a lot riding on its success — if it all works and runs profitably, it could trigger the launch of many more of these plants around the world.\n\nMura has declared the technology to be “revolutionary” because it “has the potential to help eliminate plastic waste, recycling all types of plastic to create a true circular economy”. Mura says that its process has lower carbon dioxide emissions and a higher tolerance for contaminated waste than does pyrolysis. It also emits roughly 80% less CO2 than burning the plastic in an incinerator to generate energy — a common way of dealing with waste.\n\nIf that makes it sound like a panacea for plastics recycling, think again. In practice, as Mura explains, the plant is currently picky about its diet of plastic waste, which must be shredded and sorted in ways similar to those used for mechanical recycling. And because, as with pyrolysis plants, not all of the facility’s products will be reborn as plastic, some critics say that the process shouldn’t count as recycling — an accusation that Mura rejects.\n\nThese practicalities raise questions about the future of plastics pollution and whether chemical recycling can live up to its promised potential. The idea is not a dud — but the real-life complications around the process make it less revolutionary than claimed.\n\nPlastic world\n\nPlastics pollution is a serious and growing problem. Recycling technologies already struggle to cope with today’s waste, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects1 plastic-waste production to balloon to more than one billion tonnes per year by 2060 (see ‘Where plastic waste goes’).\n\nSource: OECD\n\nMechanical recycling is the most common recycling route. Although the process often yields a material that is a little weaker than virgin plastic, it works well enough for pure streams of some plastics, such as the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in drinks bottles.\n\nBut other forms of plastic waste are much more challenging. Take flexible packaging and films, for example, a category that includes detritus such as grocery bags, bubble wrap and snack wrappers. These are typically made from various forms of polyethylene and polypropylene, part of a broad class of polymers called polyolefins, which make up two-thirds of all post-consumer plastic waste (see ‘Types of plastic’).\n\nSource: Plastics Europe\n\nThese materials might be combinations of several plastics — a pain to recycle. It can be extremely difficult to tease apart mixed plastics. If they are recycled, they often result in low-quality materials that might be suitable only for making rubbish bags, offering recyclers little financial incentive to accept such waste streams.\n\nThis is just one reason why about 40% of plastic waste is put in landfill instead, with another 25% incinerated for energy recovery. About 15% is abandoned as litter2.\n\nIt also helps to explain the surging enthusiasm for chemical recycling. Many researchers, companies and policymakers think that this approach could extract more value from tricky plastic waste and thus provide an incentive for recycling3.\n\nThe current most-used chemical recycling methods, according to data from market-intelligence company IDTechEx in Cambridge, UK, involve unpicking a plastic’s polymer chains to recover the constituent chemical building blocks, or monomers. This can be done with solvents or enzymes; IDTechEx terms the general approach ‘depolymerization’. However, these are expensive processes that have been commercialized for only a handful of plastics that have already been separated from other plastic waste.\n\nBy the end of this year, IDTechEx expects depolymerization to be overtaken by pyrolysis, a blunter method. Pyrolysis does not break plastic down into its monomers — instead, it produces a soup of hydrocarbons called pyrolysis oil, similar to crude oil. Some components of this oil then go through more petrochemical processing to generate specific plastic-feedstock chemicals such as ethene and propene, the most common monomers of polyolefins.\n\nThere are roughly 50 pyrolysis plants around the world, most in the European Union and the United States, with a combined processing capacity of about 266,000 tonnes per year, according to IDTechEx. That’s a tiny fraction of the plastic waste generated in these regions. However, many more pyrolysis plants are expected to come online by the end of this year.\n\nA plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time\n\nBut pyrolysis has a number of problems. First, some of the oil it produces is turned into fuel or other chemicals, rather than going to make new plastic, so that portion doesn’t help to reduce the amount of new plastic produced. Critics such as the Brussels-based campaign group Zero Waste Europe (ZWE) say that the approach should therefore be termed ‘chemical recovery’, rather than true chemical recycling of plastic (see go.nature.com/4hjfk7z).\n\nSecond, it’s an inefficient process. Up to 20% of the carbon from the input plastic becomes an unwanted sooty by-product called char, some is lost as CO2, and the pyrolysis oil can contain contaminants that must be removed before further use4.\n\nThird, despite their reputation for being able to feed on many kinds of mixed plastic, in practice, pyrolysis plants take in polyolefin plastic waste — and relatively clean waste at that. The reason is that this kind of waste yields a more commercially saleable pyrolysis oil that is relatively simple to drop into existing petrochemical processes, says James Kennedy, a technology analyst at IDTechEx. Different plastics, such as PET, could be pyrolysed — but they’d introduce oxygen atoms that would carry through to the pyrolysis-oil product and would have to be removed later. Meanwhile, dirtier waste tends to produce dirtier pyrolysis oil, which also has to be cleaned. To avoid that expense, pyrolysis plants still sort and clean plastics beforehand, often with the same pre-treatment steps used at mechanical recycling facilities, says Corinne Scown, a sustainability researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Consequently, manufacturing plastic in this way costs more than mechanical recycling, and more than making virgin plastic from fossil oil.\n\nChemical recycling, but better?\n\nThat’s where Mura’s technology comes in. The method is known as hydrothermal liquefaction, but the secret sauce inside Mura’s stainless-steel reactor is not merely hot water. The process operates at more than 400 °C and 220 atmospheres of pressure, which means that the water is in a supercritical state — it can behave like both a liquid and a gas, dissolving oily polymer molecules and chopping them into pieces. “On the face of it, it’s quite promising. I think that there’s a lot of excitement. I’ve been to quite a few conferences where everyone’s talking about it,” says Kennedy.\n\nJust like pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction uses heat to break the strong carbon–carbon bonds that hold polymer chains together. This produces molecular fragments with an unpaired electron on each of the sundered carbons, called carbon radicals. During pyrolysis, these reactive radicals zoom around like a frenzied swarm of cannibalistic piranhas, tearing each other into smaller pieces. But in Mura’s hydrothermal process, the molten polymer is dispersed more evenly through supercritical water. This makes heat transfer more efficient, and ensures that the carbon radicals tend to sate their hunger for other atoms by plucking hydrogen from surrounding water molecules, forming more-stable hydrocarbons and avoiding char formation5.\n\nA new plastics recycling plant near Redcar, UK, which owners Mura say will start operating in 2025.Credit: Kim Walker/Mura Technology\n\nSupercritical fluids are already used in a wide variety of industrial processes, from purifying pharmaceuticals to decaffeinating coffee. Other companies are using hydrothermal liquefaction to convert biomass into fuels and to recycle cotton–polyester textiles.\n\nBut Mura says that this is the first time supercritical water has been applied to commercial-scale processing of waste plastic. For now, it doesn’t have much competition, although plenty of researchers are studying supercritical liquids to break down various polymers6.\n\nMura says that its process generates an output that is similar to pyrolysis oil, but with lower CO2 emissions, higher efficiency and a somewhat greater tolerance for contamination. Overall, Mura predicts that this will give its process an edge over pyrolysis, and thus boost recycling of mixed waste. “If this process is more tolerant to contamination, then that could put it at an advantage,” says Scown.\n\nBlack gold\n\nMura’s technology has been brewing for a long time. It originated with Thomas Maschmeyer, a chemist now at the University of Sydney in Australia. In the 1990s, when he was at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, a company sought his advice about using supercritical liquids to process municipal waste. Although the process didn’t thrive, the concept stuck in his mind.\n\nYears later, in Australia, he and fellow chemist Len Humphreys designed a reactor that used supercritical water to transform waste biomass such as wood chippings and agricultural residues. The pair set up a company called Licella to develop that process, called catalytic hydrothermal reactor or Cat-HTR. Along with supercritical water, Cat-HTR can use catalysts to help remove oxygen atoms from woody polymers such as cellulose, producing an oily output7. In collaboration with Canadian forestry company Canfor, Licella has just finished building a facility in Prince George, Canada, that will turn forest waste into aviation fuel.\n\nIn 2016, an investor in Licella, Steve Mahon, suggested that researchers try feeding the reactor with waste plastic. The process worked — even without catalysts — and Mahon and Licella formed Mura to commercialize it as hydrothermal plastic recycling technology (Hydro-PRT). Mahon, now Mura’s chief executive, says that the process has evolved a lot since those early trials; much of the funding for development has come from petrochemical giants such as the multinational Dow, and the US technology and engineering company KBR. “Turning something that was a lab curiosity into an industrial process has been what we’ve spent the best part of US$200 million and seven or eight years doing,” he says.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes for Mura’s reactor to turn a batch of plastic into the desired blend of hydrocarbon products, unlike pyrolysis, which can take many hours. After depressurization, these hydrocarbons are separated from the water and then distilled into four products: naphtha, two kinds of ‘gas oil’ and a ‘heavy residual oil’ (see ‘How to recycle plastics with superheated water’). Most of the contaminants from the plastic remain in the water — unlike in pyrolysis — which means that the reactor can tackle dirtier waste without defiling its products.\n\nSource: Mura Technology\n\nThe heavy residual oil can be used as an additive for asphalt. Naphtha and distillate gas oil are sent to Dow, which uses huge chemical reactors called steam crackers to convert the material into various products, including ethene and propene, the building blocks of new polymers. And the remainder goes to a Finnish plant, operated by oil-refining company Neste, where it goes through further refining to make various chemicals.\n\nJust as with pyrolysis, critics such as ZWE complain that some of the plant’s output won’t be reborn as recycled plastic. And even the naphtha that goes into Dow’s steam crackers is mixed with fossil-fuel-derived naphtha before its products go to make fresh plastic. Scown points out that the supply of recycled naphtha is tiny compared with the amount of fossil naphtha processed by petrochemical plants, so that kind of mixing is inevitable to use the recycled material in existing refineries.\n\n“From the outside, it looks like we are working towards more circularity. In reality, we are locking ourselves into keeping on using virgin plastic,” says Lauriane Veillard, a chemical-recycling policy officer at ZWE. Mura rejects ZWE’s argument that its process should be termed ‘chemical recovery’. It says that ‘chemical recycling’ refers to processes that break down waste into raw materials, which might then be used to make not only new plastics, but also other products.\n\nAlthough Hydro-PRT can chew up pretty much any kind of plastic, in practice, its diet will be restricted to waste that yields the hydrocarbon products that its customers want. “We’ve concentrated on polyolefins, because we get the best-quality product for a steam cracker,” says Mahon. This also means that Mura will use many of the same shredding and sorting steps used by pyrolysis plants and mechanical recyclers to tidy up its plastic feedstock.\n\nStill, the company insists that it will only reprocess plastic waste that has already been rejected during mechanical recycling, and would otherwise be destined for incineration or landfill. There’ll be plenty of that waste available for the facility, because a UK law requires all local authorities to collect plastic films and flexible packaging from households for recycling from April 2027.\n\nEnvironmental questions\n\nIs all this good for the environment? Stuart Coles, a sustainability researcher in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) at the University of Warwick, UK, has carried out an independent life-cycle analysis (LCA) of Mura’s process, in a study funded by the government body Innovate UK8.\n\nIt found that Hydro-PRT emitted a little under half a tonne of CO2 per tonne of waste plastic. Much of that comes from the electricity used for separating and sorting the plastic waste, along with some electrical heating, so the emissions should decline as the UK electricity grid gets greener.\n\nThe emissions are much lower than incineration for energy recovery, which belches about 2.3 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of plastic, and they are less than half of the emissions associated with refining fossil oil to create virgin naphtha. But Hydro-PRT’s CO2 output is only slightly lower than the emissions from pyrolysis plants calculated by other studies, and actually a little higher than for mechanical recycling .\n\n“The overriding takeaway is that if you can mechanically recycle your material, then do that. If you can’t mechanically recycle it, then chemically recycle it in the way that is most appropriate for that material,” says Coles.",

The results are described in a preprint on the arXiv1.\n\n“I imagine it won’t be long before computers are getting full marks on the IMO,” says Kevin Buzzard, a mathematician at Imperial College London.\n\nSolving problems in Euclidean geometry is one of the four topics covered in IMO problems — the others cover the branches of number theory, algebra and combinatorics. Geometry demands specific skills of an AI, because competitors must provide a rigorous proof for a statement about geometric objects on the plane. In July, AlphaGeometry2 made its public debut alongside a newly unveiled system, AlphaProof, which DeepMind developed for solving the non-geometry questions in the IMO problem sets.\n\nMathematical language\n\nAlphaGeometry is a combination of components that include a specialized language model and a ‘neuro-symbolic’ system — one that does not train by learning from data like a neural network but has abstract reasoning coded in by humans. The team trained the language model to speak a formal mathematical language, which makes it possible to automatically check its output for logical rigour — and to weed out the ‘hallucinations’, the incoherent or false statements that AI chatbots are prone to making.\n\nFor AlphaGeometry2, the team made several improvements, including the integration of Google’s state-of-the-art large language model, Gemini. The team also introduced the ability to reason by moving geometric objects around the plane — such as moving a point along a line to change the height of a triangle — and solving linear equations.\n\nThe International Mathematical Olympiad is a prestigious annual competition for gifted school students.Credit: Valerie Kuypers/AFP via Getty\n\nThe system was able to solve 84% of all geometry problems given in IMOs in the past 25 years, compared with 54% for the first AlphaGeometry. (Teams in India and China used different approaches last year to achieve gold-medal-level performance in geometry, but on a smaller subset of IMO geometry problems2,3.)\n\nThe authors of the DeepMind paper write that future improvements of AlphaGeometry will include dealing with maths problems that involve inequalities and non-linear equations, which will be required to to “fully solve geometry”.",

          "abstract": "Surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston transplanted a modified pig kidney into a living person for the first time in 2024.Credit: Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nThe first clinical trial testing whether pig kidneys can be safely transplanted into living people has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of the trial, which will begin later this year, kidneys from genetically modified pigs will be transplanted into people with chronic kidney disease whose organs no longer function independently.\n\nWill pigs solve the organ crisis? The future of animal-to-human transplants\n\nThe FDA’s green light will bring the experimental procedure a step closer to one day supplying organs to the thousands of people who are waiting for a donor organ. “The start of formal clinical trials is very exciting,” says Jay Fishman, a specialist in transplant infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nAbout half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs — kidneys, hearts, liver and a thymus — but the surgeries were approved on compassionate grounds, meaning the patients were very sick and had no other options. Most recipients did not survive beyond a few months after the transplants for various reasons, including that they were too sick to cope with major surgery.\n\n“The humans who have received xenotransplants have made a tremendous contribution to our field,” Fishman says. But formal clinical trials are standardized, and can therefore produce important information, including crucial safety and efficacy data, to move the field forwards, he says.\n\nFirst trial\n\nSix individuals will initially be enrolled in the trial, according to United Therapeutics, the biotechnology firm, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, that is running the trial. The trial will include people with end-stage kidney disease, aged 55–70 years old, who are not eligible for conventional kidney transplantation for medical reasons or are not likely to get one in the next five years and will possibly die waiting. Patients will be closely monitored for about six months for serious adverse events, infectious diseases and signs of kidney damage, and then followed up with for the rest of their lives.\n\nFirst pig kidney transplant in a person: what it means for the future\n\nThe trial will assess efficacy by tracking how many participants — and transplanted kidneys — survive the procedure, and for how long. It will also measure how well the kidneys filter blood and will track changes in the participants’ quality of life.\n\nThe FDA has mandated pauses between patients to make sure there are no surprises, Fishman says. A monitoring committee will review safety and efficacy data for the first 6 participants, before deciding whether the trial should be expanded to up to 50 individuals.\n\nTrials will enable researchers to select people who are in better health than those first compassionate-use recipients to assess the transplant’s safety and efficacy, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.\n\nThe success of this trial will pave the way for longer-term, larger clinical trials, says Wayne Hawthorne, a transplant surgeon at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nMohiuddin, who in 2022 led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person, says he is in the process of submitting a request to the FDA to start clinical trials, but adds that the heart is a more difficult organ to get approval for.\n\nAnother company, eGenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has also submitted a request to the FDA to launch a xenotransplant trial, says Fishman, who has advised both United Therapeutics and eGenesis on microbiology safety, and would be involved in an eGenesis trial should it be approved. In an e-mailed statement, eGenesis said that in December, it had received FDA approval to conduct three pig-kidney transplants under compassionate use. The company did not comment on the status of its clinical-trial application.\n\nModified pigs",

          "abstract": "Credit: Monty Rakusen/Getty\n\nLast Thursday, 30 January, bioinformatician Niema Moshiri received a late-night message from a long-time collaborator urging him to back up the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the time, rumours had been circulating that the public-health agency, which tracks disease outbreaks and makes its data publicly available, would start removing pages from its website, in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump directing government departments to take down public information on gender and diversity.\n\nMoshiri, who is based at the University of California, San Diego, and is a self-described “data hoarder” who creates backups of his personal videos and online receipts and bills, was happy to help. “I never thought I would have to do it for information pages from the federal government,” he says.\n\nIn the past week, some US federal government websites containing important data sets and information on public health and demographics have been taken down, including those for global programmes to combat HIV and national surveys of chronic disease. Some have been reinstated; others not. “It was kind of shocking to me that they would just delete pages willy-nilly,” says Moshiri.\n\nMoshiri is one of dozens of researchers in the United States and globally who are scrambling to capture public information on US federal government websites before it is tampered with or disappears. “A lot of people did similar parallel efforts, especially within their own areas of expertise,” says virologist Angela Rasmussen, who is based at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, and was the collaborator who messaged Moshiri. She stayed up till 2 a.m. last Friday manually downloading data sets, such as on influenza surveillance. Having created these backups, researchers are now working out how to make them publicly available, she adds.\n\nThe CDC and its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, say that all changes to their websites are in accordance with Trump’s executive orders.\n\nGlobal effort\n\nOver the weekend, Moshiri got in touch with Charles Gaba, a health-care policy and data analyst based near Detroit, Michigan.\n\nMoshiri helped Gaba to create an alphabetical list of every CDC web link — amounting to more than 7,000 pages, which Gaba manually redirected to the version on the Wayback Machine, a service maintained by Internet Archive, a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, that regularly archives web pages, including material from government websites such as that of the CDC. Gaba then posted the entire list on his blog. “It took a couple of days,” says Gaba. “A lot of it is vital, and you don’t know what’s still there, what isn’t there.” Gaba has since posted a similar list of the entire website for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), organized by subject.\n\nOn his hard drive, Moshiri now has backups of the CDC’s website and data sets, as well as the websites for the FDA and other government agencies. Some of these he downloaded himself and others were first downloaded and shared by others online. He is also in the process of backing up the US Department of Agriculture’s website — all of these sites amount to hundreds of thousands of files and more than 130 gigabytes of uncompressed data, and yet all could fit on a USB flash drive. “These are pretty tiny,” he says.\n\nMoshiri hasn’t shared his backups publicly. If his university agrees that it falls within his role as a faculty member, Moshiri wants to publish an exact untouched copy of the CDC website. And his long-term goal is to back up every federal-government website. “I have 100 terabytes of storage under my desk. In theory, I could stick all of these on.”\n\nKendra Albert, an attorney with the public-interest technology and media law firm Albert Sellars LLP in Philadelphia, says that works produced by federal government employees as part of their jobs are in the public domain. Generally speaking, it is legal to download government data sets, make backups of government websites and share them, they say. In circumstances in which copyrighted material is included in those data, making copies and sharing them would often fall under the doctrine of fair use if it is done for the purposes of research, advocacy or as a historical record to show what the site looked like at an earlier date, says Albert.\n\nInternet Archive also supports an initiative, known as the End of Term Web Archive, to archive government web pages at the beginning and end of every US presidential term. James Jacobs, a librarian at Stanford University in California who works on the archive, hopes that it could become a central place for the public to access scientists’ archives of government websites.",

Credit: Getty\n\nUsing artificial intelligence (AI) tools for processes such as preparing manuscripts, writing grant applications and peer review will become widely accepted within the next two years, suggests a survey of nearly 5,000 researchers in more than 70 countries by the publishing company Wiley.\n\nThe survey asked researchers how they are currently using generative AI tools — which include chatbots such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek — as well as how they feel about various potential applications of the technology. The results suggest that the majority of researchers see AI becoming central for scientific research and publishing (see ‘Acceptable use’). More than half of the respondents think that AI currently outperforms humans at more than 20 of the tasks given as example use cases, including reviewing large sets of papers, summarizing research findings, detecting errors in writing, checking for plagiarism and organizing citations. More half of the survey participants expect AI to become mainstream in 34 out of 43 use cases in the next two years.\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\n“What really stands out is the imminence of this,” says Sebastian Porsdam Mann at the University of Copenhagen, who studies the practicalities and ethics of using generative AI in research. “People that are in positions that will be affected by this — which is everyone, but to varying degrees — need to start” addressing this now, he adds.\n\nWiley, headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey, posted the survey findings online on 4 February. Josh Jarrett, senior vice-president and general manager of the publisher’s AI growth team, says he hopes they will serve as a road map for innovators and start-ups looking for opportunities to develop AI tools. “There's broad acceptance that AI is going to reshape the research field.”\n\nLimited uses\n\nThe survey polled 4,946 researchers worldwide, 27% of whom are early-career researchers. Perhaps surprisingly, says Jarrett, the results show that “people aren't really using these tools much in their day-to-day work”. Only 45% of the first wave of respondents (1,043 researchers) said that they had actually used AI to help with their research, and the most common uses they cited were translation, proofreading and editing manuscripts (see ‘Uses of AI’).\n\nAlthough 81% of these 1,043 respondents said they had used OpenAI’s ChatGPT for personal or professional purposes, only one-third had heard of other generative-AI tools such as Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot. However, there are clear differences across countries and disciplines, with researchers in China and Germany, as well as computer scientists, being the most likely to use AI in their work.\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\nThe majority of survey participants expressed interest in expanding their AI use. About 72% want to use AI for preparing manuscripts in the next two years — for tasks such as detecting errors in writing, plagiarism checks and organizing citations. Sixty-two per cent think that AI already outperforms humans in these tasks (see ‘Who does it better: humans or AI?’).\n\nAround 67% of respondents also expressed interest in using AI to handle large amounts of information, for example helping to review the literature, summarizing papers and processing data. Early-career researchers showed greater interest than did more senior colleagues in using AI for writing grant applications and finding potential collaborators. “These are both things that come easier with experience and seniority,” says Porsdam Mann. “Using AI will help even those things out a little bit.”\n\nHowever, researchers are less convinced about AI’s capabilities in more-complex tasks such as identifying gaps in the literature, choosing a journal to submit manuscripts to, recommending peer reviewers or suggesting relevant citations. Although 64% of respondents are open to using AI for these tasks in the next two years, the majority thinks that humans still outperform AI in these areas.\n\nWho does it better: humans or AI?\n\nResearchers think AI can already perform some tasks better than people.\n\nUse caseExamplesQ: Who currently does it better: humans or AI?Manuscript preparation Detecting errors/bias in own writingChecking for unintended plagiarismWriting assistance (e.g. copyediting, translation)FormattingPopulating citationsAI (62% of respondents)Handling informationReviewing a large number of studiesAI agent to monitor key new publicationsAutomated processing of unstructured data (e.g. cataloguing events in hours of video footage)Data visualizationAI (60%)Sharing findings‘Plain language’ summaries of article findingsKnowledge-management agent to help make information accessibleAI (58%)Increasing impactGenerating educational content based on a paperGenerating multimediaVideo abstract or “explainer” generatorHumans (51%)Enhancing research methods and enhancing collaborationWriting up documentationOptimizing experimental designIdentifying potential collaboratorsTools to optimize allocation of shared resourcesAdvanced simulationsHumans (58%)Peer reviewPeer reviewer recommendation tool based on article comparisonsAdapting reviewer feedback into standardized formatAutomated feedback to reviewersHumans (59%)\n\nSource: ExplanAItions report, Wiley\n\nObstacles and opportunities",

          "abstract": "Mice immediately bolt for shelter when they see the looming shadow of a bird, just as humans jump when they see a spider. But these instinctive reactions, which are controlled by the brainstem, can be suppressed if animals learn that a scary stimulus is harmless.\n\nIn Science today, neuroscientists reveal the precise regions of the brain that suppress fear responses in mice1 — a finding that might help scientists to develop strategies for treating post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety in people.\n\nThe study showed that two parts of the brain work together to learn to suppress fear. But, surprisingly, only one of these regions is involved in later recalling the learnt behaviour. “This is the first evidence of that mechanism,” says neuroscientist Pascal Carrive at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn the study, an expanding dark circle was used to imitate a swooping bird, and caused naive mice to run to a shelter. To teach the mice that this looming stimulus was not dangerous, a barrier was added to prevent the animals from hiding.\n\n“I like their behavioural model,” says Christina Perry, a behavioural neuroscientist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “It’s very simple,” she adds. The mice “don’t get eaten, so they learn that this fake predator is not, in fact, a threat”.\n\nAs the mice were learning to be bolder, the researchers switched specific types of neurons on or off using optogenetics — a well-established technique that allows neurons to be controlled with light.\n\nWhen researchers silenced the parts of the cerebral cortex that analyse visual stimuli (called the posterolateral higher visual areas), the mice did not learn to suppress fear and continued to try to escape from the fake bird — suggesting that this area of the brain is necessary for learning to suppress this fear reaction.\n\n‘Unexpected’ result\n\nHowever, mice already trained to overcome their fear could still enact the new, courageous behaviour when the posterolateral higher visual areas were switched off. This is because the memory was stored in a region near the centre of the brain called the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus, “an area of the brain that can inhibit others; it’s quite a strong control region”, says co-author Sonja Hofer, a systems neuroscientist at University College London (UCL).",

Although the approach is still a long way from being used in humans, it is one of the latest examples of widespread efforts to harness bacteria to deliver drugs to where they are needed in the body more effectively. Another study, published today in Cell Systems2, uses a different bacterial species to deliver a protective enzyme to skin cells.\n\n“Drugs often don’t get to where they need to go very well,” says Shannon Sirk, a bioengineer at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, who was not involved in the studies. “If you can improve delivery, you can minimize side effects and reduce the burden on patients.”\n\nGut feeling\n\nMany attempts to engineer drug-secreting bacteria have focused on delivering molecules to the gut, says Sirk. The microbial flora in the gut is lush with bacteria that could carry a medical payload, including strains of Escherichia coli, a laboratory workhorse that is easy to genetically engineer. But the studies reported this week have ventured to other regions of the body and explored the capabilities of less familiar bacteria.\n\nThe brain is a particularly unusual site for a bacterial delivery system to target, says Cammie Lesser, a synthetic microbiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, because it is protected by a barrier that generally excludes microbes, as well as some molecules.\n\nEngineered brain parasite ferries useful proteins into neurons\n\nTo get around this, Matthew Wook Chang, a synthetic biologist at the National University of Singapore, and his colleagues decided to harness a little-studied gateway to the brain: the nose. The first step was to determine which potentially useful microbes reside there. “The nasal microbiome remains relatively unexplored, despite the nasal cavity’s direct connection to the brain,” says Chang.\n\nThe authors examined several bacteria, including five strains of Lactobacillus, a genus that is generally considered safe and is sometimes used in health supplements. The team then screened these strains for their ability to bind to a molecule that is found on a membrane called the olfactory epithelium. This lines part of the upper nasal passageway and is connected to the brain by nerves that are important for the sense of smell. Although bacteria are unlikely to travel from the nose to the brain, some molecules can diffuse along this path.\n\nOnce the researchers had found a suitable strain, Lactobacillus plantarum, they genetically engineered it to produce and secrete a variety of molecules, including three appetite-regulating hormones. Obese mice that received a dose of the bacteria in their nose each day for eight weeks ate less and lost weight during the treatment period1.\n\nSlow starter",

          "abstract": "Restrictions on offshore oil drilling in the United States are under threat.Credit: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nHigher greenhouse-gas emissions, fewer jobs, more expensive energy and dirtier air that kills more people: researchers have begun plugging US President Donald Trump’s energy and climate policies into their models, and the early results suggest far-reaching environmental, health and economic consequences.\n\nTrump, a Republican, began his second term on a promise to “drill, baby, drill”, vowing to make the United States rich again by promoting the development of oil and gas. To that end, Trump plans to roll back climate regulations, end clean-energy incentives and promote fossil fuels. It’s not clear that Trump will be able to accomplish his goals. But if he does, researchers’ models show that these policies are likely to have negative effects for many US residents. They also project that Trump’s policies will undermine efforts to rein in global warming, affecting people around the world.\n\n“Trump is going to make the job of meeting our climate goals a lot harder,” says Bill Hare, a physicist who heads Climate Analytics, a non-profit consultancy in Berlin.\n\nBumping up greenhouse gases\n\nTrump has vowed to roll back regulations put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from sources such as automobiles and power plants. Trump has also called for fossil-fuel development to be expedited, and for a halt to climate investments that Congress approved in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As things stand, those investments are set to pump more than US$1 trillion into programmes to cut emissions and develop green energy by 2032.\n\nAn initial analysis by Climate Analytics and the non-profit consortium Climate Action Tracker suggests that, by 2030, the Trump administration’s policies could raise cumulative US emissions by the equivalent of 2 billion to 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide over what they would otherwise be; the size of the increase will depend mainly on the extent of cuts made to IRA spending. The upper end of that range is equivalent to four years of carbon emissions from Japan.\n\nHow five crucial elections in 2024 could shape climate action for decades\n\nOther groups have come up with similar numbers for 2030, and even higher emissions figures for subsequent years. For instance, modelling by the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy based in New York City, suggests that rolling back Biden’s regulations and repealing the IRA would raise annual US emissions in 2035 by the equivalent of around 1 billion tonnes of CO2.\n\nResearchers say it’s not yet clear how these changes will affect Earth’s climate. Climate actions and policies formulated so far by nations around the world are projected to result in 2.7 °C of warming by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker. The organization projects that the estimated 2 billion to 4 billion tonnes of emissions resulting from Trump’s policies could raise the global temperature by less than a tenth of a degree Celsius. But if these policies were continued into the future and the United States abandoned its climate goals, the increase could be a few tenths of a degree, which would be enough to push the world past the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C.\n\nRipple effects\n\nTrump’s policies would slow the shift from coal to cleaner fuels for generating electricity and would also slow sales of electric vehicles. The burning of more coal and petrol would mean more air pollution, which contributes to a host of diseases. As a result, a Trump administration rollback of current environmental and energy policies could lead to several thousand premature deaths a year by 2030, says Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology, a think tank based in San Francisco, California, that modelled the effects of such policies.\n\nSuperfast Microsoft AI is first to predict air pollution for the whole world\n\nMoreover, researchers say that any gains in employment in the energy sector as a result of Trump’s policies would be more than offset by job losses and reduced economic growth across the rest of the economy. A broad repeal of current energy and climate policies could result in a net loss of nearly four million jobs by 2030, according to work by Orvis’s group.",

          "authors": "Leor Zmigrod",
          "abstract": "Outraged: Why We Fight About Morality and Politics and How to Find Common Ground Kurt Gray Pantheon (2025)\n\nSocial psychologist Kurt Gray’s timely book Outraged begins with a dramatic swerve he made on a motorway — a teenage driving mishap, a chase and an escape from the clutches of road rage. That frightening early life experience sparked Gray’s academic exploration of the roots of moral disagreement, which underpins conflicts in politics and media, and even on gridlocked streets.\n\nBy dissecting the rich body of research on how we make judgments about right and wrong, Gray delivers a second swerve — a bold conceptual turn in explaining why people collide over morality and how such collisions can be avoided.\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think\n\nHe argues that our moral reflexes reveal an innate motivation to protect ourselves and others from harm. Although outrage might seem aggressive — a loud fury hollered across town halls and digital echo-chambers — it is in fact a defensive stance.\n\nOutrage, Gray suggests, can be understood once we recognize that moral anger is often an expression of fear. In many cases, when someone is outraged, it is because they are scared that a vulnerable person will be hurt or mistreated by an action or a policy.\n\nMany liberals and conservatives disagree on climate policies because they focus on different victims. US Democrats lobby for tighter environmental regulations to protect ecosystems, whereas Republicans support plans to ease environmental regulations to prevent job losses in the fossil-fuel industry. Each group is seeking to protect someone from harm.\n\nFor Gray, this dynamic is the source of our divisions, but also a source of hope. If everyone has the same moral impulses and pursues the same moral project, then there is something uniting us. Gray’s pragmatic solution to polarization is simple: share your perspective on who is being harmed by an action, and listen to others’ fears. By doing this, we will all become more sympathetic citizens.\n\nMoral myths\n\nDespite its title, Outraged is a remarkably calm and inoffensive book. Its conversational style mirrors its conciliatory message. In pursuit of relatability, personal anecdotes are woven in along with psychological experiments, recounted with a clarity that renders them fresh and interesting.\n\nGray draws on his own psychological experiments and studies from other psychologists who study morality have sought to explore our intuitions about right and wrong through clever experiments and large surveys. The book aims to debunk three myths: that we are prone to aggression because we evolved as apex predators; that there are harmless wrongs; and that facts can change people’s attitudes and bridge divides.\n\nStructurally, these three sections align with a chronology of the past, present and future of human morality. Starting with our evolutionary heritage, Gray argues that “humans express online outrage for the same reason they expressed outrage in Stone Age tribes: to guard against societal harm and reinforce moral norms”. Same mindset, different era.\n\nHow conspiracies took root in our culture\n\nCrucially, Gray proposes that archaeologists have made a grievous error in their interpretation of the fossil record. Protection, not aggression, is the name of our evolutionary game. He urges us to discard the image of early humans as brutal hunters sharpening their spears for a predatory chase; instead, we should view them as hunted creatures trying to survive amid roving dangers. Evolutionarily, we were not predatory villains, Gray maintains — we were pretty weak prey.\n\nGray cares about this because “the assumption that humans are predators makes our moral opponents seem predatory — cold and calculating — when they do bad things”.\n\nDebunking a myth often entails denying the old narrative and completely reversing it — replacing one story with its opposite. In this case, the temptation is to claim that we were not predators, we were prey. But weren’t we both? In its early sections, the book gets a little stuck between presenting a clear theory and promoting misleading binaries. This is a wider disciplinary challenge for evolutionary psychology; amid sparse evidence and stretched implications, it can fall prey to a rigid retrospective logic that often oversimplifies the complexities of human nature.\n\nThe master key\n\nBut, fortunately, Outraged is a contemporary book concerned mostly with our present predicaments. The second myth it aims to disprove is the idea that our morality is a scattered assemblage of many heterogeneous components and levers. Instead of many moral foundations governing our instincts about good and evil, Gray insists that harm is “the master key of morality” (a recurring refrain).\n\nHe critiques theories that anchor moral concerns beyond harm, especially social psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, whose shadow looms large over moral psychology and how people perceive the field. Outraged thus wishes to refute the notion (disseminated by Haidt) that there are ‘harmless wrongs’ – actions we perceive to be wrong but which we think hurt no one.\n\nMarshalling a range of real and thought experiments, Gray argues that “all moral judgments are psychologically grounded in harm, no matter whether you lean left or right”. Gray’s physiological experiments reveal that when a person is asked to physically imitate an act that is typically harmful, such as holding a realistic toy gun to someone else’s head, their body will be biologically disturbed.",

The applications of these materials include spray coatings for glass greenhouses that can increase crop yields.\n\nMonica Saavedra, the company’s chief executive, grew up wanting to be an astronaut and first developed a taste for experimental work during her bachelor’s degree in physics, when she did a summer placement at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK, helping researchers to make and test carbon-nanotube-based soft-matter detectors for α-, β- and γ-radiation.\n\nAfter a master’s degree in nanotechnology, she undertook a doctorate in nanomaterials at the UK National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Alongside describing her own career journey, Saavedra offers advice to early-career researchers who want to move from academia to industry. She also highlights the importance of moving fast in commercial environments, using her company’s pivot from energy to agritech as an example. This month Saavedra won a 2025 Women in Innovation award, run by Innovate UK, the country's innovation agency.\n\nTell us about your career journey as an entrepreneur.\n\nIn 2012, I joined Nexeon, an early-stage company based in Abingdon, UK, developing silicon batteries. The following year, I left for a research-scientist role at Cambridge-based DNA-sequencing developer Base4 Innovation.\n\nFour years later, I joined Solaris Photonics, also based in Cambridge, as its chief technology officer (CTO), developing materials to increase the output of solar cells. Around that time, a colleague and I discussed setting up a company to make solar cells using quantum dots, which would have a bigger output than conventional silicon solar cells. I had had a similar idea around ten years previously, when I was doing my MSc — it was one of those scribbles that you do at the side of the page while the lecturer is speaking.\n\nThe company became Lambda Agri. I was its CTO originally and became chief executive in March last year.\n\nBeing a founder enabled me to wear lots of hats — one day CTO, marketing or human resources, another day chief executive. I especially enjoy hands-on involvement, making things in the laboratory, doing prototyping projects using computer-aided design and 3D printing or advising the scientists on optical physics.\n\nI also like how start-up companies are more agile than the large corporates; they are better enablers for inventiveness. I like the challenge of working fast. Smaller companies can bring more novelty into the practical realms of everyday life and, therefore, be instrumental in saving lives and the planet more quickly.\n\nWhat were the challenges and benefits of switching roles?\n\nSince switching to chief executive, my key focus is the financing and investor-relations side of the business. I was already involved in applying for funding, updating the pitch deck and having conversations with investors, so it was not a complete change. Investors expect the chief executive to be technical at an early-stage company, to increase credibility, so my CTO experience is beneficial.\n\nThe investment environment over recent years has been challenging, and even more so for women. In Europe, for example, start-up companies founded by women raised only 1.8% of the capital invested in start-ups by venture capitalists in 2023.\n\nAfter becoming chief executive, I adopted a range of measures to get it on a firmer financial footing.\n\nFirst, to minimize gender bias, I decided to approach raising funds through diversity-friendly pitch competitions (Santander X and Tech Nation are two examples).\n\nThe competitions and accelerators we participated in deviated from the current venture-capital landscape by having a much stronger female presence as the funding decision makers: approximately 30–40% female. In my experience, typically around 10–20% of venture-capital investors are female.\n\nSecond, I prioritized accelerators with grants that didn’t require match funding (a mechanism in which companies have to invest an equal sum from another source into the grant-funded project). Third, I sought equity-free funding (capital funding that does not transfer ownership of the company to investors).\n\nThese measures help to keep investors happy by minimizing dilution, which is the reduction in the percentage of existing shareholders’ equity that occurs when new shares are issued.\n\nOn one occasion, I attended a national pitch competition when I was heavily pregnant with my second child. Luckily, a representative of a family office (an investment fund managing a family’s private wealth) who was in the audience really enjoyed the pitch, and invested £100,000 (US$124,000).\n\nI live in hope that pitching events will one day be baby-friendly. At the time, I was working days, nights and weekends, with a toddler to look after as well. I have not had a day off, not even on the day my second child was born four months ago. The company has always been the ‘other baby’. I do not necessarily recommend this way of working to others, but it works for me as a mother, and I do have support, which is important.\n\nFundraising requires a focused effort that cannot stop until it’s achieved by a drop-dead deadline. Your employees have families to feed. People you care about have invested money in the business. You have to make it work if you believe in the vision, which we all do.\n\nGetting the funding in place, despite the challenges, has helped me to work on my communication skills, which I always found difficult. Previously, I was much more comfortable with computers than with people. I have had to work hard to understand how to relate better to others and in the male-dominated corporate environment.\n\nHow do you attract talent?\n\nSome scientists are technically brilliant and bold, but lack the commercial or contextual view needed to produce things as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. This is sometimes difficult to deduce before making a new hire. When I’m hiring, I only stop looking once at least one very talented and driven woman has applied.\n\nCurrently, we employ five people and the overall gender balance is 40:60 female to male. We are striving to attain a better one, ideally a 50:50 split, particularly at board level. Just now, it’s me and two white British men, both very knowledgeable angel investors.\n\nI try to ensure that women’s technical skills are being recognized, and I do not let anyone assume that they will be more suited to people-facing roles, for example. Stereotypes about women’s capabilities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics still persist.",

The innermost layer contains the ‘Bouligand structure’: in this layer, fibres of chitin are arranged like bundles of pencils that fan out in different directions, so that some point towards the exterior layers, some are parallel to them and some are at angles in between. The fibres’ orientations aren’t random, but vary in a periodic fashion that repeats every 500 micrometres or so.\n\nMantis shrimp's super colour vision debunked",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov, Dan Garisto, Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "One of the buildings on the US National Institutes of Health’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland, is a hospital dedicated to medical research.Credit: Bob Korn/Alamy\n\nA US judge has blocked a policy that would have, beginning today, slashed billions of dollars of funding annually for US research institutions, including universities and hospitals. The action is in response to a lawsuit filed by 22 US states earlier today contending that the policy was illegal and would cause “cutting-edge work to cure and treat human disease” to “grind to a halt”.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nThe policy, announced late on 7 February by the NIH, would have cut ‘research overhead’ to 15% for new and existing grants. Last year, the NIH, the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarded US$26 billion directly to scientists to help them pay workers’ salaries and buy equipment and reagents for their laboratories, while $9 billion went to these overhead, or indirect, costs, to help institutions run their facilities and cover administrative fees. The historical average indirect-costs rate has been about 40%, and goes up to 75% for some institutions.\n\nThe steep cut attempted by the NIH comes as the administration of US President Donald Trump, which has partnered with billionaire and entrepreneur Elon Musk, is taking aim at federal spending and attempting to dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds disease research, prevention and care globally. In recent weeks, Trump’s team tried to freeze federal grants, sowing chaos and confusion throughout the US scientific community, but federal judges have so far blocked these efforts. Musk said on Friday that wealthy universities getting high rates for indirect costs is “a ripoff” on the social-media platform X, which he owns.\n\nThe 15% cap is necessary to “ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead”, acting NIH director Matthew Memoli said in the memorandum announcing the change.\n\nThe attorneys general of the states that sued are Democrats, although Trump, a Republican, won five of those states in last year’s presidential election. The effects of the policy would be “immediate and devastating”, their lawsuit said. “This agency action will result in layoffs, suspension of clinical trials, disruption of ongoing research programs, and laboratory programs.”\n\nJudge Angel Kelley’s order temporarily prevents the NIH from enacting its policy in the 22 states that sued; she set a hearing for 21 February to further consider the states’ petition.\n\n‘Generational restructuring’\n\nSome research institutions had already taken precautionary measures in response to the cut on Monday. In an e-mail seen by Nature, the University of Florida in Gainesville, which has an indirect-costs rate of 52.5%, told its staff members that new awards and the projects they fund at the 15% rate would be frozen, because its accounting department has not been authorized to charge the agency the lower rate.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nResearchers say that the policy would upend the biomedical-research enterprise. Alondra Nelson, who directed the US Office of Science and Technology Policy for eight months under former US president and Democrat Joe Biden, wrote on the social-media platform Bluesky that it would lead to a “generational restructuring” of the US research and development ecosystem.\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was already losing money on federally funded clinical trials, and had to rely on philanthropy to make up the difference, says Charles Roberts, director of the hospital’s cancer centre. The NIH rate cut would further cost the hospital nearly $40 million each year, he says. “This will likely mean that fewer experimental treatments will get to children,” he adds. “More children will die.”\n\nThe NIH referred Nature to its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for comments about the lawsuit. It also did not answer questions from Nature about whether it would give more money to researchers for their direct costs to make up for the cap. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said that the agency does not discuss ongoing litigation and declined to answer Nature’s queries about the lawsuit or about scientists’ concerns about the indirect-costs policy.\n\nA question of cost\n\n‘Direct costs’ paid for by research grants help scientists to buy equipment for specific projects and cover the salaries of lab personnel running them. But research institutions also need to pay for air conditioning, electricity, computing resources, hazardous-waste disposal, administrative personnel and much more to support research projects.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nTo help pay for these utilities and resources, which are essential to scientific research, the federal government has been adding ‘indirect costs’ to research grants since 1947. These rates ranged from 8% to about 20% until 1965, when individual institutions began negotiating their own rates with HHS. For example, on a $1.2-million grant, a 20% indirect-costs rate would mean that $200,000 goes to the university to pay for overhead.\n\nThese rates have risen steadily since the 1960s, in part because of an increasing number of regulations governing laboratory research and how federal funds are spent. The regulations include measures to ensure data privacy, to protect animal welfare and human participants in research studies, and to govern collaborations with researchers in other countries.",

          "abstract": "For many countries in the Global South traditional poverty estimates are available only infrequently and at coarse spatial resolutions, if at all. This limits decision-makers’ and analysts’ ability to target humanitarian and development interventions and makes it difficult to study relationships between poverty and other natural and human phenomena at finer spatial scales. Advances in Earth observation and machine learning-based methods have proven capable of generating more granular estimates of relative asset wealth indices. They have been less successful in predicting the consumption-based poverty measures most commonly used by decision-makers, those tied to national and international poverty lines. For a study area including four countries in southern and eastern Africa, we pilot a two-step approach that combines Earth observation, accessible machine learning methods, and asset-based structural poverty measurement to address this gap. This structural poverty approach to machine learning-based poverty estimation preserves the interpretability and policy-relevance of consumption-based poverty measures, while allowing us to explain 72 to 78% of cluster-level variation in a pooled model and 40 to 54% even when predicting out-of-country.",

          "abstract": "Intergenerational transmission of inequality is a central question in the social sciences. We use one trait, beauty, to infer how much parents’ physical characteristics transmit inequality across generations. Analyses of a large-scale longitudinal dataset in the United States, and a much smaller dataset of Chinese parents and children, show that increases in parents’ looks are associated with increases in their child’s looks. A large dataset of U.S. siblings shows a positive correlation of their beauty. The appropriate weighted average from the three samples shows that a one SD increase in ratings of both parents’ looks is associated with a 0.25 SD increase in their child’s. Coupling these estimates with those from large literatures measuring the impact of beauty on earnings and the intergenerational elasticity of income suggests that a one SD difference in parents’ looks is correlated with a 0.074 SD difference in their adult child’s earnings, about U.S. $2,170 annually.",

          "abstract": "The large labor markets of big cities offer greater possibilities for workers to gain skills and experience through successively better employment opportunities. This “experience effect” contributes to the higher average wages that are found in big cities compared to the economy as a whole. Racial wage inequality is also higher in bigger cities than in the economy on average. We offer an explanation for this pattern, demonstrating that there is substantial racial inequality in the economic returns to work experience acquired in big cities. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 we find that each year of work experience in a big city increases Black and Latinx workers’ wages by about one quarter to half as much as White workers’ wages. A substantial amount of this inequality can be explained by further racial disparities in the benefits of high-skill work experience. This research identifies a heretofore unknown source of inequality that is distinctly urban in nature, and expands our knowledge of the challenges to reaching interracial wage equality.",

We also investigate the qualities teachers perceive top performers who are successful role models to have. We show that teachers associate a greater sense of learning autonomy and sense of being an example with top-performing girls compared to top-performing boys. Estimated effects are more pronounced among teachers with children and teachers in urban areas. Administrative data from a representative sample show limited observed differences between top-performing boys’ and girls’ educational outcomes that could justify the differences in teachers’ gender perceptions.

In our research, we offer predictions about the broader impact of such interventions on individuals who may not “fit” with traditional masculine identity. Across four multimethod studies ( N = 37,920) spanning both field and lab settings, we demonstrate that a gender debiasing intervention that replaces masculine language in job postings with synonymous gender-neutral language increases application rates among women and men whose self-identities are less aligned with masculinity. Our research highlights that conceptualizing identity incongruence along a continuum can help explain when and why gender diversity initiatives foster the inclusion of a broader group of individuals than initially anticipated.",

          "abstract": "Spatial patterns of cells and other biological elements drive physiologic and pathologic processes within tissues. While many imaging and transcriptomic methods document tissue organization, discerning these patterns is challenging, especially when they involve multiple elements in complex arrangements. To address this challenge, we present Spatial Patterning Analysis of Cellular Ensembles (SPACE), an R package for analysis of high-plex spatial data. SPACE is compatible with any data collection modality that records values (i.e., categorical cell/structure types or quantitative expression levels) at fixed spatial coordinates (i.e., 2d pixels or 3d voxels). SPACE detects not only broad patterns of co-occurrence but also context-dependent associations, quantitative gradients and orientations, and other organizational complexities. Via a robust information theoretic framework, SPACE explores all possible ensembles of tissue elements—single elements, pairs, triplets, and so on—and ranks the most strongly patterned ensembles. For single images, rankings reflect differences from random assortment. For sets of images, rankings reflect differences across sample groups (e.g., genotypes, treatments, timepoints, etc.). Further tools then characterize the nature of each pattern for intuitive interpretation. We validate SPACE and demonstrate its advantages using murine lymph node images for which ground truth has been defined. We then detect new patterns across varied datasets, including tumors and tuberculosis granulomas.",

          "abstract": "Misregulation of the activity of GCN2, the kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates translation initiation factor eIF2α, has been implicated in several health disorders, underscoring the need to determine the mechanisms controlling GCN2 activation. During nutrient starvation, increased uncharged tRNA levels trigger GCN1 and GCN20 proteins to mediate the binding of uncharged tRNA to GCN2 to activate the kinase to phosphorylate eIF2α. Under constant conditions, activation of the Neurospora crassa homolog of GCN2, CPC-3, is controlled by the circadian clock. However, how the circadian clock controls the rhythmic activity of CPC-3 was not known. We found that the clock regulates CPC-3 and GCN1 interaction with ribosomes and show that these interactions are necessary for clock regulation of CPC-3 activity. CPC-3 activity rhythms, and the rhythmic interaction of CPC-3 and GCN1 with ribosomes, are abolished in a temperature-sensitive valyl-tRNA synthetase mutant ( un-3 ts ) that has high levels of uncharged tRNA Val at all times of the day. Disrupting the interaction between GCN1 and uncharged tRNA in the absence of GCN20 altered rhythmic CPC-3 activity, indicating that the clock controls the interaction between uncharged tRNA and GCN1. Together, these data support that circadian rhythms in mRNA translation through CPC-3 activity require rhythms in uncharged tRNA levels that drive the rhythmic interaction between CPC-3 and GCN1 with ribosomes. This regulation uncovers a fundamental mechanism to ensure temporal coordination between peak cellular energy levels and the energetically demanding process of mRNA translation.",

          "abstract": "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are unconventional T cells that mediate rapid antimicrobial immune responses to antigens derived from microbial riboflavin pathway metabolites presented by the evolutionarily conserved MR1 molecules. MAIT cells represent a large pre-expanded T cell subset in humans and are involved in both protective immunity and inflammatory immunopathology. However, what controls the functional heterogeneity of human MAIT cell responses is still largely unclear. Here, combining functional and transcriptomic analyses, we investigate how MAIT cell response programs are influenced by the cytokine milieu at the time of antigen recognition. Activation by MR1-presented antigen together with IL-12 induces intermediate levels of IFNγ and TNF, as well as a regulatory profile with substantial IL-10 production and elevated expression of TIM-3, LAG-3, and PD-1. Activation by the combination of antigen and IL-12 induces a c-MAF-dependent program required for IL-10 production. The MAIT cell-derived IL-10 mediates both autocrine and paracrine immune regulation. In contrast, coactivation of MAIT cells with IL-18 induces IL-17, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNF, without IL-10. Notably, IL-18 dominantly counteracts IL-10 expression. The activation states biased toward IL-10 or IL-17 production are reversible and do not represent stable subsets. Finally, MR1-restricted TCR-mediated activation without cytokine coactivation drives primarily granzyme B cytolytic arming. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that human MAIT cells adapt their functional effector response during antigen recognition to cytokine cues in the microenvironment, and identify programs biased toward either regulatory c-MAF-dependent IL-10 expression, or an inflammatory IL-17 and GM-CSF profile.",

          "abstract": "The Cassini missions have identified the tiger stripes on Enceladus as the source of both thermal emission and plume jets. The hot spots in the tiger stripes are highly localized, and the plumes suggest active hydrothermal processes within the subglacial ocean of Enceladus. However, understanding the mechanism responsible for the heat anomalies in the tiger stripes remains a challenge. About 60 y ago, geoscientist George Veronis proposed a model for cold water oceans, along with the classical notion of a 1/3 scaling relationship between vertical heat transfer and the Rayleigh number ( Ra ), a dimensionless number representing the strength of buoyancy driving the convection within the fluid body. In this study, by delving into the steady coherent rolls arising in Veronis’ model, we first confirm the existence of the classical scaling as proposed. We identify two distinct pathways, characterized by different flow patterns, that converge to the unified classical scaling. In scenarios where stratification resulting from the density’s nonlinear temperature dependence is insignificant, convection rolls with fixed (width-to-height) aspect ratios achieve the classical scaling as Ra approaches infinity. Conversely, under high stratification levels, convection rolls with a heat-transport-maximizing aspect ratio achieve the classical scaling. This investigation also reveals a notable correspondence between optimal coherent rolls and turbulent flow patterns. Based on these coherent rolls, we offer insights into the formation of heat anomalies in the tiger stripes. The predicted heat flux through the ocean and the lateral flow length, are consistent with the measurements obtained by the Cassini spacecraft.",

          "abstract": "Samaras are known for their elegant and robust autorotation, a resilience that persists in the adverse conditions imposed by high-speed raindrops. Like flying insects, samaras descending from tall trees are likely to be struck by raindrops in an intense storm. In this study, we detail the collision dynamics for impact regions across the samara body and the drop-shedding mechanisms that samaras exhibit to return to autorotation. Impacts across the samara body can pitch the samara up to 60 degrees and, in some cases, induce spanwise roll. Raindrops may shatter or remain intact upon impact, pushing the undamaged samara downward before autorotation is recovered. Drops that strike near the wingtip elicit the greatest recovery distance, while impacts onto the nutlet mass are the least disruptive to the samara and most likely to cause the drop to induce fragmentation. Faster drops allow for quicker drop shedding and a subsequent rapid return to autorotation in less than 50 ms. Our results indicate that samaras are robust to raindrop impacts and consistently recover autorotation, resulting in a minor reduction in dispersal distance. To recover, the entire drop is shed from the spinning samara over a time closely tied to the shedding mode and ensuing drop rejection forces.",

          "abstract": "We recently reported that microinjection of Xenopus nodal-related ( xnr ) mRNAs into β-catenin-depleted Xenopus embryos rescued a complete dorsal axis. Xnrs mediate the signal of the Nieuwkoop center that induces the Spemann–Mangold organizer in the overlying mesoderm, a process inhibited by the Nodal antagonist Cerberus-short (CerS). However, β-catenin also induces a second signaling center in the dorsal prospective ectoderm, designated the Blastula Chordin and Noggin Expression (BCNE) center, in which the homeobox gene siamois ( sia ) plays a major role. In this study, we asked whether the Xnrs and Sia depend on each other or function on parallel pathways. Expression of both genes induced β-catenin-depleted embryos to form complete axes with heads and eyes via the activation of similar sets of downstream organizer-specific genes. Xnrs did not activate siamois , and, conversely, Sia did not activate xnrs , although both were induced by β-catenin stabilization. Depletion with morpholinos revealed a robust role for the downstream target Chordin. Remarkably, Chordin depletion prevented all ectopic effects resulting from microinjection of the mRNA encoding the maternal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa , including the radial expansion of brain tissue and the ectopic expression of the ventral gene sizzled . The main conclusion was that the BCNE and Nieuwkoop centers provide a double assurance mechanism for axial formation by independently activating similar downstream transcriptional target gene repertoires. We suggest that Siamois likely evolved from an ancestral Mix-type homeodomain protein called Sebox as a Xenopus -specific adaptation for the rapid differentiation of the anterior neural plate in the ectoderm.",

Specific knockout of astrocytic EphA4 ameliorates excitatory synapse loss in the hippocampus in AD transgenic mouse models. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed that EphA4 inhibition specifically decreases a reactive astrocyte subpopulation with enriched complement signaling, which is associated with synapse elimination by astrocytes in AD. Importantly, astrocytic EphA4 knockout in an AD transgenic mouse model decreases complement tagging on excitatory synapses and excitatory synapses within astrocytes.

          "abstract": "L-thyroxine (L-T4) monotherapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism, administered daily to normalize TSH levels. Once absorbed, T4 is converted to T3 to alleviate most symptoms. However, this treatment abnormally elevates plasma T4 levels in over 50% of patients. Using L-T4-treated Thyroid Hormone (TH) Action Indicator mice, which express a T3-regulated luciferase (Luc) reporter, we examined whether these T4 elevations disrupt TH signaling. Hypothyroid mice exhibited reduced Luc expression across brain regions, and L-T4 treatment failed to restore T3 signaling uniformly. There was also variability in the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2), the enzyme that generates most brain T3. Intracerebroventricular T4 administration achieved higher elevation of Luc expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus compared to the cortex, and studies on cultured cortical astrocytes and hypothalamic tanycytes revealed cell-type-specific responses to T4. In tanycytes, exposure to T4 sustained D2 activity, leading to progressive T3 signaling, whereas in astrocytes, T4 exposure triggered a drop in D2 activity, limiting T3 production through a ubiquitin-dependent, self-limiting mechanism. The sustained D2 activity in tanycytes was linked to rapid deubiquitination by USP33, as confirmed using a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) pan-inhibitor and USP33 knockout mice. In conclusion, the brain’s response to L-T4 treatment is heterogeneous, influenced by cell-specific regulation of D2-mediated T3 production. While cortical astrocytes exhibit limited T3 signaling due to D2 ubiquitination, tanycytes coexpressing USP33 amplify T3 signaling by rescuing ubiquitinated D2 from proteasomal degradation. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the limitations of L-T4 therapy and highlight the need for tailored approaches to managing hypothyroidism.",

Supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) are one type of particle characterized by a cytotoxic core enriched in granzymes and perforin surrounded by a proteinaceous shell including thrombospondin (TSP)-1. TSP-4 was also detected in bulk analysis of SMAPs released by CTLs; however, it has not been investigated whether TSP-4 contributes to distinct SMAP types or the same SMAP type as TSP-1 and, if in the same type of SMAP, whether TSP-4 and TSP-1 cooperate or compete. Here, we observed that TSP-4 expression increased upon CD8 + T cell activation while, surprisingly, TSP-1 was down-regulated. Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy and Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy localized TSP-4 and TSP-1 in SMAP-containing multicore granules. Superresolution dSTORM revealed that TSP-4 and TSP-1 are usually enriched in the same SMAPs while particles with single-positive shells are rare. Retention Using Selective Hooks assays showed that TSP-4 localizes to the lytic granules faster than TSP-1 and promotes its accumulation therein. TSP-4 contributed to direct CTL-mediated killing, as previously shown for TSP-1. TSP-4 and TSP-1 were both required for latent SMAP-mediated cell killing, in which released SMAPs kill targets after removal of the CTLs. Of note, we found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell culture supernatants suppressed expression of TSP-4 in CTL and latent SMAP-mediated killing. These results identify TSP-4 as a functionally important component of SMAPs and suggest that SMAPs may be targeted for immune suppression by CLL.",

          "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , remains a significant global health threat, affecting an estimated 10.6 million people in 2022. The emergence of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant strains necessitates the development of novel and effective drugs. Accelerating the determination of mechanisms of action (MOAs) for these drugs is crucial for advancing TB treatment. This study introduces MycoBCP, a unique adaptation of bacterial cytological profiling (BCP) tailored to M. tuberculosis , utilizing the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within BCP to overcome challenges posed by traditional image analysis techniques. Using MycoBCP, we analyzed the morphological effects of various antimicrobial compounds on M. tuberculosis , capturing broad patterns rather than relying on precise cell segmentation. This approach circumvented issues such as cell clumping and uneven staining, which are prevalent in M. tuberculosis . In a blind test, MycoBCP accurately identified the MOA for 96% of the compounds, with a single misclassification of rifabutin, which was incorrectly categorized as affecting translation rather than transcription. The similar morphologies resulting from transcription and translation inhibition indicate a need for further refinement to distinguish them more effectively. Application of MycoBCP to a series of antitubercular agents successfully identified known MOAs and revealed unique effects, demonstrating its utility in early drug discovery and development. Our findings underscore the potential of CNN-based BCP to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MOA determination, particularly for challenging pathogens like M. tuberculosis . MycoBCP represents a significant advancement in TB drug development, offering a robust and adaptable method for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial compounds.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 sometimes appear to be creative, solving novel tasks often with a few demonstrations in the prompt. These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data—which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning. We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of component known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together—models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the Z 2 QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a hidden large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.",

By combining phosphoproteomic and biochemical assays, we identified Hsp90 as a direct target of Ptc2 at host CO 2 concentrations and Ssb1 as a Ptc2 target protein regardless of CO 2 levels in Candida albicans , the most prevalent human fungal pathogen. Ptc2 forms reversible condensates at elevated CO 2 , which enables the recruitment of Hsp90, but not Ssb1, to condensates, allowing efficient dephosphorylation. This process confers an enhanced susceptibility to caspofungin in vitro and during in vivo infection therapy. Importantly, we demonstrate this phenomenon in non-albicans Candida species. Sequential passages of C. albicans in mice with caspofungin treatment readily induce in vivo drug tolerance, causing therapeutic failure. These evolved strains display increased resistance to caspofungin under host concentrations of CO 2 but remain susceptible in air. Collectively, our study reveals a profound impact of host concentrations of CO 2 on antifungal drug susceptibility and connects this phenotype to therapeutic outcomes and highlights condensate formation as an efficient means that enables selective recruitment of substrates for certain signaling events.",

          "abstract": "Fluid flows are dominant features of many bacterial environments, and flow can often impact bacterial behaviors in unexpected ways. For example, the most common type of cardiovascular infection is heart valve colonization by gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis (endocarditis). This behavior is counterintuitive because heart valves experience high shear rates that would naively be expected to reduce colonization. To determine whether these bacteria preferentially colonize higher shear rate environments, we developed a microfluidic system to quantify the effect of flow conditions on the colonization of S. aureus and E. faecalis . We find that the preferential colonization in high flow of both species is not specific to heart valves and can be found in simple configurations lacking any host factors. This behavior enables bacteria that are outcompeted in low flow to dominate in high flow. Surprisingly, experimental and computational studies reveal that the two species achieve this behavior via distinct mechanisms. S. aureus grows in cell clusters and produces a dispersal signal whose transport is affected by shear rate. Meanwhile, E. faecalis grows in linear chains whose mechanical properties result in less dispersal in the presence of higher shear force. In addition to establishing two divergent mechanisms by which these bacteria each preferentially colonize high-flow environments, our findings highlight the importance of understanding bacterial behaviors at the level of collective interactions among cells. These results suggest that distinct multicellular nanocolony morphologies have previously unappreciated costs and benefits in different environments, like those introduced by fluid flow.",

          "abstract": "Climate warming is increasing ocean stratification, which in turn should decrease the nutrient flux to the upper ocean. This may slow marine primary productivity, causing cascading effects throughout food webs. However, observing changes in upper ocean nutrients is challenging because surface concentrations are often below detection limits. We show that the nutricline depth, where nutrient concentrations reach well-detected levels, is tied to productivity and upper ocean nutrient availability. Next, we quantify nutricline depths from a global database of observed vertical nitrate and phosphate profiles to assess contemporary trends in global nutrient availability (1972–2022). We find strong evidence that the P-nutricline (phosphacline) is mostly deepening, especially throughout the southern hemisphere, but the N-nutricline (nitracline) remains mostly stable. Earth System Model (ESM) simulations support the hypothesis that reduced iron stress and increased nitrogen fixation buffer the nitracline, but not phosphacline, against increasing stratification. These contemporary trends are expected to continue in the coming decades, leading to increasing phosphorus but not nitrogen stress for marine phytoplankton, with important ramifications for ocean biogeochemistry and food web dynamics.",

In Arabidopsis , the seed coat, derived from ovular integuments, plays a critical role in maintaining dormancy, ensuring germination occurs during a favorable season. Dormancy is enhanced by cold temperatures during seed development by affecting seed coat permeability through changes in apoplastic barriers. However, their localization and composition are poorly understood. This study identifies and investigates a polar barrier in the seed coat’s outer integument (oi1) cells. We present histological, biochemical, and genetic evidence showing that cold promotes polar seed coat lignification of the outer integument 1 (oi1) cells and suberization throughout the entire oi1 cell boundary. The polar oi1 barrier is regulated by the transcription factors MYB107 and MYB9. MYB107, in particular, is crucial for the lignified polar oi1 barrier formation under cold temperatures. The absence of the oi1 barrier in mutant seeds correlates with increased permeability and reduced dormancy. Our findings elucidate how temperature-induced modifications in seed coat composition regulate dormancy, highlighting the roles of suberin and lignin in this process.",

          "abstract": "Hemizygous genes, which are present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes of diploid organisms, have been mainly studied in the context of sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes. However, these genes can also occur on the autosomes of diploid plants due to structural variants (SVs), such as a deletion/insertion of one allele, and this phenomenon largely unexplored in plants. Here, we investigated the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of hemizygous genes across 22 genomes with varying propagation histories: eleven clonal lineages, seven outcrossed samples, and four inbred and putatively homozygous genomes. We identified SVs leading to genic hemizygosity. As expected, very few genes (0.01 to 1.2%) were hemizygous in the homozygous genomes, representing negative controls. Hemizygosity was appreciable among outcrossed lineages, averaging 8.7% of genes, but consistently elevated for the clonal samples at 13.8% genes, likely reflecting heterozygous SV accumulation during clonal propagation. Compared to diploid genes, hemizygous genes were more often situated in centromeric than telomeric regions and experienced weaker purifying selection. They also had reduced levels of expression, averaging ~20% of the expression levels of diploid genes, violating the evolutionary model of dosage compensation. We also detected higher DNA methylation levels in hemizygous genes and transposable elements, which may contribute to their reduced expression. Finally, expression profiles showed that hemizygous genes were more specifically expressed in contexts related to fruit development, organ differentiation, and stress responses. Overall, hemizygous genes accumulate in clonally propagated lineages and display distinct genetic and epigenetic features compared to diploid genes, shedding unique insights into genetic studies and breeding programs of clonal crops.",

          "abstract": "In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T c s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher T c should no longer solely be to increase T c under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T c up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T c , possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T c . These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.",

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression. RPRM is a target gene of p53 known to be involved in tumor suppression, but its molecular function has remained elusive. Here, we report that Reprimo (the protein product of RPRM ) is secreted and extrinsically induces apoptosis in recipient cells. We identified FAT1, FAT4, CELSR1, CELSR2, and CELSR3, members of the protocadherin family, as receptors for Reprimo. Subsequent analyses revealed that Reprimo acts upstream of the Hippo–YAP/TAZ–p73 axis and induces apoptosis by transactivating various proapoptotic genes. In vivo analyses further support the tumor-suppressive effects of secreted Reprimo. These findings identify the p53–Reprimo–Hippo–YAP/TAZ–p73 axis as an extrinsic apoptosis pathway that plays a crucial role in tumor suppression.

In response, plants deploy distinct yet interconnected mechanisms to cope with these facets of salinity stress. In this investigation, we observed a substantial overlap in the salt (NaCl)-induced transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis roots with those triggered by osmotic stress or the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), as anticipated. Notably, a specific cluster of genes responded uniquely to sodium (Na + ) ions and are not regulated by the known monovalent cation sensing mechanism MOCA1 . Surprisingly, expression of sodium-induced genes exhibited a negative correlation with the ABA response and preceded the activation of genes induced by the osmotic stress component of salt. Elevated exogenous ABA levels resulted in the complete abolition of sodium-induced responses. Consistently, the ABA insensitive snrk2.2/2.3 double mutant displayed prolonged sodium-induced gene expression, coupled with increased root cell damage and root swelling under high salinity conditions. Moreover, ABA biosynthesis and signaling mutants were unable to redirect root growth to avoid high sodium concentrations and had increased sodium accumulation in the shoot. In summary, our findings unveil an unexpected and pivotal role for ABA signaling in mitigating cellular damage induced by salinity stress and modulating sodium-induced responses in plant roots.",

Generally, the features of free-electron radiation are stochastic when electrons interact with random media. Counterintuitively, here, we reveal a type of free-electron radiation that has both its intensity and directionality invariant to specific sorts of long-range structural randomness. Essentially, this invariance is enabled by the Brewster effect and the judiciously engineered phase coherence condition of emitted light, namely that the light induced by electron’s penetration through a layered aperiodic nanostructure is engineered to interfere constructively at the Brewster angle. As such, when each constituent layer with a random thickness fulfills this phase coherence condition, there is always the emergence of free-electron resonance transition radiation at the Brewster angle. At this resonant Brewster angle, we further find that the radiation intensity and directionality could be enhanced by orders of magnitude by readily increasing the interface number. The revealed resonance transition radiation via long-range Brewster randomness may offer a feasible route to explore more enticing photonic applications driven by free electrons, such as light sources at previously unreachable spectral regimes, optical frequency combs, particle detectors, and random lasers.",

Herein we demonstrate that thermosalient effects of molecular crystals could be driven by thermoelastic twisting behaviors. The crystal, based on a model compound with rigid dibenzothiophene sulfone planes and flexible ethoxy chains, can spontaneously self-heal from mechanical fractures. Upon heating, the crystal undergoes remarkable thermosalient behaviors driven by a distinctive left- or right-handed twisting. This thermoelastic twisting converts thermal energy into elastic potential energy, which is further released as kinetic energy upon untwisting to drive the crystal jump. Our demonstration on thermoelastic twisting–induced crystal jumping offers a different perspective on the origins of thermosalient crystals and could provide inspiration for future engineering and application of dynamic molecular crystals.",

FSH is essential for female fertility because mice lacking FSH ( Fshb KO ) are anestrous and infertile. Although several in vitro cell culture and ex vivo approaches combined with pharmacological hormone treatment were used to identify FSH-regulated genes, how FSH orchestrates ovarian gene networks in vivo has not been investigated. Whether FSH-regulated genes display estrous stage–specific expression changes has also not been studied. Here, we functionally rescued Fshb null mice with a gonadotrope-targeted HFSHB transgene and performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs obtained from FSH-intact ( WT ), FSH-deficient ( Fshb KO ), and FSH-rescue ( HFSHB + rescue) mice. By comparing WT vs. Fshb KO and Fshb KO vs. HFSHB + rescue ovarian gene expression datasets, we identified FSH-responsive genes in vivo. Cross interrogation of these datasets further allowed us to identify several transcription factors (TFs) and RNA-binding proteins specific to FSH-regulated genes. In an independent set of experiments, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs from mice in diestrous (DE), proestrous (PE), and estrous (E) and identified estrous stage–specific ovarian gene expression patterns. Interestingly, many of the FSH-regulated TFs themselves were estrous-stage specifically expressed. We found that ESR2 and GATA6, two known FSH-responsive TFs, and their target genes are reciprocally regulated with distinct patterns of expression in estrous stages. Together, our in vivo models and RNA-Seq analyses identify FSH-regulated ovarian genes in specific estrous stages that are under transcriptional and posttranscriptional control.",

We identified KLF5 as a regulator of genes defining this mixed basal, club, and hillock cell identity in DNPC models.

          "abstract": "Understanding how time perception adapts to cognitive demands remains a significant challenge. In some contexts, the brain encodes time categorically (as “long” or “short”), while in others, it encodes precise time intervals on a continuous scale. Although the ventral premotor cortex (VPC) is known for its role in complex temporal processes, such as speech, its specific involvement in time estimation remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated how the VPC processes temporal information during a time interval comparison task (TICT) and a time interval categorization task (TCT) in primates. We found a notable heterogeneity in neuronal responses associated with time perception across both tasks. While most neurons responded during time interval presentation, a smaller subset retained this information during the working memory periods. Population-level analysis revealed distinct dynamics between tasks: In the TICT, population activity exhibited a linear and parametric relationship with interval duration, whereas in the TCT, neuronal activity diverged into two distinct dynamics corresponding to the interval categories. During delay periods, these categorical or parametric representations remained consistent within each task context. This contextual shift underscores the VPC’s adaptive role in interval estimation and highlights how temporal representations are modulated by cognitive demands.",

          "abstract": "The two-line hybrid rice system, a cutting-edge hybrid rice breeding technology, has greatly boosted global food security. In thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines, the critical sterility-inducing temperature (CSIT; the temperature at which TGMS lines change from male fertile to complete male sterile) acts as a key threshold. We recently uncovered that thermo-sensitive genic male sterility 5 ( tms5 ), a sterile locus presenting in over 95% of TGMS lines, leads to the overaccumulation of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (cP)-ΔCCA-tRNAs and a deficiency of mature tRNAs, which underlies the molecular mechanism of tms5 -mediated TGMS. However, there are a few reports on the regulatory mechanism controlling CSIT. Here, we identified a suppressor of tms5 , an amino acid substitution (T552I) in the rice Rqc2 (ribosome-associated quality control 2), increases the CSIT in tms5 lines through its C-terminal alanine and threonine modification (CATylation) activity. This substitution alters tRNA selectivity, leading to the recruitment of different tRNAs to the A-site of ribosome and CATylation rate by OsRqc2 during ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a process that rescues stalled ribosomes and degrades abnormal nascent chains during translational elongation. Further, the mutation restores the levels of mature tRNA-Ser/Ile to increase the CSIT of tms5 lines. Our findings reveal the origin of overaccumulated cP-ΔCCA-tRNAs in tms5 lines, further deepening our understanding of the regulatory network in governing CSIT of TGMS lines containing tms5.",

          "abstract": "Plant cytokinesis requires coordination between the actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, and membranes to guide division plane formation and cell plate expansion; how these regulatory factors are coordinated remains unknown. The actin cytoskeleton assembly is controlled by several actin nucleation factors, such as the SCAR/WAVE complex, which regulates actin nucleation and branching through the activation of the ARP2/3 complex. The activity of these actin regulatory proteins is likely influenced by interactions with specific membranes; however, the molecular basis and the biological relevance of SCAR–membrane interactions are also unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the ER–PM tethering protein VAP27-1 directly interacts with SCAR2 at the ER membrane and that they colocalize to guide cell plate orientation during cell division. In the root meristem, both VAP27-1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization at the cell plates, where the interaction between ER and PM is abundant. VAP27-1 recruits SCAR2 to the cell division plane, where there is a high concentration of actin filaments. In the vap27-1346 mutant, the densities of cortical ER, SCAR2, and consequently actin filaments are significantly reduced at the cell division plane, affecting cell plate orientation, cell division, and root development. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the scar1234 mutant, suggesting that VAP27 and SCAR proteins regulate cell division through a similar pathway. In conclusion, our data reveal a plant-specific function of VAP27-regulated ER–PM interaction and advance our understanding of plant ER–PM contact site and its role in cell division.",

          "abstract": "In most eukaryotic organisms, cells that rely on continuous cell division employ the enzyme telomerase which replenishes chromosome termini through the addition of telomeric repeats. In budding yeast, the telomerase holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic core associated with two regulatory subunits, Est1 and Est3. The Est1 protein binds a telomere-specific RPA-like complex to recruit telomerase to chromosome ends. However, the regulatory function of the Est3 subunit has remained elusive. We report here that an interaction between Est3 and the canonical RPA complex is required for in vivo telomerase function, as revealed by mutations in RPA2 that confer an Est (Ever shorter telomeres) phenotype, characteristic of a defect in the telomerase pathway. Binding between RPA and telomerase, which is supported by compensatory charge-swap mutations in EST3 and RPA2 , utilizes a surface on Est3 that is structurally analogous to an interface on the human TPP1 protein that is required for telomerase processivity. Mutations in a subset of conserved DNA contact residues in RPA also result in short telomeres and senescence, which we show is due to a requirement for DNA binding after RPA interacts with telomerase. We propose that once RPA forms a complex with telomerase, RPA utilizes a subset of DNA-binding domains to stabilize the interaction between the telomerase active site and telomeric substrates, thereby facilitating enzyme processivity. These results, combined with prior observations, show that yeast telomerase interacts with two different high-affinity ssDNA-binding complexes, indicating that management of single-stranded DNA is integral to effective telomerase function.",

These groups—termed biofilms—can act as refuges from environmental disturbances and from biotic threats, including phages. Despite the ubiquity of temperate phages and bacterial biofilms, live propagation of temperate phages within biofilms has not been characterized on cellular spatial scales. Here, we leverage several approaches to track temperate phages and distinguish between lytic and lysogenic host infections. We determine that lysogeny within Escherichia coli biofilms initially occurs within a predictable region of cell group packing architecture on the biofilm periphery. Because lysogens are generally found on the periphery of large cell groups, where lytic viral infections also reduce local biofilm structural integrity, lysogens are predisposed to disperse into the passing liquid and are overrepresented in downstream biofilms formed from the dispersal pool of the original biofilm-phage system. Comparing our results with those for virulent phages reveals that temperate phages have unique advantages in propagating over long spatial and time scales within and among bacterial biofilms.",

          "abstract": "While the release of sterile males has been highly successful in suppressing some pest populations, it is impractical for many species due to the males disappearing after a single generation, necessitating large, repeated releases to maintain sufficient impact. Synthetic gene drives promise more efficient approaches since they can increase in frequency from rare, yet this also allows them to spread across a landscape, which may not always be desired. Between these two extremes are selectively neutral genetic constructs which persist at the frequency they are released, offering the potential for efficient suppression that remains localized. One way to achieve this would be to have perfect balance, at all construct frequencies, between gene drive increasing frequency and selection decreasing it. Here, we describe a way to closely approximate this balance using a toxin–antidote genetic construct that causes recessive lethality or sterility, encodes a genomic editor that makes dominant lethal or sterile edits in the genome, and provides protection against the action or consequences of the editing. Computer modeling shows that this design can be 100-fold more efficient than sterile males, increasing to 1,000-fold when released alongside a genetic booster. We describe designs for CRISPR-based molecular construction, including options that avoid using recoded genes as antidotes.",

The formation of open burrows may have increased bioirrigation in the uppermost sediment zone, promoting ventilation and generating an ecosystem engineering feedback loop between bioturbation and pore-water oxygenation.

          "abstract": "The tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau has been influenced by continental collision and postcollisional convergence of Indian and Eurasian plates, both of which have undoubtedly imposed their imprints on the lithosphere and upper-mantle structures beneath the collision zone. However, the mode by which the Indian Plate has subducted beneath Tibet, and its driving forces, have been highly uncertain. Here, we present seismic evidence from a full-waveform tomographic model that reveals flat subduction of the Indian Plate beneath nearly the entire plateau at ∼ 300 km depth, implying that the slab may have transitioned to positive/neutral buoyancy and is no longer capable of supporting steep-angle deep subduction. The horizontal distance over which the flat slab slides northward increases from west (where it collides with the Tarim lithospheric keel) to east (where it has resided approximately north of the Songpan-Ganzi Fold Belt beyond the Qiangtang Block). The Asian lithosphere is subducting beneath northeastern Tibet without colliding with the Indian slab. The low-velocity zone, with a thickness of 50 to 110 km, sandwiched between the Tibetan crust and Indian slab, is positively correlated with the high-elevation, low-relief topography of Tibet, suggesting partial melting of the uppermost mantle that has facilitated the growth and flatness of the plateau by adding buoyant material to its base. We propose that deep mantle convective currents, traced to the Réunion plume and imaged as large-scale low-velocity anomalies from the upper mantle under the Indian Plate downward toward the uppermost lower mantle under the Baikal-Mongolia Plateau, are the primary force driving the ongoing India–Asia postcollisional convergence.",

Increasing evidence suggests that ACC can also act independently of ethylene to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we explore the effects of ACC on Arabidopsis thaliana root growth and the mechanisms by which it acts. ACC inhibits growth of the primary root in Arabidopsis seedlings when ethylene signaling is blocked, which becomes evident after 36 h of treatment with ACC. This reduced root growth is in part the result of suppressed cell proliferation in the root meristem resulting from altered expression of a key regulator of stem cell niche activity, WOX5. ACC also promotes lateral root (LR) development, in contrast to ethylene, which inhibits LR formation. Transcriptomic analysis of roots revealed no significant changes in gene expression after 45 min or 4 h of ACC treatment, but longer treatment times revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes, including the downregulation of the expression of a small group of phylogenetically related CLE peptides. Reduced expression of these group 1 CLEs in response to ACC leads to the activation of a transcription factor, LBD18, which promotes LR development. These results suggest that ACC acts to modulate multiple aspects of Arabidopsis root growth independently of ethylene via distinct transcriptional effects in the root meristem and LR precursor cells.",

Here, we present the first comprehensive metatranscriptomic study of RNA viruses in Lake Nam Co, a high-altitude alkaline saline lake on the Tibetan Plateau. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based homology searches, we identified 742 RNA virus species, including 383 novel genus-level groups and 84 novel family-level groups exclusively found in Lake Nam Co. These findings significantly expand the known diversity of the Orthornavirae , uncovering evolutionary adaptations such as permutated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs and distinct RNA secondary structures. Notably, 14 additional RNA virus families potentially infecting prokaryotes were predicted, broadening the known host range of RNA viruses and questioning the traditional assumption that RNA viruses predominantly target eukaryotes. The presence of auxiliary metabolic genes in viral genomes suggested that RNA viruses (families f . 0102 and Nam-Co_family_51) exploit host energy production mechanisms in energy-limited alpine lakes. Low nucleotide diversity, single nucleotide polymorphism frequencies, and pN/pS ratios indicate strong purifying selection in Nam Co viral populations. Our findings offer insights into RNA virus evolution and ecology, highlighting the importance of extreme environments in uncovering hidden viral diversity and further shed light into their potential ecological implications, particularly in the context of climate change.",

Although the biosynthetic pathways of ginkgolides have been partly uncovered, the mechanism regulating their biosynthesis is still largely unknown. Here, using multiomic and genetic analyses, we report the identification of a transcription factor, named ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH GINKGOLIDE BIOSYNTHESIS (GbEAG), as a critical regulator of ginkgolide biosynthesis. GbEAG is highly expressed in the roots of G. biloba, and its expression is significantly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Ginkgolide content was significantly increased in roots by overexpressing GbEAG using a “cut-dip-regeneration” system. GbEAG positively regulates ginkgolide biosynthesis by directly binding to the GCC-boxes in the promoter regions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ginkgolides, such as ISOPENTENYL DIPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE ( GbIDI ) and CYTOCHROME P450 7005C3 ( GbCYP7005C3 ). GbEAG mediates the jasmonic acid (JA)-activated ginkgolide synthesis through its direct interaction with the JASMONATE ZINC-FINGER INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM DOMAIN 3 (GbJAZ3) repressor. Importantly, we also found that the central light-response regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (GbHY5) mediates light induction of ginkgolide biosynthesis by binding to the G-box in the GbEAG promoter.

          "abstract": "Microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) are microtubule-associated proteins that bind to tubulin from the luminal side. MIPs can be found in axonemes to stabilize flagellar beat or within cytoplasmic microtubules. Plasmodium spp. are the causative agents of malaria that feature different parasite forms across a complex life cycle with both unique and divergent microtubule-based arrays. Here, we investigate four MIPs in a rodent malaria parasite for their role in transmission to and from the mosquito. We show by single and double gene deletions that SPM1 and TrxL1, MIPs associated with subpellicular microtubules, are dispensable for transmission from the vertebrate host to the mosquito and back. In contrast, FAP20 and FAP52, MIPs associated with the axonemes of gametes, are essential for transmission to mosquitoes but only if both genes are deleted. In the absence of both FAP20 and FAP52, the B-tubule of the axoneme partly detaches from the A-tubule, resulting in the deficiency of axonemal beating and hence gamete formation and egress. Our data suggest that a high level of redundancy ensures microtubule stability in the transmissive stages of Plasmodium , which is important for parasite transmission.",

          "abstract": "The polyketide synthases (PKSs) in microbes and the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthases in humans (FASs) are related enzymes that have been well studied. As a result, there is a paradigm explaining in general terms how FASs repeatedly use a set of enzymatic domains to produce simple fats, while PKSs use the domains in a much more complex manner to produce pharmaceuticals and other elaborate molecules. However, most animals also have PKSs that do not conform to the rules described in microbes, including a large family of enzymes that bridge fatty acid and polyketide metabolism, the animal FAS-like PKSs (AFPKs). Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structures of two AFPKs from sea slugs. While the AFPK resemble mammalian FASs, their chemical products mimic those of PKSs in complexity. How then does the architecture of AFPKs facilitate this structural complexity? Unexpectedly, chemical complexity is controlled not solely by the enzymatic domains but is aided by the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a shuttle that moves intermediates between these domains. We observed interactions between enzyme domains and the linker-ACP domain, which, when manipulated, altered the kinetic properties of the enzyme to change the resulting chemical products. This unveils elaborate mechanisms and enzyme motions underlying lipid and polyketide biochemistry across the domains of life.",

Some information is much more salient for the decision at hand and merits closer scrutiny. The inattention decision model formalizes this choice and deduces how best to navigate through the potentially vast array of data when making decisions. In the rational formulation, the decision-maker commits fully to a subjective prior distribution over the possible states of the world that could be realized. We relax this assumption and look for a robustly optimal solution to the inattention problem by allowing the decision-maker to be ambiguity averse with respect to this prior. We feature a setup that is deliberately simple by a) assuming a discrete set of choices, b) using Shannon’s mutual information to quantify attention costs, and c) imposing relative entropy with respect to a baseline probability distribution to quantify prior divergence. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust solution and develop numerical methods to solve it. In comparison to the rational solution with no prior uncertainty, our decision-maker slants priors in more cautious or pessimistic directions when deducing how to allocate attention over the range of available information. This approach implements a form of robustness to prior misspecification, or equivalently, a form of ambiguity aversion. We explore some examples that show how the robust solution differs from the rational solution with a commitment to a subjective prior distribution and how it differs from imposing risk aversion.",

However, certain proteins may fold into two or more conformations from single amino acid sequences.

An SSP was engineered by fusing GFP lacking the C-terminal β-strand and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) lacking the N-terminal β-strand with an overlapping linker, which can be competitively incorporated into either the GFP or the DHFR moiety. In vivo and biochemical analyses, including atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, demonstrated that the SSP adopts two alternative conformations, which can be biased by point mutations and ligand binding. The drastic conformational change upon the ligand binding was directly visualized by high-speed AFM. Furthermore, the balance of the seesaw can be reversibly changed depending on buffer conditions. In summary, our design strategy for SSP provides a unique direction for creating artificial proteins with on–off behaviors.",

Many genetic ripening regulators have been identified, especially in the model system tomato, yet more remain to be discovered and integrated into comprehensive regulatory models. Most tomato ripening genes have been studied in pericarp tissue, though recent evidence indicates that locule tissue is a site of early ripening-gene activities. Here, we identified and functionally characterized an Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) gene, SlERF.D6 , by investigating tomato transcriptome data throughout plant development, emphasizing genes elevated in the locule during fruit development and ripening. SlERF.D6 loss-of-function mutants resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing delayed ripening initiation and carotenoid accumulation in both pericarp and locule tissues. Transcriptome analysis of lines altered in SlERF.D6 expression revealed multiple classes of altered genes including ripening regulators, in addition to carotenoid, cell wall, and ethylene pathway genes, suggesting comprehensive ripening control. Distinct regulatory patterns in pericarp versus locule tissues were observed, indicating tissue-specific activity of this transcription factor (TF). Analysis of SlERF.D6 interaction with target promoters revealed an APETALA 2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) TF ( SlDEAR2 ) as a target of SlERF.D6. Furthermore, we show that a third TF gene, SlTCP12 , is a target of SlDEAR2, presenting a tricomponent module of ripening control residing in the larger SlERF.D6 regulatory network.",

PAHs/PACs are the most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco smoke, and cigarette use during pregnancy can convey these molecules to the developing fetus through the placenta. This exposure is associated with many negative health outcomes, from premature birth to sudden infant death syndrome and adverse neurodevelopmental disorders. This study demonstrates the use of surface-enhanced Raman and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopies for direct detection of PAHs/PACs in human placental tissue. We applied two spectroscopy-informed machine learning algorithms, Characteristic Peak Extraction (CaPE) and Characteristic Peak Similarity (CaPSim), to identify the specific PAHs and PACs present in the placenta of women who smoked tobacco cigarettes in pregnancy compared to spectra of the placenta from self-reported nonsmokers. CaPE and CaPSim analysis enabled a clear distinction between these two groups. Independent verification was accomplished by detecting PAH-DNA and PAC-DNA adducts in the smoking group by means of a 32 P-postlabeling assay. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining surface-enhanced spectroscopies with informed ML analysis for the streamlined detection of hazardous environmental compounds in human tissues, suggesting broader applications in clinical diagnostics and public health surveillance.",

          "abstract": "Male germ cells, which are responsible for producing millions of genetically diverse sperm through meiosis in the testis, rely on lactate as their central energy metabolite. Recent study has revealed that lactate induces epigenetic modification in cells through histone lysine lactylation. Here, we report dynamic histone lactylation at histone H4-lysine 5 (K5), -K8, and -K12 during meiosis prophase I in mouse spermatogenesis. By profiling the genome-wide occupancy of histone H4-K8 lactylation (H4K8la), which peaks at zygotene, our data show that H4K8la mark is observed at the promoters of genes exhibiting active expression with Gene Ontology functions enriched for meiosis. Notably, our data also demonstrate that H4K8la is closely associated with recombination hotspots, where machinery involved in the processing DNA double-stranded breaks, such as SPO11, DMC1, RAD51, and RPA2, is engaged. In addition, H4K8la was also detected at the meiosis-specific cohesion sites (marked by RAD21L and REC8) flanking the recombination hotspots. Functionally, our data show that lactate induces upregulation of key meiotic genes through H4K8la modifications. Additionally, H4K8la shows colocalization and interaction with PRDM9 at recombination hotspots. Finally, our data show that HBO1, a lactyltransferase, is highly expressed in meiotic germ cells. In vitro lactylation assays reveal that HBO1 induces H4K8la, and pharmacological inhibition of HBO1 in mice reduces H4K8la levels and disrupts meiosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that histone lactylation serves as an epigenetic mechanism that is involved in meiotic gene expression and recombination in male germ cells during spermatogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are large intracellular macromolecular assemblies that play a critical role in cell polarization and migration. Talin serves as a direct connection between integrin receptor and actomyosin cytoskeleton within FAs. Talin contains three actin-binding sites (ABS1-3) that engage discreetly during the development of FAs, thus acting as a critical player in FA initiation and maturation. However, the molecular basis of the ABS–F-actin interactions remains unknown. Here, we explore interactions of ABSs with F-actin to understand the multivalent behavior of talin. Particularly, the cryo-EM structure of the F-actin–ABS3 complex at 2.9 Å shows ABS3 spanning through two actin monomers along the filament axis, each occupied by the R13 rod subdomain and the DD domain. The dimerization of ABS3 occurs through the DD domain where both protomers interact on the actin surface, and the dimerization of talin to the actin surface is necessary for the engagement to F-actin. The R13 helical bundle is distorted upon binding to F-actin and releases the H1 helix from the rest of the bundle. This phenomenon has also been observed with other tension-sensing proteins like vinculin and α-catenin, highlighting that unfolding is relevant for its force sensing activity. On the contrary, ABS2 (R4R8 subdomains), which is thought to be critical for the maintenance of mature FAs, had multiple F-actin-binding regions within ABS2 and the binding likely occurred by these subdomains running through the surface of F-actin, thus strengthening the interactions upon the maturation of FAs.",

Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a specific subtype of meditative practice, involves focusing one’s attention on thoughts of well-being for oneself and others. Meditation has been proven to be beneficial in a variety of settings, including therapeutic applications, but the neural activity underlying meditative practices and their positive effects are not well understood. It has been difficult to understand the contribution of deep limbic structures given the difficulty of studying neural activity directly in the human brain. Here, we leverage a unique patient population, epilepsy patients chronically implanted with responsive neurostimulation devices that allow chronic, invasive electrophysiology recording to investigate the physiological correlates of LKM in the amygdala and hippocampus of novice meditators. We find that LKM-associated changes in physiological activity were specific to periodic, but not aperiodic, features of neural activity. LKM was associated with an increase in γ (30 to 55 Hz) power and an alternation in the duration of β (13 to 30 Hz) and γ oscillatory bursts in both the amygdala and hippocampus, two regions associated with mood disorders. These findings reveal the nature of LKM-induced modulation of limbic activity in first-time meditators.",

          "abstract": "Perception and action are inherently entangled: our world view is shaped by how we explore our environment through complex and variable self-motion. Even when fixating stable stimuli, our eyes undergo small, involuntary movements. Fixational eye movements (FEM) render a stable world jittery on our retinae, which can be expected to harm neural coding. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that FEM help rather than harm human perception of fine detail. Here, we elucidate this paradox by uncovering under which conditions FEM improve or impair retinal coding and human acuity. We combine theory and experiment: model accuracy is directly compared to that of healthy human subjects in a visual acuity task. Acuity is modeled by applying an ideal Bayesian classifier to simulations of retinal spiking activity in the presence of FEM. In addition, empirical FEM are monitored using high-resolution eye-tracking by an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. FEM introduce variability in retinal ganglion cell activity, but they also effectively preprocess inputs to facilitate retinal information encoding. Based on an interplay of these mechanisms, our model predicts a relation between visual acuity, FEM amplitude, and single-trial stimulus size that quantitatively accounts for experimental observations and captures the beneficial effect of FEM. Moreover, we observe that while human subjects’ FEM statistics vary with stimulus size, our model suggests that subjects’ FEM amplitude remains within a near-optimal range, where acuity is enhanced compared to much larger or smaller amplitudes. Overall, our findings indicate that perception benefits from action even at the fine spatiotemporal scale of FEM.",

Developing antibody drugs with broad-spectrum and high efficiency is a long-term task. It is promising but challenging to develop therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) through in vitro evolution based on antigen–antibody binding interactions. From an early B cell antibody repertoire, we isolated antibody 8G3 that retains its nonregressive neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1 and various other strains in vitro. 8G3 protected ACE2 transgenic mice from BA.1 and WA1/2020 virus infection without adverse clinical manifestations and completely cleared viral load in the lungs. Similar to most IGHV3–53 antibodies, the binding sites of 8G3 and ACE2 largely overlap, enabling competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. By comprehensively considering the binding free energy changes of the antigen–antibody complexes, the biological environment of their interactions, and the evolutionary direction of the antibodies, we were able to select 50 mutants. Among them, 11 were validated by experiments showing better neutralizing activities. Further, a combination of four mutations were identified in 8G3 that increased its neutralization potency against JN.1, the latest Omicron mutant, by approximately 1,500-fold, and one of the mutations led to an improvement in activity against multiple variants to a certain extent. Together, we established a procedure of rapid selection of neutralizing antibodies with potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity. Our results provide a reference for engineering neutralizing antibodies against future SARS-CoV-2 variants and even other pandemic viruses.",

While recent studies have significantly advanced the understanding of seagrass wave attenuation in pure-wave conditions, the presence of a current introduces several complications that have yet to be fully explored. In the present study, we quantify the wave attenuation of seagrass canopies in the presence of a current parallel to the direction of wave propagation via experiments conducted with dynamically scaled mimics of seagrass installed in a laboratory flume facility. The dataset we present is the largest of its kind and spans a broad range of wave properties, current velocities, water depths, and plant densities for a total of over 300 experiments. Using our experimental results, we show that the commonly employed approach of modeling wave attenuation as a result of vegetation drag works well for a range of conditions but underpredicts systematically when turbulence generated by the interaction between the seagrass canopy and the current is sufficiently strong. We then employ phenomenological arguments and experimental data to identify a nondimensional parameter that effectively quantifies the relative importance of turbulence and drag in dictating the overall observed wave attenuation. Moreover, we propose a simple but physically based modeling approach that is consistent with the proposed phenomenology and can be used for applications in coastal waters.",

Here, we study the evaporation dynamics of a tricomponent liquid film, consisting of water, ethanol, and trans-anethole oil (known as “ouzo”). With the preferential evaporation of ethanol, cellular convective structures are observed both in the thermal patterns and in the nucleated oil droplet patterns. However, the feature sizes of these two patterns can differ, indicating dual instability mechanisms dominated by either temperature or solute concentration. Using numerical simulations, we quantitatively compare the contributions of temperature and solute concentration on the surface tension. Our results reveal that the thermal Marangoni effect predominates at the initial evaporation stage, resulting in cellular patterns in thermal images, while the solutal Marangoni effect gradually becomes dominant. By regulating the transition time of this thermal-solutal-induced bistability and the nucleation time of oil microdroplets in the ternary mixture, the oil droplet patterns can be well controlled. This capability not only enhances our understanding of the evaporation dynamics but also paves the way for precise manipulation of nucleation and deposition processes at larger scales.",

          "abstract": "HflX is a highly conserved ribosome-associated GTPase implicated in rescuing stalled ribosomes and mediating antibiotic resistance in several bacteria, including macrolide-lincosamide antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Mycobacterial HflXs carry a distinct N-terminal extension (NTE) and a small insertion, as compared to their eubacterial homologs. Here, we present several high-resolution cryo-EM structures of mycobacterial HflX in complex with the 70S ribosome and its 50S subunit, with and without antibiotics. These structures reveal a distinct mechanism for HflX-mediated ribosome splitting and antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria. Our findings indicate that the NTE of mycobacterial HflX induces persistent disordering of multiple 23S rRNA helices, facilitating the dissociation of the 70S ribosome and generating an inactive pool of 50S subunits. During this process, HflX undergoes a large conformational change that stabilizes its NTE. Mycobacterial HflX also acts as an anti-association factor by binding to predissociated 50S subunits. Our structures show that a mycobacteria-specific insertion in HflX reaches far into the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), such that it would overlap with the ribosome-bound macrolide antibiotics. However, in the presence of antibiotics, this insertion retracts, adjusts around, and interacts with the antibiotic molecules. These results suggest that mycobacterial HflX is agnostic to antibiotic presence in the PTC. It mediates antibiotic resistance by splitting antibiotic-stalled 70S ribosomes and inactivating the resulting 50S subunits.",

          "abstract": "Mec1 plays an essential role in both the DNA damage response and glucose starvation–induced autophagy. We recently reported that Mec1 regulates glucose starvation–induced autophagy through its direct binding to Atg13. However, the role of Mec1’s kinase activity in autophagy remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the kinase activity of Mec1 is required for glucose starvation–induced autophagy by regulating the phagophore assembly site (PAS) recruitment of Atg9 vesicles. Mechanistic and functional analyses identified Atg9 as a direct phosphorylation substrate of Mec1, with phosphorylation occurring at the S35, T203, and T243 sites. Mutations at these sites reduce the association of Atg9 with Atg17, Atg23, and Atg27, thereby impairing the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles. Notably, we found that the Mec1–Atg13 binding is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of Atg9 by Mec1. Furthermore, Mec1-mediated phosphorylation of Atg9 is also crucial for the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles in response to DNA damage. We thus propose that Mec1’s kinase activity regulates the PAS recruitment of Atg9 vesicles by phosphorylating Atg9 in response to energy stress and DNA damage.",

          "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales have the largest known RNA genomes of vertebrate and invertebrate viruses with 36.7 and 41.1 kb, respectively. The acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) by an ancestral nidovirus enabled crossing of the 20 kb barrier. Other factors constraining genome size variations in nidoviruses remain poorly defined. We assemble 76 genome sequences of invertebrate nidoviruses from &gt;500.000 published transcriptome experiments and triple the number of known nidoviruses with &gt;36 kb genomes, including a 64 kb RNA genome. Many of the identified viral lineages acquired putative enzymatic and other protein domains linked to genome size, host phyla, or virus families. The inserted domains may regulate viral replication and virion formation, or modulate infection otherwise. We classify ExoN-encoding nidoviruses into seven groups and four subgroups, according to canonical and noncanonical modes of viral replicase expression by ribosomes and genomic organization (reModes). The most-represented group employing the canonical reMode comprises invertebrate and vertebrate nidoviruses, including coronaviruses. Six groups with noncanonical reModes include invertebrate nidoviruses with 31-to-64 kb genomes. Among them are viruses with segmented genomes and viruses utilizing dual ribosomal frameshifting that we validate experimentally. Moreover, largest polyprotein length and genome size in nidoviruses show reMode- and host phylum-dependent relationships. We hypothesize that the polyprotein length increase in nidoviruses may be limited by the host-inherent translation fidelity, ultimately setting a nidovirus genome size limit. Thus, expansion of ExoN-encoding RNA virus genomes, the vertebrate/invertebrate host division, the control of viral replicase expression, and translation fidelity are interconnected.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying viral load, a key indicator required to achieve control and elimination of the HIV epidemic, requires cell-free plasma or serum to ensure measurements are not biased by proviral DNA contained in infected CD4 T lymphocytes. Plasma separation cards (PSC) collect and preserve a dried specimen, which makes them practical solutions for decentralized sample collection and transport in limited-resource settings. However, physiological variations in hematocrit levels can introduce significant variability in the quality of plasma generated by commercial PSCs and can lead to inaccurate test results and clinical decisions. In addition to hematocrit-dependent sampling, the Roche PSC, a standard for dried plasma collection, is known to induce considerable hemolysis, which further impacts specimen quality, concordance with liquid plasma, and the overall benefit of microsampling. We address these gaps with a patterned dried plasma spot (pDPS) card, which generates plasma with improved hematocrit independence and minimal hemolysis. This study directly compares pDPS cards to the Roche PSC to measure HIV viral load. Analysis of viral load from 75 donors revealed strong agreement in sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and viral load band placement between devices, with quantitative metrics suggesting improved performance for pDPS cards. In reflexive genotyping, remnant dried blood from pDPS cards exhibited greater success than Roche PSC in amplification and sequencing (71% vs. 62%) and detecting drug resistance mutations (63% vs. 42%). Based on this performance, pDPS cards can be versatile across multiple analytical platforms, integrate seamlessly into existing clinical laboratory workflows, and aid clinicians in making accurate treatment decisions.",

Zymocin is encoded by a killer plasmid or virus-like element (VLE), which is a linear DNA molecule located in the cytosol. We hypothesized that a tRNA-cleaving toxin similar to zymocin may have caused the three parallel changes to the nuclear genetic code that occurred during yeast evolution, in which the codon CUG became translated as Ser or Ala instead of Leu. However, zymocin-like toxins are rare — both among species, and among strains within a species —and only four toxins of this type have previously been discovered. Here, we identified 45 zymocin-like toxin genes in Saccharomycotina, the budding yeast subphylum, using a bioinformatics strategy, and verified that many of them are toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae when expressed. Some of the toxin genes are located on cytosolic VLEs, whereas others are on VLE-derived DNA integrated into the nuclear genome. The toxins are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and show evidence of positive selection. Toxin genes were found in five taxonomic orders of budding yeasts, including two of the three orders that reassigned CUG codons, indicating that VLEs have been parasites of yeast species for at least 300 My and that their existence predates the genetic code changes.",

Despite their severe ototoxicity, causing irreversible hearing loss in millions of people annually, no preventive therapy has been approved. We previously reported that GABARAP and several other central autophagy proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss. This finding opens avenues for the rational design and development of inhibitors that selectively target proteins in this pathway, thereby mitigating AG ototoxicity. In this study, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion of GABARAPL1, a homolog of GABARAP, and another model deficient in both GABARAP and GABARAPL1. We found that normal hearing is unaffected by the depletion of these proteins. Remarkably, both proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss, with GABARAP playing a more significant role. To further explore the therapeutic potential, we designed and validated short hairpin RNAs targeting the mouse and human GABARAP gene. By inhibiting GABARAP expression in inner ear hair cells using adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, we successfully prevented AG-induced hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss. Our findings underscore the critical role of GABARAP in AG ototoxicity and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing AG-induced hearing loss.",

          "abstract": "The house mouse X and Y chromosomes have recently acquired multicopy, rapidly evolving gene families representing an evolutionary arms race. This arms race between proteins encoded by X-linked Slxl1 / Slx and Y-linked Sly gene families can distort offspring sex ratio, but how these proteins compete remains unknown. Here, we report how Slxl1 / Slx and Sly encoded proteins compete in a protein family–specific and dose-dependent manner using yeast. Specifically, SLXL1 competes with SLY1 and SLY2 for binding to the Spindlin SPIN1. Similarly, SLX competes with SLY2 for binding the Spindlin SSTY2. These competitions are driven by the N termini of SLXL1, SLX, SLY1, and SLY2 binding to the third Tudor domains of SPIN1 and SSTY2. SLY1 and SLY2 form homo- and heterodimers, suggesting that the competition is between complex multimers. Residues under positive selection mapping to the interaction domains and rapid exon gain/loss are consistent with competition between the X- and Y-linked gene families. Our findings support a model in which dose-dependent competition of these X- and Y-linked encoded proteins to bind Spindlins occurs in haploid X- and Y-spermatids to influence X- versus Y-sperm fitness and thus sex ratio.",

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power due to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations reveal a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, they appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude to those measured geodetically, thereby providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance.

          "abstract": "Some plants have massive sex-linked regions. To test hypotheses about their evolution, we sequenced the genome of Silene latifolia , in which giant heteromorphic sex chromosomes were first discovered in 1923. It has long been known that the Y chromosome consists mainly of a male-specific region that does not recombine with the X chromosome and carries the sex-determining genes and genes with other male functions. However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination. We describe the genomic changes as the ancestral chromosome evolved into the current XY pair, testing ideas about the evolution of large nonrecombining regions and the mechanisms that created the present recombination pattern.",

Here, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β-cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β-cell identity following loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.",

In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range. These features effectively shield the shrimp from harmful high-frequency stress waves generated by cavitation bubble collapse events during impact.",

Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.",

Evolutionary histories and functional ecology are well understood only for vertebrates, whereas research on invertebrates is largely limited to species descriptions and some studies on environmental tolerances. Knowledge on Antarctic vegetation cover showcases the challenges of characterizing population trends for most groups. Recent community-level microbial studies have provided insights into the functioning of life at its limits. Overall, biotic interactions remain largely unknown across all groups, restricted to basic information on trophic level placement. Insufficient knowledge of many groups limits the understanding of ecological processes on the continent. Remedies for the current situation rely on identifying the caveats of each ecological discipline and finding targeted solutions.

Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law.

If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.",

Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo-EM analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering its N -myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes PI3P production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and to promote the activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex.",

This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses.

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions.",

          "abstract": "The mechanism for neurological deficits from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is unclear. In a series of 150 patients with CO poisoning, we found marked elevations of blood-borne inflammatory filamentous (F-) actin–coated microparticles (MPs), neutrophil activation, and a 90% reduction in the normal level of plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a protein capable of lysing F-actin–coated MPs. This led to studies in a murine model where the same events occur and cause neuroinflammation with cognitive dysfunction. All events are recapitulated when F-actin MPs are injected intravenously, which establishes a blood-to-brain-to-blood inflammatory cycle that persists for weeks. All changes, including cognitive dysfunction, can be abrogated by an injection of human recombinant pGSN within 2 weeks after CO poisoning. These findings demonstrate that CO-induced neurological injury has an inflammatory etiology. Because of MP-mediated communications between the brain and systemic circulation, CO-induced cognitive deficits may be reversible with a pharmaceutical intervention.",

The potential influence of the gut microbiota on MAIT cell homing to different regions of the human gut is also discussed. Last, we introduce how organoid technology offers a potentially valuable approach to advance our understanding of MAIT cell tissue homing by providing a more physiologically relevant model that mimics the human gut tissue. These models may enable a detailed investigation of the gut-specific homing mechanisms of MAIT cells. By understanding the regulation of MAIT cell homing to the human gut, potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting gut inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may emerge.",

We show that Asgard ESCRT-IIIB assembles into parallel arrays on planar membranes to initiate membrane deformation, from where it recruits ESCRT-IIIA to generate composite polymers. Last, we show that Asgard ESCRT-IIIA is able to remodel membranes into tubes as a likely prelude to scission.

A fundamental question in understanding the plasma dynamics is how energy is transported and dissipated across scales. Here, we present spacecraft measurements in the terrestrial foreshock, a region upstream of the bow shock where the solar wind population coexists with the reflected ions. In this region, the fluid-scale, ultralow-frequency waves resonate with the reflected ions to modify the velocity distributions, which in turn cause the growth of the ion-scale, magnetosonic-whistler waves. The latter waves then resonate with the electrons, and the accelerated electrons contribute to the excitation of electron-scale, high-frequency whistler waves. These observations demonstrate that the chain of wave-particle resonances is an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer, which could redistribute the kinetic energy and accelerate the particles upstream of the shocks.",

          "abstract": "Nucleosomes at promoters of active genes are marked by specific histone post-translational modifications and histone variants. These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the process of transcription coordinates the removal of these modifications to limit gene activity.",

          "abstract": "Metamorphosis is an important way for insects to adapt to the environment. In this process, larval tissue destruction regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and adult tissue reconstruction regulated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) occur simultaneously, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A ( Cpt1a ) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis.",

DMS is a particle method that uses quantum mechanically derived interaction potentials to simulate molecular collisions within a flow field. Since these interaction potentials are the only modeling inputs used in the simulation, all flow features can solely be attributed to the ab initio potential energy surfaces. Hence, providing a comparison of a hypersonic ground test and numerical data anchored to quantum mechanics. The fundamental nature of DMS is leveraged to investigate molecular level mechanisms prevalent in the flow, and comparisons with lower fidelity simulations are presented to highlight the role of these first principles calculations as benchmark solutions.",

Here, we propose a compact reconfigurable neuron design using the intrinsic dynamics of a NbO 2 -based spiking unit and excellent tunability in an electrochemical memory (ECRAM) to emulate the fast-slow dynamics in a bio-plausible neuron. The resistance of the ECRAM was effective in tuning the temporal dynamics of the membrane potential, contributing to flexible reconfiguration of various bio-plausible firing modes, such as phasic and burst spiking, and exhibiting adaptive spiking behaviors in changing environment. We used the bio-plausible neuron model to build spiking neural networks with bursting neurons and demonstrated improved classification accuracies over simplified models, showing great promises for use in more bio-plausible neuromorphic computing systems.",

          "abstract": "Cells sense and integrate multiple signals to coordinate a response. A receptor-kinase signaling pathway for plant stomatal development shares components with the immunity pathway. The mechanism ensuring their signal specificities remains unclear. Using chemical genetics, here, we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development. This cross-regulation depends on the immune receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2) and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Proliferating stomatal lineage cells are vulnerable to this immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by mitogen-activated protein kinase homeostasis, reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing an unanticipated view on signal specificity.",

This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by assessing the contribution of LD-loaded brain macrophages, including microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), in an AD mouse model. Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c + microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1 + brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/ Fit2 i Δ M φ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1 + BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.",

Although Bayesian inference serves as an abstract framework of cortical computation, precisely mapping concrete instantiations of computational models to biology under real-world tasks is necessary to produce falsifiable neural models. On the basis of a recent generative model, recursive cortical networks, that demonstrated excellent performance on vision benchmarks, we derive a theoretical cortical microcircuit by placing the requirements of the computational model within biological constraints. The derived model suggests precise algorithmic roles for the columnar and laminar feed-forward, feedback, and lateral connections, the thalamic pathway, blobs and interblobs, and the innate lineage-specific interlaminar connectivity within cortical columns. The model also explains several visual phenomena, including the subjective contour effect and neon-color spreading effect, with circuit-level precision.

          "abstract": "Intracellular bacterial infections and antimicrobial resistance are threatening global public health systems. Antimicrobial peptides are a potential solution to combat bacterial resistance, but the design of self-assembled nanopeptides with dual functions of cell penetration and antibacterial properties to combat intracellular bacteria remains a challenge. Here, we propose a strategy to develop self-assembled nanopeptides with dual functions through the chimerization of self-assembled core, hydrophobic motif, and cell-permeable unit. The optimal nanopeptides, F3FT and N3FT, exhibited potent antibacterial activity and excellent biocompatibility. Crucially, F3FT and N3FT are able to efficiently penetrate cells and eliminate intracellular bacteria and sniping inflammation. Moreover, F3FT and N3FT kill bacteria mainly by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inducing excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species. F3FT and N3FT have exhibited good safety and potent therapeutic potential in vivo. This scheme of constructing nanopeptides through multifunctional domains design provides a paradigm for dealing with escalating of intracellular bacteria and antimicrobial resistance.",

Although nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such as t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t -SNE) have been developed, their implementation in simple biological circuits remains unclear. Here, we develop a biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithm compatible with t -SNE, which uses a simple three-layer feedforward network mimicking the Drosophila olfactory circuit. The proposed learning rule, described as three-factor Hebbian plasticity, is effective for datasets such as entangled rings and MNIST, comparable to t -SNE. We further show that the algorithm could be working in olfactory circuits in Drosophila by analyzing the multiple experimental data in previous studies. We lastly suggest that the algorithm is also beneficial for association learning between inputs and rewards, allowing the generalization of these associations to other inputs not yet associated with rewards.",

Two hallmarks of efficiency, Menzerath’s law and Zipf’s law of abbreviation, predict that longer sequences will consist of shorter elements and more frequent elements will be shorter, respectively. Here, we assessed the evidence for both laws in cetaceans by analyzing vocal sequences from 16 baleen and toothed whale species and comparing them to 51 human languages. Eleven whale species exhibit Menzerath’s law, sometimes with greater effect sizes than human speech. Two of the five whale species with categorized element types exhibit Zipf’s law of abbreviation. On average, whales also tend to shorten elements and intervals toward the end of sequences, although this varies by species. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the vocalizations of many cetacean species have undergone compression for increased efficiency in time.",

Besides, materials require combinations of performance such as load bearing and energy dissipation. However, improving one performance of a material often sacrifices another performance, making it difficult to create materials with optimal performance profiles. Here we report a liquid-infused porous piezoelectric scaffold (LIPPS) that simultaneously enhances its load-bearing and energy dissipation capability under cyclic loading. For example, after 12 million loading cycles, LIPPS increases its modulus by 3600% and hysteresis by 3000%. From a CT study, this behavior is attributed to the self-recoverable mineralization under mechanical loading. Moreover, LIPPS shows a reprogrammable stiffness distribution based on the loading distribution, which enables the material to generate multiple shapes by self-folding. Our findings can contribute toward unprecedented opportunities in soft robotics, vehicles, infrastructure, and tissue engineering and contribute to the new paradigm of material selection with improved resilience and sustainability.",

Dinoflagellates play pivotal roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as major contributors of harmful algal blooms. Despite vital roles of cysts in blooming cycles and dinoflagellate ecology, the molecular processes controlling cyst dormancy have largely remained unexplored due to technological difficulties. Using DinoSL as a dinoflagellates-specific mRNA “hook” and SMRT sequencing, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of sediment-buried dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The data show that most major metabolic and regulatory pathways, except photosynthesis, were transcriptionally active. This suggests the crucial importance of broad metabolic pathways in sustaining cyst viability and germination potential. Further expression analyses of 11 genes (relevant to autophagy and phytohormone gibberellin), lysosome/autolysosome staining, and germination experiments revealed vital roles of autophagy in energy generation, nutrient recycling, and of phytohormones abscisic acid/gibberellin in modulating dormancy/germination of resting cysts.

Both scaffolds can independently recruit PCM proteins, but both are required for proper centrosome assembly, with the Cnn scaffold providing mechanical strength, and the TACC scaffold concentrating centriole and centrosome proteins. Recruiting Spd-2 to synthetic beads injected into early embryos reconstitutes key aspects of mitotic centrosome assembly on the bead surface, and this depends on Spd-2’s ability to recruit Polo and Aurora A. Thus, Spd-2 orchestrates the assembly of two scaffolds, with distinct biophysical properties, that cooperate to build mitotic centrosomes in flies.",

In low-CO 2 scenarios (1.5° and 2°C warming pathways), the suppressive effect of sulfate deposition on wetland methane emissions largely diminishes by 2100 due to clean air policies, with resulting emission increases (7 ± 2 Tg a −1 ) being 35 and 22% of total wetland emission changes.

Across all scenarios, biogeochemical feedbacks can stimulate 30 to 45% of future wetland emission rises.

Furthermore, most systems have carrier mean free paths l mfp shorter than their spin moiré lattice constant a spin , inhibiting miniband formation. Here, we discover that the layered magnetic semimetal EuAg 4 Sb 2 overcomes these challenges by forming an interface with J ~ 100 milli–electron volts transferred between a Eu triangular lattice and anionic Ag 2 Sb bilayers hosting a two-dimensional electron band in the ballistic regime ( l mfp &gt;&gt; a spin ).

To address the slow stiffness change, we propose a VS catheter based on fiber jamming (FJ) that achieves instant stiffness changes (≤300 ms), enabling seamless catheter operations without delays. Moreover, our catheter, incorporating hundreds of ultrathin fibers into a slender 2.3-mm catheter body, achieves up to 6.5-fold stiffness changes. With adequate stiffness change, our two-segment catheter achieves complex bending profiles within seconds. In addition, the FJ-based design does not require electric currents or heating inside the human body, minimizing patient risks.

We used biobanked sera and metagenomic data to reconstruct the transmission of recently discovered bat-associated influenza virus (BIV; H18N11) over 12 years in three zones of Peru. Mechanistic models fit under a Bayesian framework, which enabled joint inference from serological and molecular data, showed that common vampire bats maintain BIV independently of the now assumed fruit bat reservoir through immune waning and seasonal transmission pulses.

Over the likely range of ocean and ice shell thicknesses, we infer a K / C s of 6.3 × 10 −14 s −1 to 2.4 × 10 −10 s −1 , a k 2 /Q of 0.058 to 0.12, and a minimum dissipation factor Q ≈ 5 . Titan’s dissipation parameters are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the Moon’s and suggest an interior with a low effective viscosity.

In Drosophila , postembryonic neurogenesis requires the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) Imp/IGF2BP and Syp/SYNCRIP. However, how they coachieve their function is not well understood. Here, we elucidate the in vivo temporal RNA interactome landscapes of Imp and Syp during larval brain development. Imp and Syp bind a highly overlapping set of conserved mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neurodevelopment. We identify transcripts differentially occupied by Imp/Syp over time, featuring a network of known and previously unknown candidate temporal regulators that are post-transcriptionally regulated by Imp/Syp. Furthermore, the physical and coevolutionary relationships between Imp and Syp binding sites reveal a combinatorial, rather than competitive, mode of molecular interplay. Our study establishes an in vivo framework for dissecting the temporal coregulation of RBP networks as well as providing a resource for understanding neural fate specification.",

This study examines the role of cations in CO 2 R on single-crystal and polycrystalline Au under controlled mass-transport conditions. It establishes that CO 2 adsorption is the rate-determining step regardless of cation type or surface structure. Density functional theory calculations show that electron transfer occurs to a solvated CO 2 -cation complex. A more positive potential of zero charge enhances CO 2 R activity only on Au with similar surface coordination. The symmetry factor (β) of the rate-determining step varies with surface structure and cation identity, with density functional theory calculations indicating β’s sensitivity to surface and double-layer structures. These findings emphasize the importance of both surface and double-layer structures in understanding cation effects on CO 2 R.",

We discovered that restoration of mTOR signaling was the early dominant driver of resistance to Akt inhibition. Mechanistically, this can be achieved through molecular alterations, resulting in loss of negative regulators of mTOR. Unexpectedly, we discovered that this was dominated by restoration of mTOR signaling through the nutrient sensing arm. This can be achieved by loss of the components of the GATOR/KICSTOR complexes or through cellular processes, leading to the recycling of amino acids.

Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance. Fishing mortality came to dominate a time-invariant natural mortality rate and other population characteristics after the 14th century, with minimal evidence of environmental effects at the century scale.

On the basis of quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE on SU( N ) DQCP spin models, we show that for a series of N smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists, which implies that previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points.

However, the mechanism by which DNA damage is sensed and translated into PafBC activation has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to the WYL domains of PafBC activates the transcription factor. Our cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length PafBC in its active conformation, bound to the transcription initiation complex, reveals a previously unknown mode of interaction between the ssDNA and the WYL domains.

Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KNL1 regulates SAC silencing through the direct recruitment of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) to kinetochores. We show that KNL1 interacts with all nine TOPPs via a conserved RVSF motif in its N terminus, and this interaction is required for the proper localization of TOPPs to kinetochores during mitosis. Disrupting KNL1-TOPP interaction leads to persistent SAC activation, resulting in a severe metaphase arrest and defects in plant growth and development.

We show that several NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) exhibit chondrite-like MVE abundances, indicating that “first-generation” inner Solar System planetesimals were remarkably MVE rich. Consistent with isotopic signatures of MVEs in Earth and Mars, these planetesimals made a substantial contribution to the MVE inventories of terrestrial planets. Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies.

Field experiments, conducted 20 years apart, revealed that temporal shifts in shell thickness were driven by the evolution of increased trait means and erosion of thickness plasticity. The virtual elimination of the trade-off in tissue mass that often accompanies thicker shells is consistent with the evolution of fixed defenses under increasingly certain predation risk.",
