          "abstract": "Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state 1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state.",

          "abstract": "Long chain fatty acids are the building blocks of fat in human bodies. In mammals, fatty acid synthase (FASN) contains multiple enzymatic domains to catalyze all chemical reactions needed for de novo fatty acid synthesis1. While the chemical reactions carried out by these enzymatic domains are well defined, how the dimeric FASN with an open architecture continuously catalyzes such reactions to synthesize a complete fatty acid remains elusive. Here, using a strategy of tagging and purifying endogenous FASN in HEK293 for single particle cryogenic electron microscopy studies, we characterized the structural dynamics of endogenous human FASN. We captured the conformational snapshots of various functional substates in the condensing cycle and developed a procedure to analyze particle distribution landscape of FASN with different orientations between its condensing and modifying wings. Together, we reveal that FASN function does not require large rotational motion between its two major functional domains during the condensing cycle, and that the catalytic reactions in condensing cycle carried out by two monomers are unsynchronized. Our data thus provide a new composite view of FASN dynamics during the fatty acid synthesis condensing cycle.",

          "abstract": "The mammalian fatty acid synthase (FASN) enzyme is a dynamic multienzyme that belongs to the megasynthase family. In mammals, a single gene encodes six catalytically active domains and a flexibly tethered acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that shuttles intermediates between active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis1. FASN is an essential enzyme in mammalian development through the role that fatty acids have in membrane formation, energy storage, cell signalling and protein modifications. Thus, FASN is a promising target for treatment of a large variety of diseases including cancer, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and viral and parasite infections2,3. The multi-faceted mechanism of FASN and the dynamic nature of the protein, in particular of the ACP, have made it challenging to understand at the molecular level. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FASN in a multitude of conformational states with NADPH and NADP+ plus acetoacetyl-CoA present, including structures with the ACP stalled at the dehydratase (DH) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. We show that FASN activity in vitro and de novo lipogenesis in cells is inhibited by mutations at the ACP–DH and ACP–ER interfaces. Together, these studies provide new molecular insights into the dynamic nature of FASN and the ACP shuttling mechanism, with implications for developing improved FASN-targeted therapeutics.",

          "title": "What sparked the COVID pandemic? Mounting evidence points to raccoon dogs",
          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "This time five years ago, the virus that causes COVID-19 was spreading around the globe unchecked. One of the biggest questions that remains is: where did it come from?\n\nToday, mounting evidence from more than a dozen studies points to a person, or people, catching the virus from a wild animal or animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak. And the animal at the top of the list is the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).\n\n“There is a large focus on raccoon dogs,” says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.\n\nSome scientists, including virologist Edward Holmes at the University of Sydney in Australia, have suspected raccoon dogs all along. On 21 January 2020, he sent an e-mail to Andersen and another colleague, with the subject ‘Outbreak poker’. In jest, he proposed a wager on the animal that might have carried the virus to people. “I’m betting raccoon dog,” he said. Holmes had seen raccoon dogs at the Huanan market when he travelled to Wuhan in 2014.\n\nBut part of the reason that raccoon dogs top the list of suspects is because they have been studied more than other animals, including ones also present at the market, says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. There are yet more possible candidates, he says.\n\nMarion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, agrees. “We have to be modest about our ability to predict which animal species” sparked the COVID-19 pandemic, she says.\n\nThe origin of the pandemic is still deeply politicized, and the lack of clear answers hasn’t helped. The virus probably originated in bats living in southern China. From there, many scientists think it infected an intermediate animal that passed it to people. The virus could also have passed directly from bats, although that is considered less likely given their habitat is far from Wuhan. And some still suggest that the virus could have escaped, or been deliberately released, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was known to be doing research on coronaviruses.\n\nViral host\n\nOne of the reasons raccoon dogs were suggested as a prime candidate early on is because they were probably involved in passing another, related, virus to people. In 2003, researchers isolated close matches of the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in several civets and a raccoon dog at a live-animal market in Guangdong, China.\n\nThis finding prompted researchers in Germany to investigate these animals’ susceptibility to SARS-CoV-21.\n\nThey found that raccoon dogs can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and — despite not getting that sick themselves — can pass on the infection to other animals.\n\nStudies by Holmes and his colleagues have also shown that farmed and wild raccoon dogs in China are often infected with many viruses that can jump between species. “Raccoon dogs are very common viral hosts,” says Holmes.\n\nRight time, right place\n\nMany of the first cases of COVID-19 involved the Huanan market, suggesting it was the location of the viral spillover. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the first infected people, in late December 2019 and early January 2020, along with geolocation and epidemiological data, support this2.\n\nDuring the outbreak, the market was shut down by the authorities, but researchers know that raccoon dogs were being sold there, for their fur and as food. In June 2021, a study described the results of monthly surveys of live wild animals sold across four markets in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019, including seven stalls at Huanan3. Every month, an average of 38 raccoon dogs were sold at these markets. The most-sold species was the Amur hedgehog (Erinaceus amurensis), at an average 332 individuals a month. Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), hog badgers (Arctonyx albogularis), Chinese bamboo rats (Rhizomys sinensis), and Malayan porcupines (Hystrix brachyura) were also regularly sold.\n\nDecember 2019 sales records from the Huanan market also list trading of live animals or products from bamboo rats, porcupines and hedgehogs, among others.\n\nFurther evidence to support the raccoon-dog theory came in 2023. Chinese researchers published genomic data of swabs taken at the Huanan market in January 2020, after it was shut down, including of stalls, rubbish bins and sewage4. Studies found mitochondrial DNA of raccoon dogs in several swabs, including those that also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Raccoon dogs and hoary bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus) were the most common mammalian wildlife species detected in the mitochondrial DNA; material from civets and hog badgers was also found but not in many samples5. The findings don’t prove that the animals were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but had they been infected, this is the type of evidence you would expect to find, says Andersen.\n\nUnpublished work by Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, suggests that some of the raccoon dogs and greater hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) at the market were probably sick, although it is not clear what virus they were infected with.\n\nOther animals at the market, which could also have been infected with the virus and possibly passed it to people, include bamboo rats, Malayan porcupines, and Amur hedgehogs. But researchers don’t know how susceptible those species are to SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread.\n\nCellular studies suggest that Himalayan palm civets can be infected with the virus, but whether they can pass the virus onto other animals hasn’t been studied, partly because such studies are expensive and weren’t a priority early in the pandemic, says Koopmans.",

          "authors": "Hannah Chance",
          "abstract": "Hannah Chance was accompanied by a special guest during her career talk.Credit: David Tett\n\nLast November, I found myself with Aidan, my 6-month-old son, in one hand and a microphone in the other, giving a careers talk to postdoctoral scholars at a conference in London. I was on parental leave from my work as a policy officer at the Academy of Medical Sciences, headquartered in London. The Academy’s policy work covers a range of topics, from climate change and health inequities to the funding and regulation of research. My focus before taking leave in April was the impact of early-childhood health on long-term health and well-being, and how this influences national productivity, innovation and prosperity.\n\nI moved into policy work in March 2022, starting with a 10-month position at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, a trade association based in London. But my first experience of policymaking was during a three-month internship in 2021 at the Initiative for Science in Europe, an umbrella body for learned societies and research institutes, based in Strasbourg, France.\n\nI joined the Academy of Medical Sciences after completing a PhD in cell biology at King’s College London and the Francis Crick Institute, also in London. I was invited to speak about my career at a conference for early-career researchers, run by King’s College London’s Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine.\n\nA conference with a baby\n\nOn the day of my talk, held at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London, Aidan and I set ourselves up in the speaker ‘green room’, a repurposed seminar room, which had plenty of space for him to crawl around and feed before the session began. We then moved to the main hall for a panel of speaker flash talks introducing our journeys in science, before switching again to roundtable discussions, during which attendees asked more detailed questions about specific career areas.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well the day went. There wasn’t great deal of prep required for the talk or the discussions, but I realized I was out of practice speaking to an audience. However, I took inspiration from the other panel members. Some of the audience questions went beyond the practicalities of my career move, instead tackling the nuances of how the policy sector works as well as the challenges of working with different stakeholders and conflicting interests. These definitely challenged me to switch on my professional brain, but it was a positive experience — I enjoyed reconnecting with my work, and I was reminded of why I care so much about my job.\n\nThings that helped the day go successfully\n\nAn accessible and inclusive conference venue. The location had a room for breast-feeding and expressing milk, baby-changing facilities and step-free access so I could bring along a buggy easily, which made the practical side of the day as smooth as possible.\n\nAn enthusiastic and positive environment. At the conference, people told me that they’d love to see more scientists attending events while on parental leave. Two conference attendees kindly offered me extra help if needed. The conference organizers were adaptable and practical in their planning, and excellent at ensuring that we were accommodated.\n\nA supportive manager. My manager followed my lead on how I wanted to engage with work while on leave — I asked to be updated during check-in days about progress on the projects I was involved in, and I planned to think about career development once I returned to work. The reminders of my professional strengths during these conversations, at a time when I was disconnected from work and out of practice with public speaking, helped to give me the confidence to accept the invitation to speak at a conference.",

          "title": "Move beyond ‘publish or perish’ by measuring behaviours that benefit academia",
          "authors": "Kelly-Ann Allen",
          "abstract": "What makes a great university? Academics say they value seeing their efforts recognized, witnessing the impact of their work on students and society, and working in a collegial environment. In my studies as a research fellow in educational psychology, I’ve found that students expect more than just a sound education — they want friendship with other students, emotional growth and skills that will help them to secure jobs. None of these factors can be adequately assessed using the dominant measure of success in academia: publications.\n\nPublishing well-cited papers in high-impact journals is central to researchers’ career progression. This results in intense pressure to perform well in this one area, often at the expense of other scholarly activities. Although citation metrics can indicate expertise, they can also amplify power imbalances, because highly cited scholars attract ever-more citations and influence.\n\nThe postdoc experience is broken. Funders such as the NIH must help to reimagine it\n\nEfforts to change evaluation systems have gained momentum over the past decade. The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment — signed by almost 25,000 scientists and organizations — and the Leiden Manifesto for research metrics both advocate for research to be evaluated beyond impact factors. A range of metrics, from policy citations to social-media engagement, can be tracked using online tools. Yet the citation-based h-index remains one of the most predominant ways to evaluate academic impact.\n\nIn my view, we could make academic life more rewarding by systematically scoring the underappreciated behaviours and conduct that researchers value. The product might be called the ‘G+ index’ — G representing generosity, giving and other ‘good things’ in academia. This index could either stand alone or complement existing citation measures.\n\nFor senior academics, mentorship could be judged in terms of the number of first- or last-author papers that are co-authored by early-career researchers, signalling investment in developing others’ careers. To account for varying team sizes, formal acknowledgements of trainees in publications could also be factored in. Early-career researchers could be exempt until a set career stage.\n\nMeasuring societal impact: how to go beyond standard publication metrics\n\nCollaboration scores could measure co-authorships across institutions, countries and disciplines. They could include co-authorship with policymakers, community organizations and industry partners, and with individuals with lived experiences relevant to the research. Care would be needed to avoid disadvantaging scholars with limited resources, who might be less able to make connections.\n\nThe index could reflect good science practices — for instance, by recognizing replication studies. And public reach could be measured in terms of open-science practices — data-sharing, pre-registering protocols and communicating through podcasts, blogs and media contributions.\n\nIn some fields, publishing in practice-based journals could be rewarded to ensure that research reaches professional communities. Similarly, editorial and peer-review work for these journals — and work for scientific societies, regardless of prestige — could be valued.\n\nUltimately, the full list of metrics should be decided by the academic community, reflecting a collective vision for a healthier workplace. Funding bodies and institutions could then incorporate the index into their evaluation criteria, providing both the infrastructure and incentives for adoption. Many of the metrics are already tracked in existing data repositories, but improved systems to collect and amalgamate the data are needed.",

          "abstract": "Study participants were given customized snack packs of their favourite ultra-processed foods but still struggled to consume the requisite 1,500 extra calories per day. Credit: Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto/Getty\n\nFive days of indulging in chocolate bars, crisps and other junk foods can lead to lingering changes in brain activity, a study shows1. The resulting brain patterns are similar to those seen in people who have obesity.\n\nA junk-food splurge shifted brain patterns in healthy young men despite their body weight and composition remaining unchanged, according to the study, published on 21 February in Nature Metabolism.\n\n“I didn’t expect the effect to be so clear in a healthy population,” says neuroscientist Stephanie Kullmann at the University of Tübingen in Germany, who led the study.\n\nBut another scientist says that there are limitations to the study, which relied on a nasal spray to deliver the digestive hormone insulin. “The authors give very large doses of insulin,” says physiologist Christoph Buettner, “four to five times the amount that a human releases into the bloodstream over 24 hours.” Buettner, at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was not involved in the study. Kullmann responds that not all of the inhaled insulin reached the brain and that more study is needed to pinpoint how much does.\n\nChocolate and chips\n\nAfter a bite of food, the pancreas releases insulin to aid metabolism. Some of that insulin enters the brain, where it works to dampen appetite. But the brain’s response to the hormone is weakened in some people with obesity2. This ‘brain insulin resistance’ affects how the body processes food.\n\nTo learn more about the effects of insulin in the brain, Kullmann and her colleagues recruited 29 healthy male volunteers (Kullmann has a forthcoming study in women). Eighteen went on a high-calorie diet for five days. A nutritionist made customized 1,500-calorie packs of high-fat, high-sugar snacks for each participant to eat on each of the five days — but the men succeeded in increasing their caloric intake by an average of only 1,200 calories per day. “At the beginning, they were kind of excited,” says Kullmann, but by day 4, eating the extra processed food was a slog. Control participants ate their normal diet during the same period.\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet",

          "authors": "Jianzhuang Xiao, Shuai Zou, Chi Sun Poon, Man Lung Sham, Zongjin Li, Surendra P. Shah",
          "abstract": "Cheap, strong and versatile, concrete is the second most consumed material globally after water, with 30 billion tonnes used annually (Nature 597, 593–594; 2021). Production of concrete is energy intensive and is responsible for more than 7% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions — of which cement accounts for the vast majority.\n\nExtraction of the minerals and other materials used to make concrete is also environmentally unfriendly. For example, around 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel1, and more than 5 billion tonnes of limestone are mined annually, resulting in habitat loss, soil erosion and pollution. These impacts will only worsen, as the global market for concrete continues to grow.\n\nThe construction industry needs to become more sustainable by minimizing carbon emissions and reducing resource and energy use2. Such a vision was set out, in part, in 2023 at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai through the Cement and Concrete Breakthrough Initiative. Launched by 45 world leaders, this initiative aims to reduce the emissions associated with producing one tonne of cement by around 20% by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. Strategies include increasing the use of alternative fuels and other cement-like materials, using construction materials more efficiently, and implementing carbon capture and storage.\n\nReducing emissions is achievable. But a more comprehensive strategy for sustainable concrete is also needed, with the ultimate goals of net-zero carbon emissions and use of 100% recycled materials (see ‘Steps to net-zero concrete). Here we set out the key ingredients of a ‘net zero concrete’ strategy.\n\nSource: Analysis by J. Xiao et al.\nDesign more efficient kilns\n\nCement is produced by heating a blend of limestone and clay in a kiln. This process releases CO2 as limestone decomposes. It is also energy hungry — the chemical reactions involved require temperatures as high as 1,500 °C. Most kilns run on fossil fuels and have poor thermal insulation.\n\nWhat’s the best way to tackle climate change? An ‘evidence bank’ could help scientists find answers\n\nUpgrading kilns can save energy and reduce carbon emissions. For example, over the past few decades, much of the world has moved away from vertical shaft kilns, which work much like a blast furnace — material is added at the top of the column and this is heated from below using gas or coal, to eventually form the cement component clinker. These are being replaced by rotary kilns, which feature a horizontally inclined, rotating shaft that helps move materials through the kiln.\n\nRotary kilns outperform shaft kilns in terms of production capacity, product quality and operational flexibility, and can process 60 times more cement than the average shaft kiln. Their energy efficiency can be improved by 20–50% by using technologies that conserve or recover waste heat3. Improving insulation and optimizing operations using computer modelling and real-time data can increase the efficiency further.\n\nTo make kilns even more efficient, next-generation technologies are being explored. These include all-electric kilns and ones that suspend raw materials in hot air to speed up reactions. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and biomass, as well as hydrogen, can be deployed, as can carbon capture and storage technologies to lower carbon emissions. Leading Chinese cement manufacturers, including Anhui Conch Cement, China National Building Material and China Resources Cement, have established next-generation technology pilot projects.\n\nUse less clinker\n\nReducing the amount of cement clinker used in concrete can also bring down emissions. Some of it can be substituted with materials that require less energy to produce, including industrial by-products such as fly ash from coal combustion, ground blast-furnace slag from iron production, and recycled powders derived from materials such as glass, brick and concrete.\n\nWe need to prepare our transport systems for heatwaves — here’s how\n\nHowever, current standards in China (GB 175-2020) and Europe (BS EN 197-1 2011) only allow up to 20% of the clinker in commonly used types of cement to be substituted by ash and slag. There are ways to replace more of it, while maintaining performance in construction. Updating these standards to reflect ongoing technological advancements is essential to widen adoption.\n\nIn limestone calcined clay cement (LC3), half of the clinker is replaced with a type of clay and a combination of limestone and gypsum, which cuts CO2 emissions by 40% while maintaining the required physical properties4. Major cement manufacturers, such as the Swiss firm Holcim and Germany’s Heidelberg Materials, have already adopted this technology; it is used in the Swiss embassy building in New Delhi, for example.\n\nMoving forwards, it is essential to understand better the properties of various clay sources and to optimize their processing to ensure homogeneity and stability. Long-term durability studies need to be conducted across diverse environmental conditions. And large-scale trials are needed to address manufacturing challenges. Developing standards and increasing awareness among stakeholders is crucial.\n\nUse less cement\n\nReducing the proportion of cement paste in concrete is another strategy. Conventional concrete typically contains about 30% ordinary Portland cement paste by volume. Using less can make concrete harder to work with as it becomes stiffer. But research on optimizing the packing of concrete particles indicates that the volume of paste can be reduced to 18–20% while maintaining performance.\n\nThe world must rethink plans for ageing oil and gas platforms\n\nThe ultra-green concrete5 project, announced in 2023 and supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, has set an ambitious target to reduce the paste content even more, to as low as around 13% by volume. This goal relies on the material having a dense particle structure, known as advanced high-packing, and the incorporation of materials, such as modern superplasticizers. Challenges to overcome include the entrenched misconception that using less paste will affect the concrete’s strength and ensuring that this close-packed concrete meets practical tests, including durability and workability.\n\nAdvances in big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence can also play a part in designing more-sustainable concrete. For example, producers mainly depend on the 28-day compressive-strength benchmark specified in current standards. Through computer modelling, researchers can identify other time points to guide concrete design.\n\nUse less conventional concrete\n\nReducing concrete consumption by extending service life, optimizing the design of structures and using advanced construction technologies, such as 3D printing, offer other ways to reduce carbon emissions and material use.\n\nRisks of bridge collapses are real and set to rise — here’s why\n\nConcrete formulations can be tailored for specific projects to minimize the unnecessary consumption of concrete and its environmental footprint. Options include foamed concrete, or those including a high proportion of recycled content. Old concrete components can be reused by casting them in fresh concrete. And other materials such as fibre-reinforced polymers and steel sleeves can be incorporated to enhance structural performance while using less concrete.\n\nAlthough constructing a building requires a lot of energy, clever designs that lower the amount of energy needed to run it once it is built can save more. For example, using lightweight aggregate, honeycomb structures or composite materials in concrete can enhance the thermal insulation of buildings, so that they can run with smaller and more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.\n\nPhotovoltaic technology could be embedded in concrete, although many research challenges remain, including optimizing their efficiency, quality control during manufacture, degradation, environmental impacts and end-of-use recycling. Advancing these technologies will require close collaboration between material scientists, engineers and architects.\n\nSequester CO2 in concrete\n\nConcrete can be engineered to absorb and store CO2 during its manufacturing, curing, servicing and recycling stages. One study6 estimated that economically viable CO2 mineralization in concrete materials could mitigate up to 15% of CO2 emissions from cement clinker production, and theoretically almost 60% is possible.\n\nThe problem is that some CO2 mineralization technologies are still expensive compared with manufacture of conventional products and other carbon capture and storage methods. For example, producing a carbonated concrete block is around 35% more expensive than producing it with ordinary Portland cement, at a cost of €161 (US$166) to avoid one tonne of carbon emissions6. For now, this limits its use.",

          "authors": "Harini Nagendra",
          "abstract": "Science is necessary, but clearly not sufficient, for conveying the climate crisis. The past two years have been the hottest on record. Denial of climate change is still widespread and false claims about products’ environmental benefits, or ‘greenwashing’, are on the rise. What can researchers do?\n\nA decade ago, many scientists tended to argue that the best way they could contribute to the climate debate was to publish good ‘policy-relevant’ research — and then leave it to governments and civil-society actors to translate this science into action. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has done tremendous work in collating evidence that demonstrates the dangers of global warming and charting pathways to action. Yet, total annual global greenhouse-gas emissions are projected to be more than 60% higher in 2025 than they were in 1990, when the first IPCC report was published.\n\nClimate scientists study a world in which change is the only constant, where the collapse of our planet’s systems is widespread and evident. Most of these researchers battle a deep sense of sadness, coupled with anxiety about the future and the young people they love and care for, who will inherit a damaged planet. We must continue to document change, model impacts and describe solutions — but we cannot stop there.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nIncreasingly, many climate scientists are embracing climate activism. I am a huge admirer of those who do, and have engaged in it myself — although, some scientists critique activism for its purported bias (U. Büntgen npj Clim. Action 3, 36; 2024). But there are other things we can do, too.\n\nClimate communication is an important pathway to action that we don’t speak about enough. Many academic scientists, who are also teachers, are already deeply invested in it. But we haven’t paid enough attention to communication beyond the classroom.\n\nIn May 2019, Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, launched the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability (now called the School of Climate Change and Sustainability), aiming to strengthen India’s response to the climate crisis. Over the past five years, my colleagues and I have conducted public lectures and written media articles; taught short courses to upskill professionals including climate journalists, writers and practitioners; and used illustrated books, games and videos to reach diverse audiences. Three years ago, the university launched a multilingual climate festival attended by tens of thousands of young visitors across India.\n\nThrough these experiences and experimentation — ones that are relevant to other low- and middle-income country contexts — I have gathered five important lessons for climate communication.\n\nDon’t only mourn the loss of nature\n\nClimate change, biodiversity collapse and pollution are classic ‘dismal disciplines’, which can plunge young people — the main target of our communication efforts — into depression. I have seen my own students struggle to seek hope when confronted with the realities of climate change. Public communication must move beyond stories of doom and gloom, which — although realistic — have the unfortunate effect of making many people step away, instead of engaging in the conversation.\n\nTo spur climate action, educators must get personal\n\nIn real life, people interact with nature using their senses, and that’s where climate festivals can be effective. Our festivals have included art installations, movie screenings, theatre and folk-art performances, nature walks, leaf painting and mushroom collecting, as well as traditional Indian games with seeds and shells. Such immersive approaches that engage people with nature can help visitors to go beyond passively viewing scientific information and towards a more joyous and active way of interacting with climate research. This enables individuals to personalize and internalize the elements of nature in their own minds and bodies. I hope that these experiences will remain with people for their whole lives.\n\nThe names of these events use the metaphor of the Indian festival or ‘mela’ to celebrate a different facet of nature each year. In 2022, we focused on the ‘Rivers of life’ — moving to ‘Forests of life’ in 2023, ‘Mountains of life’ in 2024 and now ‘Coasts and oceans of life’ this year. We are not being unrealistically optimistic — these festivals showcase the grim realities of vanishing forests, collapsing mountains, polluted rivers and warming oceans. But we also use photoessays and the voices of local people to document the beauty of a snow-capped mountain, the joy of an Indigenous forest festival and the intimate relationship of a shaman with her river goddess. Over time, we find that these are the areas of the festival where people linger, read and interact — their eyes lighting up with hope. Celebrations pull in the crowd — and people stay to discuss the challenges.\n\nUse multilingual communication\n\nClimate-change education is not only for those who speak English, or whatever the dominant language of a region might be. India is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world, yet most scientific discussions in India are restricted to a relatively small section of the population — those who speak English. This leaves out the majority of the country’s people, who also have a stake in India’s climate future and are often highly motivated to act.\n\nAlthough the School of Climate Change and Sustainability develops its climate material in English, it has translated it into Kannada, Hindi and Assamese, and is now interpreting it in other languages. This is not without challenges. For instance, how do you take a technical term such as ‘sustainability’ and translate it into a local Indian language? A direct translation of the term in Kannada is ‘susthirate’, which means permanence, or freedom from instability. It doesn’t work. Instead, the material contains many of these technical terms, written in local script — or uses alternative ways to communicate the same idea without using the term.\n\nAzim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, hosts an annual, multilingual climate festival.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nThe university casts its net widely to find people who can complete the translations. Professional translators, who are used to translating literature and poetry, often use complex language with a literary flourish. However, the comprehensibility of such language can be a barrier for children from low-income, underserved public schools, who constitute about half of the visitors at our climate-change festivals.\n\nThe festival organizers now work with committed middle- and high-school language teachers, who are used to communicating complex ideas using relatively simple vocabulary. This process helps to improve the teachers’ climate-change communication skills, and strengthens the festival’s partnership with teachers, building a larger community.\n\nInvolve young people\n\nThe success of student movements around climate change, such as Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement, demonstrates the importance of involving young people in climate communication. However, far too often, some scientists think of young people as recipients of their knowledge, not as communicators with unique perspectives and ways to connect with others of their generation.\n\nOver the past three years, we have worked with more than 200 young interns as part of the climate festivals, who have visited different parts of India to document climate and environmental change on the ground. This has had two important outcomes.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nFirst, it has built on their capacity and commitment to the subject, transforming them into lifelong climate champions. Some of our youngest student interns — including 14-year-olds — have delivered powerful projects, including a terrarium that was the centrepiece of our art exhibits, and a display exploring the ethics around elephant capture and training in India.\n\nAnother high-school student documented an island in the Sundarbans, a mangrove forest area in the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, that is being swallowed by rising sea levels. Realizing that the residents were also dealing with other challenges, including an inadequate public-health system, the student raised money to help the islanders. Several of our younger visitors have returned to our university, applying to undergraduate programmes and seeking to contribute to climate activities.\n\nSecond, we have found that young people are more likely to react to messages delivered by other young people, rather than to more scientifically advanced, but less accessible, lectures by trained specialists. When students see other young people who have completed exciting projects, it inspires them to join forces and contribute.\n\nElevate traditional knowledge\n\nMost efforts to communicate climate science to the public use researchers to inform and influence people. But scientists and sustainability specialists are not the only people with expert knowledge. They can learn from society, as well as inform.\n\nClimate justice is a central focus for us. Although we work with many scientists, climate practitioners and activists who are excellent at communicating with wider audiences, we have also found that preaching, moralizing and proselytizing — such as by telling people that they are ‘bad’ for consuming more, using plastic, travelling by aeroplane and so on — only turns audiences away. And students often tune these messages out.\n\nExhibitions at an annual climate festival in Bengalaru, India, are used to inspire students.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nRather than receiving information through didactical lectures, it is much more effective to get the audience to arrive at such conclusions for themselves — by showing them photographs of people living on the coast whose lives are affected by plastic, for instance.\n\nIndigenous communities, with their deep connection to nature and different epistemological approaches, include experts of a different kind and have been too long ignored by scientists. In November 2023, the two-week ‘Forests of life’ climate festival held at our campus, was inaugurated by Soliga tribal elders. Instead of giving a specialist talk, they performed a traditional harvest dance on stage and invited students to join them. By the end of the performance, even the teachers and security and support staff were dancing with the group, transforming the atmosphere into something transcendental and joyous — a perfect launchpad for the festival.",

          "abstract": "Emergency: COVID-19 and the Uneven Valuation of Life Claire Laurier Decoteau Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nIn May 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In response, US government and public-service officials promised marginalized communities that they would make real efforts to tackle racial injustice.\n\nYet, says sociologist Claire Laurier Decoteau, both the pandemic and those promises now seem long forgotten in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIn Emergency, Decoteau interviews 110 of the city’s residents and 65 officials to methodically dissect COVID-19’s impact on marginalized groups. Her analysis reveals how policies that intended to tackle racial injustice instead produced an endless cycle of inequality.\n\nWhy we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments\n\nAt the time of Floyd’s death, Black Americans accounted for 60% of deaths caused by COVID-19 in Chicago, despite comprising only 30% of its population, a pattern mirrored in many other US cities and Western countries. The increased risk of death is attributable to what Decoteau calls “converging ‘demics’” — the confluence of structural injustices, including poor access to health care, housing and employment, that disproportionately affect Black, Latinx and immigrant Chicagoans.\n\nChicago’s initial response to the pandemic was poor, asserts the author. Instead of addressing systemic problems, public-health officials plugged the gap with short-term interventions, such as welfare payments to cover rent or sick days. Although such policies might have benefited less-vulnerable people, they condemned people on the margins to a “slow or quick death”.\n\nTenants who had informal landlord agreements or an undocumented status struggled to access emergency rental payments, because their landlords frequently would not comply with administrative processes. As a result, vulnerable people who should have been shielding themselves from the virus were unable to do so — instead, they had to work to minimize the risk of being evicted and becoming homeless.\n\nDecreasing the number of cases and deaths among Black and Latinx people became the focus of some public-health efforts. But that did not produce long-term changes for the communities most affected by COVID-19. Although many well-intentioned people have used statistics to show that racism is a public-health crisis, Decoteau cautions against reducing the complex history that produced today’s structural inequalities to quantifiable targets.\n\nCommunity care\n\nDecoteau’s interviews highlight how mutual-aid groups and community organizers were the pandemic’s unsung heroes, often achieving what governments could or would not. Many of the stories are bleak, illustrating how systemic discrimination, from poor housing to police brutality, has a physical and mental toll. Yet I found a hopefulness in their tales of community cooperatives that ran food banks and provided COVID-19 tests by employing people enrolled in drug-recovery programmes.\n\nIn Chicago, Illinois, community-led cooperatives, such as food banks, are a lifeline for many.Credit: Scott Olson/Getty\n\nOne volunteer at a community service proclaims: “We need more organizations like this one. We need to grow bigger. We grew up here in the struggle. We know how to cope.” I could not agree more.\n\nIn 2018, I founded a community-based organization in London called Decolonising Contraception, which ran events centred on sexual and reproductive health. Decoteau does a great job of showing what I discovered, too: a top-down approach often has minimal impact on those who require urgent assistance. Too often, red tape and bureaucracy mean that those who are most vulnerable cannot access government support and, instead, end up relying on grass-roots organizations.\n\nMisguided policies\n\nNext, Decoteau illustrates how racial ‘biocapitalism’ — the creation of wealth through the exploitation of people who have been racially categorized — produced policies that caused the death of essential, yet often poorly paid, workers, many of whom in Chicago were Black and Latinx. For example, one such policy introduced extra payments to essential workers in the city. But Candice, a Black woman and former nurse, remarks that: “Every two weeks when you got paid, you got an extra $350 but you couldn’t miss a day. So if you missed a day, you didn’t get the $350.” This policy encouraged people to lie about being unwell, increasing the risk of viral spread.",

          "abstract": "PostdocNet represents several thousand postdocs at the Max Planck institutes and provides opportunities for professional development and community building.Credit: Swen Pfoertner/Alamy\n\nA year into my first postdoc, at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, Germany, I saw a call to join the steering group of the research institute’s PostdocNet as its financial officer. PostdocNet represents the 3,000 postdocs across Germany and a few other countries working at the Max Planck institutes, advocating for better working conditions and career development. I thought managing a budget would be a useful skill for future applications to become a research group leader. I submitted a 3-minute pitch explaining why I wanted the role, and I won the nomination.\n\nI enjoyed my 12-month term so much that I continued in the steering group as a spokesperson. In this one-year role, I represented and managed PostdocNet and headed our steering group, which aims to maximize opportunities for mentorship and academic exchange and build community among postdocs. In practice, we organized interdisciplinary meetings and discussions and represented all postdocs to the Max Planck institutes and external parties, including the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. I was responsible for communication in the network and with external parties, including the society’s president and contacts in science, industry and politics.\n\nStress rewarded\n\nI spent about 10 hours each week fulfilling this demanding role — a mini-job alongside my postdoctoral research responsibilities, often spilling into evenings and weekends. The role could be taxing; sometimes, the stress led to sleepless nights.\n\nBut the work fulfilled me in ways my research could not. I saw the value and necessity of networks that advocate for postdocs. I wanted to pave the way for future postdocs to have better opportunities. Moreover, I could identify concrete problems, develop solutions and see the immediate impact of our efforts.\n\nThanks to this role, my confidence and professionalism have grown, and I’ve improved my communication skills. Tasks that once took hours, such as drafting official e-mails, now come easily. The connections I have made have expanded my professional network far beyond my research field. I learnt how to manage a diverse, international team, navigate conflict and lead meetings inclusively.\n\nUltimately, the extra work was worth it not just for the professional skills that I gained, but also for the personal growth that I experienced — which I will carry with me throughout my career. I have now been appointed by the Max Planck president to serve on the advisory board of the Planck Academy, which offers professional-development opportunities for specific groups of Max Planck employees. This is a service role usually given to those at mid- to senior-career stages.\n\nI am also applying for junior professorships and research-group-leader positions, and I think my PostdocNet roles made a difference in my interviews. One committee member asked me to share more about my work there. In another interview, I drew on my experiences to answer a question about how I would manage conflict in a research group. These experiences taught me that it was not enough to simply list this service role on my CV. I needed to clearly and concretely outline my responsibilities and skills to help interview committees to better understand my achievements.\n\nOvercoming the challenges of running a network\n\nOver the past year, I saw at first hand the struggles of running a successful postdoc network and taking part in academic service relatively early in my career. Here are the four biggest challenges I encountered, and how I addressed them:\n\n1. Institutional memory. Given the high turnover rate of postdocs, steering groups often consist entirely of new members each year. This year, we were fortunate that both the deputy spokesperson and I had served on the steering group previously, which helped to preserve institutional memory, or the collective knowledge and experiences of a group of people. To support the incoming steering group, we wrote a guide on standard operating procedures for the spokesperson role, made e-mail introductions to all our contacts and included the spokesperson-elect in our end-of-term meetings. I documented all activities, meetings and decisions in a comprehensive report for the new steering group. I also made myself available for any questions or enquiries, even after my term ended.\n\n2. Recruitment and participation. Many postdocs are on short-term contracts, and finding their next position is a top priority. Others might be starting families. Very few have extra time to dedicate to an academic network. Offering clear, specific tasks — along with an estimated time commitment — was the most effective way to encourage participation. For example, I estimated that it takes one hour a week to manage social-media posts, and a similar time commitment to organize a scientific talk. Specific and manageable requests yielded better engagement than did vague calls for help.\n\n3. Mentorship. Although I had experience in the steering group, the spokesperson role brought new challenges. To navigate these, I sought a mentor: I reached out to someone experienced in the society who was no longer actively involved, and they provided valuable guidance on pressing issues. Finding a mentor is often just a matter of asking — you’d be surprised by how willing experienced scholars and representatives are to help.",

          "authors": "Katie L. Burke",
          "abstract": "On the rugged, uninhabited Archipelago of the Recherche off the coast of Western Australia, marine ecologist Jennifer Lavers has front-row access to the wildlife she studies, because she lives nearby. In 2022, Lavers set up her successful marine-ecology research group in the tiny hamlet of Esperance, or Kepa Kurl, on the coast of southwest Australia, a seven-hour drive from the nearest city, Perth. As a researcher studying how plastic pollution affects seabirds and the marine food web, Lavers finds a closeness with nature in such an isolated place, and has used that closeness in her collaborations with the local Aboriginal communities. “The birds sing during the day, the frogs at night and the kangaroos mow our lawn for us,” she says of her home. “It gives me the quiet life that I keep seeking, but also the opportunity to truly embed myself with the Aboriginal community.”\n\nLavers’ career trajectory is unusual, because she’s had to think creatively to build her life and do the work that she wants. Academics tend to move to urban institutions as they progress in their careers (E. Yan et al. Quant. Sci. Stud. 1, 1451–1467; 2020). Most career advice that PhD students receive is biased towards urban or suburban locations; indeed, most of their mentors have followed such paths themselves. But some PhD holders want to live in a place far from a research hub or a university town.\n\nWant to make a difference? Try working at an environmental non-profit organization\n\nIn an academic job market that offers fewer and fewer stable positions, more science PhD holders are forging their own paths in the places where they want to live — whether that means launching a business or a non-profit organization or finding remote work. But doing so isn’t always easy. Small towns and rural areas can have fewer resources than cities do and can leave scientists feeling isolated and without mentorship. Still, the benefits in flexibility, community and autonomy are worth it, say trailblazers on an unusual path.\n\nThe most common reason that people interviewed by Nature’s careers team gave for living in such places was to be near family — many have parenting or caring responsibilities. People also valued a sense of place, living close to nature and the mental-health benefits of their autonomy and community. Some wanted to see their skills benefit the community in which they grew up or, like Lavers, wanted to live long term near field-research locations.\n\n“I advise PhDs with extreme geographical restrictions to think broadly and widely about what they can do,” says Karen Kelsky, a career coach who founded the consultancy The Professor Is In. “It is becoming more normative to not work in academia.” Kelsky, who founded her business after leaving a tenured academic position, needed to stay in Eugene, Oregon, because she shared custody of her children with her ex-spouse. “I wish more academics would be entrepreneurial,” she says, noting that it’s been gratifying for her.\n\nSolopreneurs and start-up firms\n\nFor PhD scientists living outside major research hubs who want to continue using their expertise, a common path is to start their own business, either as a consulting firm or as a freelancer. For instance, ecologist Reilly Dibner founded a science-animation and voice-over acting studio called Ecosystem Films in Laramie, Wyoming. “In creating my business, I found I knew a lot more about being an entrepreneur than I ever imagined, simply because I understood how to navigate the academic landscape. So many skills are transferable,” says Dibner. For example, academics know how to seek out and apply for funding, test ideas, quickly learn new skills and organize ambitious, long-term projects. “I understand discomfort and I know how to bust through work challenges,” Dibner adds. “And I have knowledge, resources and networks of people to tap into for their expertise.”\n\nReilly Dibner works on an animation project at her Ecosystem Films studio.Credit: Gregory Nickerson\n\nTo prepare for being self-employed, networking is key. Entrepreneurs say that their first work usually came from colleagues. Social scientist and writer Luis Alexis Rodríguez-Cruz, who runs a science-writing and research business from his hometown of Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico, says, “Networks of solidarity, trust and friendship expanded the opportunities that I use to build a life and a home.” Although some people interviewed by Nature began consulting part time before leaving a full-time position, many relied on a partner’s income or lived with family while getting their businesses off the ground.\n\nSome business owners don’t want to just go solo; instead, they join forces to build a larger firm. Anna Ortega, co-founder and lead researcher of the Western Wildlife Research Collective, started a business because none of the conventional routes for PhD holders in wildlife biology seemed the right fit for her. She also wanted to move back to her home of Durango, Colorado, to raise her children near their grandparents. “I didn’t want to work for the federal government, I didn’t want to work for a state agency and I didn’t want to work in academia,” she says. “At the same time, I wanted to advance science.” Now, she and two team members do consulting work analysing wildlife data for academic laboratories, state and federal agencies and conservation non-profit organizations.\n\n‘Research that touches the heart’: the scientists who study sex and lov\n\nBusiness owners such as Ortega must navigate the administrative and logistical load of setting up a small firm. Once a business is off the ground, such work can be outsourced, but at the start, the owner usually has to deal with the personnel and financial paperwork. Ortega read widely on business management as she was finishing her PhD and setting up her business.\n\nMark Crane, who splits his time between a small town on the edge of the Cotswolds region, UK, and the mountains of southern Spain, sees the ability to outsource this work as a boon. When he built his agricultural toxicology business, WCA Environment, in Faringdon, UK, in 2005, his team was fully remote. This meant that he could recruit the talent he wanted because he could pay specialists well to work from home. “We would win bids because we were cheaper. We had almost no overhead,” he says. “We contracted out everything that wasn’t scientific on an as-needed basis.” This strategy of recruiting the best talent and keeping overheads low allowed him to compete with much larger companies. In 2012, Crane sold the company back to his employees, giving him the funds necessary for developing his next project, a sustainable almond farm in Spain, and helping his wife to run her environmental consultancy.\n\nSelf-employed PhD scientists working far from research hubs must prevent becoming isolated from an academic community. Ortega says that starting a business with a friend has helped her to feel connected because they communicate weekly about their shared projects. She also goes to conferences often to meet colleagues and has company subscriptions to key journals to stay up to date with the literature.\n\nFounding a non-profit organization\n\nScientists with mission-oriented research that has a low overhead can establish a non-profit organization. When Lavers found herself in a particularly difficult workplace situation after ten successful years in academia, she decided to strike out on her own. She started Adrift Lab, a research group focused on seabirds and marine plastics that collaborates with other scientists around the world. She founded Adrift Lab four years before she left her job at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, so that she could transition to Esperance without disrupting her long-term data collection.\n\n“The ivory tower makes you believe that the only way you can do real science is by being in academia,” says Lavers. “Our model demonstrates quite clearly that that is not a requirement.” Lavers and her two co-supervisors have seen nine master’s and four PhD students graduate over the course of six years in conjunction with the University of Tasmania, where one of her colleagues has a full-time position. The advantage of their model shows in their students’ success. “Most of our PhD students graduate with 5–7 publications as first author,” Lavers says. Lavers holds several part-time positions that allow her to stay involved in academic activities.\n\nJennifer Lavers and her colleagues set up an independent research group called Adrift Lab to study how plastic pollution affects marine and seabird lifeCredit: Blue The Film/Northern Pictures\n\nThinking about non-conventional funding is key, says Lavers. She and her colleagues have found that standard funding, such as grants from national funders, is harder to get as a principal investigator without a customary institutional affiliation. “We have survived because of the generosity of two philanthropists,” she says. “We have 20-year data sets, including the longest-running plastic-ingestion data set in the Southern Hemisphere. And yet we’ve never been successful with state or federal government funding.”\n\nLavers says that her relationship with the lab’s donors has been one of the surprising rewards of this non-profit work model. The philanthropists have come along on field excursions, gotten to know students and even been involved in data collection. “Those relationships have become long-lasting and really close in a way that you would never have with a government department. It builds that sense of community spirit within the lab. Funders get as much out of it as we do,” she says. And this funding model saves Lavers precious time. “I don’t spend weeks of every year writing these long reports that get sent off to the government,” says Lavers. “Instead, I divert that energy to writing papers, helping my students and doing all the things that actually matter.”\n\nHow five researchers fared after their ‘great resignation’ from academia\n\nThe study of marine pollution is a rapidly evolving discipline, and Lavers can pivot quickly to pursue emerging issues in a way that government and university structures don’t allow. She also doesn’t have to fit her research into a department or research institution’s priorities and so can investigate interdisciplinary questions as she sees fit.\n\nLavers notes that establishing an independent lab was easier for her because she already knew how to run a conventional one. She understood the processes in her discipline and what it took to keep fieldwork and a lab running. Without that experience, she acknowledges, it would have been a lot tougher.\n\nLavers’ isolated locale isn’t for everyone. “The nearest major hospital is seven hours away,” she says. “We only have one tiny little airport. There are no major shopping malls or clothing stores or anything like that.” But, for Lavers, the upshot is that she lives a quiet, peaceful life close to nature.",

          "abstract": "Early-career scientists fear that their chances of making a life in the US research scene are slipping away. Credit: Karen Ducey/Getty\n\nThe first in her family to go to university, Suzanne Autrey pushed herself to the brink chasing an academic career. She is now an assistant professor at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, and takes delight in teaching geology to other first-generation university students. “I know first-hand that a degree to them doesn’t just change their lives,” Autrey says. “It changes their families’ lives.”\n\nNow, like some other early-career scientists in the United States, Autrey feels her dream of a research career slipping away. The tick-tock of her tenure clock echoes in her ears as she checks and rechecks the status of two crucial grant applications. Both are stalled at the US National Science Foundation, an agency facing the prospect of large budget cuts. She can’t do the research needed to support her tenure bid without those grants. “I’m dead in the water if I can’t get one,” she says.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nAfter a month of repeated threats to US science funding, many early-career researchers such as Autrey are fearing for their careers. These scientists are especially vulnerable: graduate students, postdocs and scientists who are just starting their own laboratories are the researchers most likely to be living pay cheque to pay cheque, most reliant on federal grants for their income and least likely to have job security. Some are considering changing jobs, leaving the country or abandoning research altogether.\n\n“Disruption and uncertainty are the enemy of science,” says Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. And when disruption and uncertainty strike, she adds, “the people who lose their jobs are students and postdocs”.\n\nIf that happens now, science in the United States could undergo its own generational shift, she says: “Early-career scientists are the future.”\n\nDiminished prospects\n\nDuring its chaotic first month, US President Donald Trump’s administration moved to sharply curtail federal funding for research. Some of the administration’s changes, such as freezing research funds and curtailing reimbursement for overhead costs on federal grants, have been temporarily blocked by the courts. But the administration’s push to shrink the size of the government is clear, and many researchers fear that the system of federal support they have come to rely on is eroding.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nTheir anxiety was on display at a protest in Washington DC on 19 February, when about 250 graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and research technicians gathered outside the US Department of Health and Human Services to protest against the chaos unleashed by mass layoffs, leadership changes and promises of budget cuts at federal agencies. “Last week aged me a year,” says Alexander Jordan Lara, a research fellow at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Lara’s career is in limbo after his principal investigator, a high-ranking NIH scientist, abruptly retired on 11 February amid the turmoil created by the Trump team’s directives , leaving the fate of the laboratory and its members up in the air.\n\nThat fear radiates beyond employees of federal agencies. At the University of Maryland in College Park, an NIH diversity grant pays neuroscience postdoc Haroon Popal’s salary. Popal counts himself lucky: this year’s salary has already been allocated. But the Trump administration has threatened any funding that falls under the rubric of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and Popal is not counting on getting paid next year. He’s looking for other jobs now, especially any that do not rely on federal funds — even if that means leaving science. “I love my research,” he says, “but I cannot afford to lose a pay cheque.”\n\nFaced with that uncertainty, some young scientists might choose to leave the country rather than leave science, says Ginther. But the United States churned out more than 34,000 science PhD graduates in 2023. Not all of them will choose to stay in science, but whether those who do and seek to leave the United States could be absorbed by other countries is unclear. “I don’t know that the world’s scientific enterprise can absorb the potential loss of talent that we’re creating in the United States,” says Ginther.\n\nFading allure\n\nThe United States has long attracted scientific talent from around the globe. Just a few weeks ago, Adam Pavlinek, a developmental neuroscientist at King’s College London, had planned to start a postdoc at an NIH laboratory later this year. Now, he tracks the recent firings at federal agencies and waits to learn of the fate of the team that he had hoped to join.\n\nNIH pay rise for postdocs and PhD students could have US ripple effect\n\nThe instability in the United States has Pavlinek thinking twice about his plans. “I’m worried that four or five months after I move all my stuff there, I’ll be told, ‘Actually there’s no more funding,’” he says. He has started looking for positions in the United Kingdom.",

          "abstract": "Babies with severe spinal muscular atrophy lack sufficient proteins to maintain motor neurons.Credit: YsaL/Getty\n\nA two-and-a-half-year-old girl shows no signs of a rare genetic disorder, after becoming the first person to be treated for the motor-neuron condition while in the womb. The child’s mother took the gene-targeting drug during late pregnancy, and the child continues to take it.\n\nThe “baby has been effectively treated, with no manifestations of the condition”, says Michelle Farrar, a paediatric neurologist at University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday.\n\nThe child was conceived with a genetic condition known as spinal muscular atrophy, which affects motor neurons that control movement, and leads to progressive muscle weakening. About one in every 10,000 births have some form of the condition — making it a leading genetic cause of death in infants and children.\n\nIn its most severe form, as in the case of this child, individuals lack both copies of the SMN1 gene, and have only one or two copies of a neighbouring gene, SMN2, that partially compensates for that deficiency. As a result, the body does not produce enough of the protein required for maintaining motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This protein is most important in the second and third trimesters, and the first few months of life. Babies with severe disease don’t usually live past their third birthday.\n\nIn the past decade, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three drugs to treat newborns for spinal muscular atrophy. The oral drug used in this study, called risdiplam, manufactured by biotech firm Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, is a small molecule that works by modifying expression of the SMN2 gene so that it produces more SMN protein.\n\nUp until now, treatments for spinal muscular atrophy were given after birth. But up to half of newborns lacking both copies of the SMN1 gene, and with only two copies of the SMN2 gene, are born with some symptoms. “There was still room for improvement,” says Richard Finkel, a clinical neuroscientist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, who led the study.\n\nParent proposal\n\nThe idea of giving the drug in utero came from the parents, says Finkel. “They had already experienced a loss from this horrible disease,” he says, and wanted to know whether there were treatment options they could start before birth. The FDA approved the study for this one individual.\n\nThe mother, who was 32 weeks pregnant, took risdiplam daily for six weeks. The baby started taking the drug from roughly one week old, and will probably continue to take it for the rest of her life.",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "If the number of on-camera screams is any indication, Kim Kardashian’s first encounter with epigenetics was a thrilling one.\n\nThe reality-television star and her family shrieked and squealed in the season finale of The Kardashians in Los Angeles, California, last July as they each learnt the results of a commercial blood test that purportedly assessed their “biological ages”. Although Kardashian was 43, the placement of chemical markers on her DNA — her ‘epigenetic profile’ — matched that of a 34-year-old, according to the test. Her body, moreover, was ageing 18% more slowly than most people of her age.\n\n“You should give yourself a pat on the back,” said Matthew Dawson as he relayed the results. (Dawson is chief executive of TruDiagnostic in Lexington, Kentucky, the company that sells the test.)\n\nOn the other side of the country, neuropsychologist Terrie Moffitt says she was “mortified” when she saw the segment. Moffitt, who works at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, had spent decades with her colleagues collecting data from around 1,000 people to create the basis for one of the tests provided by TruDiagnostic. She had hoped that her work might one day inform medical decisions or provide a way for researchers to assess whether an anti-ageing treatment is having a positive effect on health. A stunt on a reality-TV show was not the kind of publicity she was aiming for. “I have a snob’s view of reality TV,” she adds.\n\nMixed feelings of enthusiasm and apprehension were common among researchers who spoke to Nature about efforts to develop tests that measure the impact of ageing on the body. With money pouring into the field and an unprecedented level of public attention and excitement, scientists are publishing a steady stream of papers on ways to measure how rapidly a person’s body is declining. Many of the measures look at chemical marks on DNA known as methylation, or at proteins or metabolites that can be found in the blood. These biological markers, or biomarkers, could prove incredibly useful as part of burgeoning efforts to develop drugs and other therapies that would forestall the negative effects of ageing and increase what gerontologists refer to as the healthy lifespan.\n\nOften, however, test results that use these biomarkers are interpreted and presented without a full reckoning of the uncertainties that plague them. It’s a problem not just for commercial tests, but also for media articles and even scientific publications. “There’s a lot of confusion,” says Brian Chen, a molecular epidemiologist at California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute in San Francisco. “I’ve seen, in academia, scientists trying to promote and hype up ‘biological age’ and ageing research in general to generate more interest and funding.”\n\nChen and others worry about the risk of elevated expectations as scientists take on the long and arduous task of validating these tests. “Whether or not at the end of the day this kind of thing is going to be positive or negative for the field is hard to know,” says Matt Kaeberlein, chief executive at Optispan, a health-care technology company in Tukwila, Washington. “If you lose your reputation, that’s hard to get back.”\n\nMarking time\n\nFor the moment, the field is on fire. In December 2024, the US Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health announced a programme to develop and validate biomarkers of ageing. Hevolution Foundation, a charity in Riyadh, has invested US$400 million in healthspan research. And organizers of XPRIZE Healthspan — a competition to find treatments for conditions associated with ageing — are planning a 7-year, $101-million global competition that is dedicated to improving healthspan.\n\nA smorgasbord of tests to assess ageing already exists. Geneticist Steve Horvath, now at Altos Labs in Cambridge, UK, developed one of the first epigenetic clocks more than a decade ago1. He analysed data from 7,800 samples to catalogue which sites in the genome were tagged with methyl groups — a chemical modification to DNA that helps to regulate the expression of genes. He then fed these data, along with the ages of the study participants, into a machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm produced a collection of 353 methylation sites that, taken together, correlated with participants’ chronological ages. Some of these sites were more methylated with age; others were less so.\n\nThose markers became the basis for a test that can predict a person’s chronological age with remarkable accuracy, says Chen, who worked with Horvath. But the test was not as good at predicting how long a person might expect to remain healthy, or when they might die.\n\nSo, Horvath’s team and others began to build new tests, searching for methylation sites that correlate with other age- and health-related measures, such as white-blood-cell counts, the amount of glucose in the blood and levels of a protein that serves as a marker for inflammation2. This time, the goal was to create a clock that reflected a person’s time to death, rather than merely the number of years lived.\n\nPregnancy advances your ‘biological’ age — but giving birth turns it back\n\nA younger ‘age’ based on this test tended to associate with a variety of lifestyle factors, including high income and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. An older age score was associated with factors such as cigarette smoking or the risk of heart disease, among other ailments.\n\nMoffitt and her colleagues took this a step further, returning to the same study participants every few years to collect a fresh round of health data3. This allowed them to create an epigenetic test that assessed the rate at which age takes its toll on the body, rather than one static number. “It’s capturing the slow, gradual progression of biological decline,” Moffitt says.\n\nThe biology underlying these tests, however, remains a puzzle. There is no clear mechanism that links the patterns of methylation measured in the tests with changes in a person’s health — the patterns are simply correlations fished out from large data sets, with no obvious cause. “Why did the methylation go up, and what went wrong?” asks Horvath. “What does it mean?”\n\nOther kinds of test can provide a clearer link to mechanisms. Those that measure changes in the abundance of certain proteins or in the chemical products of metabolism allow researchers to draw conclusions about what triggered the change. “This is why I chose metabolomics,” says Eline Slagboom, a molecular epidemiologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, referring to tests that try to survey all of the metabolites in an organism or tissue. “When we have a marker, we also understand a little about why it is important: is it an inflammation marker, a lipid marker? Is it related to glucose?”\n\nSlagboom and her colleagues created a test called MetaboHealth, which is based on 14 metabolites found in the blood that correlate with the likelihood of death from disease4. Others have turned to tests based on proteins: a team led by UK researchers developed one using data from more than 45,000 people that measures the levels of around 200 proteins in blood5.\n\nTurning back time with epigenetic clocks\n\nFor now, however, some researchers are forgoing molecular biomarkers in their clinical trials. Therapies, interventions or lifestyle changes aimed at extending a person’s healthy lifespan must come with a measurable benefit, says Jamie Justice, a gerontologist in Grand Junction, Colorado, who is executive vice-president of health at the XPRIZE Foundation in Culver City, California. “When we talk about that benefit, we’re talking about the way that a person functions, feels or survives” — not simply the chemical composition of their DNA, she says. Experimental therapies tested in the XPRIZE Healthspan programme will not be evaluated on the basis of epigenetic tests. Instead, the competition will focus on factors such as muscle strength and cognition, as well as assays for immune function.\n\nThe prize will be structured so that teams gather data and samples in a standardized way. Justice also hopes to raise funds for a competition in which teams develop and test other biomarkers using those data. “I love biomarkers,” she says. “I love them and I hate them, because I know how hard it is to actually get one developed.”\n\nSeeking validation\n\nResearchers sometimes recoil when they learn just how much work it takes to vet a biomarker fully so it can be used in clinical trials, says Mahdi Moqri, a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. Such tests must be studied repeatedly in a variety of populations, and under the specific conditions in which they will be used in the clinic. A biomarker of ageing that is based on data from people in their forties and fifties, for example, might have little relevance to a frail 80-year-old who has multiple health conditions, says Slagboom. “We have a tendency to try to sell how valuable our marker is,” she says. “But valuable for which purpose?”\n\nThe hype surrounding ageing research has also created a false impression of how well tested the markers have been in different populations, or in different settings, says Moqri. Although epigenetic-clock markers have been used in a vast range of studies, they typically have not been sufficiently validated for use as primary outcomes in clinical trials, he says. “Even those who are running clinical trials, they think that these biomarkers are more advanced than they actually are,” he says.\n\nThere is also disagreement in the field about what the clocks really measure. Despite frequent references to ‘biological age’ in both the media and scientific articles, a 2024 study found little agreement in the community as to what the term means6. In a survey of more than 100 participants at a scientific conference on ageing research, about 30% defined ageing as the loss of function that comes with time. Other definitions included the accumulation of damage with time; a developmental stage; and an increase in disability and death. “Defining biological age is a whole touchy subject in itself,” says Marije Sluiskes, a biostatistician at Leiden University Medical Center.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how",

It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nDuring her PhD at the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, South Korea, biochemist Babita Paudel studied antioxidant compounds from lichens and mosses that thrive in Antarctica. On returning to her home country, Nepal, she shifted to studying molecules produced by high-altitude microbes and medicinal plants found there. She co-founded the Center for Natural and Applied Sciences (CENAS) in Kathmandu, where she studies groups of bacteria called actinomycetes, known for producing compounds with antimicrobial activity. To isolate these bacteria, her team collected soil samples from extreme environments, including the base camps at Mount Everest and Annapurna, looking for potential products to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.\n\nBeyond her research, Paudel leads efforts to boost the numbers of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers in Nepal. Supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, her Women in STEM Nepal team travels across the country to conduct capacity-building training for early- and mid-career women. The team organizes sessions on academic writing, building CVs, professional networking and writing grant proposals. In addition, it created Nepal's Women in STEM Nepal database, listing around 650 female researchers. The initiative has connected around 3,200 women interested in STEM careers. Paudel spoke to Nature about what inspired her to take the reins of this countrywide project.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nWhat drives me to help female students to thrive at my Ugandan university\nIt wasn’t a singular event. From the start, my passion was fuelled by strong family support. My father was the principal at a public secondary school. I was a bright student and having good scores encouraged my family to support my science education. At that time, only a small number of female students opted for science subjects. There were very few female professors teaching STEM courses, but seeing their commitment — despite the major household responsibilities that Nepalese society puts on women — inspired me to continue my career as a scientist.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?\n\nI've been fortunate to have my husband as a significant influence and mentor. We both are researchers in biochemistry, and his unwavering support has enabled me to pursue my career despite the responsibilities of raising our two children.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle gender inequality in science?\n\nIn 2021, while participating in an event organized by the Nepal German Academic Association, an alumni body, I was asked to give a presentation on the status of women in science in Nepal. It took me a month to prepare that presentation because there wasn’t any proper database of women scientists. I had to meticulously review data from a government body, the University Grants Commission, and visit department home pages of each of Nepal’s universities to gather information. One 2010 statistic from the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO was particularly shocking: women comprised just 7.9% of the STEM workforce in Nepal, a proportion that was among the lowest in Asia. I realized the urgent need to do something about this.\n\nWere there other surprises that came out of your work?\n\nIn Nepal, there is a substantial disparity for women in STEM owing to various social norms such as domestic and childcare responsibilities, the lack of female-friendly policies in the workplace, and insufficient capacity-building activities, inspiration and motivation.\n\nI found that most Nepalese women in STEM tend to marry after completing their bachelor’s or master’s degrees. This often results in an academic break, one that often leads to a significant loss of confidence, contributing to imposter syndrome. I didn’t realize how pervasive this problem was until I started travelling the country and hearing women’s stories.\n\nAlso, Nepalese society is still patriarchal, and a lot of panel discussions at scientific conferences still tend to exclude female experts. I was surprised by the extent of this inequality. Women are expected to sacrifice the most, not just for their families, but also academically. Even women with advanced degrees often find themselves limited to sometimes entry-level, contract-limited and temporary lecturer positions in universities, with few opportunities for further promotion.\n\nHow does your initiative try to address these disparities?\n\nI’m a Palestinian scientist building a more inclusive future\nWe are building capacity for female students in STEM careers and creating networks of female researchers. In 2022 and 2023, we organized 10 capacity-building activities across 7 provinces in Nepal, engaging 421 female researchers in workshops on professional networking, how to explore work and study opportunities, CV preparation, proposal writing and plagiarism in research. In addition, we hosted ten webinars and published a comprehensive database of national and international funding agencies, scholarships and fellowships on the CENAS website.\n\nWe also created a Facebook group for team members to network, and to disseminate information on scholarships, funding agencies and opportunities. The group has more than 4,000 members. In 2022 and 2023, we also provided travel grants for 25 female students and early-career researchers to participate in and present their research at national and international conferences across Nepal.\n\nWhat is your best piece of advice to a 20-something female researcher in Nepal?",

Credit: Eye Of Science/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can diagnose a range of infections and health conditions in one sweep, by screening immune-cell gene sequences in blood samples.\n\nIn a study of nearly 600 people, published in Science on 20 February1, the tool identified whether participants were healthy or had COVID-19, type 1 diabetes, HIV or the autoimmune disease lupus, as well as whether they had recently received a flu vaccine.\n\nNeuronostics: Accelerating the diagnosis of epilepsy with computer modelling\n\n“This is a one-shot sequencing approach that captures everything that your immune system has been exposed to,” says Sarah Teichmann, a molecular biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThe tool is not yet ready for clinical use, but with more work to refine the approach, it could one day help clinicians to deal with “conditions that today don’t have definitive tests”, says study co-author Maxim Zaslavsky, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California.\n\n“From a real-world point of view, the promise would be to have one foundation model for the immune system where you can read out everything that a person has seen, and then link it to their health care,” says Teichmann. “There are a lot of steps on the pathway to realizing that down the line, but this is one step.”\n\nNatural diagnostic\n\nThe immune system holds an extensive record of past and current illnesses through its two major cell types — B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that attach to viruses and harmful molecules, whereas T cells activate other responses or kill infected cells.\n\nWhen a person has an infection, or an autoimmune condition in which the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues, their B cells and T cells increase in number and start to produce specific surface receptors. Sequencing the genes that encode these receptors can unlock the person’s unique record of diseases and infections.\n\n“The immune system is a natural diagnostic, and if we just learn how it can do it, then we could also do it,” says Victor Greiff, a computational immunologist at the University of Oslo.\n\nCurrent diagnostic tools “make some but little use of the immune system’s record of disease exposures”, says Zaslavsky, but most previous efforts have focused on sequences from either B or T cells. “Combining them for this fuller picture of immune activity gives us a more complete read-out of what could be happening.”\n\nSuper-speedy sequencing puts genomic diagnosis in the fast lane\n\nZaslavsky and his colleagues built an AI tool that combines six machine-learning models to analyse gene sequences encoding key regions in B-cell and T-cell receptors, and pick out patterns associated with particular diseases.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "An artist’s impression of an asteroid.Credit: ESA-Science Office\n\nThe latest calculations indicate that the asteroid known as 2024 YR4 is much less likely to hit Earth than earlier measurements had suggested. Late on 19 February, telescopic observations of the object allowed researchers to revise down the estimated chance of impact in 2032 from 3.1% — the greatest such threat ever recorded — to a still-worrying 1.5%.\n\nAsteroid lost 1 million kilograms after collision with DART spacecraft\n\nThis value is likely to fall even further, to less than 1%, says Richard Moissl, head of the European Space Agency’s Planetary Defence Office, based in Frascati, Italy. As data flood in, uncertainty regarding 2024 YR4’s ‘impact corridor’ — the path it will take in the vicinity of Earth — is shrinking. If, as the uncertainty in an asteroid’s path gets smaller, Earth’s orbit remains within it, the likelihood of impact grows — which is why, earlier this week, space agencies reported that the risk had climbed. But now Earth is on the fringes of this region and edging out.\n\nYR4 has given researchers their first chance to test an international protocol for responding to such hazards, put in place after the Chelyabinsk meteor hit Earth in 2013 without any warning. And with new asteroid-hunting telescopes coming online all the time, astronomers are likely to see many more close calls, says Moissl. “It’s not if, it’s when.”\n\nImpact warning\n\nAsteroids appear on researchers’ radars all the time — but not ones like YR4. It was first spotted in late December, and by 27 January, the object’s likelihood of hitting Earth had crept up above 1%, which triggered the United Nations-mandated International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to spring into action.\n\nIAWN’s network of researchers have been working overtime to precisely calculate the asteroid’s speed and path, says Moissl. It hopes to report an impact risk of below 1% before April, when YR4’s orbit will take it beyond the range of ground-based telescopes until 2028.\n\n‘Head-scratcher’: first look at asteroid dust brought to Earth offers surprises\n\nIAWN’s regular practice exercises, using hypothetical asteroids, have taught scientists to focus on quickly obtaining the most important measurements in real time — those that allow them to pinpoint when and where an asteroid could hit, and the damage it could cause, says Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson and manager of IAWN.\n\nThis kind of rapid applied science is already familiar to meteorologists and seismologists, he says. “You have to coordinate and understand that you’re doing science to save the world, for the lack of a better term,” he says.",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson, Max Kozlov, Alexandra Witze, Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Donald Trump took office as US president for the second time one month ago.Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty\n\nIn the wake of the Second World War, US leaders adopted the view that scientific progress is an “essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress”. And for the next eight decades, government officials on both sides of the political aisle agreed to invest in US science. Just one month into the second administration of Republican President Donald Trump, scientists fear that that long-time consensus is disintegrating.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nActing with unprecedented speed, the administration has laid off thousands of employees at US science agencies and announced reforms to research-grant standards that could drastically reduce federal financial support for science. The cuts form part of a larger effort to radically reduce the government’s spending and downsize its workforce.\n\nAlthough US courts have intervened in some cases, Republicans in both chambers of the US Congress — which largely blocked Trump’s efforts to cut science funding during his first term as president from 2017 to 2021 — have mostly fallen in line with the agenda for Trump 2.0. For many researchers, this first month signals a realignment of priorities that could affect science and society for decades to come.\n\nThese actions are all “unprecedented”, says Harold Varmus, a former director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) who is now a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. “No one has ever seen a [presidential] transition in which one of the most valuable parts of our government enterprise is being taken apart.”\n\nThe Trump White House did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nHere, Nature unpacks the Trump team’s blazing-fast actions on science so far (scroll to bottom to see timeline ‘Science impacts: one month of Trump 2.0’) and talks to policy watchers about what’s next.\n\nFast and furious\n\nThe overhaul of US science kicked off within hours of Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, when he signed dozens of executive orders, which are presidential directives on how the government should operate inside existing laws.\n\nSome of those orders had been anticipated, including pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement to rein in global climate emissions and terminating the nation’s membership of the World Health Organization. Others had surprising and immediate ripple effects through the scientific community.\n\nOne order erroneously attempted to define only two biological sexes, male and female, and banned federal actions “that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”. Biomedical-research agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scrambled to respond by, among other things, taking down data sets from their websites and pulling back manuscript submissions from scientific journals to purge terms including ‘gender’ and ‘transgender’.\n\nResearchers, clinicians and others protest the Trump administration’s actions outside the US Department of Health and Human Services in Washington DC on 19 February.Credit: Matthew Rodier/Sipa US/Alamy\n\nAnother executive order banned what Trump called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI)”. Any federal employee who did not report colleagues defying the DEI orders would face “adverse consequences”, according to an e-mail sent to government workers. To many scientists’ dismay, agencies began terminating DEI programmes, including environmental-justice efforts, which are programmes aimed at protecting low-income communities vulnerable to pollution and climate change. Even some scientific societies and private research organizations scrubbed DEI mentions from their websites. In one of Trump’s orders, he called for the investigation of foundations, non-profit organizations and other private entities not in compliance.\n\nOn 27 January, just one week into the new administration, Trump’s budget office froze all federal grants and loans, saying that it needed to review government spending to ensure that it aligned with the executive orders. Chaos erupted as agencies, including the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — both major funders of basic science — halted grant payments, cancelled review panels for research-grant funding and paused communications. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order, but disruptions and confusion continue.\n\nPrincipal investigators who lead research teams are suffering in this environment, says a university scientist who requested anonymity because their research is funded by multiple US agencies. “Everything is on you to manage your grants and your team,” they say, adding that “there’s a lot of fear of people not wanting to say or do the wrong thing” and therefore lose financial support for their work. “It’s completely chaotic; I’m losing sleep.”\n\nSlash and burn\n\nTrump’s unprecedented directives landed as his partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has flourished. The pair are working together to slash federal spending and dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds global disease research, prevention and care.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, the Trump administration — working through the US Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk reportedly advises — has moved quickly to demoralize and gut the federal workforce, including about 280,000 scientists and engineers. Initially, a 30 January e-mail offer to all federal employees asked them to “move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector”; around 75,000 employees subsequently resigned, on the promise that they would retain their salary until September. In mid-February, layoffs began for probationary employees across the US government — those usually hired into their positions within the past two years, meaning that early-career researchers were particularly affected.\n\nTrump has partnered with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk (left) to downsize the US government.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\n“I can’t even convey how haphazard and cruel the layoffs are,” says an NIH researcher who lost members of their laboratory to the job cuts and requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the press. E-mails notifying workers that they were being let go reportedly gave a blanket reason of poor performance for the termination — even to those whose performance was rated ‘exceptional’ by their supervisors. “They took some of the best and brightest people who just joined the government and laid them off,” the researcher says.",

There’s more research on the reproductive ecology of cheetahs, say, in remote areas, than on wildcats in Europe.\n\nWildcat populations are in sharp decline and the animals are now absent from much of their former range in the Iberian Peninsula, owing to legal predator control and illegal killings, as well as road accidents, habitat fragmentation and hybridization with domestic cats. In Mediterranean areas, a decline in their main prey — rabbits — due to viral diseases seems to be the key factor. Understanding the balance of all of these factors is crucial to identify potential threats, reassess the need for greater protection and urge governments to take conservation action.",

UKRI describes it as the largest real-terms stipend increase since 2003. The agency supported an estimated 24,000 students in the 2023–24 academic year, amounting to around one in five of doctoral students based in the United Kingdom.\n\nOther changes unveiled by UKRI include allowing students to take up to 28 weeks’ medical leave, more opportunities to extend studentships and greater support for students with disabilities.\n\nAnnouncing the stipend increase on 30 January, UKRI chief executive Ottoline Leyser said: “Postgraduate training is critical to building the workforce needed for an innovation-led economy and public sector, and to delivering outstanding research and innovation outcomes.\n\n“The increase in the postgraduate stipend and changes in terms and conditions we are announcing today are part of our ongoing work to forge a new deal for postgraduates, widening access to the diverse and fulfilling careers that research and innovation has to offer.”\n\nAlongside the announcement, UKRI also published a report that said there was widespread support from universities and other research organizations and UKRI grant holders for setting the stipend in line with the UK national living wage.\n\nFinancial survival\n\nSome researchers hailed the increase as a step towards helping all researchers to survive financially. But others said that much more needs to be done to help them.\n\nStephanie Buller, who researches risk management as part of a UKRI-funded PhD at Cardiff University, says the stipend hike is still too low.\n\nMany first jobs, including apprenticeships aimed at 16- and 18-year-olds that combine practical training with study, can pay more than a PhD does, she adds.\n\nBuller says: “I’ve got an undergraduate [degree], a master’s and 10 years’ experience, so my current skill set is worth £60,000. I've walked away from a very-well-paying job to be a mature student in financial hardship.\n\n“There are hundreds of PhDs up and down the country that are saying, ‘how do I keep a roof over my head and how do I pay for my next meal?’”\n\nPablo Ouro, a civil engineer at the University of Manchester who completed his PhD in 2017, says that the increase is “good news for all PhD students”, but notes that foreign students have extra costs to bear.",

          "authors": "Felice Frankel",
          "abstract": "One of the privileges of being on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge is seeing glimpses of the future, from advances in quantum computing and energy sustainability and production, to designing new antibiotics. Do I understand it all deeply? No, but I am able to wrap my head around much of it when I am asked to create an image to document the research.\n\nThe joy of being a science photographer is that I must learn about the things I am documenting to produce communicative and trustworthy images, intended as a form of data, for the researchers who welcome me into their laboratories.\n\nBut now, with the wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools, lots of questions must be asked. Will there be a point at which, with just a few keystrokes and prompts, a scientist can create a ‘visual’ of their research, as I do with my camera, and consider that image a record of the work? Will researchers, journals and readers be able to spot artificially created images and understand that they do not truly document the work? And finally, from a personal point of view, will there still be a place for a science photographer like me to advance the communication of research? Here’s what I have found out while experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) image generators.\n\nReality and representation\n\nFirst, let’s remind ourselves of the differences between a photograph, in which each pixel corresponds to real-world photons, and a genAI visual, created with a diffusion model — a complex computational process that generates something that seems real but might never have existed.\n\nTo explore these differences, I decided to experiment with genAI visuals made with Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E diffusion models to reproduce the work shown in one of my most popular science photographs — with help from scientific-visualization researcher Gaël McGill at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1997, Moungi Bawendi, a chemist at MIT, asked me to take a picture of his nanocrystals (quantum dots). When excited with ultraviolet light, these crystals fluoresce at different wavelengths depending on their size. Bawendi, who later shared a Nobel prize for this work, did not like the first image (see ‘Three views’), in which I had placed the vials flat on the lab bench, taking a top-down photograph. You can tell that was how I had placed them, because you can see the air bubbles in the tubes. It was intentional; I thought it made the image more interesting.\n\nCredit: Felice Frankel\n\nThe second iteration was used on the November 1997 cover of the Journal of Physical Chemistry B (see ‘Three views’). That photograph provides a straightforward record of the research and highlights the importance of collaborating with the scientist — an essential part of my process.\n\nTo generate a comparable image in DALL-E, I used the prompt “create a photo of Moungi Bawendi’s nanocrystals in vials against a black background, fluorescing at different wavelengths, depending on their size, when excited with UV light”.\n\nChina made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation\n\nPeople might think that the image the program produced is attractive (see ‘Three views’), but it is not even close to the reality captured in the original photograph. DALL-E introduced bead-like dots that were not in the prompt. The algorithm presumably found the words ‘quantum dots’ in the data set of the AI model that underlies it and used that information to replace the words “nanocrystals”.\n\nMore troubling is the fact that, in each vial, there are dots with different colours, implying that the samples contain a mix of materials that fluoresce at a range of wavelengths — this is inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the dots are shown lying on the surface of the table. Was that an aesthetic decision made by the model? I find the resulting visual fascinating (see Supplementary Information).\n\nThe results of my AI experimentation are often cartoon-like images that can hardly pass as reality — let alone documentation — but there will be a time when they will be. In conversations with colleagues in research and computer-science communities, they all agree that we should have clear standards on what is and is not allowed. In my opinion, a genAI visual should never be allowed as documentation.\n\nManipulated versus AI generated\n\nThe advent of AI means that we need to clarify three core issues related to visual communication: the difference between illustration and documentation, the ethics of image manipulation and the desperate need for visual-communication training for scientists and engineers.\n\nDecisions about how to frame an image — what to include or leave out — are already a manipulation of reality. The tools that people decide to use are also part of the manipulation. Each digital camera creates a distinct photograph. An Apple iPhone’s algorithm enhances image colours differently to that of a Samsung phone. Similarly, the near-infrared images produced by the James Webb Space Telescope are designed to be different from, yet complement, the Hubble Space Telescope’s optical scans.\n\nHow AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history\n\nTaking the point even further, the colours we see in all of those amazing images of the Universe are digitally enhanced and give us yet more renditions of reality. Seen through this lens, it is clear that humans have been, in effect, artificially generating images for years, without necessarily labelling them as such. However, there is a crucial difference between enhancing a photograph with software to depict reality and creating a reality from trained data sets.\n\nAs a science photographer, I am acutely aware of the difference between an illustration and a documentary photograph, but I am less confident that AI programs can make this distinction. An illustration or diagram is a representation of something, subjectively translating and visually describing a concept or structure using notations, colours, shapes and so on. A documentary optical photograph, or one made using scanning or transmission electron microscopy, is created with photons and electrons and is therefore a representation of an item, even if it is not the item itself. The difference between the two is in the intent.\n\nWith illustration, the intent is to describe and clarify the work. GenAI visuals will probably excel in that task. But for a documentary photograph, the intent is to bring us as close to reality as we can. Both are, in essence, already a form of manipulation or an act of artificial generation, and therein lies the importance of defining and discussing their ethics before we include genAI tools.\n\nPublishers now have software in place to identify various manipulations in images that already exist (see Nature 626, 697–698; 2024), but, frankly, AI programs will eventually be able to circumvent these fail-safes. There are efforts under way to find ways to trace the provenance of a photograph or to document any manipulation of the original. For example, the forensic photography community, through the global Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, provides technical information to camera manufacturers regarding the ability to trace the provenance of a photograph by keeping a record in the camera of any manipulation. As one can imagine, not all manufactures are on board.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nThe scientific community still has time to create a system of transparency and form guidelines regarding AI-generated images. At a minimum, every genAI visual should be clearly labelled as such, and the process and tools used to create it should be clearly stated and include, where possible, credit for any source images provided to the AI engine. However, listing the sources poses a challenge.\n\nTwo articles have raised an important issue by highlighting potential privacy and copyright violations when using diffusion models (N. Carlini et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/grqmsb (2023); and see go.nature.com/4jqyevn). Credit is only feasible in a closed system (which diffusion models are not) for which the training data are known and fully documented. For example, Springer Nature, which publishes Nature (Nature is independent of its publisher), has recently included an exception into its policy for Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold program to cover this sort of use (for models trained on a specific set of scientific data). However, people should keep in mind that AlphaFold is not a genAI tool that creates images — it generates structural models (coordinate data) that are then turned into images by people (not by genAI tools).\n\nHappily, efforts are addressing privacy issues. Creators can now use a kind of ‘tamper-evident’ metadata called Content Credentials to, as Adobe explains in its manual, “obtain proper recognition and promote transparency in the content creation process” (see go.nature.com/3wx92ng).\n\nEthical standards\n\nFor years, I have suggested that scientists need to be trained in the ethics of visual communication, and the easy availability of AI image-creation software adds urgency to this discussion.\n\nFor example, I recall one experience with an engineer who altered a photograph that I had made of their research and wanted to publish it, along with the submitted article (see Supplementary Information). The researcher did not consider that altering the image was, in fact, similar to changing their data because they had not been taught the basic ethics of image manipulation and visual communication.",

          "abstract": "The main historical building on the campus of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Grandbrothers/Alamy\n\nAbout a month after Donald Trump took office as the 47th US president, almost all grant-review meetings remain suspended at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), preventing the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research from spending much of its US$47-billion annual budget.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nThese review panels are suspended because the Trump administration has barred the agency from taking a key procedural step necessary to schedule them. This has caused an indefinite lapse in funding and left scientists facing difficult decisions about the future of their research programmes.\n\nThe Trump administration issued an order on 27 January freezing payment on all federal grants and loans, but lawsuits challenging its legality were filed soon afterwards, putting the order on hold. However, payments are still not going out, because Trump’s team has halted grant-review meetings, exploiting a “loophole” in the process, says Aaron Hoskins, an RNA biochemist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who has had to reconsider hiring graduate students because of a frozen grant application. “It’s really quite nefarious.”\n\nSome legal scholars say that this ‘back-door’ approach to freezing funding is illegal. That’s because the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president or his team, the power to appropriate funds, says David Super, an administrative-law specialist at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington DC. Blocking “advisory-committee meetings that are legally required to make payments is no different in effect than simply refusing to sign contracts or issue cheques”, he says.\n\nThe NIH, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the freeze, its legality or when the freeze would be lifted.\n\nA loophole in the process\n\nTo gain approval, NIH research-grant applications are considered in two steps, by two separate panels. The first is a study section, which is a group of independent scientists who convene to score applications. The second is a meeting of the agency’s advisory council, which is a separate group of external and internal scientists and advisers that acts as a final check on an application before a funding decision is made.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nTo run either of these grant-review sessions, the agency must post its meeting plans at least 15 days in advance on the Federal Register, which is the official daily publication of the US government. Trump’s team has barred NIH officials from making these posts, according to e-mail correspondence that Nature has obtained. The NIH has posted no notices on the Federal Register since Trump took office; during the same period in 2024, the agency posted more than 150 notices.\n\nAccording to the e-mail, the Trump administration will, in future, require that these notices be posted at least 35 days before grant-review meetings, instead of the standard 15 in effect previously. This means that, even if these notices were allowed again from today, the earliest date on which a new grant-review meeting could be scheduled is 28 March.\n\nA small number of study sections have convened since Trump took office, but only because a Federal Register notice was posted to schedule them before his inauguration. The continuing cancellation of these meetings has had a snowball effect, and there is now an enormous backlog of applications (see ‘Trend reversal’).\n\nSource: NIH RePORTER database/Nature analysis (see code here)\nAn untenable backlog\n\nAdvisory councils at 23 of the NIH’s institutes and centres usually meet only once every four months to discuss grant applications. The first council gatherings for 2025, which were scheduled to be held between late January and early February, were cancelled by the new administration during a ‘communications pause’.\n\n‘Devastating’ cuts to NIH grants by Trump’s team put on hold by US judge\n\n“As we get more backed up, there will reach a point where it’ll be impossible to do peer review in time for the [second] council meeting date,” says an NIH scientific review officer, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press.",

          "abstract": "The Trump administration prevented NASA’s chief scientist from travelling to climate talks where she was to co-chair a working group.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nA major United Nations climate assessment is moving forwards in China this week without the United States, after the administration of President Donald Trump blocked US officials’ participation and shut down a team providing technical support for the next international climate assessment.\n\nReports emerged last week that the Trump administration had banned NASA chief scientist Katherine Calvin from attending a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that began on Monday in Hangzhou, China. Nature has now confirmed with several sources that the US State Department delegation is not attending the meeting, which is slated to end with the adoption of an outline for the panel’s seventh climate assessment, due for completion by late 2029. The IPCC assessments, which are the gold-standard guide to the pace and effects of climate change, are used by governments to shape their climate policies.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNASA has also cancelled a contract that funded a team including scientists and others to provide administrative and technical support to the climate-assessment effort, according to a US official who is familiar with the situation but asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press. The team would have supported Calvin and her co-chair, Joy Jacqueline Pereira, a geologist at the University Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi. The cancellation was reported by the Washington Post and independently confirmed by Nature. A NASA spokesperson said that the move was prompted by guidance “to eliminate non-essential consulting contracts”.\n\nThe absence of the US delegation from the meeting “is obviously a loss for the international community,” says Li Shuo, the director of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s China Climate Hub in Washington DC. “The US plays an important role in the IPCC process, contributing both financial and intellectual support.”\n\nIPCC spokesperson Andrej Mahecic declined to comment, except to say that the United States has not notified the organization of any decisions regarding participation in this week’s meeting or the broader climate assessment. For now, the process is moving forwards, Mahecic says. NASA officials confirmed that Calvin would not be attending the meeting in China but declined to make her available for an interview. The White House referred Nature's queries to the State Department; officials there declined to comment.\n\nOutsized role\n\nThe United States has historically made substantial scientific and monetary contributions to the IPCC. US scientists publish research that informs the assessment and run computer simulations of the climate that feed into it. For the seventh report, Calvin was co-chairing one of three IPCC working groups; hers was assessing the scientific literature on options to reduce emissions and halt global warming.\n\nCalvin’s support team would have helped with everything from reviewing the literature and designing graphics to managing travel logistics. The group was funded by a NASA contract but situated in the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a White House organization that coordinates climate work across federal agencies. That contract has now been ended, according to the US official. “We don’t know if Kate will be allowed to continue as a co-chair” of the working group, they said.\n\n“It would be a real shame if the administration pulled Kate out of that role, not just for her, but for the US,” says Andy Miller, who was one of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s liaisons to the USGCRP until his retirement in December. “And it would be a loss for IPCC to lose someone of Kate's caliber.”\n\nScramble to recover",

          "abstract": "Adolescence (ages 10–24) is characterized by cognitive, behavioural and social development. Childhood environments are typically centred on home and care settings, whereas adolescents increasingly engage with peer and community environments. These changing environments confer risks of experiencing specific adversities at different ages. Despite the unique characteristics of adversities in adolescence and potential associations with lifespan outcomes, few frameworks exist to systematize adversities in adolescents. Here we review current research and propose an approach specific to this developmental period: the adverse adolescent experiences (AAEs) framework. Building on existing models (for example, the adverse childhood experiences framework), the AAEs focus on potentially traumatizing experiences during adolescence. The framework builds on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory to conceptualize adversities at intrapersonal, interpersonal, community and societal levels. We argue that this approach can enhance our understanding of adolescent adversity, facilitate the study of its potential effects, and guide prevention and intervention efforts.",

          "abstract": "To build and establish essential international networks, gain international experience and secure a position on the academic tenure track, early-career researchers are increasingly seeking employment opportunities abroad1,2. Relocation to a foreign country — particularly one with a different culture and language — is an inherently challenging undertaking. Early-career researchers often encounter difficulties even before departing. A typical example would be the frustrating cycle between residence permit and employment contract: in many cases, obtaining a visa or residence permit is necessary to secure an employment contract. However, without proof of employment and a rental agreement, obtaining a visa can be difficult. In situations in which institutions fail to provide specialized and dedicated support, delays in the researcher’s arrival may occur that limit the ability of the early-career researcher to achieve and show their full potential within the host institution.\n\nAfter arrival, those who do not speak the local language may face additional challenges3. Although researchers typically use a common language (often English), administrative staff of the employing institutions might not, which makes tasks such as completing paperwork and reading email correspondence difficult. These activities frequently require help from a bilingual third party, which is not always available or advisable for sensitive matters. Furthermore, such challenges often extend beyond the walls of the institution into daily life, including in finding accommodation, setting up a local bank account, navigating taxes, and scheduling private or occupational medical appointments.",

Implementation science can help to reduce the gap in a way that maintains scientific rigour by simultaneously examining the safety, effectiveness and implementation of PAT.

We examine 70 million job transitions to show that human capital development and career progression follow this structured pathway in which skills more aligned with the nested structure command higher wage premiums, require longer education and are less likely to be automated. These disparities are evident across genders and racial/ethnic groups, explaining long-term wage penalties. Finally, we find that this nested structure has become even more pronounced over the past two decades, indicating increased barriers to upward job mobility.",

We validated that 80% of the identified functional variants are regulatory variants, and expression quantitative trait loci analysis uncovered the potential target genes regulated by the prioritized risk variants. Gene-level analysis, including transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies, colocalization and Mendelian randomization-based analyses, prioritized potential causal genes and drug targets. Gene prioritization analyses highlighted likely causal genes, including TMEM106B, CTNND1, AREL1 and so on. Pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment of depression risk genes in synapse-related pathways. Finally, knockdown of Tmem106b in mice resulted in depression-like behaviours, supporting the involvement of Tmem106b in depression.

Although adaptation is studied extensively in the context of motor control, there is limited evidence that cognitive functions such as working memory are subject to the same error-driven adaptive control mechanism. To examine the possibility that internal spatial representations undergo adaptation, we had participants perform a task that interleaved a perceptual discrimination task and a spatial working memory task. Perceptual discrimination trials (85% of trials) presented an initial peripheral cue to exogenously capture attention, immediately followed by a displaced target stimulus. This sequence of events served to repeatedly induce a covert attentional allocation error. Interleaved spatial working memory trials (15% of trials) presented a stimulus at a pseudorandom peripheral location followed by a delay interval. On half of the working memory trials, the stimulus was surreptitiously presented at the same location as the initial attentional cue. We found that as attentional errors accumulated over the course of the experiment, participants’ spatial recall shifted to counteract the attentional error. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the number of induced errors. Recall performance recovered rapidly following the offset of error trials. Multiple control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for these results, such as oculomotor confounds and attentional biases unrelated to error. These findings indicate that the computational mechanisms governing the adaptation of motor commands appear to similarly serve to adjust and calibrate spatial cognition.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Scholars and practitioners widely posit that listening to other people enhances efforts to persuade them. Listening may enhance persuasion by promoting cognitive processing, reducing defensiveness, and improving perceptions of the persuader. However, empirical tests of this widely theorized hypothesis are surprisingly scarce. We review the case for and against this hypothesis, arguing previous research has not sufficiently attended to reasons why listening may not enhance persuasion. We test this hypothesis using a preregistered, well-powered field experiment in which trained professional canvassers, acting as confederates, had ∼10 min video conversations with U.S. participants ( N = 1,485) about unauthorized immigration, a salient topic of disagreement. We independently randomized whether confederates shared a persuasive narrative about an undocumented immigrant and whether they practiced high-quality nonjudgmental listening to participants’ opinions. We measured outcomes immediately after the conversation and again five weeks later. Sharing a persuasive narrative meaningfully and durably reduced prejudice and changed policy attitudes. The listening manipulation also successfully improved perceptions of the persuader and increased processing. Surprisingly, however, the listening manipulation did not enhance persuasion: Sharing a persuasive narrative was just as effective in the absence of high-quality listening. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.",

          "abstract": "A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.",

          "abstract": "Sociotechnical systems, where technological and human elements interact in a goal-oriented manner, provide important functional support to our societies. Here, we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness—i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time—that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the modus operandi of sociotechnical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system toward the proverbial “edge of a cliff.” Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to critical fragility is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental “excess volatility puzzle” in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing sociotechnical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.",

          "abstract": "High-profile incidents of police violence against Black citizens over the past decade have spawned contentious debates in the United States on the role of police. This debate has played out prominently in the news media, leading to a perception that media outlets have become more critical of the police. There is currently, however, little empirical evidence supporting this perceived shift. We construct a large dataset of local news reporting on the police from 2013 to 2023 in 10 politically diverse U.S. cities. Leveraging advanced language models, we measure criticism by analyzing whether reporting supports or is critical of two contentions: 1) that the police protect citizens and 2) that the police are racist. To validate this approach, we collect labels from members of different political parties. We find that contrary to public perceptions, local media criticism of the police has remained relatively stable along these two dimensions over the past decade. While criticism spiked in the aftermath of high-profile police killings, such as George Floyd’s murder, these events did not produce sustained increases in negative police news. In fact, reporting supportive of police effectiveness has increased slightly since Floyd’s death. We find only small differences in coverage trends in more conservative and more liberal cities, undermining the idea that local outlets cater to the politics of their audiences. Last, although Republicans are more likely to view a piece of news as supportive of the police than Democrats, readers across parties see reporting as no more critical than it was a decade ago.",

Research in cultural evolution theory distinguishes factors related to social influence (such as copying from the majority, or from certain individuals) from factors related to individual, nonsocially influenced, propensities such as evolved cognitive predispositions, or physical, biological, and environmental constraints. Here, we show, using analytical and individual-based models, that individual preferences, even when weak, determine the equilibrium point of cultural dynamics when acting together with nondirectional social influence in three out of four cases we study. The results have implications regarding the importance of keeping into account individual-level, nonsocial, factors, when studying cultural evolution, as well as regarding the interpretation of cross-cultural regularities, that must be expected, but can be product of weak directional forces, intensified by social influence.",

ATL has a very poor prognosis and lacks satisfactory treatments; therefore, it is critical to identify potential targets in ATL cells in order to develop effective targeted therapeutics. Here, we report the identification of two oncogenes, AK4 and RHOC, as target genes of miR-455-3p, a tumor-suppressive microRNA in ATL patients. Importantly, AK4 and RHOC are highly expressed in ATL and exhibit oncogenic potentials in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal a functional overlap of AK4 and RHOC, including activating oncogenic pathways such as Myc targets and deregulating lipid metabolism such as enhancing the production of sphingomyelin, a tumor-promoting lipid. In particular, compared to other types of T cell malignancy such as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), ATL is sensitive to sphingomyelin inhibition and AK4 or RHOC depletion. Altogether, we report a distinct dependency of ATL on AK4 and RHOC oncogenes and an oncometabolite sphingomyelin, which together represent targetable vulnerabilities of ATL that could be exploited for developing effective therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Female mosquitoes are vectors of many devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding to initiate reproduction. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms managing female mosquito reproduction is essential. Although the regulation of gene expression during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle has been studied in detail, how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains unclear. Chromatin must be accessible for transcription factors (TFs) governing gene expression. A specialized class of TFs, called pioneer factors (PFs), binds and remodels closed chromatin, permitting other TFs to bind DNA and activate the gene expression. Here, we identified a homolog of the vertebrate PF FoxA in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mosquitoes deficient in AaFoxA . We found that ovary development was severely retarded in mutant females. Multiomics and molecular biology analyses have shown that AaFoxA increased histone acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27 by controlling the chromatin accessibility of histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodelers. AaFoxA is bound to the loci of chromatin remodelers, changing their chromatin accessibility and modulating their temporal expression patterns. AaFoxA increased the accessibility of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and E74 loci, indicating the important role of AaFoxA in the hormonal regulation of mosquito reproductive events. Further, the CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq analyses revealed that AaFoxA temporarily bound closed chromatin, making it differentially accessible during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle. Hence, this study demonstrates that AaFoxA modulates chromatin dynamics throughout female mosquito reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Processivity clamps mediate polymerase switching for translesion synthesis (TLS). All three Escherichia coli TLS polymerases interact with the β 2 processivity clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif (CBM), which is indispensable for TLS. Notably, Pol IV also interacts weakly with the rim of the clamp through non-CBM residues. Ablating this “rim contact” in cells results in selective sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, raising the question how the rim contact contributes to TLS. Here, we show that the rim contact is critical for TLS past a strong replication block but barely necessary for a weak blocking lesion. Within the in vitro reconstituted E. coli replisome, the rim mutation compromises Pol IV-mediated TLS past 3-deaza-methyl dA, a strong block, whereas barely affecting TLS past N 2 -furfuryl dG, a weak block. Similar observations are also made in E. coli cells bearing a single copy of these lesions in the genome. At lesion-stalled replication forks, single-stranded DNA binding protein locally enriches Pol IV, enabling it to bind the low-affinity rim site. This interaction poises Pol IV to better compete with Pol III, the replicative polymerase, which competitively inhibits Pol IV from interacting with the clamp through its CBM. We propose that this bipartite clamp interaction enables Pol IV to rapidly resolve lesion-stalled replication at a strong block through TLS, which reduces damage-induced mutagenesis.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) promise unique electronic, optical, and chemical properties, which can be exquisitely tuned by controlling the composition, size, and morphology. Semiconductor QDs have been synthesized primarily via two approaches, namely, epitaxial growth and wet-chemical synthesis. However, the properties of epitaxial QDs (eQDs) are susceptible to wetting layer formation and substrate dislocations, while colloidal QDs (cQDs) face fluorescence intermittency issues. Here, we report on the synthesis of a class of QDs that can overcome the fundamental limitations of eQDs and cQDs. By exploiting the sp 2 bonding of layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we show that GaN QDs can be epitaxially grown through a weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction without two-dimensional wetting layer formation. The photoluminescence intensity of GaN van der Waals quantum dots (vQDs) is more than six times stronger than that of conventional GaN eQDs and no optical blinking was observed from vQDs. We show that the interadatom bond strength is about one order of magnitude stronger compared with that between the adatoms and the hBN substrate. This work shows that vQDs have unique properties that are difficult to achieve using existing QDs synthesis methods and thus can potentially enable new classes of high-performance optoelectronic and quantum devices.",

In our extensive simulation study, the proposed method consistently demonstrates greater power than existing alternatives, achieving a relative increase of over 20% in challenging scenarios where true causal variants are sparse and multiple association regions exist at the same time, while maintaining a lower false positive rate.",

          "abstract": "Longitudinal imaging data are routinely acquired for health studies and patient monitoring. A central goal in longitudinal studies is tracking relevant change over time. Traditional methods remove nuisance variation with custom pipelines to focus on significant changes. In this work, we present a machine learning–based method that automatically ignores irrelevant changes and extracts the time-varying signal of interest. Our method, called Learning-based Inference of Longitudinal imAge Changes (LILAC), performs a pairwise comparison of longitudinal images in order to make a temporal difference prediction. LILAC employs a convolutional Siamese architecture to extract feature pairs, followed by subtraction and a bias-free fully connected layer to learn meaningful temporal image differences. We first showcase LILAC’s ability to capture key longitudinal changes by simply training it to predict the temporal ordering of images. In our experiments, temporal ordering accuracy exceeded 0.98, and predicted time differences were strongly correlated with actual changes in relevant variables (Pearson Correlation Coefficient r = 0.911 with embryo phase change, and r = 0.875 with time interval in wound healing). Next, we trained LILAC to explicitly predict specific targets, such as the change in clinical scores in patients with mild cognitive impairment. LILAC models achieved over a 40% reduction in root mean square error compared to baseline methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that LILAC effectively localizes and quantifies relevant individual-level changes in longitudinal imaging data, offering valuable insights for studying temporal mechanisms or guiding clinical decisions.",

          "abstract": "Groundwater is essential to urban water supplies throughout the world, but we do not understand how quantity and quality issues may jeopardize the ability of cities to meet their water needs. Here, we present a national analysis of both quantity and quality challenges facing China’s urban groundwater supply security, using high-resolution groundwater depletion modeling and a recently compiled dataset detailing quality violations in drinking groundwater sources. We estimate that 180 cities (about half of the prefecture-level-and-above cities), accounting for 311 million urban residents, face at least one groundwater pressure between 2016 and 2021. Cities that face dual quantity and quality pressures pinpoints hotspots of intense groundwater threats— Specifically, 40 cities, mainly situated in Northeast China and the middle to lower reaches of the Yellow River, are exposed to dual groundwater pressures. The results highlight the interconnected and possibly mutually reinforcing nature of groundwater depletion and quality issues. The logistic regression models indicate that groundwater depletion and quality violations are associated with natural water endowment and anthropogenic factors. Particularly, drinking groundwater quality issues are clustered in relation to socioeconomic gaps, with larger, wealthier cities being less prone to such problems. We argue that securing drinking water sources in small and poor cities through integrated groundwater management and economic assistance should be an important national priority for achieving groundwater supply sustainability.",

          "abstract": "Electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of furfural represents a sustainable route for biomass valorization. Unfortunately, traditional Cu-catalyzed ECR suffers from diversified product distribution and industrial-incompatible production rates, mainly caused by the intricate mechanism−performance relationship. Here, we manipulate hydrogenation pathways on Cu by introducing ceria as an auxiliary component, which enables the mechanism switching from proton-coupled electron transfer to electrochemical hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and thus high-speed furfural-to-furfuryl alcohol electroconversion. Theoretical and kinetic analyses show that oxygen-vacancy-rich ceria delivers an efficient formation−diffusion−hydrogenation chain of H* by diminishing H* adsorption. Spectroscopic characterizations indicate that Cu/ceria interfacial perimeter enriches the local furfural, synergistically lowering the barrier of the rate-determining HAT step across the perimeter. Our Cu/ceria catalyst realizes high-rate HAT-dominated ECR for electrosynthesis of single-product furfuryl alcohol, achieving a high production rate of 19.1 ± 0.4 mol h −1 m −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97 ± 1% at an economically viable partial current density of over 0.1 A cm −2 . Our results demonstrate a highly efficient route for biofeedstock valorization with enhanced techno-economic feasibility.",

          "abstract": "While it is known that endocannabinoids (eCB) modulate multiple neuronal functions, the molecular mechanism governing their release and transport remains elusive. Here, we propose an “ on-demand release ” model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is an important step. A coculture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, G protein-coupled receptor-based (GRAB) eCB2.0 , and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by protein kinase C, Diacylglycerol lipase, Adenosinediphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2,000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. The “ on-demand release ” model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB trafficking at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids in their membrane regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.",

          "authors": "Spencer P. Alliston, Chris Dames, Matthew J. Powell-Palm",
          "abstract": "Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid–solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entropic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59% (to 5.6 K), eutectic temperature by 45% (to 9.7 K), and eutectic composition by 43% (to 4.7 mol%), as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that, for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.",

          "abstract": "Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P , however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",

          "abstract": "Scaffold proteins are key players in many signaling pathways where they ensure spatial and temporal control of molecular interactions by simultaneous tethering of multiple signaling components. The protein JIP1 acts as a scaffold within the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by assembling three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, into a macromolecular complex that enables their specific activation. The recruitment of these kinases depends on the 450-amino acid intrinsically disordered tail of JIP1, however, the structural details of this tail and the molecular mechanisms by which it binds kinases have remained elusive. Here, we provide an atomic resolution structural description of the JIP1 tail, and we study its interaction with the kinase JNK1. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that JNK1 not only engages with the well-known docking site motif (D-motif) of JIP1, but also interacts with a noncanonical F-motif. We determine the crystal structure of the JIP1–JNK1 complex at 2.35 Å resolution revealing a bipartite binding mode of JIP1. Our work provides insights into the sequence determinants of F-motifs suggesting that these motifs may be more prevalent in JNK substrates than previously recognized. More broadly, our study highlights the power of NMR spectroscopy in uncovering kinase interaction motifs within disordered scaffold proteins, and it paves the way for atomic-resolution interaction studies of JIP1 with its multitude of interaction partners.",

We used our pipeline for prediction of engineering targets for 103 different chemicals using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host.

          "abstract": "Understanding the evolving dynamics of the brain throughout life is pivotal for anticipating and evaluating individual health. While previous research has described age effects on spectral properties of neural signals, it remains unclear which ones are most indicative of age-related processes. This study addresses this gap by analyzing resting-state data obtained from magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 350 adults (18 to 88 y). We employed advanced time-series analysis at the brain region level and machine learning to predict age. While traditional spectral features achieved low to moderate accuracy, over a hundred time-series features proved superior. Notably, temporal autocorrelation (AC) emerged as the most robust predictor of age. Distinct patterns of AC within the visual and temporal cortex were most informative, offering a versatile measure of age-related signal changes for comprehensive health assessments based on brain activity.",

DDFs are often essential scaffolding domains in receptors, adaptors, or effectors of these pathways by mediating homo- and hetero-oligomerization including helical filament assembly. At the downstream ends of these pathways, effector oligomerization by DDFs brings the enzyme domains into proximity for their dimerization and activation. Hundreds of structures of these domains have been solved. However, a comprehensive understanding of DDFs is lacking. In this article, we report the curation of a DDF structural atlas as a public website (deathdomain.org) and deduce the common and distinct principles of DDF-mediated oligomerization among the four families (death domain or DD, death effector domain or DED, caspase recruitment domain or CARD, and pyrin domain or PYD). We further annotate DDFs genome-wide based on AlphaFold-predicted models and protein sequences. These studies reveal mechanistic rules for this widely distributed domain superfamily.",

          "abstract": "Karrikin Insensitive 2 (KAI2), identified as the receptor protein for karrikins (KARs), which are smoke-derived seed germination stimulants, belongs to the same α/β-hydrolase family as D14, the receptor for strigolactones (SLs). KAI2 is believed to recognize an endogenous butenolide (KAI2 ligand; KL), but the identity of this compound remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested that ligand hydrolysis by KAI2 is a prerequisite for receptor activation to induce interaction with the target proteins, similar to the situation with D14. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we designed KAI2 ligands (carba-dMGers) whose butenolide rings were modified so that they cannot be hydrolyzed or dissociated from the original ligand molecule by KAI2, by structurally modifying dMGer, a potent and selective KAI2 agonist. Using these dMGer analogs, we found that the strongly bioactive ligand, (+)-dMGer, was hydrolyzed by KAI2 at a lower enzymatic rate compared with the weakly bioactive ligand, (+)-1′-carba-dMGer, and the hydrolyzed butenolide ring of (+)-dMGer was transiently trapped in the catalytic pocket of KAI2. Additionally, structural analysis revealed that (+)-6′-carba-dMGer bound to the catalytic pocket of KAI2 in the unhydrolyzed state. However, this binding did not induce the interaction between KAI2 and SMAX1, indicating that ligand binding to the receptor alone was not sufficient for KAI2 signaling. This study showed experimental data from a ligand structure–activity study that ligand hydrolysis and subsequent covalent adduct formation with the catalytic triad plays a key role in KAI2 activation, providing insight into the chemical structure of the Arabidopsis KL.",

We report a polarized dual-view light-sheet system for determining the diffraction-limited three-dimensional distribution of the orientations and positions of ensembles of fluorescent dipoles that label biological structures. We share a set of visualization, histogram, and profiling tools for interpreting these positions and orientations. We model the distributions based on the polarization-dependent efficiency of excitation and detection of emitted fluorescence, using coarse-grained representations we call orientation distribution functions (ODFs). We apply ODFs to create physics-informed models of image formation with spatio-angular point-spread and transfer functions. We use theory and experiment to conclude that light-sheet tilting is a necessary part of our design for recovering all three-dimensional orientations. We use our system to extend known two-dimensional results to three dimensions in FM1-43-labeled giant unilamellar vesicles, fast-scarlet-labeled cellulose in xylem cells, and phalloidin-labeled actin in U2OS cells. Additionally, we observe phalloidin-labeled actin in mouse fibroblasts grown on grids of labeled nanowires and identify correlations between local actin alignment and global cell-scale orientation, indicating cellular coordination across length scales.",

          "abstract": "Chromatin architecture facilitates accurate transcription at a number of loci, but it remains unclear how much chromatin architecture is involved in global transcriptional regulation. Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture alters global chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multiomics analyses with sorted juvenile postmitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and we identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. CTCF depletion leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (&gt;3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (&gt;27,000 sites) before any prominent cellular or physiological phenotypes arise. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy at euchromatin, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility and frequently inhibits expression of these direct binding targets, which are enriched for binding motifs of transcription repressors. These findings provide different and sometimes opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cellular heterogeneity and cell-type specificity when performing multiomics analyses. CTCF knockout rods undergo complete degeneration by adulthood, indicating an essential role for their viability. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.",

Thereby they harbor great potential for being targeted in vaccination, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here, we use fate mapping, functional analyses, and comparative cross-species transcriptomics to show that RORγt + DCs are a conserved, functionally versatile, and transcriptionally distinct type of DCs. RORγt + DCs entail various populations described in different contexts including Janus cells/RORγt-expressing extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), subtypes of Thetis cells, RORγt + -DC (R-DC) like cells, cDC2C and ACY3 + DCs. We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt + DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4 + T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt + DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt + DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men. Thus, our work establishes RORγt + DCs as immune sentinel cells that exhibit a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing peripheral T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment.",

          "abstract": "The most common chemotherapeutics induce DNA damage to eradicate cancer cells, yet defective DNA repair can propagate mutations, instigating therapy resistance and secondary malignancies. Structural variants (SVs), arising from copy-number-imbalanced and -balanced DNA rearrangements, are a major driver of tumor evolution, yet understudied posttherapy. Here, we adapted single-cell template-strand sequencing (Strand-seq) to a HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the formation of doxorubicin-induced de novo SVs. We coupled this approach with nucleosome occupancy (NO) measurements obtained from the same single cell to enable simultaneous SV detection and cell-type classification. Using organoids from TetO-CMYC/TetO-Neu/MMTV-rtTA mice modeling HER2+ breast cancer, we generated 459 Strand-seq libraries spanning various tumorigenesis stages, identifying a 7.4-fold increase in large chromosomal alterations post-doxorubicin. Complex DNA rearrangements, deletions, and duplications were prevalent across basal, luminal progenitor (LP), and mature luminal (ML) cells, indicating uniform susceptibility of these cell types to SV formation. Doxorubicin further elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicative of genomic stress persisting posttreatment. Altered nucleosome occupancy levels on distinct cancer-related genes further underscore the broad genomic impact of doxorubicin. The organoid-based system for single-cell multiomics established in this study paves the way for unraveling the most important therapy-associated SV mutational signatures, enabling systematic studies of the effect of therapy on cancer evolution.",

The diversification of quinones, from low redox potential (LPQ) in anaerobes to HPQs in aerobes, is assumed to have followed Earth’s surface oxygenation ~2.3 billion years ago. However, the evolutionary origins of HPQs remain unresolved. Here, we characterize the structure and biosynthetic pathway of an ancestral HPQ, methyl-plastoquinone (mPQ), that is unique to bacteria of the phylum Nitrospirota . mPQ is structurally related to the two previously known HPQs, plastoquinone from Cyanobacteriota /chloroplasts and ubiquinone from Pseudomonadota /mitochondria, respectively. We demonstrate a common origin of the three HPQ biosynthetic pathways that predates the emergence of Nitrospirota , Cyanobacteriota , and Pseudomonadota . An ancestral HPQ biosynthetic pathway evolved ≥ 3.4 billion years ago in an extinct lineage and was laterally transferred to these three phyla ~2.5 to 3.2 billion years ago. We show that Cyanobacteriota and Pseudomonadota were ancestrally aerobic and thus propose that aerobic metabolism using HPQs significantly predates Earth’s surface oxygenation. Two of the three HPQ pathways were later obtained by eukaryotes through endosymbiosis forming chloroplasts and mitochondria, enabling their rise to dominance in modern oxic ecosystems.",

The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity cosimulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.",

          "abstract": "Pathogenic Enterobacter species are of increasing clinical concern due to the multidrug-resistant nature of these bacteria, including resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Our understanding of Enterobacter virulence is limited, hindering the development of new prophylactics and therapeutics targeting infections caused by Enterobacter species. In this study, we assessed the virulence of contemporary clinical Enterobacter hormaechei isolates in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection and used comparative genomics to identify genes promoting virulence. Through mutagenesis and complementation studies, we found two porin-encoding genes, ompC and ompD , to be required for E. hormaechei virulence. These porins imported clinically relevant carbapenems into the bacteria, and thus loss of OmpC and OmpD desensitized E. hormaechei to the antibiotics. Our genomic analyses suggest porin-related genes are frequently mutated in E. hormaechei , perhaps due to the selective pressure of antibiotic therapy during infection. Despite the importance of OmpC and OmpD during infection of immunocompetent hosts, we found the two porins to be dispensable for virulence in a neutropenic mouse model. Moreover, porin loss provided a fitness advantage during carbapenem treatment in an ex vivo human whole blood model of bacteremia. Our data provide experimental evidence of pathogenic Enterobacter species gaining antibiotic resistance via loss of porins and argue antibiotic therapy during infection of immunocompromised patients is a conducive environment for the selection of porin mutations enhancing the multidrug-resistant profile of these pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and familial frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). To identify molecular defects that take place in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of patients with C9orf72 ALS/FTD, we compared healthy controls with C9orf72 ALS/FTD donor samples staged based on the levels of cortical phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein (pTDP-43), a neuropathological hallmark of disease progression. We identified distinct molecular changes in different cell types that take place during FTD development. Loss of neurosurveillance microglia and activation of the complement cascade take place early, when pTDP-43 aggregates are absent or very low, and become more pronounced in late stages, suggesting an initial involvement of microglia in disease progression. Reduction of layer 2-3 cortical projection neurons with high expression of CUX2/LAMP5 also occurs early, and the reduction becomes more pronounced as pTDP-43 accumulates. Several unique features were observed only in samples with high levels of pTDP-43, including global alteration of chromatin accessibility in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes; higher ratios of premature oligodendrocytes; increased levels of the noncoding RNA NEAT1 in astrocytes and neurons, and higher amount of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. Our findings reveal progressive functional changes in major cell types found in the prefrontal cortex of C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients that shed light on the mechanisms underlying the pathology of this disease.",

However, little is known about the most abundant O-glycans in the mammalian brain, which are N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc) linked. Here, we determined the spatial localization, protein carriers, and cellular function of O-GalNAc glycans in the mouse brain. We observed striking spatial enrichment of O-GalNAc glycans in neuronal tracts, and specifically at nodes of Ranvier, specialized structures involved in signal propagation in the brain. Glycoproteomic analysis revealed that more than half of the identified O-GalNAc glycans were present on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans termed lecticans, and display both domain enrichment and regional heterogeneity. Inhibition of O-GalNAc synthesis in neurons reduced binding of Siglec-4, a known regulator of neurite growth, and shortened the length of nodes of Ranvier. This work establishes a function of O-GalNAc glycans in the brain and will inform future studies on their role in development and disease.",

Recently, TMC1 and TMC2 (TMC1/2) have been recognized as the pore-forming subunit of the MT channel, but TMC1/2 functional expression in heterologous cells—which is critical for unequivocally identifying them as the bona fide pore-forming subunit of the MT channel—has not been achieved because ectopic TMC1/2 become trapped in the ER. Here, we report that adding a Fyn lipidation tag to mouse TMC1/2 (mTMC1/2) drove their cell-surface expression, and, importantly, full-length mTMC1/2 expressed alone functioned as mechanosensitive channels, underscoring the view that TMC1/2 constitute the sole pore-forming subunit of the MT channel. Moreover, mouse transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) (mTMIE) protein robustly stimulated TMC1/2 channel activity by modulating their gating. Intriguingly, the N-terminal 27 residues of mTMIE were dispensable for regulating TMC1/2 in our in vitro functional assay, whereas, in striking contrast, mutating mTMIE C76C77, the predicted palmitoylation sites, eliminated mTMIE stimulation of mTMC1/2, indicating a crucial role of the palmitoyl group in regulating TMC1/2 gating. mTMC1/2+mTMIE form 18 pS and 24 pS single channels, respectively. mTMC1/2+mTMIE single channels showed biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of the MT channel. Our findings provide insights into several fundamental and debated aspects of the function of TMC1/2 and TMIE, and our functional assay of TMC1/2 and TMIE in heterologous cells will facilitate further functional and structural characterization of these proteins and other MT-complex components.",

          "abstract": "Building differences between genetically equivalent units is a fundamental challenge for all multicellular organisms and superorganisms. In ants, reproductive or worker fate is typically determined during the larval stage, through feeding regimes managed by adult caretakers. However, the feeding care provided to larvae varies significantly across ants, as does phenotypic divergence between queen and worker castes. Here, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods and causal inference to investigate the relationships between larval feeding care, caste size dimorphism, and social complexity across ant diversity. We digitized the life’s work of George and Jeanette Wheeler, cataloging the larval morphology of over 700 species, and we compiled data on species diets and larval feeding behaviors from the literature and our own observations. We measured queen–worker size dimorphism in 392 species and gathered data for colony size, worker polymorphism, and worker reproduction. Our analyses revealed that ancestral active-feeding larvae evolved passive morphologies when adults began feeding them individually, typically with processed material and often following a shift to nonpredatory diets. Greater queen–worker size dimorphism coevolved with larval passiveness, alongside traits indicative of increased social complexity, including larger colony sizes, worker subcastes, and a reduction in workers’ reproductive potential. Likelihood comparisons of causal phylogenetic models support that extended alloparental care facilitated stronger caste dimorphism, which, in turn and along with increased colony sizes, promoted higher social complexity. Our results suggest that enhanced adult control over larval development enabled greater phenotypic specialization within colonies, with profound implications for social evolution.",

Next, radial glial cells generate tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs) that give rise to cortical astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from cortical neurogenesis to gliogenesis, and the subsequent fate determination of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons, remain unclear. Here, we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a fundamental role in promoting cortical gliogenesis and the generation of Tri-IPCs. Additionally, sonic hedgehog-smoothened-glioma-associated oncogene homolog (SHH-SMO-GLI) activator signaling has an auxiliary function to ERK during these processes. We further demonstrate that, from Tri-IPCs, NOTCH signaling is crucial for the fate determination of astrocytes, while ERK signaling plays a prominent role in oligodendrocyte fate specification, and SHH signaling is required for the fate determination of olfactory bulb interneurons. We provide evidence suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in both mice and humans. Finally, we propose a unifying principle of mammalian cortical gliogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Viral proteins frequently mutate to evade host innate immune responses, yet the impact of these mutations on the molecular energy landscape remains unclear. Epistasis, the intramolecular communications between mutations, often renders the combined mutational effects unpredictable. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a major virulence factor of the influenza A virus (IAV) that activates host PI3K by binding to its p85β subunit. Here, we present a deep analysis of the impact of evolutionary mutations in NS1 that emerged between the 1918 pandemic IAV strain and its descendant PR8 strain. Our analysis reveals how the mutations rewired interresidue communications, which underlie long-range allosteric and epistatic networks in NS1. Our findings show that PR8 NS1 binds to p85β with approximately 10-fold greater affinity than 1918 NS1 due to allosteric mutational effects, which are further tuned by epistasis. NMR chemical shift perturbation and methyl-axis order parameter analyses revealed that the mutations induced long-range structural and dynamic changes in PR8 NS1, relative to 1918 NS1, enhancing its affinity to p85β. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations and graph theory-based network analysis for conformational dynamics on the submicrosecond timescales uncover how these mutations rewire the dynamic network, which underlies the allosteric epistasis. Significantly, we find that conformational dynamics of residues with high betweenness centrality play a crucial role in communications between network communities and are highly conserved across influenza A virus evolution. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the allosteric and epistatic communications between distant residues and provide insight into their role in the molecular evolution of NS1.",

Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi and ensure the coexpression of the different enzymes coordinating the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Here, we report the identification of a withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family ( Solanaceae ). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolic analyses revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed subclusters, containing several pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this subfunctionalization is tightly associated with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two subclusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the structural chromatin level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomics, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific subfunctionalization is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on an instance of an epigenetically modulated subfunctionalization within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids important in plant defense and amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and anticancer properties.",

Further, variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT-MCD) of the ligand field transitions, combined with nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy of the two S=1 Fe IV =O systems show that the equatorial ligand field decreases from a nonheme to a heme Fe IV =O site. Alternatively, RIXS and Fe L-edge XAS combined with MCD show that the Fe d π orbitals are unperturbed in the Fe IV =O heme relative to the nonheme site because the strong axial Fe-O bond uncouples the Fe d π orbitals from the porphyrin π -system.

Since low-TMB tumors express fewer neoantigens, they are less responsive to ICI therapy like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of low-TMB melanoma, we recently demonstrated that exposure to 6-thioguanine (6TG) significantly improved tumor control by increasing TMB and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. The combination of 6TG with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, although it did not fully inhibit tumor growth. We here investigated additional ICI combinations, assessing anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-1 to improve efficacy. ICI eliminated tumors in 6TG-exposed mice when ICI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 20 mm 3 , stopped tumor growth at volumes of 120 mm 3 , and had no effect at volumes of 300 mm 3 . Finally, we showed that mice achieving complete tumor regression with 6TG and ICI treatment exhibited lasting immune memory, which effectively suppressed tumor growth at relapse upon re-exposure to tumor cells. These findings may pave the way to effective application of ICI to low-TMB cancers, when initiated at low tumor volume.",

          "abstract": "Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses.",

          "abstract": "The conservation of biodiversity represents a global challenge as the world experiences its sixth mass extinction. Understanding how conservation efforts are allocated is paramount to effectively protect threatened species. We analyzed ~14,600 conservation projects over a 25-y period, revealing substantial taxonomic biases in funding. When matched with formal assessments of species’ threat status, several highly threatened groups such as amphibians receive little and ever-decreasing support. Within particular groups (e.g., Mammalia, Reptilia), funding is directed to a very narrow selection of taxa, leaving the majority of their threatened species with limited or no support. More attention is urgently needed to assess the extinction risks of neglected taxa, especially smaller species. Paradoxically, while approximately 6% of species identified as threatened were supported by conservation funds, 29% of the funding was allocated to species of “least concern”. A more holistic distribution of conservation funding is, therefore, urgently needed if we are to protect biodiversity efficiently. We suggest avenues and mechanisms for a more balanced coverage of threatened species within conservation programs and highlight some of the benefits that could be derived from such an approach.",

          "abstract": "Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical–genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.",

However, observed increases in algal biomass do not consistently correlate with air temperature or precipitation, and evidence is lacking for a causal effect of climate or the nonlinear dynamics needed to demonstrate regime shifts. We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.",

          "abstract": "Dark-field microscopy is a technique used in optical microscopy to increase the contrast in unstained samples, making it possible to observe details that would otherwise be difficult to see under bright-field microscopy; thus, it has been widely employed in biological research, material science, and medical diagnostics. However, most dark-field microscopy methods cannot overcome the optical diffraction limit and require a bulky dark-field condenser and precise alignment of each optical element. In this study, we introduce a planar photonic device that can produce random speckles for dark-field illumination and improve the optical resolution. This planar device is made of random distribution fibers for injection of a laser beam, a scattering layer to produce random speckles, a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) to produce a hollow cone of light, and a metallic film to increase the energy efficiency. This planar device can work as a substrate for conventional microscopy. Taking advantage of the hollow cone of light with random speckles generated by the proposed planar device, we achieve a high-contrast, label-free image with a 1.55-fold improvement in spatial resolution. Furthermore, random evanescent speckles can be generated on the 1DPC just through tuning the incident wavelength, which demonstrates the ability for optical surface imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The advantage of this technique is that it does not require complex optical system or precise knowledge of the illumination pattern. This study will expand the potential applications of dark-field microscopy and provide insights into samples that might otherwise be invisible under traditional dark-field microscopy.",

          "abstract": "Neural activity in sensory cortex is modulated by behavioral and cognitive factors, and this modulation is thought to contribute to the selection of specific sensory information needed to achieve behavioral goals. In contrast, more abstract behavioral variables that are independent of stimulus selection, such as stimulus–response mapping, are thought to be encoded by neurons outside of sensory cortex. We show that information about such mapping is robustly encoded in the responses of neurons in primate visual cortex. Monkeys were trained to alternate between two tasks that differed in the rule governing the mapping of a remembered visual cue onto an eye movement response. During the memory-delay period, neurons in area V4 reliably signaled the remembered cue location in both tasks. However, the encoding of cue location depended critically on the stimulus–response mapping rule. Thus, V4 delay activity encoded the mapping rule and signaled the preparation of the appropriate motor response rather than spatial working memory per se, contrary to previous assumptions. In addition, we probed the origins of motor-related delay activity and found that it was reduced during local inactivation of the frontal eye field (FEF). The results demonstrate that behavioral modulation of visual cortical activity is not solely related to the selection of sensory stimuli but instead reflects a distinct mechanism for sensory-guided motor output.",

          "abstract": "The Huns appeared in Europe in the 370s, establishing an Empire that reshaped West Eurasian history. Yet until today their origins remain a matter of extensive debate. Traditional theories link them to the Xiongnu, the founders of the first nomadic empire of the Mongolian steppe. The Xiongnu empire dissolved, however, ~300 y before the Huns appeared in Europe, and there is little archaeological and historical evidence of Huns in the steppe during this time gap. Furthermore, despite the rich 5th to 6th centuries current era (CE) archaeological record of the Carpathian Basin, the cultural elements of connections with the steppe are limited to few findings and even fewer solitary eastern-type burials. In this study, we coanalyze archaeological evidence with 35 newly sequenced and published genomic data for a total of 370 individuals—from 5th to 6th century CE contexts in the Carpathian Basin including 10 Hun-period eastern-type burials, 2nd to 5th century sites across Central Asia and 2nd c. before current era (BCE) to 1st c. CE Xiongnu period sites across the Mongolian steppe. We find no evidence for the presence of a large eastern/steppe descent community among the Hun- and post-Hun-period Carpathian Basin population. We also observe a high genetic diversity among the eastern-type burials that recapitulates the variability observed across the Eurasian Steppe. This suggests a mixed origin of the incoming steppe conquerors. Nevertheless, long-shared genomic tracts provide compelling evidence of genetic lineages directly connecting some individuals of the highest Xiongnu-period elite with 5th to 6th century CE Carpathian Basin individuals, showing that some European Huns descended from them.",

          "abstract": "The escalating demand for rare earth elements (REEs) highlights the necessity for their sustainable recovery from waste streams and secondary resources. However, this process requires materials with exceptional selectivity and capacity for REEs due to their low concentration and high presence of interfering ions. Herein, we synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and subsequently modified it with tributyl phosphate (TBP) to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the recovery of REEs. The distribution coefficients ( K d ) of ZIF-8-TBP for REEs (neodymium, Nd, and dysprosium, Dy) were orders of magnitude higher than the K d of main interfering ions (e.g., Mg, Ni Al, and Fe). Particularly, the maximum sorption capacities ( q m ) for Nd and Dy were 475 and 529 mg g −1 , respectively. In addition, the separation factor between Dy (a representative of heavy REE) and Nd (a representative of light REE) reached 24, greatly exceeding the figures reported previously. Importantly, the outstanding ability of ZIF-8-TBP for selective separation and recovery of REEs was demonstrated via its application to real samples including mining wastewater, and leaching solutions from REE filter cakes and discarded NdFeB magnets. Multiscale simulations reveal that ZIF-8-TBP possessed a stronger binding strength and greater sorption energy for REE ions. These results indicate that ZIF-8-TBP could effectively harvest REEs from wastes and offers an efficient alternative for industrial applications in REE recovery.",

The reflectors dip unidirectionally with inclinations in the range 6° to 20° and are imaged to a thickness of 10 to 35 m along an uninterrupted 1.3 km northward shoreline-perpendicular traverse. The consistent dip inclinations, absence of dissection by fluvial channels along the extended traverse, and low permittivity of the sediments are consistent with terrestrial coastal deposits—and discount fluvial, aeolian, or magmatic origins favored elsewhere on Mars. The structure, thickness, and length of the section support voluminous supply of onshore sediments into a large body of water, rather than a merely localized and short-lived melt event.

Moreover, the steroid hormone ecdysone, which is mainly synthesized in the female ovary during sexual maturation, acts on LK neurons via the ecdysone receptor to suppress sexual receptivity. We further found that LK suppresses female receptivity through its receptor LKR in central pC1 neurons, a decision center for female sexual behavior.

This allows us to directly visualize the spatial variations in density, orientational order, and the entanglement, a mesoscopic field that we define in terms of a local average crossing number, a measure of the topological complexity of the packing. We find that increasing the aspect ratio of the constituent rods in a packing leads to a proliferation of regions of strong entanglement that eventually percolate through the system and correlated with a sharp transition in the mechanical stability of the packing. To corroborate our experimental findings, we use numerical simulations of contacting elastic rods and characterize their stability to static and dynamic loadings. Our experiments and computations lead us to an entanglement phase diagram which we also populate using published experimental data from pneumatically tangled filaments, worm blobs, and bird nests along with additional numerical simulations using these datasets. Together, these show the regimes associated with mechanically stable entanglement as a function of the statistics of the packings and loading, with lessons for a range of systems from reconfigurable architectures and textiles to active morphable filamentous assemblies.",

          "abstract": "The cGAS–STING pathway mediates innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA. In addition to its well-established role in inducing inflammatory cytokines, activation of the cGAS–STING pathway also induces noncanonical autophagy, a process involving the conjugation of the ATG8 family of ubiquitin-like proteins to membranes of the endolysosomal system. The mechanisms and functions of STING-induced autophagy remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that STING activation induced formation of pH-elevated Golgi-derived vesicles that led to ATG16L1 and V-ATPase-dependent noncanonical autophagy. We showed that STING-induced noncanonical autophagy resulted in activation of the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors (TFEB, TFE3, and MITF), which regulate lysosome biogenesis. We found that lipidation of the ATG8 proteins, particularly GABARAPs, inhibited phosphorylation of MiT/TFE transcription factors by mTORC1. The lipidated GABARAPs bound to the Folliculin-interacting proteins (FNIPs), thereby sequestering the FNIP-folliculin protein complexes from activating mTORC1, resulting in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE transcription factors. Furthermore, we found that STING-induced autophagy activated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease, through GABARAPs lipidation. We further showed that STING-induced autophagy induced ALIX-mediated ESCRT machinery recruitment to mitigate endolysosomal perturbation.

RBPMS gene expression positively correlates with VSMC contractile markers in human and murine atherosclerotic arteries as well as in two vascular injury models during the postinjury intimal hyperplasia phase. RBPMS promotes contractile VSMC differentiation, reduces plaque cap development in high-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E-null ( ApoE −/− ) murine atherosclerotic arteries, and inhibits intimal hyperplasia.

The direct generation of spin-polarized electrons at catalytic surfaces remains elusive, and the underlying mechanisms are still controversial due to the lack of intrinsically chiral catalysts. To address this challenge, we investigate topological homochiral PdGa (TH PdGa) crystals with intrinsically chiral catalytic surfaces for ORR. Through spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, we show that both structural chirality and spin–orbit coupling are critical for inducing spin polarization at the surface of TH PdGa. As a result, TH PdGa achieves a kinetic current density over 100 times higher than the achiral PdGa (AC PdGa) at 0.85 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode.

          "abstract": "DNA is heterogeneously packaged into chromatin, which is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) with sharp boundaries. These boundary locations are critical for genome regulation. Here, we explore how the distribution of DNA-packing density across chromatin affects the TAD boundary locations. We develop a polymer-physics-based model that utilizes DNA accessibility data to parameterize DNA-packing density along chromosomes, treating them as heteropolymers, and simulates the stochastic folding of these heteropolymers within a nucleus to yield a conformation ensemble. Such an ensemble reproduces a subset (over 60%) of TAD boundaries across the human genome, as confirmed by Hi-C data. Additionally, it reproduces the spatial distance matrices of 2-Mb genomic regions provided by FISH experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that utilizing DNA accessibility data alone as input is sufficient to predict the emergence and disappearance of key TADs during early T cell differentiation. We show that stochastic folding of heteropolymers in a confined space can replicate both the prevalence of chromatin domain structures and the cell-to-cell variation in domain boundary positions observed in single-cell experiments. Furthermore, regions of lower DNA-packing density preferentially form domain boundaries, and this preference drives the emergence of TAD boundaries observed in ensemble-averaged Hi-C maps. The enrichment of TAD boundaries at CTCF binding sites can be attributed to the influence of CTCF binding on local DNA-packing density in our model. Collectively, our findings establish a strong link between TAD boundaries and regions of lower DNA-packing density, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying TAD formation.",

          "abstract": "The experience of human parenthood is near ubiquitous and can profoundly alter one’s body, mind, and environment. However, we know very little about the long-term neural effects of parenthood for parents themselves, or the implications of pregnancy and caregiving experience on the aging adult brain. Here, we investigate the link between the number of children parented and age on brain function in 19,964 females and 17,607 males from the UK Biobank. In both females and males, parenthood was positively correlated with functional connectivity, such that higher number of children parented was associated with higher connectivity, particularly within the somato/motor network. Critically, the spatial topography of parenthood-linked effects was inversely correlated with the impact of age on functional connectivity across the brain for both females and males, such that the connections that were positively correlated with number of children were negatively correlated with age. This result suggests that a higher number of children is associated with patterns of brain function in the opposite direction to age-related alterations. Overall, these results indicate that the changes accompanying parenthood may confer benefits to brain health across the lifespan, altering aging trajectories, consistent with animal models of parenthood and preliminary findings of “younger-looking” brain structure in human parents. Observing this effect in both females and males implicates the caregiving environment, rather than pregnancy alone, and highlights the importance of future work to disentangle the underlying mechanisms related to the direct impact of caregiving, the indirect impact of the environment, and the result of covarying sociodemographic factors.",

          "abstract": "Humans often take actions to assist others experiencing unresponsiveness, such as transient loss of consciousness. How other animals react to unresponsive conspecifics—and the neural mechanisms driving such behaviors—remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.",

At the same time, quantum computing likely will not supplant classical computing in the foreseeable future—after all, quantum computing architectures are best equipped to solve certain problems, but not every problem. Quantum computers almost certainly will work in concert with classical processing, where each computing architecture will handle those parts of a calculation that it is best suited to tackle. For that to happen, the quantum computing hardware will require software that combines quantum with classical computing. It also must be devised in a user-friendly way so that nonquantum scientists and software developers working on problems such as modeling molecules with unprecedented accuracy and calculating interesting properties of structured datasets can run quantum computational tasks without having in-depth knowledge of quantum computing.",

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

While cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5′-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD + depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification-based anti-phage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.",

Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change.

Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity.

Here, we report an antiviral mechanism of type III CRISPR-Cas–regulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in which ATP is converted into inosine triphosphate (ITP) by CRISPR-Cas–associated adenosine deaminase (CAAD) upon activation by either cA 4 or cA 6 , followed by hydrolysis into inosine monophosphate (IMP) by Nudix hydrolase, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest. The cryo–electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 or cA 6 binds to the CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity. Our results reveal the mechanism of a CRISPR-Cas–regulated ATP depletion antiviral strategy.",

HARMONI operates at subsecond resolution, estimating 3D mesh representations and spatial interactions of humans, and adapts to challenging natural environments using an environment-targeted synthetic data generation module. Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are emerging as a promising platform for epitaxial growth, largely free from the constraints of lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient mismatches. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices. In this regard, developing a process for growing high-quality 3D epitaxial materials before and after the growth of 2D TMDs and understanding the 2D/3D interface are crucial. This study demonstrates the sequential growth of fully epitaxial ZnSe/MoSe 2 /ZnSe heterostructures using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. ZnSe and MoSe 2 , sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase. Multiscale analysis involving transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals lattice commensurability, van der Waals gaps, termination, and interfacial reconstruction. Understanding these interactions is crucial for advancing multidimensional integration of 2D and 3D materials.",

In a liquid crystal (LC), the topological nature of disclination lines and colloids induces chiral colloidal entanglements. How the chirality of the entanglements is deterministically created and how the chirality conversion is actuated in the disclinations with Möbius strip topology have never been explored. Here, we create colloidal entanglements with designed chirality in the nematic disclination loops with Möbius topology. An irreversible process of chirality change is revealed if we move the colloidal entanglement along the loops. A nonreciprocal chirality conversion in the dynamical colloidal entanglements is demonstrated, which is induced by the interplay between topological profiles and the geometrical curvature of the disclination loop. Colloidal entanglements in opposite chirality are templated in arbitrary shapes of disclination lines. This work opens opportunities to design smart colloidal materials.",

Herein, we theoretically propose a form of electromagnetic toroidal vortex solutions that uniquely integrates both scalar and vector characteristics, challenging the prevailing notion of their mutual exclusivity. We also present an experimental generation of hybrid toroidal vortex pulses by a compact coaxial horn emitter augmented with a radial metasurface. These topological pulses exhibit peculiar electromagnetic features, such as vortex streets, skyrmions, and transverse orbital angular momentum, and may present advantages when propagating through perturbations, opening avenues for enhanced free-space information transmission, topologically nontrivial light-matter interaction, and microscopy techniques.",

Yet, plasticity rules operating on one-shot episodic memory timescales rarely depend on both pre- and postsynaptic spiking, challenging Hebbian theory in this crucial regime. Here, we present an episodic memory model governed by a simpler rule depending only on presynaptic activity. We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model.",

          "abstract": "Cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.",

Herein, we report subnanopore-rich carbon spheres encapsulated with Sn single atoms (Sn/CS@SC) as a Li host to address these challenges. Owing to the high Li affinity of Sn single atoms, Sn/CS@SC can promote storage of quasi-metallic Li within the inner void space other than direct plating of metallic Li on the outer surface. Moreover, the subnanopores with a strong spatial confinement effect can prevent the penetration of ester electrolyte for reduced side reactions. As expected, the Sn/CS@SC host demonstrates a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 600 cycles. Moreover, a full cell using a prelithiated Sn/CS@SC anode and LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode shows high capacity retention (~80%) over 500 cycles at high current density.",

Essential for both aspects are rapid chromosome movements enabling the pairing of homologous chromosomes, thereby promoting their recombination and ensuring their correct segregation afterward. However, it is unknown how meiocytes reorganize their nuclear architecture when chromosomes are tethered to the nuclear lamina in somatic cells. Here, we reveal the meiosis-specific Skp1–Cul1–F-box-protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF RMF as a key regulator of this reorganization in Arabidopsis . We find that the nuclear lamina proteins of the CRWN family are degraded in an SCF RMF -dependent manner in this process. Thus, the SCF RMF functions to release the somatic constraints on chromosome mobility through disrupting the nuclear lamina, allowing homologous chromosomes to pair.",

          "abstract": "Glycosylation chemistry plays a pivotal role in glycoscience. Recent substantial developments have poised the field to address emerging challenges related to sustainability, cost efficiency, and robust applicability in complex substrate settings. The transition from stoichiometric activation to metal-catalyzed methods promises enhanced chemoselectivity and greater precision in controlling glycosidic bond breakage and formation, key to overcoming existing obstacles. Here, we report a nitrene-mediated glycosylation strategy using regular aryl sulfide glycosyl donors and easily accessible 3-methyl dioxazolone as an activator under the catalysis of iron or ruthenium. The iron-catalyzed system demonstrates exceptional catalytic reactivity, requiring as little as 0.1 mole % of catalyst at room temperature, and works well for complex peptide substrates.

          "abstract": "Data-driven models widely used for assessing landslide susceptibility are severely limited by the landslide and environmental data needed to create them. They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible.",

Sediment-loaded plumes discharged by flashfloods deposit onto the seabed. Burrowing animals disrupt these flood layers, erasing the paleorainfall record. Fortuitously, we discovered an anoxic deep-sea brine pool sited close enough to shore to chronicle floods, yet be otherwise undisturbed by animals. Cores retrieved from the pool delivered a 1600-year rainfall record. We merge these core-layer histories with modern rainfall statistics, satellite observations, and simulations to deliver a high-resolution quantitative Late Holocene hydroclimate record for Arabia. We find that the modern era is 2.5 times drier than the last 1.6 thousand years. The Little Ice Age stands out as particularly wet. That period experienced a fivefold increase in rainfall intensity compared to today. Though hyperarid now, the flood layers demonstrate that climate shifts can generate weather conditions unwitnessed in the modern era. Such long-range insight is crucial for framing uncertainties surrounding future hydroclimate forecasts.",

This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques.

Notably, N2G directly links kinesin-1 to F-actin, enabling the transport of actin filaments along microtubule tracks, establishing active cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.

In this study, we developed a low-input ac 4 C sequencing technology, ac 4 C LACE-seq, and mapped 8241 ac 4 C peaks at the whole-transcriptome level using 50 mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage. Oocyte-specific Nat10 knockout wiped out ac 4 C signals in oocytes and caused severe defects in meiotic maturation and female infertility. Mechanically, Nat10 deletion led to a failure of ac 4 C deposition on mRNAs encoding key maternal factors, which regulate transcriptome stability and maternal-to-zygotic transition. Nat10 -deleted oocytes showed decreased mRNA translation efficiency due to the direct inhibition of ac 4 C sites on specific transcripts during meiotic maturation.

Furthermore, we observe that atlantification is extending far beyond the Lomonosov Ridge into the Makarov Basin of the Arctic Ocean where upper ocean ventilation creates a new and unique ecological environment. The eastern part of the Siberian Arctic Ocean is still strongly stratified, but the atlantification-driven shoaling of warm, salty, and nutrient-rich intermediate waters already has important ecological consequences there.

We characterize the platform and then demonstrate its modularity by using 16 affinity domains against four different antigens with minimal protocol optimization. We show that TLISA is suitable for POC use by sensing human biomarkers in serum and saliva with a colorimetric readout within 1 hour and by demonstrating functionality after lyophilization.

Hematopoietic-specific Mto1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were embryonic lethal and showed niche-independent defect in erythroblast proliferation and terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes were severely impaired in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver, and this was followed by cytosolic iron accumulation. Overloaded cytosolic iron promoted heme biosynthesis, which induced an unfolded protein response (UPR) in Mto1 cKO erythroblasts.

Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H 2 molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity.

By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system’s anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components.

Laboratory studies defined each type’s specific absorption properties. Our results indicate that chromatic acclimation offers an evolutionary advantage by enabling Synechococcus to adapt to varying light environments.

Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis.

Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role.

Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.",

Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability.

          "abstract": "Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) usually lead to significantly improved clinical benefits in immunotherapy but are rarely observed within native tumors. The current approaches are difficult in effectively inducing TLS formation, let alone fully exploiting its anticancer efficacy. Here, a biomimetic nanovesicle (ADU-S@M1) is constructed to target tumors and then to produce abundant activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in situ by polarizing the tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype and promoting dendritic cell maturation. These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy.",

A promising mechanism for large-scale natural H 2 generation is serpentinization of exhumed mantle material. We study this serpentinization-related H 2 generation during rifting and subsequent rift-inversion orogen development using numerical geodynamic models. Serpentinization-related H 2 generation is best known from rifted margins and spreading ridges. However, because orogens are colder than rift environments, conditions for serpentinization and natural H 2 generation are considerably better in orogenic settings: We find that yearly H 2 generation capacity from serpentinization in the overriding mantle wedge during rift inversion may be up to 20 times larger than during rifting. Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H 2 accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings. Together with indications of ongoing natural H 2 generation in the Balkans and Pyrenees, our model results provide a first-order motivation for natural H 2 exploration in rift-inversion orogens.",

Herein, we show that TPE-Gal, which contains a tetraphenylethene unit and a galactose moiety, offers a promising molecular therapy designed to light up and eliminate senescent cells through a hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by β-galactosidase, an enzyme overexpressed in senescent cells. The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing. Moreover, apoptotic vesicles, which are generated during the process, are partly phagocytosed by macrophages, mimicking physiological metabolic processes. This study opens new avenues for addressing bone health issues through the designed bioclearance of senescent cells, aligning with the body’s natural pathways for maintaining homeostasis.",

The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",

In the oceans, cyanobacterial diazotrophs, mostly prevalent in warm tropical and subtropical waters, were traditionally considered the sole contributors to marine N 2 fixation. Recently, an almost ubiquitous distribution of N 2 -fixing heterotrophic bacteria has been discovered in the pelagic ocean. However, the mechanisms enabling heterotrophic diazotrophs to thrive in cold high-latitude waters and their contribution to the global nitrogen budget are unknown. Using a data-driven cell-based metabolic model, we show that heterotrophic bacteria inside sinking particles can fix N 2 over a wide range of temperatures, explaining their ubiquitous presence in the oceans. We estimate that heterotrophic diazotrophs account for about 10% of global marine N 2 fixation, with the highest contribution in oxygen minimum zones. These findings call for a reassessment of the N 2 fixation patterns and the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in the global ocean.",

In-depth functional studies in vitro and in vivo further reveal that specific ncUCEs can be enhancers of tumor suppressors (such as ARID1B) and silencers of oncogenic proteins (such as RPS13). Moreover, several miRNAs located in ncUCEs are recurrently mutated.

Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast. We propose that ion-sensitive conformational changes in a PLD directly regulate transcription to maintain ionic strength homeostasis in animal cells.",

Our case study is Mono Lake in California, which has close to 1 millimolar dissolved P at steady state despite extremely high rates of biological productivity, in contrast to smaller closed basins where life is scarce. Hence, large closed-basin lakes offer an environment where high rates of prebiotic P productivity can plausibly coexist with high steady-state P concentrations.

However, the mechanisms regulating this conversion remain unclear. In this study, we showed that removal of toxic and bitter SGAs is under the control of DNA demethylation, ethylene, and key transcription factors by forming a feedback loop that governs the expression of key GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM ( GAME ) genes during ripening. Moreover, the ethylene-inducible transcription factors NON-RIPENING, RIPENING INHIBITOR, and FRUITFULL1 coordinately regulate the expression of GAME31 , GAME40 , GAME5 , and the glycoalkaloid transporter gene GORKY , whereas jasmonic acid–induced MYC2 modulates the transcription of GAME36 .

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire. Our results highlight the role of convection and fuel in wildfire forecast, prompting a revisit of wildfire prediction under intertwined atmospheric and terrestrial changes.",

Here, we report an unexplored associative strategy to realize DME formation at room temperature and the generation of olefins even at 413 kelvin, which is achieved by coinjecting basic acetone to manipulate the local chemical microenvironment of the methanol reactant inside the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation.

In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O 2 evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups. We found that the nonequivalent electron distribution within an asymmetric M A -O-M B backbone (metal-to-metal charge transfer via oxygen ligands) increases electron density on electronegative transition metal ions, preventing them from reaching unstable oxidation states within an operating voltage range.

To address this, we used immunopeptidomic analysis and RNA sequencing on five metastatic OC samples, which identified 311 cryptic peptides (40 to 83 per patient).

The strain-induced folding structures and no active-material design endow the wireless-charging MBs with reliable deformation-tolerant capabilities, which can sustain ~200% omnidirectional strains and have advantages of an order of magnitude in terms of power and energy densities, compared to the existing in-plane MBs. With the exceptional compatible and elastic properties, a wirelessly charging stretchable display integrated circuit and even intelligent electronic skin are achieved, capable of mimicking human touch to sense the weight, temperature, and shape of objects.",

          "authors": "Sanjana Kumaraguru, James Morgan, Fong Kuan Wong",
          "abstract": "Beyond their role as immune sentinels, microglia are actively involved in establishing and maintaining cortical circuits. Alteration in microglial numbers has been associated with abnormal behaviors akin to those observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function. Our findings reveal that microglia adapt their numbers to changes in pyramidal cell activity during a critical time window in development, consequently adjusting their numbers and function to the demands of the developing local circuits.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the remarkable adaptability observed in biological organisms, multifunctional soft robotics have emerged as promising systems capable of navigating complex environments. In this study, we present a strategy for weaving fiber soft actuators to overcome the existing limitations in deformation capabilities and complex manufacturing processes. This strategy combines traditional rope artistry with the advanced responsive characteristics of electro-driven liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) fibers, facilitating the efficient creation of multifunctional soft actuators. Leveraging this strategy, we have developed four distinct types of soft actuators: the double twisting weaving actuator (DTWA), the circular four-strand weaving actuator (CFWA), the orthogonal weaving actuator (OWA), and the diagonal weaving actuator (DWA). These weaving fiber soft actuators can be readily assembled in various soft robots, granting multiple functionalities, including surface shape programmability, biomimetic blood pumping inspired by the cardiac muscle, and versatile locomotion modes such as crawling and swimming. Our proposed strategy offers unprecedented opportunities for multifunctional soft robots in performing complex tasks.",

Emerging see-through color-tunable applications pose a synergetic demand on electrochromic device, concurrently having ultralow field driving, operation in transmissive mode, and high-purity and tunable interference colors of sci-fi perception. However, such an electrochromic device remains elusive. Herein, we invent a transmissive electro-interference-color device based on two-dimensional titania liquid crystals (2D TiO 2 LCs), demonstrating a record-high electroresponse sensitivity of ~1.5 × 10 −7 square meters per square volt among all wide-bandgap media. Consequently, the device works under an electric field of 6 × 10 3 volts per meter (three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional LCs), operates in a transmissive mode with ~85% transparency, and displays pure and tunable interference colors. The electro-interference-color device serves as a good example to fabricate diverse see-through chromatic applications as conceptually demonstrated smart windows with functions of privacy protection, energy saving, and artistic presentation as well as transparent display.",

          "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) represents a promising gene-specific therapy against tumors. However, its clinical translation is impeded by poor performance of lysosomal escape and tumor targeting. This challenge is especially prominent in glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, necessitating the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leveraging the intrinsic tumor-targeting and BBB traversing capability of human H-ferritin, we designed a series of ferritin variants with positively charged cavity and truncated carboxyl terminus, termed tHFn(+). These nanocarriers respond to weak acid and disassemble in endosomal compartments, exposing the internal positive charges to facilitate the lysosomal escape of loaded small interfering RNA (siRNA). Functioning as universal siRNA nanocarriers, tHFn(+) significantly enhanced the uptake of different siRNAs and suppressed gene expressions associated with GBM progression. Furthermore, tHFn(+) traversed the BBB and targeted glioma in vivo by binding to its receptors (e.g., transferrin receptor 1). tHFn(+)-delivered siRNAs exhibited exceptional therapeutic effects against glioma in vivo, advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond GBM for the treatment of various diseases.",

          "abstract": "Oocytes naturally present mechanical defects that hinder their development after fertilization. Thus, in the context of assisted reproduction, oocyte selection based on their mechanical properties has great potential to improve the quality of the resulting embryos and the success rate of these procedures. However, using mechanical properties as a quantifiable selective criterion requires robust and nondestructive measurement tools. This study developed a constriction-based microfluidic device that monitors the deformation of mouse oocytes under controlled pressure. The device can distinguish mechanically aberrant oocyte groups from healthy control ones. On the basis of a mathematical model, we propose that deformability measurements infer both oocyte tension and elasticity, elasticity being the most discriminating factor in our geometry. Despite force transmission during oocyte deformation, no long-term damage was observed. This noninvasive characterization of mouse oocyte deformability in microconstrictions allows for a substantial advance in assessing the mechanical properties of mammalian oocytes and has potential application as a quantifiable selective criterion in medically assisted reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Implantable medical devices (IMDs) provide effective medical solutions for diverse health care applications. Electrical circuits are crucial for implantable devices due to the requirement of intended functions, such as communication with external devices. Circuits have several risks, such as biocompatibility issues, power limitations, or size constraints. In this work, we propose a passive modulated ultrasound (PMU) principle for IMDs and develop a circuit-free ultrasonic system (CUS) for thoracic pressure monitoring. The PMU principle can passively modulate monitored physiological signals into ultrasound pulses without using electrical circuits or power supply. The size of the developed CUS is only 2.5 millimeters in radius and 850 micrometers in height. Animal experiments demonstrated that the CUS, with a high sensitivity (−22.96 millivolts per kilopascal), can monitor thoracic pressure to assist in diagnosing different heart diseases, including cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction. The PMU provides a human-friendly wireless sensing and communication strategy for IMDs, which promotes advancements in health care applications within the human body.",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of marine algae in the Neoproterozoic Era is thought to have stimulated the ecology of predatory microbial eukaryotes. To test this proposal, we introduced algal particulate matter (APM) to marine sediments underlying a modern marine oxygen minimum zone with bottom-water oxygen concentrations approximating those of the late Neoproterozoic water column. We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18 S rRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans.",

          "abstract": "Biological membranes consist of a lipid bilayer studded with integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Most α-helical membrane proteins require protein-conducting insertases known as translocons to assist in their membrane insertion and folding. While the sequence-dependent propensities for a helix to either translocate through the translocon or insert into the membrane have been codified into numerical hydrophobicity scales, the corresponding propensity to partition into the membrane interface remains unrevealed. By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern. Using this system, we determined the sequence-dependent propensities for transfer from the translocon to a TM, interfacial, or extramembrane space and compared these propensities with the corresponding probability distributions determined from the sequences and structures of experimentally determined proteins.",
