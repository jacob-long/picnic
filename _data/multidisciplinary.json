          "abstract": "Intersectionality describes interdependent systems of inequality related to sex, gender, race, age, class and other socio-political dimensions. By focusing on the compounded effects of social categories, intersectional analysis can enhance the accuracy and experimental efficiency of science. Here we extend intersectional approaches that were predominantly developed in the humanities, social sciences and public health to the fields of natural science and technology, where this type of analysis is less established. Informed by diverse global and disciplinary examples—from enhancing facial recognition for diverse user bases to mitigating the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized populations—we extract methods to demonstrate how quantitative intersectional analysis functions throughout the research process, from strategic considerations for establishing research priorities to formulating research questions, collecting and analysing data and interpreting results. Our goal is to offer a set of guidelines for researchers, peer-reviewed journals and funding agencies that facilitate systematic integration of intersectional analysis into relevant domains of science and technology. Precision in research best guides effective social and environmental policy aimed at achieving global equity and sustainability.",

          "abstract": "A critical challenge in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the simultaneous attainment of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high stability. Employing polymers interfaces in PSCs can enhance durability by blocking water and oxygen, and by suppressing ions interdiffusion, but their electronic shielding poses a challenge for efficient and stable PSCs1–3. In this study, we report a magnetic endohedral metallofullerene Nd@C82-polymer coupling layer, which features ultra-fast electron extraction and in-situ encapsulation, thereby promoting homogeneous electron extraction and suppressing ions interdiffusion. The Nd@C82-polymer coupling layer in PSCs exhibited PCE of 26.78% (certified 26.29%) and 23.08% with an aperture area of 0.08 square centimetres and 16 square centimetres (modules), respectively. The unencapsulated devices retained ~82% of the initial PCE after 2,500 hours of continuous 1-sun maximum power point operation at 65 °C.",

          "abstract": "Photons can carry angular momentum, which is conventionally attributed to two constituents—spin angular momentum (SAM), which is an intrinsic property related to the polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is related to the photon spatial distribution. In paraxial optics, these two forms of angular momentum are separable1, such that entanglement can be induced between the SAM and the OAM of a single photon2,3 or of different photons in a multi-photon state4. In nanophotonic systems, however, the SAM and the OAM of a photon are inseparable5,6, so only the total angular momentum (TAM) serves as a good quantum number7,8,9. Here we present the observation of non-classical correlations between two photons in the near-field regime, giving rise to entanglement related to the TAM. We entangle those nanophotonic states by coupling photon pairs to plasmonic modes and use quantum imaging techniques10,11 to measure their correlations. We observe that entanglement in TAM leads to a completely different structure of quantum correlations of photon pairs, compared with entanglement related to the two constituent angular momenta. This work paves the way for on-chip quantum information processing using the TAM of photons as the encoding property for quantum information.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits 1 . More than 300 mutations in POLG , the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists 2 . Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA.",

          "abstract": "At subduction zones, lithospheric material descends through the upper mantle to the mantle transition zone (MTZ), where it may continue to sink into the lower mantle or stagnate 1,2 . Several factors may be important in influencing this flow, including chemical heterogeneity 3–5 . However, tight constraints on these mantle flows and the exact factors that affect them have proved challenging. We use P-to-S receiver functions to image the subducting slab and the MTZ beneath the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. We image a singular, superdeep (&gt;700 km) 660-km discontinuity over a 200-km-wide zone within the slab, accompanied by nearby double 660 discontinuity phases (normal and superdeep). Combined geodynamic and waveform modelling shows that this observation cannot be explained by temperature effects in typical mantle compositions but requires a large basalt-rich chemical anomaly, strongest in the location of the singular, deep 660. The inferred basalt signature is near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge 6,7 , where basalt is probably present in greater proportions. Our finding suggests that past tectonic events impart chemical heterogeneity into slabs, and the heterogeneities, in turn, may affect the inherent tendency of the slab to sink.",

          "abstract": "Materials with a high electrocaloric effect (ECE)1,2 tend to favour a disordered yet easily tunable polar structure. Perovskite ferroelectrics3 stand out as ideal candidates owing to their high dielectric responses and reasonable thermal conductivity. The introduction of multielement atomic distortions induces a high-polar-entropy state4 that notably increases the ECE by effectively overcoming the constraints imposed by highly ordered, polar-correlated perovskite structures. Here we developed a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric with strong polar disorder through targeted multielement substitution at both the A and B sites of the perovskite, effectively distorting the lattice structure and inducing a variety of nanoscale polar configurations, polymorphic polar variants and non-polar regions. A combination of these multielement-induced features led to an increased density of interfaces, significantly enhancing the polar entropy. Remarkably, a high ECE for an entropy change of about 15 J kg−1 K−1 under a 10 MV m−1 field is observed for the material across a broad temperature range exceeding 60 °C. The formation of ultrafine, dispersed, multiphase lattice configurations leads to high-polar-entropy ferroelectric oxides with a high ECE and a long lifetime of over 1 million cycles that are suitable for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors for practical electrocaloric refrigeration applications.",

The field is centrally motivated by finding alternative technologies to extend computational progress in a post-Moore’s law and Dennard scaling era15,16,17,18,19. Despite these advances, no photonic chip has achieved the precision necessary for practical AI applications, and demonstrations have been limited to simplified benchmark tasks. Here we introduce a photonic AI processor that executes advanced AI models, including ResNet3 and BERT20,21, along with the Atari deep reinforcement learning algorithm originally demonstrated by DeepMind22. This processor achieves near-electronic precision for many workloads, marking a notable entry for photonic computing into competition with established electronic AI accelerators23 and an essential step towards developing post-transistor computing technologies.",

Although current reinforcement-learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires substantial human expertise and experimentation 1,2 . Here we present the third generation of Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world 3 . Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic biodiversity decline threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the many benefits they provide to humanity1. As well as causing species losses in directly affected locations, human influence might also reduce biodiversity in relatively unmodified vegetation if far-reaching anthropogenic effects trigger local extinctions and hinder recolonization. Here we show that local plant diversity is globally negatively related to the level of anthropogenic activity in the surrounding region. Impoverishment of natural vegetation was evident only when we considered community completeness: the proportion of all suitable species in the region that are present at a site. To estimate community completeness, we compared the number of recorded species with the dark diversity—ecologically suitable species that are absent from a site but present in the surrounding region2. In the sampled regions with a minimal human footprint index, an average of 35% of suitable plant species were present locally, compared with less than 20% in highly affected regions. Besides having the potential to uncover overlooked threats to biodiversity, dark diversity also provides guidance for nature conservation. Species in the dark diversity remain regionally present, and their local populations might be restored through measures that improve connectivity between natural vegetation fragments and reduce threats to population persistence.",

          "abstract": "Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch 1 . DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara’s genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco 2 , associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch.",

It has been extensively investigated for applications in communications 1 , computing 2 , metrology 3 , imaging 4 and quantum optics 5 . With its advantages of small footprint, large nonlinearity and dispersion-engineering capability, optical integrated waveguides are excellent candidates for realizing high-gain and large-bandwidth four-wave mixing for which anomalous dispersion is a key condition. Various waveguides based on, for example, silicon, aluminium gallium arsenide and nonlinear glass have been studied 6–10 , but suffer from considerable gain and bandwidth reductions, as conventional design approaches for anomalous dispersion result in multi-mode operation. We present a methodology for fabricating nonlinear waveguides with simultaneous single-mode operation and anomalous dispersion for ultra-broadband operation and high-efficiency four-wave mixing. Although we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, the design approach can be used with other platforms as well. By using higher-order dispersion, we achieved unprecedented amplification bandwidths of more than 300 nm in these ultra-low-loss integrated waveguides. Penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit s −1 data in a single optical channel of over 200 nm was realized. These single-mode dispersion-engineered nonlinear waveguides could become practical building blocks in various nonlinear photonics applications.",

Here we found that treating these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and about 1,000 °C in the presence of CO and NO in steam (reactive treatment under reducing atmosphere) leads to the dispersion of ceria nanoparticles into high-density 2D (roughly one atomic layer thin) CexOy domains, as confirmed by microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These domains, which densely cover the alumina, exhibit substantially enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity, facilitating easier extraction of oxygen and the formation of Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies. As a result, these catalysts—whether with or without PGMs, such as Rh and Pt—show improved activity for several industrially important catalytic reactions, including NO and N2O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation, even after exposure to harsh ageing conditions. This study shows a catalyst architecture with superior redox properties under conditions that typically cause sintering, offering a pathway to more efficient metal–ceria catalysts for enhanced general catalysis.",

Here, analyses using mass spectrometry detection show the widespread occurrence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) polymers and oligomers in plant leaves, and identify that their levels increase with atmospheric concentrations and the leaf growth duration. The concentrations of PET and PS polymers can reach up to 104 ng per g dry weight in leaves at the high-pollution areas studied, such as the Dacron factory and a landfill site, and 102–103 ng per g dry weight of PET and PS can be detected in the open-air-grown leafy vegetables. Nano-sized PET and PS particles in the leaves were visually detected by hyperspectral imaging and atomic force microscopy–infrared spectroscopy. Absorption of the proactively exposed non-labelled, fluorescently labelled or europium-labelled plastic particles by maize (Zea mays L.) leaves through stomatal pathways, as well as their translocation to the vascular tissue through the apoplastic pathway, and accumulation in trichomes was identified using hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the absorption and accumulation of atmospheric MPs by plant leaves occur widely in the environment, and this should not be neglected when assessing the exposure of humans and other organisms to environmental MPs.",

By 2050, the total number of patients with osteoarthritis is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide 2 . As no disease-modifying treatments exist for osteoarthritis, a better understanding of disease aetiopathology is urgently needed. Here we perform a genome-wide association study meta-analyses across up to 489,975 cases and 1,472,094 controls, establishing 962 independent associations, 513 of which have not been previously reported. Using single-cell multiomics data, we identify signal enrichment in embryonic skeletal development pathways. We integrate orthogonal lines of evidence, including transcriptome, proteome and epigenome profiles of primary joint tissues, and implicate 700 effector genes. Within these, we find rare coding-variant burden associations with effect sizes that are consistently higher than common frequency variant associations. We highlight eight biological processes in which we find convergent involvement of multiple effector genes, including the circadian clock, glial-cell-related processes and pathways with an established role in osteoarthritis (TGFβ, FGF, WNT, BMP and retinoic acid signalling, and extracellular matrix organization). We find that 10% of the effector genes express a protein that is the target of approved drugs, offering repurposing opportunities, which can accelerate translation.",

          "abstract": "The mammalian nucleus is compartmentalized by diverse subnuclear structures. These subnuclear structures, marked by nuclear bodies and histone modifications, are often cell-type specific and affect gene regulation and 3D genome organization1,2,3. Understanding their relationships rests on identifying the molecular constituents of subnuclear structures and mapping their associations with specific genomic loci and transcriptional levels in individual cells, all in complex tissues. Here, we introduce two-layer DNA seqFISH+, which enables simultaneous mapping of 100,049 genomic loci, together with the nascent transcriptome for 17,856 genes and subnuclear structures in single cells. These data enable imaging-based chromatin profiling of diverse subnuclear markers and can capture their changes at genomic scales ranging from 100–200 kilobases to approximately 1 megabase, depending on the marker and DNA locus. By using multi-omics datasets in the adult mouse cerebellum, we showed that repressive chromatin regions are more variable by cell type than are active regions across the genome. We also discovered that RNA polymerase II-enriched foci were locally associated with long, cell-type-specific genes (bigger than 200 kilobases) in a manner distinct from that of nuclear speckles. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that cell-type-specific regions of heterochromatin marked by histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me3) are enriched at specific genes and gene clusters, respectively, and shape radial chromosomal positioning and inter-chromosomal interactions in neurons and glial cells. Together, our results provide a single-cell high-resolution multi-omics view of subnuclear structures, associated genomic loci and their effects on gene regulation, directly within complex tissues.",

          "abstract": "Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses1,2,3,4. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity5,6, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells7,8,9. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics’ behavioural actions10. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin’s ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin’s effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action.",

Importantly, how microvascular thromboinflammation resolves remains poorly understood due to the small size-scale of microvasculature and the long duration (weeks to months) of this process. Here we introduce a hydrogel-based thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model with long-term culture capabilities to model microvascular thromboinflammation and monitor clot resolution over clinically and physiologically relevant timescales (up to months). Using this system, we mapped out the distinct temporal phases of clot resolution in microvascular thromboinflammation. Using multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with our thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model, we observed that inflammation shifts the endothelium fibrinolytic balance to favour thrombosis and pinpointed neutrophil elastase as a double-edged sword that induces clot resolution but also tissue damage. We then investigated the mechanisms of potential therapeutic agents that either prevent microvascular thrombosis or accelerate clot resolution. Specifically, we observed that, in thromboinflammation, (1) early tissue plasminogen activator administration within 3 h directly improves endothelial barrier function; (2) prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms; and (3) combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease. These data introduce a paradigm in investigating the underlying mechanisms of thromboinflammatory clot resolution and conducting drug discovery thereof.",

Exploration of genetic, chemical and environmental factors demonstrated that a specific genotype background enabled high parthenogenesis and that full spectrum high-intensity light supplementation boosted parthenogenesis, yielding hundreds of haploid seeds per head.

In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress, protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1 motor3. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses, we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1.",

          "abstract": "The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2)1–4. Experiments to date have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at ν = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moiré unit cell) 1–6. In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist exotic quantum phases 7–15, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators (FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional states. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy 16,17 on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states 18. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing 1,3,19–21. Besides the known states, we observe additional fractional fillings between ν = 0 and -1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (ν > 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at ν = -4/3, -3/2, -5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases 7–15. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct moiré conduction and valence bands.",

Other complications9,10,11 include risks of infections, lacerations and perforations of the myocardium, and of displacements of external power supplies and control systems.

Experimental studies demonstrate effective pacing in mouse, rat, porcine, canine and human cardiac models at both single-site and multi-site locations. Pairing with a skin-interfaced wireless device allows autonomous, closed-loop operation upon detection of arrhythmias. Further work illustrates opportunities in combining these miniaturized devices with other medical implants, with an example of arrays of pacemakers for individual or collective use on the frames of transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems, to provide unique solutions that address risks for atrioventricular block following surgeries.

Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have produced models that accurately simulate brain activity, enhancing our understanding of the brain’s computational objectives and neural coding. However, it is difficult for such models to generalize beyond their training distribution, limiting their utility. The emergence of foundation models 1 trained on vast datasets has introduced a new artificial intelligence paradigm with remarkable generalization capabilities. Here we collected large amounts of neural activity from visual cortices of multiple mice and trained a foundation model to accurately predict neuronal responses to arbitrary natural videos. This model generalized to new mice with minimal training and successfully predicted responses across various new stimulus domains, such as coherent motion and noise patterns. Beyond neural response prediction, the model also accurately predicted anatomical cell types, dendritic features and neuronal connectivity within the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset 2 .

These clusters can be found at the centre of all galaxy types but tend to favour galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 10 9 M ⊙ (refs. 1,2 ). At present, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in situ star formation from gas infall 3 and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction 4 . Studies 5–9 of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, whereas the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, until now, no ongoing merger of GCs has been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N -body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need for large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps.",

          "abstract": "Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system1,2. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel NaV1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony. These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Although Earth, together with other terrestrial planets, must have had an early-formed protocrust, the chemical composition of this crust has received little attention. The protocrust was extracted from an extensive magma ocean formed by accretion and melting of asteroidal bodies1. Both experimental and chronological data suggest that the silicate melt ascending from this magma ocean formed in equilibrium with, or after, metal was extracted to form Earth’s core. Here we show that a protocrust formed under these conditions would have had incompatible (with respect to silicate minerals) trace-element characteristics remarkably similar to those of the current average continental crust. This has major implications for subsequent planetary evolution. Many geochemical arguments for when and how plate tectonics began implicitly assume that subduction is required to produce the continental trace-element signature. These arguments are severely compromised if this signature was already a feature of the Hadean protocrust.",

As advances in AI lead to growing computing demands, photonic computing has gained considerable attention as an appealing candidate. Nonetheless, there are substantial technical challenges in the scaling up of integrated photonics systems to realize these advantages, such as ensuring consistent performance gains in upscaled integrated device clusters, establishing standard designs and verification processes for complex circuits, as well as packaging large-scale systems. These obstacles arise primarily because of the relative immaturity of integrated photonics manufacturing and the scarcity of advanced packaging solutions involving photonics. Here we report a large-scale integrated photonic accelerator comprising more than 16,000 photonic components. The accelerator is designed to deliver standard linear matrix multiply–accumulate (MAC) functions, enabling computing with high speed up to 1 GHz frequency and low latency as small as 3 ns per cycle. Logic, memory and control functions that support photonic matrix MAC operations were designed into a cointegrated electronics chip. To seamlessly integrate the electronics and photonics chips at the commercial scale, we have made use of an innovative 2.5D hybrid advanced packaging approach. Through the development of this accelerator system, we demonstrate an ultralow computation latency for heuristic solvers of computationally hard Ising problems whose performance greatly relies on the computing latency.",

To overcome this longstanding challenge, we here describe a prototypical example of an alternative conceptual approach, “Strategic Atom Replacement”, in which we synthesize N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles. The net forward transformation is a “swap” of the isothiazole sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole.4,5 Linking the two azoles is an orphaned heterocycle class, 1,2,3-Thiadiazine-S-Oxides, whose synthetic potential has yet to be tapped.6 By proceeding via these unusual heterocycles, the typical selectivity and separation challenges associated with exclusively bond-based pyrazole preparations are circumvented, and even minimally differentiated peripheral substituents can be discriminated to afford isomerically pure products.",

Inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on targeting of dendritic compartments and developed an excitatory neuron classification based on dendritic reconstructions with whole-cell maps of synaptic input. Single-cell connectivity showed a class of disinhibitory specialist that targets basket cells. Analysis of inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of spatially intermingled subpopulations. Inhibitory targeting was organized into ‘motif groups’, diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking contemporary multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.",

          "abstract": "Retroelements have a critical role in shaping eukaryotic genomes. For instance, site-specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons have spread widely through preferential integration into repetitive genomic sequences, such as microsatellite regions and ribosomal DNA genes1,2,3,4,5,6. Despite the widespread occurrence of these systems, their targeting constraints remain unclear. Here we use a computational pipeline to discover multiple new site-specific retrotransposon families, profile members both biochemically and in mammalian cells, find previously undescribed insertion preferences and chart potential evolutionary paths for retrotransposon retargeting. We identify R2Tg, an R2 retrotransposon from the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as an orthologue that can be retargeted by payload engineering for target cleavage, reverse transcription and scarless insertion of heterologous payloads at new genomic sites. We enhance this activity by fusing R2Tg to CRISPR–Cas9 nickases for efficient insertion at new genomic sites. Through further screening of R2 orthologues, we select an orthologue, R2Tocc, with natural reprogrammability and minimal insertion at its natural 28S site, to engineer SpCas9H840A–R2Tocc, a system we name site-specific target-primed insertion through targeted CRISPR homing of retroelements (STITCHR). STITCHR enables the scarless, efficient installation of edits, ranging from a single base to 12.7 kilobases, gene replacement and use of in vitro transcribed or synthetic RNA templates. Inspired by the prevalence of nLTR retrotransposons across eukaryotic genomes, we anticipate that STITCHR will serve as a platform for scarless programmable integration in dividing and non-dividing cells, with both research and therapeutic applications.",

          "abstract": "Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin 1 . Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing 2,3 . However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 4 of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release 5,6 . Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin 7 . These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement.",

This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer’s disease.",

The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) provided the very first such genetic link to cancer 1,2 . However, little is known about the trajectory to CML, the rate of BCR::ABL1 clonal expansion and how this affects disease. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 haematopoietic colonies from nine patients with CML aged 22 to 81 years, we reconstruct phylogenetic trees of haematopoiesis. Intronic breaks in BCR and ABL1 were not always observed, and out-of-frame exonic breakpoints in BCR , requiring exon skipping to derive BCR::ABL1 , were also noted. Apart from ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, extra myeloid gene mutations were mostly present in wild-type cells. We inferred explosive growth attributed to BCR::ABL1 commencing 3–14 years (confidence interval 2–16 years) before diagnosis, with annual growth rates exceeding 70,000% per year. Mutation accumulation was higher in BCR::ABL1 cells with shorter telomere lengths, reflecting their excessive cell divisions. Clonal expansion rates inversely correlated with the time to diagnosis. BCR::ABL1 in the general population mirrored CML incidence, and advanced and/or blast phase CML was characterized by subsequent genomic evolution. These data highlight the oncogenic potency of BCR::ABL1 fusion and contrast with the slow and sequential clonal trajectories of most cancers.",

          "abstract": "Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations—sometimes affecting the same gene—will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions1. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1+/− deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress remodels brain homeostasis, in which persistent change leads to depressive disorders1. As a key modulator of brain homeostasis2, it remains elusive whether and how brain autophagy is engaged in stress dynamics. Here we discover that acute stress activates, whereas chronic stress suppresses, autophagy mainly in the lateral habenula (LHb). Systemic administration of distinct antidepressant drugs similarly restores autophagy function in the LHb, suggesting LHb autophagy as a common antidepressant target. Genetic ablation of LHb neuronal autophagy promotes stress susceptibility, whereas enhancing LHb autophagy exerts rapid antidepressant-like effects. LHb autophagy controls neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity by means of on-demand degradation of glutamate receptors. Collectively, this study shows a causal role of LHb autophagy in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress. Disrupted LHb autophagy is implicated in the maladaptation to chronic stress, and its reversal by autophagy enhancers provides a new antidepressant strategy.",

The activity and stability of SACs are governed by the pair of metal–adsorbate and metal–support interactions8,9,10. However, the understanding of these interactions with their catalytic performance in nature is challenging. Correlations of activity with the charge state of metal atoms have frequently reached controversial conclusions11,12,13,14,15. Here we report that the activity of palladium (Pd1) SACs exhibits a linear scaling relationship with the positions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of oxide supports across 14 types of semiconductor. Elevation of the LUMO position by reducing the support particle size to a few nanometres boosts a record high activity along with excellent stability in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. We show that the elevated LUMO of support reduces its energy gap with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Pd1 atoms, which promotes Pd1–support orbital hybridizations for high stability and further amends the LUMO of anchored Pd1 atoms to enhance Pd1–adsorbate interactions for high activity. These findings are consistent with the frontier molecular orbital theory and provide a general descriptor for the rational selection of metal–support pairs with predictable activity.",

Exposure to direct neonatal but not intrapartum antibiotics was associated with significantly lower antibody titres against various polysaccharides in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate and diphtheria toxoid antigens in the combined 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine at 7 months of age. Blood from infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics had an inflammatory transcriptional profile before vaccination; in addition, faecal metagenomics showed reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species in these infants at the time of vaccination, which was correlated with reduced vaccine antibody titres 6 months later. In preclinical models, responses to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were strongly dependent on an intact microbiota but could be restored in germ-free mice by administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species or a probiotic already widely used in neonatal units. Our data suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could mitigate the detrimental effects of early-life antibiotics on vaccine immunogenicity.",

Frequency differences between overtone modes—large separations—probe stellar density 2 , whereas differences between low-degree modes—small separations—probe the sound-speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main-sequence Sun-like stars 3 , and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterized by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and become proportional to large separations 4,5 . Here we present evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolutions, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.",

Streams of vapourized molecular substances that pass out of or into the skin alter the properties of the microclimate defined in this chamber in ways that can be precisely quantified using an integrated collection of wireless sensors. A programmable, bistable valve dynamically controls access to the surrounding environment, thereby creating a transient response that can be quantitatively related to the inward and outward fluxes of the targeted species by analysing the time-dependent readings from the sensors. The systems reported here offer unique capabilities in measuring the flux of water vapour, volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide from various locations on the body, each with distinct relevance to clinical care and/or exposure to hazardous vapours.

This has allowed the single-crystal structures of 48 alkyl-chain-containing molecules, including 6 natural products, 2 approved drugs and 18 custom-made compounds collected from 16 research groups, to be determined using standard SCXRD instrumentation. The structures of alkyl-chain-containing molecules derived from crude reaction products can also be determined directly by SCXRD analyses without further purification. The simplicity, high efficiency and apparent generality of the present pillar[5]arene-incorporated MOF-based supramolecular docking approach suggest that it could emerge as a new tool for the analyses of natural products and drugs that might not be amenable to traditional SCXRD-based structure determination.",

Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process 1 . Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar’s test: 45.7, P &lt; 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar’s test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians’ diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients’ access to specialist-level expertise.",

These properties were integrated to define 28 inhibitory, morpho-electric-transcriptomic (MET) cell types in mouse visual cortex16, which do not include synaptic connectivity. Conversely, large-scale electron microscopy (EM) enables morphological reconstruction and a near-complete description of a neuron’s local synaptic connectivity, but does not include transcriptomic or electrophysiological information. Here, we leveraged morphological information from Patch-seq to predict the transcriptomically defined cell subclass and/or MET-type of inhibitory neurons within a large-scale EM dataset. We further analysed Martinotti cells—a somatostatin (Sst)-positive17 morphological cell type18,19—which were classified successfully into Sst MET-types with distinct axon myelination and synaptic output connectivity patterns.

In mouse primary visual cortex, excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected 1–8 ; however, broader connectivity rules remain unknown. Here we leverage the millimetre-scale MICrONS dataset to analyse synaptic connectivity and functional properties of neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar response properties are preferentially connected within and across layers and areas—including feedback connections—supporting the universality of ‘like-to-like’ connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections beyond what could be explained by the proximity of axons and dendrites. We also discovered a higher-order rule whereby postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Recurrent neural networks trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns that mirror both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitudes similar to those in MICrONS data. Ablation studies in these recurrent neural networks reveal that disrupting like-to-like connections impairs performance more than disrupting random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may have a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems.",

However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel 14,15 , but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.",

With these feature-rich graphs, we automate a variety of tasks such as state-of-the-art automated proofreading of merge errors, cell classification, spine detection, axonal-dendritic proximities and other annotations. These features enable many downstream analyses of neural morphology and connectivity, making these massive and complex datasets more accessible to neuroscience researchers.",

Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (&lt;1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives.",

          "abstract": "At the heart of medicine lies physician–patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust 1,2 . Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians’ expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based 3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE’s performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination 4,5 . The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM–patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.",

          "abstract": "Radio-frequency (RF) accelerators providing high-quality relativistic electron beams are an important resource enabling many areas of science, as well as industrial and medical applications. Two decades ago, laser-plasma accelerators 1 that support orders of magnitude higher electric fields than those provided by modern RF cavities produced quasi-monoenergetic electron beams for the first time 2–4 . Since then, high-brightness electron beams at gigaelectronvolt (GeV) beam energy and competitive beam properties have been demonstrated from only centimetre-long plasmas 5–9 , a substantial advantage over the hundreds of metres required by RF-cavity-based accelerators. However, despite the considerable progress, the comparably large energy spread and the fluctuation (jitter) in beam energy still effectively prevent laser-plasma accelerators from driving real-world applications. Here we report the generation of a laser-plasma electron beam using active energy compression, resulting in a performance so far only associated with modern RF-based accelerators. Using a magnetic chicane, the electron bunch is first stretched longitudinally to imprint an energy correlation, which is then removed with an active RF cavity. The resulting energy spread and energy jitter are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to below the permille level, meeting the acceptance criteria of a modern synchrotron, thereby opening the path to a compact storage ring injector and other applications.",

The Chang’e-6 (CE6) mission returned samples from the South Pole–Aitken impact basin of the lunar farside2,3,4, providing an opportunity to study the water contents of the farside mantle. Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite and melt inclusions from CE6 mare basalt, derived from partial melting of the lunar mantle. The parent magma of CE6 mare basalt is estimated to have a water abundance of 15–168 μg g−1 with a δD value of −123 ± 167‰. Our estimate of water abundance of 1–1.5 μg g−1 for the mantle source indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier than its nearside counterpart. This contrast thus suggests that the distribution of water in the interior of the Moon may exhibit a hemispheric dichotomy similar to numerous surface features5. The new estimate for the lunar farside mantle represents a landmark for estimating the water abundance of the bulk silicate Moon, providing critical constraints on the giant impact origin hypothesis6,7,8 and the subsequent evolution of the Moon for which the role of water is central1,9.",

          "abstract": "Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food1. However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood. Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes. PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food. These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations. Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later. These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.",

Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka) 1 . In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys 2–4 . Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta’s geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region.",

Although numerous humid phases occurred in southern Arabia during the past 1.1 million years 9 , little is known about Arabia’s palaeoclimate before this time. Here, based on a climatic record from desert speleothems, we show recurrent humid intervals in the central Arabian interior over the past 8 million years. Precipitation during humid intervals decreased and became more variable over time, as the monsoon’s influence weakened, coinciding with enhanced Northern Hemisphere polar ice cover during the Pleistocene. Wetter conditions likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, with Arabia acting as a key crossroads for continental-scale biogeographic exchanges.",

          "abstract": "Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis with hooks, are a diverse endoparasitic group that infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates1. Although long regarded as a separate phylum, they have several putative sister taxa based on morphological features, including Platyhelminthes (flatworms)2, Priapulida (penis worms)3 and Rotifera (wheel animals)4. Molecular phylogenies have instead recovered them within rotifers5,6,7,8,9,10, suggesting acanthocephalans are derived from free-living worms with a jaw apparatus (Gnathifera). Their only fossil record is Late Cretaceous eggs11, contributing limited palaeontological information to deciphering their early evolution. Here we describe an acanthocephalan body fossil, Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis gen. et. sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou biota of China. Juracanthocephalus shows unambiguous acanthocephalan characteristics, for example a hooked proboscis, a bursa, as well as a jaw apparatus with discrete elements that is typical of other gnathiferans. Juracanthocephalus shares features with Seisonidea (an epizoic member of Rotifera) and Acanthocephala, bridging the evolutionary gap between jawed rotifers and the obligate parasitic, jawless acanthocephalans. Our results reveal previously unrecognized ecological and morphological diversity in ancient Acanthocephala and highlight the significance of transitional fossils, revealing the origins of this highly enigmatic group of living organisms.",

          "abstract": "Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia 1–5 . Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects 6–9 . Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system 10 . Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.",

          "abstract": "Resistance is rising against the assault on science, the environment and marginalized communities by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Battles are starting to play out in courts, but these cannot be the only sites of resistance. A broader, more inclusive defence of science is needed.\n\nI have felt the impacts of political assaults. In 2017, after Hurricane Maria hit my homeland, Puerto Rico, and killed thousands of people, the first Trump administration denied the death toll and delayed the provision of US$20 billion in disaster aid. And, last month, a programme I run at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania — to help undergraduates from all backgrounds gain research experience — was among thousands of US National Science Foundation grants branded as promoting “woke” diversity propaganda by Republican Senator Ted Cruz (Texas).\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nMy colleagues face similar challenges (see go.nature.com/42twbyb). The University of Pittsburgh is one of several that have paused or frozen graduate admissions, spending or hiring in response to the threat of losing millions in federal funding. Meanwhile, community environmental justice groups that I work with have been denied more than $50 million that was committed to them through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency has paused all funding actions related to Biden-era climate and infrastructure laws.\n\nA rising chorus of voices in the scientific community is sending a clear message that researchers need to step up and defend our hard-won gains. But what is to be done?\n\nOn climate change, for example, some researchers have proposed that compromise with moderate sectors, such as backing carbon-capture technologies, might be a way to keep up momentum. Yet such solutions fall short on environmental justice. They come from ‘top down’ and rely on big companies; surveys show that the public is unfamiliar with them; and their effectiveness at scale is yet to be demonstrated. Instead, policies to transition away from fossil-fuel dependence should emerge from democratic processes and deliberations that include and centre the needs of affected workers and communities.\n\n‘Silence is complicity’ — universities must fight the anti-DEI crackdown\n\nSimilarly, to protect the scientific enterprise itself, limiting ourselves to defence and elite-driven compromise will be a losing strategy. Those who believe in the importance of science for the public good should build power by boosting movements and coalitions and advocating for science and justice in the public arena.\n\nWe can learn from successes, such as the mobilizations that helped to enhance research-integrity policies after Trump’s first administration attacked science by sidelining and censoring scientists, reducing data accessibility and halting studies. Leveraging diverse voices through transnational alliances also has a proven track record, such as enabling the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.",

          "abstract": "An analysis identified studies that contained duplicated images or tortured phrases.Credit: bernie_photo/Getty\n\nA biotechnology journal that was inundated with paper-mill submissions in 2021 — and claimed in 2023 that it had tackled the problem — still harbours hundreds of dubious papers, an analysis by research-integrity sleuths has found.\n\nAt least 226 studies on rodents published in the open-access journal Bioengineered between 2010 and 2023 contain manipulated or duplicated images, says the analysis, which was posted on the arXiv preprint server on 28 March1. These are hallmarks of papers produced by paper mills — companies that churn out fake scientific manuscripts to order. Most of these 226 studies have not been retracted.\n\nScience’s fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills\n\nBioengineered and its publisher, Taylor & Francis, said in a 2023 blogpost that they became suspicious about paper-mill submissions in early 2021. In response, the publisher said, it had introduced policies to screen manuscripts more rigorously. However, the preprint’s authors say that efforts to clean up published papers have been too slow.\n\n“The problem isn’t that they were targeted by paper mills, because that can happen. It’s just the way that you solve the problem afterwards. And I think that this hasn’t happened correctly,” says René Aquarius, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a co-author of the preprint. “It’s been two to four years since most of these bad papers have been published,” he adds.\n\nTaylor & Francis says that it is investigating “a large number of articles” in Bioengineered that it suspects were produced by paper mills. “We will cross-check that list with papers of concern identified by the preprint’s authors,” a spokesperson for the UK-based publisher told Nature. “Alongside this work, we have made a range of editorial and process changes to the journal, which, as noted in the preprint, have prevented the publication of further paper-mill content.” The spokesperson declined to answer specific questions about the preprint’s findings.\n\nSuspicious activity\n\nFrom its launch in 2010 until 2019, Bioengineered published around 70 papers a year. This rose to 131 papers in 2020, then soared to more than 1,000 per year in 2021 and 2022.\n\n“Our previous experience on other journals that had been targeted by paper mills signaled the need for a thorough investigation,” said Todd Hummel, a global publishing director at Taylor & Francis, in the 2023 blogpost. He added that the journal had brought in measures to root out fraudulent submissions. These included asking authors to provide raw data with their manuscripts, training editors on how to spot paper-mill submissions and applying closer scrutiny to requests to change author lists. In 2023, the number of papers the journal published dropped back down to 64.\n\nScience journals crack down on image manipulation\n\n“I think it’s admirable that they have been transparent about this,” says Aquarius. “It’s great that [they] stopped the influx of paper-mill papers, or at least the acceptance of them.”\n\n“But why leave some of those papers for multiple years?” he adds. “I think cleaning up the literature is also an important task.”\n\nJana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press, who is based in Heidelberg, Germany, agrees. “It’s important that the effort of correcting the literature takes place efficiently, effectively, thoroughly and at a reasonable pace,” she says.\n\nManipulated images\n\nIn their analysis, Aquarius and his colleagues decided to screen studies that mentioned mice or rats in their titles or abstracts. The number of articles that met these criteria had increased sharply in 2021 — before 2019, they made up less than 15% of Bioengineered papers, but in 2021 and 2022, they accounted for more than 35%.",

          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nInclusion — not gatekeeping — is a theme in mathematician Nathan Alexander’s laboratory at Howard University in Washington DC. His quantitative-histories workshop is a computational and community hub for studying social problems, such as housing insecurity and homelessness. He founded that lab while in a previous post at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, and has now expanded it to include Howard and another site at the Institute for Racial Justice in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n“We have anyone and everyone come together,” he says. “Our youngest member is in high school, and our oldest is someone who, in their late 60s, was interested in returning to mathematics. We have members from the community, including formerly incarcerated persons,” he adds.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate students, along with collaborators from outside academia, all have a place at the table. By adopting a community-centred mindset, the team approaches problems with a blend of academic training and real-world experience. As a result, team members learn from each other, broaden their views on the problems they are studying and obtain better results than could be achieved without that diversity of perspectives.\n\nThe financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States\nFor instance, Alexander’s lab is in the early stages of a project to use the US Census Bureau’s community resilience estimates (CRE) — a metric of how vulnerable neighbourhoods are to disasters — to probe housing insecurity and homelessness.\n\n“Each member of our group is taking on an area of the United States that they are familiar with and conducting a local analysis to help us make sense of the different features across geographical contexts, and by state,” Alexander says. The team is also building a set of statistical models that can be used to compare relationships between the CRE and measures of segregation.\n\nAlexander, who is also assistant graduate director of the Center for Applied Data Science and Analytics at Howard, notes that it’s a common mistake to view mathematics as a universal pursuit that everyone approaches in the same way. Instead, as he tells Nature’s careers team, his team members each approach data-driven problems with their own unique lens.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a mathematician?\n\nSolving problems. At some point in studying mathematics, you learn a method to solve a problem. And then, as you learn more, you realize that there are many different ways to approach a problem. That has been the impetus for my interdisciplinary work — the idea that we can ‘patchwork’ our way to solutions and think about different fields and what they offer.\n\nIs there one thing in your career that you wish you could revisit?\n\nMy knee-jerk reaction is that things have really worked out in a way that has been beautifully scary. So I'm content with my choices.\n\nCollection: Changemakers in science\nIf I could go back and change one thing, I would spend a little more time in graduate school and do more exploring. At the time, I was broke, and wanted to be done with my studies, so I rushed through; I said to myself, let me get my dissertation taken care of and then I can begin my actual academic career. But now, I think it’s all about investigating and solving problems, and as a graduate student, I didn’t do enough of that. Now I’ve found more time to just do that and learn with my students and our community members.\n\nWhat is the coolest discovery to come out of your work?\n\nWe have found some really abstract connections between mathematical fields — such as graph theory, number theory, probability, game theory — and real-world problems.\n\nThe CRE census analysis is one example of our attempts to model real-world factors by taking a numerical analytic approach initially. Our goal is to consider mathematical insights, using probability and statistics, before moving forward with a single methodological model.\n\nMathematics is often viewed as being universal, but the field of ethnomathematics reveals that mathematical practices look different across cultures, communities and their histories. For the sake of universality, we would want to steer clear of a single frame of reference or method. Indeed, what we see among mathematicians today are attempts to make sense of a diverse set of problems across a diverse set of disciplines which give attention to the different cultural foundations of mathematics. People use mathematics differently, and they have done so throughout history.\n\nOur lab’s goal is to learn how to balance a focus on deep theoretical aspects with the need to quantify things. Often when we quantify, or mathematize, things, you want to get down to their essence, to their core. We have been working hard all these years to maintain those theoretical, critical foundations that contribute to intersections between maths and society. For example, we can quantify changes in demographics over time in a specific community, such as the effects of gentrification, but we see that these processes play out differently in cities such as Atlanta and Washington DC. We want to understand those nuances in both our theory and quantification.\n\nIf he could be a graduate student again, Alexander says he would spend more time simply exploring ideas.Credit: Cheriss May for Nature\nWhy is running an inclusive research group important to you?\n\nAnyone who visits our lab understands clearly that we try to get rid of hierarchy as much as possible. So, although I’m the principal investigator, founder and leader of the lab, I think that empowering everyone in our space — other faculty members, students and also our elders — to give us that context, that intuition, has been our greatest asset. We call this a near-peer model.\n\nFor example, a younger team member might have experience of recently released computational tools, whereas a more experienced member might discuss the different tools used over the course of their lifetime.\n\nImplementing this near-peer model has been a learning process. As faculty members, we’re often told to be the expert. I’ve tried to do the opposite of that by saying, “Here’s what I’m able to contribute. What do other people think?” That has led to this explosion of ideas.\n\nI want to ensure that Africans take part in the AI revolution\nIt also opens up space for all lab members to play around with ideas in a way that is not always possible in a conventional classroom setting. This ultimately leads to a ripple effect in which conventional lines of inquiry can be supplemented by, at times, abstract inquiries that result in many more ideas. We try our best to avoid a top-down model and collect regular feedback from lab members.",

          "abstract": "The Breakthrough prize trophy’s design is inspired by imagery from science, including black holes, seashells and the structure of DNA.Credit: The Breakthrough Prizes\n\nFive scientists who contributed to the development of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have picked up one of this year’s US$3-million Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science.\n\nOriginally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that controls blood sugar levels and helps to curb appetite. “This class of drugs truly saves lives, changes lives and brings joy back to people’s lives,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, a physician-scientist at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who recently led a massive study analysing data from almost two million people to evaluate the effects of such medication1.\n\nThe ‘breakthrough’ obesity drugs that have stunned researchers\n\nThis life-sciences prize is shared between the four researchers who discovered and characterized GLP-1 – endocrinologist Daniel Drucker at the University of Toronto, Canada; physician-researchers Joel Habener at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts and Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen; and chemist Svetlana Mojsov at The Rockefeller University in New York City — along with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark, who spearheaded the development of drugs based on these discoveries2,3.\n\nIn the 1990s, Drucker and his colleagues realized that GLP-1 caused animals to eat less and lose weight. Knudsen stablized the drug by adding fatty-acid chains, enabling it to bind to proteins in the blood, which prevents it from breaking down rapidly once injected. “It’s a tremendous honour to receive this prestigious award,” says Drucker. “But the most amazing gratification is when someone comes to my office and says, ‘I lost 40 pounds [18 kg] and I feel healthy’.”\n\nEveryone’s a winner\n\nThe award is one of six Breakthrough prizes to be awarded this year in life sciences, physics and mathematics.\n\nUnusually for a major award, one of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to a grand total of 13,508 physicists spanning four collaborations at CERN, Europe’s particle physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland. Through experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these researchers have taken multiple precision measurements over the past decade to probe, and so far confirm, the standard model of particle physics. “We’re honoured the award was made to the entire collaboration because without all those people we could not have made these advances,” says Patricia McBride, a spokesperson for CERN’s CMS collaboration. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit CERN, she adds.\n\nCERN’s Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, one of the collaborations whose scientists share a Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics.Credit: Harold Cunningham/Getty\n\nThe award is well deserved, says Brian Rebel, a particle physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Finding the Higgs [boson] in 2012 was a once-in-lifetime event, but it was only the first step,” Rebel says. Since then, LHC scientists have been pinning down the mass of the Higgs and its interactions, as well as discovering 72 new particles, investigating antimatter and probing the nature of the ‘quark–gluon plasma’ that existed soon after the Big Bang. “It takes a small army to create the tools to test and validate these results,” says Rebel.\n\nAnother Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to one of the architects of the standard model, theoretical physicist Gerard ’t Hooft at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who also won a share of the 1999 Nobel prize in physics for his work on the weak nuclear force, and contributed to understanding the strong nuclear force. “A beautiful synthesis emerges when one’s mathematics is linked to particles actually seen in the world,” says ’t Hooft, adding that he is “honoured” to win the prize.\n\nA theory of everything",

          "abstract": "McMurdo Station in Antarctica, which is operated by the US National Science Foundation, has been in need of repairs and upgrades for decades.Credit: U.S. National Science Foundation/Associated Press/Alamy\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s massive government cuts are threatening the nation’s leadership at the ends of the Earth, say scientists who work in Antarctica.\n\nBy presidential directive stretching back decades, the United States maintains three research stations in Antarctica. Each summer, scientists descend on them keen to make discoveries, and each winter small crews maintain the bases as a key national presence. US research in Antarctica has yielded groundbreaking insights into our planet, and the research stations aren’t just science hubs. They are also a proxy for geopolitical power; without them, the United States might cede soft power in Antarctica to other nations.\n\nTrump’s bid for Greenland threatens to destabilize Arctic research\n\nMuch of that research and clout is now in danger, many scientists say. US Antarctic research is run by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which Trump has threatened with drastic budget and staff cuts. He has already withdrawn construction funds previously set aside to update the biggest US Antarctic station, and his administration has fired and — under court order — rehired several crucial programme officers for Antarctic research.\n\nUncertainty about what might happen next is undermining plans for research from penguin surveys to studies of the Universe. “People are looking over their shoulders,” says Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “They don’t know whether the science that they have been doing for decades is of interest to NSF anymore.”\n\n“What’s really unhelpful is the timing,” says Gary Wilson, a geoscientist at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, and president of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. “The global issues we face are urgent.”\n\nUrgent work on the ice\n\nOf all the science done in Antarctica, none is more urgent than that seeking to understand the continent’s melting ice, which is fuelling sea-level rise that will displace millions of people in the coming decades. The NSF has supported many projects to study ice loss, coordinating the complex logistics of getting people and equipment to remote areas using icebreakers, ski-equipped planes and other polar infrastructure.\n\nNew Antarctic island spotted as mammoth glacier retreats\n\nSuch work has included a US–UK project allotted US$25 million over five years to study how quickly Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier is losing ice. “That’s a very small amount of money relative to the cost of not understanding what’s happening,” says Brent Minchew, a geophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who studies glacier melting.\n\nIn one of the agency’s biggest investments in facilities, the NSF’s Office of Polar Programs spends more than US$200 million each year to maintain civilian infrastructure at the three US bases: the small Palmer Station on an island off the Antarctic peninsula, the large McMurdo Station near the Ross ice shelf, and the remote Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station.\n\nEven before Trump took office in January, the NSF had been struggling to fund Antarctic work. Stagnant budgets led to programme cutbacks in the late 2010s, and COVID-19 derailed years of fieldwork. On top of that, the NSF has been trying to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure at McMurdo, but has not had enough money to do so.\n\nFieldwork fears\n\nBut last month, Trump cancelled the NSF’s construction budget for the current fiscal year ― which includes work on the McMurdo rebuild ― overriding Congress’s spending priorities. Scientists fear that he will also seek to slash the agency’s budget for the fiscal year 2026: one preliminary document leaked to The Washington Post suggested a 28% cut. Trump will release his budget request in the next few months, although the agency’s final budget for next year, to be decided by Congress, could differ substantially from that request.\n\nIf support for the Antarctic programme is slashed, then the NSF might not be able to fund substantial field research for at least a couple of years. “It feels like a complete exercise in blind hope to be writing scientific proposals and submitting them,” says a US scientist who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. In a worst-case scenario, the NSF could be faced with winding down research at the bases. “Keeping the stations alive is the first imperative,” says Michael Jackson, a geophysicist who worked at the NSF as an Antarctic programme officer until December. “Keeping the stations viable for science is the second, and doing science is the third.”",

          "abstract": "The problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI’m a biogeochemist from the United States. I experienced bullying in a previous workplace, where I wasn’t given opportunities to participate in academic activities such as applying for grants, teaching students and publishing papers. I have since learnt that others have been similarly victimized, but at the time I was encouraged not to take any formal action.\n\nThree years of no opportunities means I have very little to show from that crucial time in my career, and I have no reference from my manager.\n\nHow do I explain this career gap to prospective employers or represent this in my CV? — A struggling biogeochemist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s careers section spoke to three academics who study academic bullying and its impacts. All expressed their sympathy for any researcher — particularly those in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM) — caught in such a situation.\n\n“I’ve seen scholars who are in the social sciences and the liberal arts who can work their way around the mentor, and I think it’s harder in STEMM subjects because so much emphasis is put on the head of your lab: your adviser,” says Leah Hollis, associate dean of access, equity and inclusion at Pennsylvania State University in University Park.\n\nHollis notes that a gap in a publication record isn’t unusual, and can come from any number of life events, such as serious illness or caring responsibilities. However, she notes, “I know those stories are much more palatable than ‘my adviser was a jerk’.”\n\nLoraleigh Keashly, a communications scholar at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, agrees that it is OK to have a break in your career record, because “we already have mechanisms in place that say that there are extraordinary circumstances in one’s life that draw people’s attention away”.\n\nThe challenge is how to frame this particular circumstance. Having been on interview panels, Keashly says she might be curious enough to ask about a gap. Her advice is to address that question simply — saying, for example, that ‘there was a challenging environment, and it wasn’t a good fit’, or ‘the principal investigator (PI) wanted to move in one direction, I wanted to move in another’ — and move on to talk about other things, to avoid drawing extra attention to the experience.\n\nBoth Hollis and Keashly also suggested seeking out other researchers and academics in the field who could serve as references in place of the difficult supervisor. “Access professional networks, other people in the discipline,” Keashly says — maybe people you’ve worked with before, or you’ve met at conferences and “had positive, constructive conversations” about your work.\n\nHollis also suggests contacting the Academic Parity Movement — a non-profit organization in Brookline, Massachusetts, working to address academic bullying, discrimination and violence — which she is on the advisory board for. “Perhaps we can get you connected with somebody,” she says, such as other senior scientists in the field who might be familiar with your work and the situation.\n\nAn ‘agony aunt’ for working scientists",

          "title": "Microbial warfare brought us CRISPR. What big breakthroughs could be next?",
          "authors": "Amber Dance",
          "abstract": "All around the world — in the oceans, the soil, your body — an invisible battle is raging. Earth’s vast population of roughly 1030 bacteria faces an unending onslaught from an even larger army of viruses, known as bacteriophages. The bacteria have a variety of defences at their disposal: they chop up viral components, deny the invaders key ingredients for replication and even shut down their own biological systems to halt infections, sacrificing themselves to protect nearby kin. The viruses, in turn, evolve counter-defence mechanisms, resulting in an ever-escalating arms race.\n\nAlthough microbiologists are just beginning to understand the extent of this eternal contest, microbial immune mechanisms have already inspired technologies that have revolutionized biology. The discovery of restriction enzymes, bacterial proteins that slice DNA at specific sites, sparked the field of molecular biology in the 1970s, enabling everything from the development of genetically modified organisms to DNA forensics. CRISPR–Cas, a bacterial defence system that recognizes and slashes specific sequences in viral genomes, gave scientists the power to delete or edit genes with remarkable precision. Developed in the early 2010s, CRISPR-based gene editing has attracted billion-dollar investments and earned its key discoverers the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nCredit: Nik Spencer/Nature\n\nCRISPR–Cas and other breakthroughs have spurred an explosion of interest and discoveries in microbial defence systems. Thanks to advances in computational biology and genomic sequencing, scientists have identified a slew of immune mechanisms that bacteria and the other prokaryotic form of life on Earth, archaea, use in their ongoing existential struggle with viruses (see ‘The many sides of microbial immunity’).\n\n“I would venture to say that bacteria and archaea use everything that you can imagine for the purpose of defence — and then, some that you cannot,” says Eugene Koonin, an evolutionary biologist at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThe discoveries have already led to improvements in gene editing and other laboratory processes. And these defences — some of which have relatives in the human immune system — are likely to inspire new treatments, particularly in the area of phage therapies, which kill pathogenic bacteria but are harmless to humans, and antibiotics. And although no single technology seems poised to dethrone CRISPR–Cas as one of the most transformative biological discoveries of the century, the excitement is palpable.\n\n“To do better than CRISPR is a very tall order,” says Koonin, but “there are some of these systems that have very significant applications”.\n\nA strong defence\n\nAlthough bacteria and archaea and their phages have been locked in competition for billions of years, microbiologists were oblivious to the panoply of defence systems until the past decade or so. In part, that’s because there was no easy way to search for them, says Rotem Sorek, a microbiologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.\n\nThat changed in 2011, when Koonin, evolutionary biologist Kira Makarova and their colleagues showed that immunity genes in the microbial genome tend to cluster together in ‘defence islands’1. This discovery meant that scientists could use known defence genes to find likely suspects nearby.\n\nBiggest-ever AI biology model writes DNA on demand\n\nCandidates were soon pouring in. In the years that followed, Sorek’s group and others reported hundreds of potential defence genes2,3. Most of the research so far has focused on bacteria, for which scientists have ample tools to tinker with genes.\n\nTo verify a defence system, scientists can select a candidate, insert the genes into a standard strain of laboratory bacteria and test whether they allow the microbes to resist phages that they couldn’t fend off before. The discoveries are coming fast, says Artem Isaev, a microbial immunologist at the Center for Molecular and Cellular Biology in Moscow. “Right now, we are discussing in our journal club five papers a week, and we don’t have time to discuss everything.”\n\nStudies have yielded surprising immune mechanisms, such as the one biochemist Philip Kranzusch encountered while he was a postdoctoral researcher in Jennifer Doudna’s lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Kranzusch was not a microbiologist: he trained in human virology. In the early 2010s, he was interested in a human immune protein called cGAS. It detects foreign DNA and produces a signalling molecule that kick-starts part of the immune system known as the interferon response.\n\nBacteria contain enzymes that produce a similar signalling molecule, so Kranzusch wondered whether studying those enzymes would provide insights into cGAS function. Remarkably, the bacterial proteins had a very similar structure to cGAS. “I remember running into Jennifer’s office,” Kranzusch recalls. “The same machine, found in human cells, is found in bacteria as well.”\n\n‘Dark proteins’ hiding in our cells could hold clues to cancer and other diseases\n\nKranzusch, at his own lab at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, continued to investigate the system. Sorek was also studying the bacterial cGAS counterpart, called CBASS. Their groups showed that CBASS is a bona fide microbial defence system that even uses the same signalling molecule receptor, called STING, as the human immune system4,5.\n\nKranzusch and Sorek also discovered bacterial counterparts of eukaryotic immune proteins called gasdermins, which create pores in the cell membrane to kill infected cells and block viral replication6. And microbiologist Aude Bernheim, then a postdoc in Sorek’s lab, and her colleagues described prokaryotic versions of eukaryotic viperins: these proteins produce molecules that halt the transcription of viral genes into RNAs7. Sorek’s team also described a microbial immune mechanism called Thoeris that has close parallels with plant defences2.\n\n“From an evolutionary perspective, this is highly unexpected,” says Bernheim, who is now at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Scientists had presumed that immune systems would evolve rapidly in the face of ongoing viral assaults, leading to vast divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic defences. Instead, at least in some cases, a system that evolved in the precursor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes has persisted over billions of years of evolution, creating parallel biology in microbes and humans or plants.\n\nBuilding tools\n\nNow, biotechnologists are adapting these ancient innovations into lab or clinical tools.\n\nAt a basic level, they can protect valuable microbial cultures, says Owen Tuck, a graduate student in Doudna’s lab who is working on a DNA-chomping defence system called Hachiman. For instance, if a bioreactor became infected with phages, scientists could activate defences in the bacteria to vanquish the invaders, Tuck says.\n\nResearchers are also creating bespoke tools. Consider the Argonaute system, an immune response initially identified in eukaryotes — first in plants, then in animals. It uses small RNA guides to target other RNAs, such as viral RNAs, for destruction. In microbes, Argonaute systems work in more variable ways, says Daan Swarts, a biochemist at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands. Argonaute sensors might notice loose DNA ends, he speculates, or an excess of circular DNA molecules. In response to infection, Argonaute-associated mechanisms might then damage pathogen genes or deplete the cell of crucial metabolites such as NAD+ and NADP+, which are involved in energy generation and other processes.\n\nResearchers have used microbial Argonautes to edit bacterial genomes and cut precise DNA sequences in test tubes. In experiments seeking specific, rare sequences, scientists have also used Argonautes to eliminate common but undesired sequences so that the rare ones are easier to detect. And Swarts and his team have designed diagnostics to identify sequences of interest. To do so, they adapted the NAD+/NADP+-depleting system, called SPARTA, to create a test that changes colour or fluoresces once the target sequence is captured8. “Basically, any type of sequence can be detected with these Argonautes,” says Swarts. “We’ve not run into any limitations yet.”\n\nMany of these tasks can be performed by CRISPR–Cas, but Argonautes offer some different features. Both systems require a guide RNA to find target sequences, and the Cas enzyme also needs an extra bit of sequence, called a PAM, that helps Cas to bind to and unwind the DNA double helix. Argonaute works without a PAM and the guide RNA sequence can be shorter, making the system simpler to manufacture. Furthermore, Swarts notes, it is easier to submit patent applications for Argonautes than to obtain patents for ideas in the saturated CRISPR–Cas field.\n\nFeng Zhang, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has discovered9 another efficient CRISPR-like system. He and his colleagues sought molecules with genetic sequences and protein structures similar to CRISPR–Cas and found a DNA-binding system they called TIGR–Tas (for tandem interspaced guide RNA–TIGR-associated protein). Like CRISPR, it’s a two-part system that detects specific DNA sequences and can be programmed to cut at desired locations. But TIGR–Tas requires no PAM, and the components are physically smaller than those for CRISPR, which could be useful in applications such as gene therapy, in which only a limited amount of molecular cargo can be delivered to tissues.\n\nAnother bacterial defence system primed for innovation involves genetic elements called retrons. These were discovered in the 1980s, when scientists noticed hundreds of copies of short, single-stranded DNAs in samples of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. They determined that these single-stranded DNAs were produced by a reverse transcriptase enzyme — which creates DNA from an RNA template — and this type of system became known as a retron.

          "abstract": "Increased tariffs on imports into the United States are affecting the global trade in laboratory supplies.Credit: Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty\n\nThe Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs on all imports into the United States — which range from 10% on products from some countries up to 54% on goods from China — are increasing the costs of labware and specialist scientific instruments in the country. The price increases come as research budgets for US laboratories are stretched thin by unprecedented grant cancellations and cuts to university funding introduced since Donald Trump’s second presidency began in January.\n\n“We’re already doing quotes today that are 20% more than they were yesterday,” says Drew Kevorkian, chief executive of ARES Scientific in Miami Beach, Florida, which supplies research equipment to scientific laboratories, including those at many universities. “I think almost everybody is going to see a price increase of some sort.”\n\nThe latest round of tariffs comes into effect on 5 April for all countries, to be followed by steeper hikes for some on 9 April. It represents “systemic changes to the cost structure of doing science — and they’re landing at a time when research institutions are already under acute financial stress”, says Tinglong Dai, who researches global supply chains and health care at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “This isn’t just about belt-tightening. It could be the last straw — and risks causing lasting damage.”\n\nSource: TrendEconomy\n\nThe United States imports billions of dollars’ worth of lab equipment and reagents each year, says Dai (see ‘Global trade in reagents’). Many of these products come from countries about to be hit by tariff rises, including China, Switzerland, Japan, the United Kingdom and European Union countries; others come from Mexico and Canada, on which the Trump administration imposed tariffs earlier this year.\n\nAnnouncing the latest tariffs on 2 April, Trump said they will save the United States from a “national emergency”, boost a hollowed-out manufacturing base and reduce the country’s dependence on “foreign adversaries”. The news prompted global financial turmoil: stocks tumbled, and the International Monetary Fund is warning of a significant risk to the global economy.\n\nMicroscopes, glassware, DNA sequencers\n\nResearchers told Nature that the prices of many scientific products could be affected.\n\nChina supplies basic lab equipment, such as glass tubes, and reagents to the United States, they say, as well as advanced electronic equipment including computer chips, liquid-crystal displays and incubators. Germany (whose imports, like those from the rest of the EU, will be hit with a 20% tariff) and Japan (24%) supply high-end lab instruments such as microscopes or precision analytical devices, whereas Switzerland (32%) and the United Kingdom (10%) are major exporters of diagnostic tools, antibodies and specialty chemicals. Mexico supplies plasticware and Canada provides specialized equipment including DNA sequencers and cell counters. Sterilizers, centrifuges and glassware washers used in US labs often come from Europe.\n\n‘Does anyone have any of these?’: Lab-supply shortages strike amid global pandemic\n\n“These aren’t luxury items,” says Dai. “They’re the core infrastructure of modern science.”\n\nMikhail Kats, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, says it’s not clear how tariffs will apply to items already budgeted for in a grant. “Do we budget the price or the price with the tariff?” he asks.\n\nKevorkian says around 60% of the products his company supplies are made in the United States, and 40% are imported. But even US-made products often rely on imported components. “A DNA sequencer built in California might still depend on optics from Germany and semiconductors from China,” says Dai.\n\nSwitching to US-based suppliers doesn’t always reduce costs, says Kevorkian. “Believe it or not, some of the products that we’re buying overseas, even when you put the tariffs on them, they’re still less expensive than buying them from the US.”\n\nSupply-chain complexity",

          "title": "AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried",
          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "This February, ecologist Timothée Poisot was surprised when he read through the peer reviews of a manuscript he had submitted for publication. One of the referee reports seemed to have been written with, or perhaps entirely by, artificial intelligence (AI). It contained the telltale sentence, “Here is a revised version of your review with improved clarity and structure”, a strong indication that the text was generated by large language models (LLMs).\n\nPoisot hasn’t yet told the journal editor of his suspicions; he asked that the journal involved — which bans the use of LLMs in peer reviews — not be revealed in this article.\n\nBut in a blogpost about the incident, he argued strongly against automated peer review. “I submit a manuscript for review in the hope of getting comments from my peers. If this assumption is not met, the entire social contract of peer review is gone,” wrote Poisot, who works at the University of Montreal in Canada.\n\nAI systems are already transforming peer review — sometimes with publishers’ encouragement, and at other times in violation of their rules. Publishers and researchers alike are testing out AI products to flag errors in the text, data, code and references of manuscripts, to guide reviewers toward more-constructive feedback, and to polish their prose. Some new websites even offer entire AI-created reviews with one click.\n\nBut with these innovations come concerns. Although today’s AI products are cast in the role of assistants, AI might eventually come to dominate the peer-review process, with the human reviewer’s role reduced or cut out altogether. Some enthusiasts see the automation of peer review as an inevitability — but many researchers, such as Poisot, as well as journal publishers, view it as a disaster.\n\nMy other editor is AI\n\nEven before the appearance of ChatGPT and other AI tools based on LLMs, publishers had been using a variety of AI applications to ease the peer-review process for more than half a decade — including for tasks such as checking statistics, summarizing findings and easing the selection of peer reviewers. But the advent of LLMs, which mimic fluent human writing, has changed the game.\n\nIn a survey of nearly 5,000 researchers, some 19% said they had already tried using LLMs to ‘increase the speed and ease’ of their review. But the survey, by publisher Wiley, headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey, didn’t interrogate the balance between using LLMs to touch up prose, and relying on the AI to generate the review.\n\nThree AI-powered steps to faster, smarter peer review\n\nOne study1 of peer-review reports for papers submitted to AI conferences in 2023 and 2024 found that between 7% and 17% of these reports contained signs that they had been ‘substantially modified’ by LLMs — meaning changes beyond spell-checking or minor updates to the text.\n\nMany funders and publishers currently forbid reviewers of grants or papers from using AI, citing concerns about leaking confidential information if researchers load material into chatbot websites. But if researchers host offline LLMs on their own computers, then data aren’t fed back into the cloud, says Sebastian Porsdam Mann at the University of Copenhagen, who studies the practicalities and ethics of using generative AI in research.\n\nUsing offline LLMs to rephrase one’s notes can speed up and sharpen the process of writing reviews, so long as the LLMs don’t “crank out a full review on your behalf”, wrote Dritjon Gruda, an organizational-behaviour researcher at the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon, in a Nature careers column.\n\nBut “taking superficial notes and having an LLM synthesize them falls far, far short of writing an adequate peer review”, counters Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. If reviewers start relying on AI so that they can skip most of the process of writing reviews, they risk providing shallow analysis. “Writing is thinking,” Bergstrom says.\n\nLLMs can certainly improve some reviewers’ style, says Porsdam Mann: this is unsurprising, given that some peer reviews are slapdash or poorly written. However, LLM output almost always contains errors, because the tools work by producing text that seems statistically likely on the basis of their training data and inputs — although researchers are finding ways to dampen error rates.\n\nIn many cases, the gap between humans and LLMs isn’t so great, according to a study that provided more than 300 US computational biologists and AI researchers with reviews of their own papers — some produced by human reviewers and others by GPT-4, one of the leading LLMs at the time2. Some 40% of respondents said the AI was either more helpful than the human reviews, or as helpful; and a further 42% that the AI was less helpful than many, but more helpful than some (see ‘Comparing AI and human peer review’).\n\nSource: Ref. 2\nAI that goes beyond editing\n\nThe team behind the study that compared AI and human reviews, led by James Zou, a computational biologist at Stanford University, California, is now developing a reviewer ‘feedback agent’. It evaluates human review reports against a checklist of common issues — such as vague or inappropriate feedback — and, in turn, suggests how reviewers can improve their comments.\n\nAt a publisher innovation fair in London last December, many AI developers lined up to pitch products to improve peer review that do more than mere editing. One tool, called Eliza, launched last year by the firm World Brain Scholar (WBS) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, makes suggestions to improve reviewer feedback, recommends relevant references and translates reviews written in other languages into English. The tool is not meant to replace human peer reviewers, says WBS founder Zeger Karssen. “The tool will just analyse what the peer reviewer has written down,” he says.\n\nA similar tool is Review Assistant, developed by multinational publishing-services firm Enago and Charlesworth. Initially, the tool used an LLM system to answer structured queries about a manuscript, which reviewers could then check or verify. But after talking to publishers, developers added a ‘human first’ mode, in which reviewers answer the queries and then have an AI tool look at their answers. The tool can “support reviewers to do what they may already be doing illegitimately, in a legitimate way”, says co-developer Mary Miskin, global operations director at Charlesworth, who is based in Huddersfield, UK.\n\nAnother AI approach aims to free reviewers from the laborious parts of peer review. A start-up firm called Grounded AI, in Stevenage, UK, has developed a tool called Veracity, which checks whether cited papers in manuscripts exist, and then — using an LLM — analyses whether the cited work corresponds to the author’s claims. It functions like “the workflow that a motivated, rigorous human fact checker would go through if they had all the time in the world”, says co-founder Nick Morley.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nAnd a host of efforts have sprung up to apply LLM-assisted tools to existing papers — from software to spot image duplications, to statistics-checking programs. But researchers have expressed concerns that LLMs can be unreliable and that some apparent errors could be false positives.\n\nOne AI review tool that’s already in trials with publishers is Alchemist Review, developed by Grounded AI and a company called Hum in Charlottesville, Virginia. The software’s creators say that it can summarize core findings and methods and assess the novelty of research, as well as validate citations. They also say that reviewers can use the tool in a secure environment that protects the confidentiality of manuscripts and authors’ intellectual property.\n\nAIP Publishing, the publishing arm of the American Institute of Physics, headquartered in Melville, New York, is piloting a version of this software in two journals, says chief transformation officer Ann Michael. Journal editors will test a prototype of the tool and, at their discretion, allow some peer reviewers to try it. However, the publisher will not test the tool’s ability to judge novelty, because internal surveys suggested editors didn’t rate that as being as helpful as other features, Michael says. “We’re trying to learn how to responsibly apply AI to peer review,” she says, emphasizing that the tool is being used before human review, not to replace it.\n\nOther publishers also told Nature that they were exploring developing in-house AI tools for peer review, but didn’t say exactly what they were working on. Wiley, for instance, is “looking into various potential use cases for AI to strengthen peer review, including at the editor and reviewer levels”, a spokesperson said.\n\nA December 2024 study of guidelines at top medical journals3 found that among large publishers, Elsevier currently bans reviewers from using generative AI or AI-assisted review, whereas Wiley and Springer Nature permit “limited use”. Both Springer Nature and Wiley require the disclosure of any use of AI to support review, and forbid online uploading of manuscripts. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.) The study noted that 59% of the 78 top medical journals with guidance on the matter ban AI use in peer review. The rest allow it, with varying requirements.\n\nAI-led review?\n\nThe most radical applications of AI in peer reviewing are tools that directly provide automated reviews of manuscripts. One example is Paper-Wizard, which generates full-fledged multi-page reviews when a paper is uploaded, and checks for detailed aspects of methodological designs, such as statistical rigour. Its co-creator, cognitive neuroscientist Shane Ehrhardt in Brisbane, Australia, says that it is a ‘pre-peer-review’ product, intended to help authors with their own work.",

          "abstract": "People who have high trust in their health-care system are more likely to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.Credit: Anshuman Poyrekar/Hindustan Times via Getty\n\nScience has a trust problem — at least, that is the common perception. If only, the argument goes, we could get people to ‘trust’ or ‘follow’ the science, we, as a society, would be doing more about climate change, childhood vaccination rates would be increasing rather than decreasing and fewer people would have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. Characterizing the problem as ‘science denialism’, however, is misleading and wrongly suggests that the solution is to build greater trust between scientists and the public.\n\nIndeed, the research produced by our organizations — the Edelman Trust Institute think tank and the Global Listening Project non-profit organization — suggests that trust in science and scientists remains high globally. But scientists and scientific information exist in an increasingly complex ecosystem in which people’s perception of what counts as reliable evidence or proof is influenced by myriad other people and factors, including politics, religion, culture and personal belief. In the face of this complexity, the public are turning to friends, family, journalists and others to help them filter and interpret the vast amounts of information available.\n\nOur work suggests that the crux of science’s current challenge is not lost trust, but rather misplaced trust in untrustworthy sources. High trust levels can be dangerous when they are invested in institutions and individuals that are misinformed or not well-intentioned. In this regard, it is especially problematic when societal institutions become politicized and advocate policies and behaviours that are at odds with scientific consensus.\n\nMisplaced trust can drive behaviours that put people’s lives at risk1,2. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, cases and deaths were higher in nations, such as the United States and Brazil, that had political leaders who dismissed the severity or even existence of the pandemic, undermined the need for masks and questioned the safety of the vaccines2–4.\n\nIn what follows, we share data on trust in science and strategies to help scientists compete with non-credentialed sources for influence.\n\nUnpacking the real challenges\n\nTrust in science is generally high. A survey, conducted in 68 countries between November 2022 and August 2023, found that 75% of respondents said that they trusted scientists5. In a separate study across 70 countries, conducted by the Global Listening Project between July and September 2023, 71% of respondents said that they had high trust in science (see go.nature.com/3qyawpb). And the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual online survey of 28 countries conducted by the Edelman Trust Institute in November 2023, found that 74% of respondents trust scientists to tell the truth about new innovations and technologies6.\n\nBy contrast, our research revealed concern over the sanctity and independence of science, especially for certain topics, such as COVID-19 and climate change. More than half of Trust Barometer respondents (53%) said that science had become politicized in their country, and 59% said that governments and other large funding organizations have too much influence on how science is done6. One by-product of these perceptions has been an increase in aggression towards scientists7.\n\nAnother damaging consequence of this politicization is that it makes people more open to alternative narratives that might not be evidence-based and are often rooted in political ideologies, on topics such as climate and vaccines. This ideological schism is not defined by a pro-science versus anti-science antipathy but by a ‘my science’ versus ‘your science’ or a ‘my evidence’ versus ‘your evidence’ polarization.\n\nPeople in some countries put more trust in community leaders than scientists.Credit: Jorge Mantilla/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\n\nOften, this tension stems from the fact that scientists seek truth in experiments and data analyses, and focus on effects that manifest across large numbers of people. By contrast, the public is often focused on, and driven by, the experiences of people they know personally or vicariously. These experiences are taken as evidence and often carry more weight than peer-reviewed research.\n\nAll sides claim respect for science and evidence, hence the generally high numbers for trust in scientists across ideological groups; but each side has its own version of the ‘truth’ based on its own evidence and its own interpretation of what actions the evidence dictates6.\n\nFor example, parental concerns about the potential of vaccines to cause autism have been refuted by many scientific studies8; nevertheless, a parent’s experience with their own child or witnessing what has happened to others can be taken as direct and compelling evidence of a causal rather than a coincidental link between the timing of a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the onset of autism. Sometimes a sample of one, when you know that person, is more powerful emotionally, if not statistically, than a sample of 10,000.\n\nCompeting narratives around topics such as vaccines or climate change can also breed confusion, which manifests as doubt or misguided beliefs about the best actions to take, for oneself and for wider society. Doubt can weaken people’s resolve to support and follow scientific advice, especially when doing so requires effort, risk and sacrifice. Misguided beliefs, meanwhile, can lead people to act against their own or society’s best interests.\n\nAnother challenge is that many people trust non-scientists to tell them the truth about scientific matters. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer report, those with most influence include ‘someone like me’ (74%) and ‘friends and family’ (78%). Even celebrities (39%) and religious leaders (43%) enjoy substantial amounts of trust on technology and innovation matters6. Participants in the Global Listening Project study ranked family members higher than scientists when it came to who they would go to for truthful information in a crisis (see go.nature.com/3qyawpb and ‘Local influences’).\n\nSource: Global Listening Project\n\nAlthough these other sources generally lack scientific credentials, they exhibit other characteristics that people associate with legitimacy. In particular, respondents to the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer survey conducted between October and November last year indicated that relevant personal experience (70%) is more strongly associated with source legitimacy than are formal training and academic credentials (65%; see go.nature.com/4jpparb). Although this might not affect the world of theoretical physics, it does matter in domains such as health and climate.\n\nLegitimacy based on personal experience is something that people extend to themselves. The 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report: Trust and Health survey9, which involved 16 countries and was conducted in March last year, found that 65% of people are confident in their own judgement, information acumen and personal efficacy when it comes to health matters (see ‘Trust in health’). Of these ‘high health self-confidence’ individuals, 43% have relatively low trust in the health-care system9. High health self-confidence coupled with trust in health-care systems generally drives better health outcomes, but when there is a high level of self-confidence accompanied by low levels of trust, things can be problematic.\n\nSource: Ref. 9\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to complying with public-health mandates, acceptance of medical-care innovations and being a positive influence on the health decisions of others. In the case of vaccines, those who reported themselves as being self-confident with high trust in the health-care system were more likely to be fully vaccinated (including all boosters) against COVID-19 (54%) than were those who felt equally self-confident but had lower trust (40%)9.\n\nThe threat posed by high levels of trust in non-credentialed sources is exacerbated by where and how people get their scientific information. Most often, it is through online searches, which return a mix of credentialed and non-credentialed information. Because of how people judge credibility, it cannot be assumed that they will discount non-credentialed information in favour of evidence-based, peer-reviewed findings. In fact, those with high self-confidence and little trust in official sources are often drawn to non-credentialed voices and sources8.\n\nBecause the information ecosystem contains misinformation disseminated by sources who lack scientific training but are trusted at similar levels to those who have had training, scientists need to communicate better — with more relevance, emotional resonance and empathy — if they are going to compete with other sources that are increasingly influential.\n\nThree strategies to build trust\n\nWe recommend three strategies for scientists to enhance the influence of evidence-based, peer-reviewed information.\n\nFirst, work with locally trusted sources to disseminate information. Beyond their credibility, respected individuals such as physicians and religious leaders are often in the best position to make information relevant to people’s lives and their values. Public-health authorities that issue scientific information, as well as academic and research institutions, should identify and work with such partners, and provide them with training to become trusted sources of information armed with accurate and compelling arguments to address misconceptions.\n\nFinland is consistently recognized for having one of the best science-literacy programmes.Credit: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty\n\nFor example, people trust family physicians more than they do scientists in some settings, and religious leaders are more influential than scientists in many countries. Employers are another potential partner: 68% of respondents said they trust their employer to do what is right when it comes to addressing their health-related needs and concerns9. This trust was higher than for government, media, business and non-governmental organizations.",

          "abstract": "Researchers think that the fire-footed rope squirrel could be a reservoir host for the monkeypox virus.Credit: ANT Photo Library/Science Source\n\nOne of the great mysteries of the monkeypox virus has been pinpointing its ‘reservoir’ hosts — the animals that carry and spread the virus without becoming sick from it.\n\nNow, an international team of scientists suggests that it has an answer: the fire-footed rope squirrel (Funisciurus pyrropus), a forest-dwelling rodent found in West and Central Africa1.\n\nMonkeypox in Africa: the science the world ignored\n\nAlthough the name ‘monkeypox’ comes from the virus’s discovery in laboratory monkeys in 1958, researchers have long suspected rodents and other small mammals in Africa of being reservoir hosts. And studies published in the past year2,3 have demonstrated that African outbreaks of mpox, the disease caused by the virus, have been fuelled by several transmission events from animals to humans.\n\nPinpointing viral reservoirs is crucial to breaking the vicious cycle of transmission, says Placide Mbala, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. By identifying the sources, scientists could work with local communities to design strategies to shield people from infection — for instance, safe handling of wild-animal meat.\n\nThe identification of the squirrel is “exceptional” detective work and provides compelling evidence, says Alexandre Hassanin, who studies the evolution of monkeypox at Sorbonne University in Paris. He and others who spoke to Nature, however, aren’t sure that the study definitively establishes F. pyrropus as a monkeypox reservoir, but they applaud the long-term wildlife-surveillance work.\n\nThe report was posted as a preprint, ahead of peer review, to the Research Square server on 8 April. (Research Square is owned by Springer Nature, Nature’s publisher.)\n\nDisease ecologist Carme Riutord-Fe observes a sooty mangabey in the Taï National Park in Côte d’Ivoire.Credit: TCP/Constant Kaye\nLong-term surveillance\n\nAlthough mpox has affected Africa for decades, it captured headlines worldwide in 2022 when the virus sparked a global outbreak, fuelled by human-to-human transmission. Last August, the World Health Organization declared another global emergency after a worrisome strain of the virus spread to previously unaffected African countries.\n\nGrowing mpox outbreak prompts WHO to declare global health emergency\n\nAs these outbreaks have become more common, one question on researchers’ minds has been their animal sources. A clue emerged in 2023 in Taï National Park in Côte d’Ivoire, where a team of researchers has been monitoring a group of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) for many years. In late January that year, Carme Riutord-Fe, a disease ecologist at the Swiss Centre of Scientific Research in Abidjan, noticed an infant mangabey with red skin lesions on its forehead, chest and legs. The fluid-filled lesions, characteristic of mpox, quickly spread across its body, and it died two days later.\n\nWithin two months, the disease had spread to nearly one-third of the group of 80 mangabeys; 4 of them died. The team identified the monkeypox virus as causing the outbreak and successfully sequenced the full viral genome from two of the infected animals. They were identical, suggesting that the outbreak originated from a single source, says Livia Patrono, a disease ecologist at the Helmholtz Institute for One Health in Greifswald, Germany, and a study author.\n\nBut what was the source?\n\nFor most outbreak investigations, scientists begin collecting animal samples weeks or months after the first reported cases. Animals don’t always carry detectable levels of the virus, and those responsible for the outbreak might have left the “crime scene” by the time researchers arrive, says Fabian Leendertz, leader of the work and founding director of the Helmholtz Institute. This makes it difficult to pinpoint disease origins, he says.\n\nLeendertz and his team surveil a group of sooty mangabeys to study pathogens, such as the monkeypox virus, that are relevant to humans.Credit: TCP/Ane Lopez-Morales\n\nIn the case of the mangabey outbreak, however, “we were there when it happened”, Leendertz says. His team has been monitoring several populations of free-living, non-human primates in the Taï forest on a daily basis since 2001 to better understand pathogens relevant to humans4.\n\nWhen mpox struck in 2023, archived samples of the mangabeys’ urine and faeces, as well as tissues and swabs from dead animals found in the forest, proved invaluable. Monkeypox virus showed up in faecal samples collected as early as 6 December 2022 from a mangabey called Bako — the mother of the infant that first drew researchers’ attention.\n\nThree pieces of evidence then led the researchers to conclude that Bako, who survived the infection without developing symptoms, had caught the virus after eating a fire-footed rope squirrel. The first was that they observed mangabeys hunt and eat F. pyrropus. The second was that they found an F. pyrropus carcass teeming with a virus identical to the one infecting the mangabeys one month before Bako’s faecal samples turned positive. And finally, they identified F. pyrropus DNA in the earliest positive faecal sample from Bako.",

After scientists succeeded in sequencing the human genome in 20012, they quickly began working on the genomes of other apes — the closest genetic relatives to humans.\n\nUnderstanding the genomes of non-human apes is crucial because it gives geneticists insights into human evolution and the genetic factors that differentiate us from other apes, says Makova. In medicine, for instance, scientists frequently study the variations in ape DNA that make the animals resistant to certain diseases, such as AIDS.\n\nIn the past, scientists had deciphered segments of non-human apes’ genomes, but they had never managed to assemble a complete sequence for any species. In the current study, however, Makova and her collaborators used advanced sequencing techniques and algorithms that allowed them to read long segments of DNA and assemble them into a sequence that stretched from one end of each chromosome to the other, without any gaps. “This has never been done before,” says Makova.\n\nThe chimpanzee is one of humanity’s closest living relatives, and its genome promises to shed light on human evolution.Credit: Fiona Rogers/Nature Picture Library\n\nUsing these techniques, the authors decoded the genomes of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang gibbon. The scientists discovered between 770 and 1,482 possible new genes for each species. They also found unusual DNA structures lurking in previously inaccessible regions of the genome.",

          "abstract": "Top AI models’ performance is improving quickly, and the competition between them is growing ever fiercer.Credit: Adapted from Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) race is heating up: the number and quality of high-performing Chinese AI models is rising to challenge the US lead, and the performance edge between top models is shrinking, according to an annual state of the industry report.\n\nThe report highlights that as AI continues to improve quickly, no one firm is pulling ahead. On the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, which asks users to vote on the performance of various bots, the top-ranked model scored about 12% higher than the tenth-ranked model in early 2024, but only 5% higher in early 2025 (see ‘All together now’). “The frontier is increasingly competitive — and increasingly crowded,” the report says.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 was released today by the Institute for Human Centered AI at Stanford University in California.\n\nSource: AI Index Report 2025\n\nThe index shows that notable generative AI models are, on average, still getting bigger, by using more decision-making variables, more computing power and bigger training data sets. But developers are also proving that smaller, sleeker models are capable of great things. Thanks to better algorithms, a modern model can now match the performance that could be achieved by a model 100 times larger two years ago. “2024 was a breakthrough year for smaller AI models,” the index says.\n\nBart Selman, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who was not involved in writing the Index report, says it’s good to see relatively small, cheap efforts such as China’s DeepSeek proving they can be competitive. “I’m predicting we’ll see some individual teams with five people, two people, that come up with some new algorithmic ideas that will shake things up,” he says. “Which is all good. We don’t want the world just to be run by some big companies.”\n\nNeck and neck\n\nThe report shows that the vast majority of notable AI models are now developed by industry rather than academia: a reversal of the situation in the early 2000s, when neural nets and generative AI had not yet taken off. Industry produced fewer than 20% of notable AI models before 2006, but 60% of them in 2023 and nearly 90% in 2024, the report says.\n\nThe United States continues to be the top producer of notable models, releasing 40 in 2024, compared with China’s 15 and Europe’s 3. But plenty of other regions are joining the race, including the Middle East, Latin America and southeast Asia.\n\nMeta AI creates speech-to-speech translator that works in dozens of languages\n\nAnd the previous US lead in terms of model quality has disappeared, the report adds. China, which produces the most AI publications and patents, is now developing models that match their US competition in performance. In 2023, the leading Chinese models lagged behind the top US model by nearly 20 percentage points on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding test (MMLU), a common benchmark for large language models. However, as of the end of 2024, the US lead had shrunk to 0.3 percentage points.\n\n“Around 2015, China put itself on the path to be a top player in AI, and they did it through investments in education,” says Selman. “We’re seeing that’s starting to pay off.”\n\nThe field has also seen a surprising surge in the number and performance of ‘open weight’ models such as DeepSeek and Facebook’s LLaMa. Users can freely view the parameters that these models learn during training and use to make predictions, although other details, such as the training code, might remain secret. Originally, closed systems, in which none of these factors are disclosed, were markedly superior, but the performance gap between top contenders in these categories narrowed to 8% in early 2024, and to just 1.7% in early 2025.\n\n“It’s certainly good for anyone who can’t afford to build a model from scratch, which is a lot of little companies and academics,” says Ray Perrault, a computer scientist at SRI, a non-profit research institute in Menlo Park, California, and co-director of the report. OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which developed the chatbot ChatGPT, plans to release an open-weight model in the next few months.\n\nBetter, smaller, cheaper",

          "abstract": "Vaccines have made several deadly diseases a thing of the past.Credit: Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\nA second unvaccinated child in Texas has died from measles, amplifying fears that the outbreak there could be wider than reported.\n\nThe death, announced on 6 April, also harkens back to a pre-vaccine past that many Americans have forgotten, when hundreds of children died each year of measles.\n\nGenerations ago, a child swimming in a community pool could become paralysed by polio. Pregnant individuals who contracted rubella (also called German measles) were at risk of their babies being born deaf, intellectually disabled or stillborn.\n\nVaccines have granted families in wealthy countries the luxury of forgetting this history, says Anne Schuchat, a former deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. “Many doctors have never seen these diseases because our vaccines have been so successful,” she says.\n\nBut public-health specialists fear that vaccination is under threat. Around the world, funds for vaccination drives are in jeopardy as the United States scales back foreign aid, and other countries and public-health organizations juggle competing demands.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, a prominent anti-vaccine campaigner, has risen to head the US Department of Health and Human Services, which has the power to shape the country’s approach to public health. Misinformation about vaccine safety and efficacy is rampant in the United States and beyond. “It can be very confusing for parents right now with the flood of information they get,” says Schuchat.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of vaccines, Nature examines the millions of lives that they have saved.\n\nThe most contagious of them all\n\nAn alarming outbreak of measles is raging in the United States. It has infected more than 500 people and hospitalized dozens. In addition to the two Texas children, measles is thought to have killed an adult in New Mexico — the first measles deaths in the country in the past decade.\n\nSource: US CDC\n\nBefore the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, the country saw hundreds of thousands of measles infections each year. Within a decade of the vaccine’s roll-out, infections in the United States plummeted from about 450,000 a year to fewer than 50,000 (see ‘Measles cases in the United States’). Measles kills up to 3 out of every 1,000 infected people.\n\nIn 2000, the World Health Organization declared that measles had been eliminated from the United States. But measles is so contagious that at least 95% of a population must be immunized to prevent transmission. US vaccination has dropped to 93% among children starting school, with pockets of the country falling even lower.\n\nIf the measles virus circulates in the country for more than a year, the virus will no longer be considered eliminated. “We can’t take for granted the progress that we’ve made,” says Schuchat.\n\nAbout 55 countries were reporting large measles outbreaks at the end last year, and an outbreak in Vietnam is thought to have infected tens of thousands of people.\n\nA bumpy road to eradication\n\nThe world is teetering on the edge of eradicating polio, thanks to a global vaccination campaign that has eliminated the virus in every country except Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe only virus to ever have been eradicated globally is smallpox in 1980. Eradicating polio would be an enormous victory against a virus that once killed or paralysed more than half a million people every year in the middle of the twentieth century, before vaccines were introduced (see ‘Severe polio’).\n\nSource: Badizadegan/The Journal of Infectious Diseases\n\nPolio is not nearly as contagious as the measles, but it is still important to maintain high vaccination rates, says Neil Maniar, a public-health researcher at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. “If we start to see a consistent decline around the world in polio vaccination rates, all it takes is a couple of outbreaks for infections to start to expand more rapidly,” he says.\n\nLives saved by childhood vaccinations\n\nIn total, childhood vaccinations have saved about 154 million lives over the past 50 years. Most of these are thanks to the measles vaccine, which has saved more lives than vaccines against tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis) and tuberculosis combined (see ‘Childhood vaccines save lives’).\n\nSource: Shattock/The Lancet\n\nThat figure doesn’t include lives saved by the eradication of smallpox. Obidimma Ezezika, who studies vaccine implementation at the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada, estimates that the world would lose at least five million people each year to smallpox, had vaccines not been used to stamp out the virus entirely.\n\nEven without the development of new vaccines, just getting existing ones to more people would save another one to two million lives each year, Ezezika estimates.\n\n“As I think about the great public-health success stories of the past century, vaccinations are at the top of that list,” says Maniar.\n\nInfant deaths spared by vaccines",

          "title": "Cells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?",
          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "There’s unexpected movement in the world of cell biology — specifically, with the energy factories known as mitochondria.\n\nEver since they were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, mitochondria have been known as organelles that reside inside cells. But that textbook picture now seems to be wrong. An explosion of research is challenging mitochondria’s long-standing image as exclusively cellular organelles. “They may be a multicellular organelle,” says Jonathan Brestoff, an immunologist who studies metabolism at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. In other words, the supposedly static energy factories now seem to be expert travellers, skipping from one cell to another on demand.\n\nCancer cells ‘poison’ the immune system with tainted mitochondria\n\nThis ‘mitochondrial transfer’ has been observed in a wide variety of cells and in organisms as diverse as yeast, molluscs and rodents. “It’s really exciting to see,” says Jeffrey Spees, a stem-cell biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington.\n\nIt’s not yet clear why mitochondria are so mobile. Some studies have hinted that cells donate their mitochondria to their neighbours during times of need. In cellular emergencies, newly arrived mitochondria might kick-start tissue repair, fire up the immune system or rescue distressed cells from death. Other research suggests that mitochondrial transfer can be a lethal weapon that cancer cells deploy to gain an advantage.\n\nBut what this means for human health is still a mystery. Researchers haven’t yet captured the process inside the human body and so don’t know for sure if it happens in people, says Daniel Davis, an immunologist at Imperial College London. “We don’t have the technology yet to witness this happening,” he says.\n\nThat fact hasn’t stopped researchers from exploring how to leverage mitochondrial transfer to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer and stroke.\n\nA borrowed bacterium\n\nOver the past three decades, research has revealed that mitochondria are much more than cellular powerhouses that turn nutrients from food into energy. They’re key players in multiple processes in the body: they guide the chatter that keeps cells functioning and contribute to the immune response against harmful invaders. They’re also unexpectedly diverse. Last year, researchers found that mitochondria divide themselves into two distinct forms to help cells survive nutrient starvation1. Another study, published in March, modelled the density and type of mitochondria throughout the human brain2.\n\nAll mitochondria — in whatever organism, in whatever part of the body — are thought to have sprung from the same ancient bacterium. Around 1.5 billion years ago, this drifting bacterium was swallowed up by the microbe that eventually gave rise to eukaryotes — the large group of organisms, including us, whose cells have an enclosed nucleus.\n\nScientists make precise gene edits to mitochondrial DNA for first time\n\nAfter several evolutionary twists and turns, this borrowed bacterium became the organelle that drives metabolism. Mitochondria’s microbial origins probably help to explain why they are more dynamic than they first appear, says Kazuhide Hayakawa, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who studies how mitochondrial transfer could help to treat stroke. “It is possible that mitochondria retain the ancient ability to spread from cell to cell, like bacteria,” he says.\n\nIn 2006, Spees and his colleagues captured the first glimpse of mitochondria skipping from one cell to another3. The team had been trying to understand a perplexing behaviour of stem cells in laboratory dishes. These cells seemed to be sharing some kind of physical information that told them how to differentiate, and mitochondria were thought to be involved.\n\nTo investigate mitochondria’s role, the researchers cultured human lung cancer cells, which lacked the organelles, with stem cells sourced from bone marrow. With the stem cells’ mitochondria tagged with fluorescent proteins, the team shot a time-lapse video of what happened next.\n\nThe grainy black and white footage showed the stem cells shooting out their mitochondria, which were then taken up by the defective lung cells. After the donation, the lung cells quickly recovered their ability to divide and transform glucose into energy. “Watching it was like a miracle,” says Spees.\n\nSince then, researchers have observed mitochondria zipping between several types of cell — lung, heart, brain, fat, bone and more. Sometimes the mitochondria are travelling down ephemeral highways known as tunnelling nanotubes that form between cells and transport other cellular cargo. In other cases, the mitochondria take their journey in bubble-shaped vesicles or float freely in blood4 (see ‘Three ways to go’).\n\nHow mitochondria are getting around is largely settled, but what’s less clear is why. Researchers are learning that the process is often a form of cellular damage control, says Clair Crewe, a cell biologist at Washington University.\n\nSome studies suggest, for example, that mitochondrial transfer might help cells to weather neurological storms. In 2016, Hayakawa and his colleagues found that in mice that have had a stroke, support cells called astrocytes deliver their mitochondria to faltering neurons. With this mitochondrial boost, neurons grew branches and restarted their metabolic processes, which improved their chances of survival. When the researchers inhibited mitochondrial transfer, fewer neurons survived, suggesting the donated organelles were key to the cells’ recovery5. But which part of the mitochondria’s structure or function protected the cells remains unknown, says Hayakawa.\n\nLung cells might also benefit from a mitochondrial boost during a crisis, says Jahar Bhattacharya at Columbia University in New York City, who specializes in a severe inflammatory condition known as acute lung injury. He and his colleagues have found that in mice with this inflammation, stromal cells — which make up connective tissues that support organs — transfer their mitochondria to lung cells6. Cells with loaned organelles had higher concentrations of the cellular fuel ATP, which ended up being distributed to nearby cells that did not receive new mitochondria.\n\nThese diseased lungs showed more signs of recovery than did diseased lungs that didn’t receive outside mitochondria. Bhattacharya was amazed when he and his team witnessed mitochondrial transfer in action. “I don’t think we slept for the next few nights, it was so exciting,” he says.\n\nOther research hints that transferred mitochondria might supercharge wound healing. In 2021, Anne-Marie Rodriguez, a cell biologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, and her colleagues found that platelets isolated from human blood shuttled their mitochondria to stem cells when researchers put the two cell types into a dish together. After taking up the mitochondria, the stem cells released molecules that play a part in forming new blood vessels. When the cells were placed onto skin wounds in mice, those injuries healed faster than did injuries in rodents that had received either stem cells or platelets alone7.\n\nResearchers suspect that cells with dysfunctional mitochondria might even have ways to request healthy mitochondria from their neighbours, although the exact mechanisms underlying this process remain murky. “We’re only beginning to understand the signalling that’s involved,” says Crewe.\n\nEveryday operations\n\nBeyond its role in recovery, researchers want to know whether mitochondrial transfer is an essential part of everyday biology. Initial evidence suggests it might help to maintain healthy tissues. Last year, Minghao Zheng, a regenerative biologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and his colleagues discovered that some types of astrocyte donate their mitochondria to cells that line blood vessels in the mouse brain8. When the researchers disrupted this process, the blood–brain barrier became leaky, suggesting that mitochondrial transfer helps to maintain this protective membrane shield. Zheng and his team had already reported that mitochondrial transfer in the bones of mice can accelerate the formation of new blood vessels9.\n\nIn healthy mice, Brestoff and his colleagues reported, white fat cells transfer their mitochondria to macrophages — white blood cells that hoover up cellular debris. The number of shuttled organelles was reduced in obese mice. The obese mice also burnt less energy than their healthy counterparts10. These organelles might help macrophages to function when their metabolism is disrupted, says Brestoff.\n\nIn the labyrinthine world of the immune system, donated mitochondria might have an anti-inflammatory effect, especially when they are taken up by T cells — white blood cells that stave off infections and disease. In studies in cell cultures, Patricia Alejandra Luz-Crawford, an immunologist at the University of the Andes in Santiago, Chile, and her colleagues found that some types of T cell that receive mitochondria from stem cells produce fewer inflammatory molecules. Stem cells cultured from people with rheumatoid arthritis pass fewer mitochondria along to T cells than do stem cells from healthy individuals, which she says might contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with the disease11.\n\nMitochondria, visible in red, travel through a tunnelling nanotube from a type of bone marrow cell (top left) to a T cell that fights infections and cancer (bottom right).Credit: Jeremy Baldwin\n\nBut there are many unanswered questions about mitochondrial transfer, including what the organelles might be doing after they enter cells and how long they last, says Luz-Crawford. “There’s still a lot of mystery.”\n\nThe lack of detail about why cells transfer their mitochondria makes it hard to know what specific role these cellular exchanges might have in conditions such as cardiovascular disease and obesity, says Rodriguez. In vivo studies have tracked mitochondria in only a handful of tissue types, making it difficult to build a bigger picture of the wider impacts these transfers have on health.",

          "abstract": "Young researchers in the United States can benefit from the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program, which awards students a stipend and pays for their tuition.Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech\n\nEach April, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) offers a cohort of around 2,000 promising young researchers a prestigious fellowship to support their careers in science. Yesterday, the agency, which is a major funder of basic science, announced that it is awarding only 1,000 fellowships — slashing the cohort by half.\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts\n\nThe NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) selectively offers five-year awards to students pursuing master’s and PhD degrees in the sciences. Only about 16% of the more than 13,000 applicants are usually successful. Fellows receive an annual stipend of US$37,000 plus coverage of their tuition. The GRFP is one of the longest running programmes to fill the global pipeline of science talent: since 1952, it has funded more than 75,000 young researchers. The programme’s goal, according to its website before US President Donald Trump took office, was to “ensure the quality, vitality, and diversity of the scientific and engineering workforce”. A new version of the website replaces “diversity” — a priority the Trump administration has sought to eradicate — with “strength”.\n\nThis cut to the GRFP is “a heartbreaker”, says Rob Denton, a biologist at Marian University in Indianapolis, Indiana, who has previously reviewed GRFP applications. Many of the applicants are vulnerable because they’re just starting their careers, he says, and receiving this award “could be the difference between them staying in science or finding another career”.\n\n75% of US scientists who answered Nature poll consider leaving\n\nThe cuts to the GRFP add to the headwinds that the Trump administration has been stirring up for young scientists. Under Trump, US funding agencies have been cutting active research grants — many of them training grants for students and postdocs — as it seeks to reduce US government spending. In response to funding uncertainty, some universities have curtailed PhD admissions, and the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest biomedical research funder, has also cancelled a summer programme for undergraduate students.\n\nThe NSF’s ability to administer awards could soon be diminished — a possible reason for slashing the fellowships: The Washington Post reported in March that an internal White House document indicated the agency would soon face a reduction in its staff headcount of 28%. Cutting the GRFP to save money is “boneheaded”, says Kenny Evans, a science-policy specialist at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “GRFPs are one of the most cost-effective ways for NSF to give out money,” he says, because the outcome is a trained, promising young scientist and it’s relatively inexpensive.\n\nAn NSF spokesperson declined to comment on the cuts to GRFP, but said that the agency is committed to preserving funding at levels promised to new and existing GRFP awardees. “A subsequent announcement of additional awardees is possible subject to future resourcing considerations,” the spokesperson also noted.\n\nApplication ambiguity\n\nThis year’s cuts to the programme mark a sharp decline from a record high 2,555 fellowship offers in 2023. For 15 years, the number of scientists selected for fellowships has remained relatively stable; the last time the NSF gave fewer than 1,000 offers was in 2008 (see ‘Early-career cuts’).\n\nIn addition to the 1,000 fellowships, the NSF also named a record 3,018 applicants as honourable mentions — an award that does not provide funding but that young researchers can put on their résumés to boost their standing. The high number of honourable mentions are a sign that there were far more worthy candidates than could be awarded fellowships, Evans says.\n\nSource: NSF",

After a bruising battle, they managed to revive some of the research grants cancelled by the administration of President Donald Trump ― a rare victory for science as Trump’s team slashes funding and fires federal scientific staff.\n\nThe crisis began in late March, when the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) terminated the funding for dozens of long-COVID projects. Activists and researchers – including many with long COVID — began a dogged advocacy campaign, including an eleventh-hour effort to sway a sympathetic member of Congress to intervene, according to an employee of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the NIH. (The employee requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.) Within days, the cuts had been reversed.\n\nBut the administration’s termination of an array of infectious-diseases research suggests a rocky path ahead for long-COVID research. Now activists and scientists are both anxious and hopeful as they brace themselves for the potential of future cuts to federal support.\n\n“The long COVID patient community is reeling and flabbergasted by what they’re seeing,” says Emily Taylor, president of the Solve ME/CFS Initiative and based in Glendale, California. “We’ve been telling congresspeople, ‘Stop cutting, first thing. Stop hurting us. Stop the pain.’”\n\nThe HHS, which includes the NIH and other health agencies, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLong COVID’s reach\n\nOver the past two months, US President Donald Trump’s new administration has cancelled or delayed thousands of biomedical research grants, including those for research on COVID-19.\n\nWhen asked about the COVID-19 cuts, a spokesperson for HHS told Nature on 26 March, “HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”\n\nThat response appalled some long COVID advocates and researchers. “It’s totally shocking and really incorrect,” says Serena Spudich, an infectious disease neuroscientist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “The aftermath of the COVID pandemic is absolutely affecting millions of people, the economy, people’s ability to work and attend school.” A 2024 study estimated that 11 million people in the United States currently have long COVID, and that the condition costs the country more than $152.6 billion in lost work hours each year.\n\nClosed doors\n\nHHS is run by longtime anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who said during his confirmation hearing on 29 January that he’d commit to funding long COVID research. That gave Ian Simon, who was at the time the director of HHS’s Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, a “glimmer of hope”, he says, because it seemed “a full-throated endorsement of serious government action.” But the grant cancellations “make me question what a full-throated endorsement in front of Congress means these days”.\n\nLong COVID still has no cure — so these patients are turning to research\n\nUnder Kennedy, the HHS shuttered its long COVID office and laid off Simon and another employee in the office. An executive order signed by Trump dismantled the only federal advisory committee on long COVID, and the US Department of Labor stripped mention of long COVID from its websites.\n\nThe NIH cut not only research on long COVID but also other work that could affect people with the condition. For example, the NIH has terminated several disability studies, says David Putrino, a physical therapist and neuroscientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Many people with severe long COVID live with disabilities.\n\nDespite this, some advocates had hoped that a US$1.8 billion NIH long COVID research initiative, called RECOVER, might be safe because Congress had funded the programme directly in 2020.\n\nThen, in late March, the NIH cancelled a wave of RECOVER grants. “We were completely shocked,” says Megan Fitzgerald, a neuroscientist in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who has long COVID and works with the advocacy group Patient-Led Research Collaborative. “And that’s when we started mobilizing.”\n\nWasted investment\n\nFitzgerald’s detective work revealed dozens of cancelled projects, most of them studies of either the biology underlying long COVID, or of long COVID in children. The loss of the paediatric studies would have been particularly painful, says Fitzgerald, because the study of long COVID in children has lagged research in adults.\n\nThe biology studies included a project on dysautonomia, a condition sometimes seen in people with long COVID that affects the body’s ability to control heart rate and blood pressure. Another terminated project aimed to characterize antibodies made against the body’s own proteins. Such “autoantibodies” are thought to contribute to some cases of long COVID and could become targets for medicines to treat the condition.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal",

          "authors": "Mohamed Ibrahim",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform many industries, yet its use to improve public services remains limited globally. AI-based tools could streamline access to government benefits through online chatbots or automate systems by which citizens report problems such as potholes.\n\nCurrently, scholarly advances in AI are mostly confined to academic papers and conferences, rarely translating into actionable government policies or products. This means that the expertise at universities is not used to solve real-world problems. As a No10 Innovation Fellow with the UK government and a lecturer in spatial data science, I have explored the potential of AI-driven rapid prototyping in public policy.\n\nTake Street.AI, a prototype smartphone app that I developed, which lets citizens report issues including potholes, street violence or illegal litter dumping by simply taking a picture through the app. The AI model classifies the problem automatically and alerts the relevant local authority, passing on the location and details of the issue. A key feature of the app is its on-device processing, which ensures privacy and reduces operational costs. Similar tools were tested as an early-warning system during the riots that swept the United Kingdom in July and August 2024.\n\nAI models can also aid complex decision-making — for instance, that involved in determining where to build houses. The UK government plans to construct 1.5 million homes in the next 5 years, but planning laws require that several parameters be considered — such as proximity to schools, noise levels, the neighbourhoods’ built-up ratio and flood risk. The current strategy is to compile voluminous academic reports on viable locations, but an online dashboard powered by AI that can optimize across parameters would be much more useful to policymakers.\n\nHow to track the economic impact of public investments in AI\n\nThis is the key insight from my stint in government: public officials are often interested in deliverable products or demonstrable solutions, whereas academics are trained to funnel new knowledge into papers. Existing mechanisms to bring academic expertise into government, such as secondment opportunities and exchange programmes, do not adequately address the factors that limit collaboration. A more effective approach would be to frame research in practical, solution-oriented terms.\n\nThere are several measures that could strengthen collaboration between academia and public institutions, particularly in emerging domains such as AI, to enhance the delivery of public services.\n\nAcademics can ease into a product-focused mindset through prototyping, where the risk is low. The aim is to go beyond conventional research-dissemination practices to ensure that findings are accessible and can be applied in government settings. This involves translating complex data, models and insights into user-friendly digital tools. For instance, imagine that a university research team has developed an AI model capable of predicting which areas are at high risk of flooding. As well as publishing the findings in academic journals, the team could create a digital tool — an interactive platform — to display the AI insights for government officials in a way that makes them actionable.",

          "title": "AI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool",
          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "When Mohammed Shafi, a PhD student in civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, first saw his friends testing out artificial intelligence (AI) tools back in late 2022, he didn’t immediately see the appeal. Mostly, people seemed to be using generative AI platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a replacement for Google, or as a novelty for drumming up ideas for practical jokes and pet names. “They were fun to play around with, but I didn’t necessarily sense any relevance to my own coursework or my research,” he says.\n\nHe quickly came around, however, when he started seeing more AI tools being built to meet the needs of students and scientists. Now a daily user of AI, Shafi has pieced together an entire pipeline of AI-powered platforms that feed into one another. These update him on new research, break down complex topics, troubleshoot experiments, organize his writing and citations, and help him to navigate the demands of classes and research.\n\nShafi now says that the arrival of AI has been “a revolution for research”, a sentiment seemingly shared by others. Surveys show that many university students and scientists are using AI in their work, often on a weekly or even daily basis. And whereas many educators and academic institutions initially responded with wariness, academia seems increasingly willing to allow students to use AI, albeit in controlled ways. Although it wouldn’t be impossible to go back to the way he did things before, Shafi says, “it’s hard to imagine wanting to”.\n\nHere, Nature explores how academics and students can harness AI to streamline various parts of the research process.\n\nSharpen your literature review\n\nDaniel Weld, chief scientist at the academic search engine Semantic Scholar, who is based in Seattle, Washington, says that many popular AI platforms have “advanced enormously” in an area called active learning — a method that mimics how a person would approach a research question. Programs such as Google’s Gemini Deep Research and OpenAI’s Deep Research offer the most powerful tools in this regard, and many companies are launching similar products.\n\nStudents can enter a query, supported by their own data or documents, and then step away as these advanced models conduct in-depth searches over 30 minutes or so. The final report might include text, figures and visualizations, and all output is thoroughly referenced — another jump over past iterations, says Isa Fulford, a technical staff researcher at OpenAI in San Francisco, California, who helped to develop Deep Research. “Especially in the context of scientific research, we recognize that veracity is critical, and we think this model is better at including the proper citations than any other model we’ve released,” she says.\n\nChuck Downing, a PhD student in accounting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, says that these deep-research tools have been especially useful when digging into unfamiliar topics. During one project, Downing used OpenAI’s Deep Research to create a report ranking various approaches for reducing emissions at manufacturing plants. “I didn’t know much going in, but I learnt quite a bit, and so I use these deep dives all the time now,” he says. “It’s better than anything else I’ve used so far at finding good papers and in presenting the information in a way that I can easily understand.”\n\nOther programs enable students to delve more deeply into a single document or small collection of papers. The student-focused AI platform SciSpace , for example, has a ‘Chat with PDF’ function. Users can upload a paper and ask questions about its content — a feature shared by other platforms, such as Claude, NotebookLM and PDF.ai.\n\nFor David Tompkins, a PhD student in human development at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, this approach has helped him to stay on top of the burgeoning scientific literature. Tompkins often goes to journal-club meetings having used Claude to generate a summary of a chosen paper, which he then follows up with more-targeted questions based on the group’s discussion. “I’m still a big believer in actually reading papers to fully understand them, but it’s become much easier to do my prep when I’m feeling stretched,” he says. “In some ways, I feel I’m engaging more with the material through these tools than I did before them.”\n\nCreate your hypothesis\n\nThe ability of AI to pull together many threads of information has seemingly made it easier to identify research gaps and connect ideas — although a recent survey suggests that an over-reliance on generative AI could dampen a person’s critical-thinking skills. Weld, who is also an AI researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, says there has been so much demand for tools that assist with ideation that he and his team are developing hypothesis-generation and detection products that attempt to combine ideas across papers into something new. “We have them running internally, but we’re trying to make sure that they’re working robustly,” he says, adding that his Allen Institute group hopes to release them publicly in the next few months.\n\nShafi turned to programs such as the visualization tool Research Rabbit when working on his dissertation, which focuses on how microplastics are transported through soil and into groundwater. Research Rabbit takes a single ‘seed paper’ and generates an interconnected web of research linked by topic, author, methodology or other key features. By piping its results into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, “it’s possible to query the body of work for hidden links or new ideas”, Shafi says.\n\nMaría Mercedes Hincapié-Otero.Credit: Jayson J. Ricamara\n\nAI-powered programs are also proving increasingly capable as experimental assistants. As a PhD student at MIT, Zhichu Ren created the software Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientist (CRESt), which combines several AI technologies into an enhanced chatbot (Z. Ren et al. Preprint at ChemRxiv https://doi.org/pdwv; 2023). Users can chat with CRESt as they would with a colleague, and it can help to craft and run experiments by retrieving and analysing data, turning equipment on and off using digital switches, powering robotic arms, documenting findings and alerting scientists by e-mail when issues arise or protocols end. In a 2023 conference paper, CRESt assisted researchers by prioritizing candidate alloys for a new fuel cell, and suggested experiments that the group might run to test them. “I wanted to create a tool that can continue to help even as your needs change,” says Ren, who now works at the AI start-up firm Labig in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “AI can do that in a way that static, written documentation cannot.”\n\nBut even for students who do not have access to something as advanced as CRESt, AI can still function as a helpful colleague. Gemini Deep Research, for example, can generate a “personalized multi-point research plan” among other features, and resources such as Scite and Elicit are billed as research assistants. Users can give these programs a handful of papers or a working hypothesis, for example, and ask for a set of experiments to test the theory.\n\nJoseph Fernandez, a PhD student in biomedical engineering at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, says he continues to use ChatGPT for most things, including troubleshooting his experiments. In the past, the bot has helped him to brainstorm explanations when one of his assays was returning unusual values, and to calculate serial dilutions to avoid wasting expensive reagents. ChatGPT has also served as a stand-in for his committee, generating pointed questions to test his research proposal before his exams.\n\n“I think you’re really only limited by your imagination, even if some uses are more mundane than others,” he says. “Nowadays, if a question or task pops into my mind, I’m generally wondering if ChatGPT can help with it.”\n\nStreamline your statistics\n\nCode editors including GitHub’s Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer (now Amazon Q Developer) and Anysphere’s Cursor aim to make it easy for beginners to use coding to organize data, create analysis pipelines, run descriptive statistics and generate visualizations. Such tools, researchers note, have also largely overtaken websites such as GitHub and Stack Exchange as the main resources for troubleshooting. Rather than spending hours looking for answers, users can simply highlight a section of code and ask a chatbot to fix it, Downing says.\n\n“Thinking about what a PhD student primarily does, the largest tasks are increasingly coding and data analysis, at least for computational fields, so anything that helps there is just disproportionately useful,” he says. Although he already considered himself an adequate coder, he says that his preferred tool, Cursor, has made him better by removing the more tedious aspects and making it easier to probe specific aspects of a data set. Instead of spending all of his time debugging (cleaning the code), he says, he is “putting more effort into really getting to know the underlying data and engaging with my code in ways that help me learn. If I get curious about something, it’s very easy to generate descriptive statistics, something like a chart.”\n\nTompkins has likewise found tools such as Claude to be essential for writing code for compelling, dynamic visualizations. Creating a good graph, particularly if it’s interactive, can require hundreds of lines of code, and Tompkins says that, in the past, that level of effort had put him off. “But once I started using Claude, I was able to have it write out those literal hundreds of lines of code,” he says. The resulting visualizations have gone a long way towards helping others to understand his research, which describes how small changes in the way in which people experience information can drive their reactions to it.\n\nResearcher Zhichu Ren created an AI-based system called CRESt to run experiments.Credit: Jason Sparapani/MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering\n\nHe adds, however, that he still always writes his own code for statistical analyses: “I want to make sure that whatever I’m reporting is something that I fully understand and can stand behind when I submit a paper.”\n\nThese AI programs focus on generating new code, but Gaurav Ragtah, who founded a platform called CatalyzeX, saw an opportunity to repurpose existing code. If researchers write a new analysis pipeline for each experiment, for example, it can make it more challenging for others to reproduce their work, particularly if the documentation is poor or a developer stops updating their code. Instead, Ragtah, who is based in San Francisco, wanted to make it easier to locate and share code that others have published. CatalyzeX uses a web platform and browser extension to flag open-source code shared in papers indexed on websites such as Google Scholar or PubMed, and researchers can search for code through the platform using keywords. Someone interested in using machine learning to aid in cancer detection, for example, could search for a modified data-processing pipeline that helps to address the fact that publicly available data often involve small sample sizes.\n\n“As amazing as some of these code generators are, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time when there are excellent examples of what you’re trying to do,” Ragtah says. “Open source keeps people from having to start from scratch and gives them a scaffold on which to build and improve, while making research more easily comparable.”",

          "title": "Norway set to scrap mandatory language training for foreign postdocs and PhD students",
          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "The government has backed off its requirement for PhD students and postdocs, but learning to speak Norwegian is a ‘key component’ of an enjoyable stay in the country, say some.Credit: Izusek/Getty\n\nNorway’s new research minister has signalled that the government will axe a controversial law that requires PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from other countries to undertake mandatory Norwegian language training. The move follows a backlash from scientists, who argued that the language stipulation — which was introduced in August last year with a year’s implementation delay — would create substantial barriers to recruiting international talent to their labs.\n\nUnder the law, PhD students and postdocs who do not speak Norwegian, Danish or Swedish must complete 15 study points of Norwegian language training — around 3 months of study — during the period covered by their contracts. But on 21 March, Sigrun Aasland of Norway’s Labour party, who was appointed minister for research and higher education in February, announced the intention to reverse it, in a white paper setting out the government’s plan to enhance Norway’s research competitiveness and bolster its national security through science.\n\nThe proposed U-turn has been sent out for fast-tracked public consultation — a necessary step for such amendments. “Norway is a small country; we must collaborate more,” said Aasland. She also highlighted the need to create more attractive conditions for international researchers, and said the government might review its work-permit rules for scientists to make it easier for them to leave, to arrive and to stay.\n\n“I am grateful that the Norwegian government listened to us so quickly,” says Olga Lehmann, a psychology researcher from Colombia, who has lived in Norway for 11 years and is based at the University of Stavanger. “Norwegian academia needs to strive for balance between local and global needs.” She is optimistic that this is a step in the right direction.\n\n‘Enormous relief’\n\n“It’s an enormous relief,” adds Nobel laureate Edvard Moser, who leads the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. But he warns that the policy could be reversed if the country’s Centre Party rejoins the government in September’s parliamentary elections.\n\nMoser joined more than two dozen Norwegian researchers who backed a complaint made to the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority in December last year. They argued that the language requirement contravened European Economic Area rules on the free movement of workers. That legal challenge will be withdrawn when the minister’s policy change is completed, says Pierre Lison, an artificial-intelligence researcher at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, and one of the instigators of the complaint. “Right now, the ministry has only indicated its intention to drop the requirement, but it’s not yet official,” he adds.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the reversal will also apply to another stipulation around Norwegian language competency, which affects permanent academic staff who don’t speak Norwegian, Danish or Swedish. Under the current rules, they must reach a B2 language proficiency level within three years — a higher standard than that required for Norwegian citizenship.\n\n“This is a key point still to be clarified, but hopefully, [it will also be] scrapped to support Norway’s goals to attract top international talent,” says Simon Roussanaly, an energy researcher at SINTEF, an independent research institute in Trondheim. Roussanaly is originally from France, and has lived in Norway since 2011.\n\nAlthough many universities had similar rules as part of their policies previously, there was some flexibility in those arrangements, which the law has removed, Roussanaly says. “This is a significant burden and work for academics and researchers.”",

          "abstract": "The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has been tracking down and detaining international scholars across the United States.Credit: Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via Getty\n\nA wave of shock and fear has spread among university researchers as US immigration officials have moved to detain and deport international students and scholars. The officials allege, in many instances, that the detainees’ involvement in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza constitutes a threat to national security.\n\n‘Anxiety is palpable’: detention of researchers at US border spurs travel worries\n\nMultiple organizations representing university faculty members filed a lawsuit on 25 March challenging the actions, which include high-profile cases that have landed several student researchers in jail and sent others into hiding. Professors and students who spoke to Nature say they have already begun brushing up on their legal rights and taking precautions.\n\n“People are living in fear, if not for their lives, then certainly for their liberty and safety,” says Michael Thaddeus, a mathematician at Columbia University in New York City. He stresses that the detentions are just one part of a broader attack by the government of US President Donald Trump on scientists and academics that includes the cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants at Columbia and other universities.\n\nOne graduate student who studies public health tells Nature that they are crafting contingency plans for reuniting with their children and spouse if they are detained while returning from a pending research trip abroad. “These are insane things to be thinking about in the United States,” says the scientist, who has had their primary research grant terminated by the Trump team and who asked for anonymity out of fear that they would be targeted by the administration.\n\nThe Trump White House and the US Department of State did not respond to Nature’s requests for comment.\n\nTaking away visas\n\nTrump set the stage for the current detentions when, on 30 January, he signed an executive order that called on US immigration officials to deport alleged student “sympathizers” of Hamas, the organization that governs the Gaza Strip. Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023 and is designated as a terrorist group by the United States. Many students and professors reject the charge that they support Hamas, arguing that they — and most protestors — instead oppose Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry.\n\nProtests over Israel–Hamas war have torn US universities apart: what’s next?\n\nMarco Rubio, head of the US Department of State, confirmed at a press event last week that his agency has revoked visas for at least 300 students, with more to come. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,” Rubio said.\n\nIn nearly a dozen cases that have attracted media attention, officials with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency have detained or sought to detain students and scholars who have been living legally in the United States either on visas or on ‘green cards’ that provide permanent-residency status. The list includes several well-known pro-Palestinian activists, such as Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying social-media use among young people at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Both are being detained in Louisiana.\n\nAlthough the US state department has broad latitude over visas and green cards, the lawsuit filed by faculty organizations in a federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, last week alleges that, in many instances, these actions violate students’ constitutional right to free speech, which scholars say applies to everybody in the United States, not just US citizens.\n\nSigns decorate a tree in Somerville, Massachusetts, where immigration agents arrested Tufts University PhD student Rümeysa Öztürk.Credit: Scott Eisen/Getty\n\n“This is ideological deportation,” says Ramya Krishnan, an attorney at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute and counsel on the lawsuit. She raises particular concern about the Trump administration’s argument that many of the arrested scholars pose a threat to US foreign policy because of the opinions they have voiced about the war in Gaza. She asks: what’s to stop the administration from saying that opinions on climate policy or other issues are threats? “There really is no limit to the government’s theory here, and that is part of what is so disturbing.”\n\nAlready, multiple cases seem to hinge on issues other than students’ involvement in the Gaza war protests. For instance, on 16 February, Kseniia Petrova, a bioinformatician from Russia at Harvard Medical School in Boston, was arrested at the US border after failing to declare that she was bringing frog embryos to her laboratory from France. She is also being detained in Louisiana.\n\nThe White House and the state department did not respond to questions from Nature about the reasons for various detentions.",

          "authors": "Arvind Narayanan, Sayash Kapoor",
          "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is exploding across many branches of science. Between 2012 and 2022, the average proportion of scientific papers engaging with AI, across 20 fields, quadrupled (see ‘AI’s rise in research’), including economics, geology, political science and psychology1.\n\nHopes are high that AI can accelerate scientific discovery, because the rate at which fundamental advances are made seems to be slowing down: despite there being more funding, publications and personnel, we are making advances at a slower pace.\n\nBut the rush to adopt AI has consequences. As its use proliferates — in forecasting disease outbreaks, predicting people’s life outcomes and anticipating civil wars — some degree of caution and introspection is warranted. Whereas statistical methods in general carry a risk of being used erroneously, AI carries even greater risks owing to its complexity and black-box nature. And errors are becoming increasingly common, especially when off-the-shelf tools are used by researchers who have limited expertise in computer science. It is easy for researchers to overestimate the predictive capabilities of an AI model, thereby creating the illusion of progress while stalling real advancements.\n\nHere, we discuss the dangers and suggest a set of remedies. Establishing clear scientific guidelines on how to use these tools and techniques is urgent.\n\nThere are many ways in which AI can be deployed in science. It can be used to effectively comb through previous work, or to search a problem space (of, say, drug candidates) for a solution that can then be verified through conventional means.\n\nAnother use of AI is to build a machine-learning model of a phenomenon of interest, and interrogate it to gain knowledge about the world. Researchers call this machine-learning-based science; it can be seen as an upgrade of conventional statistical modelling. Machine-learning modelling is the chainsaw to the hand axe of statistics — powerful and more automated, but dangerous if used incorrectly.\n\nSOURCE: Ref. 1\n\nOur concern is mainly about these modelling-based approaches, in which AI is used to make predictions or test hypotheses about how a system functions. One common source of error is ‘leakage’, an issue that arises when information from a model’s evaluation data improperly influences its training process. When this happens, a machine-learning model might simply memorize patterns in the evaluation data instead of capturing the meaningful patterns behind the phenomenon of interest. This limits the real-world applicability of such models and produces little in terms of scientific knowledge.\n\nThrough our investigations and compiling existing evidence, we have found that papers across at least 30 scientific fields — ranging from psychiatry and molecular biology to computer security — that use machine learning are plagued with leakage2 (see go.nature.com/4ieawbk). It is a type of ‘teaching to the test’, or, worse, giving the answers away before the exam.\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of studies stated that AI could diagnose the disease using just chest X-rays or CT scans. A systematic review of 415 such studies found that only 62 met basic quality standards3. Even among them, flaws were widespread, including poor evaluation methods, duplicate data and lack of clarity on whether ‘positive’ cases were from people with a confirmed medical diagnosis.\n\nIn more than a dozen studies, the researchers had used a training data set in which all COVID-positive cases were in adults, and the negatives were in children aged between one and five. As a result, the AI model had merely learnt to distinguish between adults and children, but the researchers mistakenly concluded that they had developed a COVID-19 detector.\n\nIt’s hard to systematically catch errors such as these because evaluating predictive accuracy is notoriously tricky and, as yet, lacks standardization. Computer codebases can be thousands of lines long. Errors can be hard to spot, and a single error can be costly. Thus, we think that the reproducibility crisis in machine-learning-based science is still in its early days.\n\nWith some studies now using large language models in research — for instance, by using them as surrogates for human participants in psychological experiments — there are even more ways in which research might be irreproducible. These models are sensitive to inputs; small changes in the wording of prompts can cause notable changes to outputs. And because the models are often owned and operated by private companies, access to them can be restricted at any point, making such studies difficult to replicate.\n\nFooling ourselves\n\nA greater risk from the hasty adoption of AI and machine learning lies in the fact that the torrent of findings, even if error-free, might not result in true scientific progress.\n\nTo understand that risk, consider the impact of an enormously influential paper from 2001, in which statistician Leo Breiman astutely described the cultural and methodological differences between the fields of statistics and machine learning4.\n\nWill AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct\n\nHe strongly advocated the latter, including the adoption of machine-learning models over simpler statistical models, with predictive accuracy prioritized over questions of how faithfully the model represents nature. In our view, this advocacy did not mention the known limitations of the machine-learning approach. The paper doesn’t make enough of a distinction between the use of machine-learning models in engineering and in the natural sciences. Although Breiman found that such black-box models can work well in engineering, such as by classifying submarines using sonar data, they are harder to use in natural science, in which explaining nature (say, the principles behind the propagation of sound waves in water) is the whole point.\n\nThis confusion is still widespread, and too many researchers are seduced by the commercial success of AI. But just because a modelling approach is good for engineering, it doesn’t mean that it’s good for science.\n\nThere is an old maxim that ‘every model is wrong, but some models are useful’. It takes a lot of work to translate outputs from models to claims about the world. The toolbox of machine learning makes it easier to build models, but it doesn’t necessarily make it easier to extract knowledge about the world, and might well make it harder. As a result, we run the risk of producing more but understanding less5.\n\nScience is not merely a collection of facts or findings. Actual scientific progress happens through theories, which explain a collection of findings, and paradigms, which are conceptual tools for understanding and investigating a domain. As we move from findings to theories to paradigms, things get more abstract, broader and less amenable to automation. We suspect that the rapid proliferation of scientific findings based on AI has not accelerated — and might even have inhibited — these higher levels of progress.\n\nIf researchers in a field are concerned about flaws in individual papers, we can measure their prevalence by analysing a sample of papers. But it is hard to find smoking-gun evidence that scientific communities as a whole are overemphasizing predictive accuracy at the expense of understanding, because it is not possible to access the counterfactual world. That said, historically, there have been many examples of fields getting stuck in a rut even as they excelled at producing individual findings. Among them are alchemy before chemistry, astronomy before the Copernican revolution and geology before plate tectonics.\n\nA shout-out for AI studies that don’t make the headlines\n\nThe story of astronomy is particularly relevant to AI. The model of the Universe with Earth at its centre was extremely accurate at predicting planetary motions, because of tricks such as ‘epicycles’ — the assumption that planets move in circles whose centres revolve around Earth along a larger circular path. In fact, many modern planetarium projectors use this method to compute trajectories.\n\nToday, AI excels at producing the equivalent of epicycles. All else being equal, being able to squeeze more predictive juice out of flawed theories and inadequate paradigms will help them to stick around for longer, impeding true scientific progress.\n\nThe paths forward\n\nWe have pointed out two main problems with the use of AI in science: flaws in individual studies and epistemological issues with the broad adoption of AI.\n\nThe following are tentative ideas to improve the credibility of machine-learning-based scientific studies and avoid illusions of progress. We offer these as starting points for discussion, rather than proven solutions.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "Activists rally for the rights of transgender people at the National Mall in Washington DC last month.Credit: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty\n\nAs the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) continues to defund nearly every research project on transgender health, the White House has directed the agency to focus on studying “regret” after a person transitions to align their body with their gender identity. Several NIH employees, who were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, confirmed the directive to Nature.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nTwo weeks ago, Matthew Memoli, who was acting NIH director at the time, sent an e-mail to the directors of several NIH institutes. It said that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is the NIH’s parent agency, “has been directed to fund research on a few specific areas” related to what it calls “chemical and surgical mutilation” of children and adults — a reference to gender-affirming care and surgery. “This is very important to the President and the Secretary” of the HHS, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the e-mail added.\n\nBased on its priorities, the White House sometimes directs the NIH — the world’s largest public funder of biomedical science — to study certain broad topics, such as cancer or women’s health, but the latest directive’s specificity, inflammatory language and focus on a hyper-polarizing topic are unprecedented, the NIH employees say. Although the White House can sometimes “push us on various different things, we normally get to chart out the approach”, a staff member says.\n\nMany scientists, reeling from the abrupt cancellation of more than US$180 million in NIH funding for research on transgender health, slammed the proposed studies as ideologically driven.\n\n“It’s really pigeonholing trans people into this medical lens where the only thing important to know about them is that they seek medical transition” and regret it, says Harry Barbee, who studies the health of people from gender and sexual minorities (LGBT+) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, and identifies as non-binary and queer. “When ideology is prioritized over scientific merit, that threatens the entire scientific enterprise.”\n\nThe NIH and the White House did not respond to Nature’s queries about the new research priorities or scientists’ concerns with their apparent ideological bent. The HHS said that the “NIH is prioritizing research that serves the best interests of public health, not ideological agendas, and will continue to support studies that provide clear, objective data — particularly regarding the long-term effects of gender transitions.”\n\nShifting focus\n\nEstimates suggest that 1.6 million people in the United States identify as transgender, and about one-quarter of them obtain gender-affirming surgeries. Research suggests1 that access to these procedures can reduce anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation in transgender people.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office on 20 January that directed the US government to stop acknowledging that gender can differ from sex at birth. The cancellation of many trans-health research grants quickly followed, and now the agency seems to be shifting the type of research it funds. The e-mail from Memoli, obtained by Nature, specifies two areas of research that the Trump administration wishes to fund about “social transition”, which is when a person changes how they express their gender to others — for example, by changing their name or appearance.\n\nThese include “regret and detransition following social transition as well as chemical and surgical mutilation of children and adults” and “outcomes from children who have undergone social transition and/or chemical and surgical mutilation”, the e-mail says.\n\nMore research on the experience of trans people — including understanding reasons for dissatisfaction after transition — is direly needed, Barbee says. But they worry that the sole focus on negative consequences is misplaced: fewer than 1% of transgender people who undergo gender-affirming surgery regret it, according to an analysis published by Barbee and their colleagues2. By comparison, 14.4% of the broader population reports regret after any kind of surgery3.\n\nSo far, about 187 NIH grants funding trans-health research have been terminated, according to an online effort to track the Trump team’s research cuts by Brittany Charlton, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who studies LGBT+ health, and her colleagues. In 2023, the NIH funded about 180 projects in this field, according to another NIH employee.\n\nIf these proposed studies move forwards, it will create a “a distorted research ecosystem where only politically favourable findings are permitted to exist” and an “evidence vacuum for clinicians who are trying to do right by their patients”, Barbee says.",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "The inner structures of the brain are difficult to investigate without surgery.Credit: K H Fung/Science Photo Library\n\nNeuroscientists have observed for the first time how structures deep in the brain are activated when the brain becomes aware of its own thoughts, known as conscious perception1.\n\nThe brain is constantly bombarded with sights, sounds and other stimuli, but people are only ever aware of a sliver of the world around them — the taste of a piece of chocolate or the sound of someone’s voice, for example. Researchers have long known that the outer layer of the brain, called the cerebral cortex, plays a part in this experience of being aware of specific thoughts.\n\nThe involvement of deeper brain structures has been much harder to elucidate, because they can be accessed only with invasive surgery. Designing experiments to test the concept in animals is also tricky. But studying these regions would allow researchers to broaden their theories of consciousness beyond the brain’s outer wrapping, say researchers.\n\n“The field of consciousness studies has evoked a lot of criticism and scepticism because this is a phenomenon that is so hard to study,” says Liad Mudrik, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. But scientists have increasingly been using systematic and rigorous methods to investigate consciousness, she says.\n\nAware or not\n\nIn a study published in Science today1, Mingsha Zhang, a neuroscientist at Beijing Normal University, focused on the thalamus. This region at the centre of the brain is involved in processing sensory information and working memory, and is thought to have a role in conscious perception.\n\nParticipants were already undergoing therapy for severe and persistent headaches, for which they had thin electrodes injected deep into their brains. This allowed Zhang and his colleagues to study their brain signals and measure conscious awareness.\n\nThe participants were asked to move their eyes in a particular way depending on whether they noticed an icon flash onto a screen in front of them. The icon was designed so that the participants would be aware of its appearance only about half of the time.\n\nDuring the tasks, the researchers recorded neural activity in multiple regions of the brain, including the thalamus and the cortex. This is the first time that such simultaneous recordings have been made in people doing a task that is relevant to consciousness science, says Christopher Whyte, a systems neuroscientist at the University of Sydney in Australia. The work “is really pretty remarkable”, he says, because it allowed the team to look at how the timing of neural activity in different regions varied.\n\nGatekeeper",

          "authors": "Ariana Remmel",
          "abstract": "The average human cell contains roughly 10,000 different proteins. Existing as several to millions of copies in each cell, proteins mediate all manner of tasks, including chemical transformations, communication and intracellular trafficking. To execute these crucial functions, each protein must cosy up with designated partners, says Emma Lundberg, a bioengineer at Stanford University in California. If you want to understand how cells function, you have to work out what proteins interact with — and where.\n\nTo coordinate the mass of moving parts, eukaryotic cells evolved membrane-bound organelles and other subcellular compartments that gather protein networks together in controlled environments, each with a distinct function. By working out the sites at which a protein operates, researchers can infer something about its job. “It’s like a person in a house: if you are in the kitchen or in your laundry room, I can make a pretty good guess of what you’re doing,” says Lundberg.\n\nBut, like people, proteins aren’t restricted to one place; as researchers such as Lundberg in the fast-growing field of spatial proteomics have discovered, more than half of our proteins have more than one hangout spot. Many have multiple functions and moonlight in different roles depending on their position. By the same token, cellular processes falter when proteins show up to the wrong job site. “It really shows that this notion of ‘one gene, one protein, one function’ is really not correct,” Lundberg says.\n\nWith advances in high-resolution imaging, mass spectrometry and machine-learning-assisted data analysis, spatial-proteomics researchers are mapping and tracking proteins with increasing detail at multiple scales, from subcellular compartments to tissues. The work is challenging and data-intensive, but findings have yielded insights into cellular biology and disease progression — not to mention, potential therapeutic strategies.\n\nCellular cartography\n\nProteomics is to proteins what transcriptomics is to RNA. By counting the RNA-based messages that the cell writes to direct its protein-making machinery, transcriptomics practitioners hope to deduce what the cell is doing. But the expression level of a given transcript doesn’t necessarily match the abundance of its corresponding protein. And cells often edit their transcripts and modify proteins after translation to create different variants, called proteoforms.\n\nEnter proteomics, which provides concrete data to explain how the ‘parts list’ of possible proteins in our genes is assembled to build the cell types in the body. By mapping protein abundances to their physical locations, spatial proteomics highlights how those proteins — and cells — are organized in tissues. There are two basic approaches: the imaging method fluorescence microscopy and quantitative mass spectrometry. The methods are complementary, and two large-scale atlas projects demonstrate the power of using them together.\n\nA tissue sample is prepared for highly multiplexed proteoform imaging.Credit: Lisa La Vallee\n\nIn 2017, Lundberg and her collaborators used a mix of both methods to build a subcellular atlas of more than 12,000 proteins in 22 cell types called the Cell Atlas, which is part of the Sweden-based Human Protein Atlas project1. The team stained a library of cells with fluorescently labelled antibodies for each target protein alongside markers for notable structures, such as the nucleus and mitochondria. These cellular landmarks helped the researchers to assign each protein to one or more of 30 subcellular locations, from major organelles to more esoteric options, such as cell junctions and lipid droplets.\n\nImmunofluorescence works well when researchers know what proteins they are looking for and have suitable antibodies that can tag them, says Kathryn Lilley, a biochemist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Newer methods that combine repeated cycles of staining and imaging — such as co-detection by indexing (CODEX) and iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) — can visualize tens to hundreds of labelled proteins in a single sample. But even these multiplexed methods overlook most of the proteome. Mass spectrometry can help to complete the picture, Lilley says.\n\nLilley and her colleagues developed a suite of mass-spectrometry-based techniques for subcellular mapping that are broadly called ‘localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging’ (LOPIT). To validate the Cell Atlas’s image-based assignments, the researchers applied a variant called hyperLOPIT that works by carefully breaking cells open, separating their contents across a density gradient and digesting the proteins from each sample using enzymes. Next, they label each sample with a different isotope tag, recombine them and analyse the resulting mixture using tandem mass spectrometry — a quantitative approach that allows them to identify, quantify and assign thousands of proteins back to their original subcellular compartments.\n\nThe team used these and other methods to demonstrate that more than half of the proteins in human cells could be found in more than one location, and a subset could be found in at least three. About one-third of the proteins were present in every cell type, suggesting that they have generic ‘housekeeping’ roles that keep our cells running.\n\nIn 2022, Manuel Leonetti at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, California, working with Matthias Mann at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany, and their colleagues on the OpenCell project generated a library of 1,310 lines of human embryonic kidney cells, each of which fused a genetically encoded fluorescent protein tag to a different protein target. The team then used fluorescence microscopy to manually annotate the distribution of the tagged protein in living cells of each type and to train a machine-learning algorithm to carry out the same assignments. At the same time, the genetically encoded tags provided an antigen with which Mann’s team could perform immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry experiments. These allow the researchers to grab hold of a protein and its interaction partners and then train a second machine-learning algorithm to systematically build up a ‘social network’ for these proteins. Users can explore each protein’s whereabouts and known associates on the OpenCell web portal.\n\nTake, for example, FAM241A, an ‘orphan’ protein of previously unknown function. When Leonetti and his colleagues looked at cells engineered to express FAM241A with a fluorescent tag, they found it in the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle that, among other things, affixes chemical modifications to proteins. From those snapshots, the project’s machine-learning algorithm predicted that FAM241A might interact with two enzymes from the OpenCell library that add a specific type of sugar molecule to proteins. Further investigation confirmed that FAM241A is part of the same pathway, revealing its function2.\n\nMoving molecules\n\nLiving cells are dynamic, ceaselessly building and breaking biomolecules, and shuffling them from one location to another. Detailed descriptions of where proteins typically congregate — and how they move from place to place — can help researchers to understand the significance of protein movements when cells are stressed or during disease.\n\nIn one study3, for instance, Lilley and her colleagues measured how the proteome of lung cancer cells responds to radiotherapy — a common treatment for this disease. Using a LOPIT-based workflow, the team measured the proteomes of cultured lung cancer cells exposed to X-rays and those of untreated controls. Of the several hundred proteins that differed between the two conditions, most changed in either abundance or location, but rarely in both, Lilley says. Focusing on those proteins that seemed to migrate after exposure to radiation, the researchers identified several key players in an iron-dependent cell-death pathway called ferroptosis that might contribute to radiotherapy resistance in some cancers. Although the work is preliminary, the pathway is a potential therapeutic target, Lilley says.\n\nMethod of the year 2024: spatial proteomics\n\nSimilarly, Mikko Taipale, a functional geneticist at the University of Toronto in Canada, and his colleagues coaxed human cell cultures to produce 3,448 fluorescently tagged proteins in which a single-letter alteration to the coding sequence changes one amino acid for another. Such ‘missense mutations’ can sometimes disable a protein, he notes; at other times, “it leads to this rewiring of cellular networks so that the protein ends up in the wrong place and interacts with the wrong partners”. In this case, manual analysis of the microscopy data showed that 16% of variants that were known or likely to be pathogenic also congregated in the wrong place in cells, suggesting a link between protein location and disease4. “I don’t think I would have guessed that it’s that common,”Taipale says.\n\nIn fact, misplaced proteins in cancer and neurodegenerative disease “seems sufficiently widespread that an approach to fixing that mislocalization would be quite powerful”, says Stanford chemical biologist Steven Banik. Scientists have developed tools to study these processes either by reuniting estranged interaction partners5 or by sequestering crucial components in distant parts of the cell6. Now, they are attempting to exploit this information for therapeutic benefit.\n\nBanik and his colleagues, for instance, have created a chemical ‘tow hitch’ called targeted relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs) that latch on to a shuttle protein at one end and a designated cargo on the other7. In one demonstration of this technology, Banik’s team used an RNA-binding protein called FUS as cargo. This protein is normally present in the nucleus but can form toxic granules in the cytoplasm of neurons in some cases of the neurodegenerative condition motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). In cells that are manipulated to express both the faulty form of FUS and a protein that shuttles cargo from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, treatment with the matching TRAM effectively dissolved the troublesome granules by carting away the errant variants. With further development, Banik is hopeful that such molecular tools will uncover the rules that govern logistical networks in cells and even serve as medicinal compounds themselves.\n\nSpatial conundrum\n\nDespite these advances, significant knowledge gaps remain — even to seemingly obvious questions. For instance, just how big is the human proteome? Between variations in gene splicing, post-translational modification and folding, every protein-coding gene can give rise to multiple proteoforms, each of which might have a different function and location, says Neil Kelleher, a protein biochemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nTo survey the proteoform landscape of cells and tissues, Kelleher and his collaborators combined an existing imaging system called nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) and a new instrument for individual ion mass spectrometry, which is being commercialized by biotechnology company Thermo Fisher Scientific. Kelleher and his collaborators call the resulting platform ‘proteoform imaging mass spectrometry’ (PiMS); it can measure hundreds of proteoforms at the tissue level with a resolution of the order of a few cells. In one analysis of ovarian cancer biopsies, Kelleher and his colleagues identified 303 proteoforms that were expressed differently in healthy tissue and tumours8. Now, they are drilling down to the scale of isolated organelles such as nuclei.\n\nA section of brain hippocampus from an individual with Alzheimer’s disease highlights proteins in different cell types: neurons (orange, magenta and green), astrocytes (cyan) and microglia (yellow).

Every month, my team and I come by boat to retrieve the data, as I am doing in this picture with my student Joel Lopez (I’m on the right).\n\nIn this project, we tagged 30 individual birds with GPS data-loggers, including 10 that live in the local mangrove trees, which host around 500 breeding pairs.

On average, foraging trips last 14 hours and birds fly about 30 kilometres from the colony, with males venturing farther than females.

When it stops beating, the blood does not run out.\n\n*****\n\nThe surgeon folds the model of the electric heart in your hands. You squeeze it, feel the matt silver flex, soft as flower petals, and you consider the weakening walls of your own heart.\n\nYou twist the model apart to inspect the core and the leads that weave into the chambers. You’re told that it will work like a casing with the new core implanted. When it’s your time — or what would be your time — your heart will tilt, and the tissue will wither until only the new heart is left.\n\nYou look up to ask, “How long does it live?”\n\n*****\n\nIf your heart beats an average of 72 beats per minute, that means 4,320 per hour, 103,680 per day.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nYou hold your breath long enough to feel the soft timpani in your chest. So you continue to hold it, longer and longer. Your chest burns as you swallow another breath, chirrup with each inhale, each one smaller and smaller as you fill and fill. You swell until your pulse becomes one body of vibration, until you hang on one great breath held too long, on the swell of a breath that waits.\n\nWhen you press your palms to your chest to hold each beat, you wonder how many fewer you already have, how many are left.\n\n*****\n\nYou cannot feel the metal casing or the leads that tendril through the muscle into the new walls. Yet you know your flesh trembles within the implant that pulses in what the surgeon calls pericardial whir, each beat perfect, rhythmic, stable.\n\nAlthough you live another six years, two months, three days, four minutes without feeling anything but your own body, the moment comes when gravity shifts and all within you seems to slant into collapse.\n\nThe part that was perhaps the most you simply ceases to be, preceded in death by two billion beats.\n\nYet here you are, upright and breathing, with a palm to your chest, the little hummingbird of hearts beating on. You begin counting heartbeats in reverse, all that survive you. Minus 1 … minus 2 … minus 65 … minus 143 … You breathe a little deeper, lengthen your stride, fold your hands behind your head to open your chest and expand your lungs as you step across the line of demarcation into your own living afterlife.\n\nIf shimmer was a sound, the new heartbeat sings in this high voice.\n\n*****\n\nThe surface of the water ripples as you lower yourself into the warm bathtub and let the water slip up, over your ears. You close your eyes, float, let all air seep from your lungs, until the only sound is the pattern of small whooshes, like an unborn child on an ultrasound.\n\nThe soft pulse grows into a heavy gallop, reverberating, pounding until it feels as though it might split your bones. And you wonder how to be, without being, how to be, while being, a body.\n\n*****\n\nHours lean into days as the all-consuming pulse throbs within your ears, and you search for something calm, reach for the earth to still you.\n\nYou walk in bare feet, palm the base of a tree, trace the corrugations of bark down to the tops of the roots. You turn to press your back into the trunk, nestle into the tangle of grass, as you watch the birds overhead, beaks opening and closing without a sound.\n\nYou hold onto the calm, the pulse unspooling from you until birdsong and breeze uncoil from the branches above. And you can hear again. The thrum fades as sound returns from each feathered voice, from wind that lifts and catches through the leaves in whispers.",

Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through measurable targets, including tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, net carbon balance and carbon intensity. The goal is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 °C, ideally to 1.5 °C, above preindustrial levels. Without effective mitigation, average global temperature increases will push beyond 3 °C (ref. 4).\n\nAdaptation is the process of preparing for and adjusting to the effects of climate change. It is inherently multidimensional, and spans diverse sectors such as health, infrastructure, agriculture and ecosystems, without a singular, quantifiable metric. Adaptation is especially context-specific, so quantifying adaptation indicators remains a challenge. The global stocktake, a process designed to assess adaptation and resilience-building efforts, continues to grapple with defining and evaluating success.",

Here we investigate this question through Utah array recordings from human MC during attempted handwriting of Chinese characters (n = 306, each consisting of 6.3 ± 2.0 strokes). We find that MC activity evolves through a sequence of states corresponding to the writing of stroke fragments during complicated handwriting. The directional tuning curve of MC neurons remains stable within states, but its gain or preferred direction strongly varies across states. By building models that can automatically infer the neural states and implement state-dependent directional tuning, we can significantly better explain the firing pattern of individual neurons and reconstruct recognizable handwriting trajectories with 69% improvement compared with baseline models. Our findings unveil that skilled and sophisticated movements are encoded through state-specific neural configurations.",

          "abstract": "While Indigenous Knowledge (IK) contains a wealth of information on the behavior and habitat use of species, it is rarely included in the species–habitat models frequently used by Western species management authorities. As decisions from these authorities can limit access to species that are important culturally and for subsistence, exclusion of IK in conservation and management frameworks can negatively impact both species and Indigenous communities. In partnership with Iñupiat hunters, we developed methods to statistically characterize IK of species–habitat relationships and developed models that rely solely on IK to identify species habitat use and important areas. We provide methods for different types of IK documentation and for dynamic habitat types (e.g., ice concentration). We apply the method to ringed seals (natchiq in Iñupiaq) in Alaskan waters, a stock for which the designated critical habitat has been debated in part due to minimal inclusion of IK. Our work demonstrates that IK of species–habitat relationships, with the inclusion of dynamic habitat types, expands on existing mapping approaches and provides another method to identify species habitat use and important areas. The results of this work provide a straightforward and meaningful approach to include IK in species management, especially through comanagement processes.",

Long-range temporal correlations (TCs) characterizing the dissipation of information within a signal have been shown to be a hallmark of brain criticality. However, the experimental link between cognitive performance, criticality, and thus TCs has remained elusive due to limitations in recording length and spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we investigate multiday invasive EEG recordings of 104 persons with epilepsy (PwE) together with an extensive cognitive test battery. We show that short TCs predict cognitive impairment. Further, we show that heterogeneous factors, including interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), antiseizure medications (ASMs), and intermittent periods with slow-wave activity (SWSs), all act directly to perturb critical dynamics and thus cognition. Our work suggests critical dynamics to be the setpoint to measure optimal network function, thereby providing a unifying framework for the heterogeneous mechanisms impacting cognition in conditions like epilepsy.",

ASD's adaptive mechanism accommodates a broad range of dopant concentrations, optimally passivating trap states as needed. This approach significantly lowers the trap energy level from 84 meV to 14 meV above the valence band edge, promoting a transition from hopping to band-like transport mechanisms. ASD boosts carrier mobility by over 60%, reaching up to 30.7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , while extending the extrapolated operational lifetime of treated devices beyond 57.5 y. This breakthrough sets a standard in organic electronics, positioning ASD as a powerful method for simultaneously enhancing performance and stability in OSC devices.",

          "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans feeds by rhythmic contraction and relaxation of a neuromuscular organ called the pharynx, which draws in and filters water and bacterial food. This behavior is driven by myogenic plateau potentials, long-lasting depolarizations of the pharyngeal muscle, which are timed by neuronal input from a dedicated pharyngeal nervous system. While the timing of these plateaus’ initiation has received significant attention, their mechanisms of termination remain incompletely understood. In particular, it is unclear how plateaus resist early termination by hyperpolarizing current noise. Here, we present a computational model of pharyngeal plateaus against a noisy background. We propose that an unusual, rapidly inactivating potassium conductance confers exceptional noise robustness on the system. We further investigate the possibility that a similar mechanism in other systems permits switching between plateau and spiking behavior under noisy conditions.",

          "abstract": "Various strategies targeting spinal locomotor circuitry have been associated with functional improvements after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the neuronal populations mediating beneficial effects remain largely unknown. Using a combination therapy in a mouse model of complete SCI, we show that virally delivered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (AAV-BDNF) activates hindlimb stepping and causes hyperreflexia, whereas submotor threshold epidural stimulation (ES) reduces BDNF-induced hyperreflexia. Given their role in gating proprioceptive afferents and as a potential convergence point of BDNF and ES, we hypothesized that an enhanced excitability of inhibitory RORβ neurons would be associated with locomotor improvements. Ex vivo spinal slice recordings from mice with a range of locomotor and hyperreflexia scores revealed that the excitability of RORβ neurons was related to functional outcome post-SCI. Mice with poor locomotor function after SCI had less excitable RORβ neurons, but the excitability of RORβ neurons was similar between the uninjured and “best stepping” SCI groups. Further, chemogenetic activation of RORβ neurons reduced BDNF-induced hyperreflexia and improved stepping, similar to ES. Our findings identify inhibitory RORβ neurons as a target population to limit hyperreflexia and enhance locomotor function after SCI.",

Here, we removed the C-terminal tail of five alpha- and four beta-tubulin genes in the C. elegans genome. Sensory cilia typically exhibit an axoneme that longitudinally differentiates into a middle segment with doublet MTs and a distal segment with singlet MTs. However, the excision of the alpha-tubulin tail, but not the beta-tubulin tail, resulted in the ectopic formation of doublet MTs in the distal segments. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the alpha-tubulin tail could prevent the B-tubule from docking on the surface of A-tubule. Using recombinant tubulins, we demonstrated that removing the alpha-tubulin tail efficiently promoted doublet MTs formation in vitro. These results reveal the vital and unique contributions of tubulin tails to the structural integrity and accuracy of axoneme MT organization.",

However, effective genetic tools for lineage tracing and functional assessments of NMPs in vivo are currently lacking. Here, we developed a dual recombinase–mediated genetic system to specifically trace and ablate Brachyury + Sox2 + NMPs. Our genetic tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that NMPs consist of three distinct unipotent and bipotent progenitor populations that progressively differentiate into neural and mesodermal fates. Genetic depletion of NMPs demonstrated their critical role in trunk and tail formation. This study provides in vivo genetic evidence supporting the heterogeneity of NMPs in terms of cell fate determination and their functional roles in the developing embryo.",

We show that SIVmus is not resistant to ZAP inhibition. Instead, these Cercopithecus monkey hosts differ from other primate species by a splice site mutation and express the poorly active extralarge XL rather than the highly active L isoform of ZAP. Similarly, higher CpG levels in endogenous prosimian lentiviruses were associated with low activity of the corresponding host lemur ZAPs. In addition, lemur genes also show lower CpG suppression than other primates. Thus, the antiviral activity of ZAP not only affects suppression of CpG dinucleotides in viral transcripts but possibly also host genomes.",

Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (N = 9,082, female = 4,327), we found extensive cross-sectional associations with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and streamline count in the brains of 9- and 10-y-old children exposed to a range of experiences, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, and neighborhood adversity. Lower values of FA were associated with later difficulties with mental arithmetic and receptive language. Furthermore, white matter FA partially mediated the detrimental relationship between adversity and cognition later in adolescence. These findings advance a white matter-based account of the neural and cognitive effects of adversity, which supports leading developmental theories that place interregional connectivity prior to gray matter maturation.",

Herein, we report that we have synthesized a stable and photosensitive zirconium-based MOF (Zr-MOF) with a photoactive tetrathienylethene-based organic linker, Zr-TSS-1. Compared with all-carbocyclic Zr-MOF counterparts, Zr-TSS-1 shows a substantial improvement in visible-light harvesting and free-carrier generation, enabling it to be a promising candidate for photocatalytic antibacterial applications. In order to validate the advantages of this framework as an antibacterial protective material, a composite was fabricated by incorporating robust Zr-TSS-1 onto sustainably accessible bacterial cellulose (BC) using an in situ growth method. This composite exhibits near-complete lethality toward typical Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus within 1 h under mild irradiation and preserves outstanding antibacterial capability after five cycles of reutilization. In addition, the high biocompatibility is confirmed by the low cytotoxicity toward human skin fibroblast, suggesting its potential for biomedical and healthcare applications. This research demonstrates the efficacious integration of a purposely designed photosensitive porous framework onto a sustainable substrate for synergistic functionality, paving a practical way for the development of the next-generation high-efficiency antimicrobial technology.",

This type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless “photon” modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry nonquantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial invasion into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells triggers the activation of the cellular autophagic machinery as a defense mechanism, a process known as xenophagy. In this study, we identified HEATR3, an LC3-interacting region (LIR)-containing protein, as a factor involved in this defense mechanism using quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. HEATR3 localizes intracellularly invading Salmonella , and HEATR3 deficiency promotes Salmonella proliferation in the cytoplasm. HEATR3 also localizes to lysosomes damaged by chemical treatment, suggesting that Salmonella recognition is facilitated by damage to the host cell membrane. HEATR3 deficiency impairs LC3 recruitment to damaged membranes and blocks the delivery of the target to the lysosome. These phenotypes were rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type HEATR3 but not by the LIR mutant, indicating the crucial role of the HEATR3–LC3 interaction in the receptor for selective autophagy. HEATR3 is delivered to lysosomes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Although HEATR3 recruitment to the damaged membrane was unaffected by ATG5 or FIP200 deficiency, it was markedly impaired by treatment with a calcium chelator, suggesting involvement upstream of the autophagic pathway. These findings suggest that HEATR3 serves as a receptor for selective autophagy and is able to identify damaged membranes, facilitate the removal of damaged lysosomes, and target invading bacteria within cells.",

          "abstract": "Historical trends suggest the decline in the importance of land as a production factor, as evidenced by the decline in the employment and gross domestic product (GDP) shares of land-intensive industries. However, land continues to be a prominent store of value, as over half of household wealth in major countries is real estate. To explain this apparent disconnection between land output and land value, in a plausible economic model with land and aggregate risk, we theoretically study the long-run behavior of land prices and identify economic conditions under which land becomes overvalued relative to the fundamentals defined by the present value of land rents. Unbalanced growth together with the elasticity of substitution between production factors plays a critical role. We establish the Land Overvaluation Theorem: When the elasticity of substitution between land and nonland factors exceeds 1 (which is natural because we can create more space by constructing taller buildings with fixed land) and technological progress is faster in nonland sectors, land overvaluation necessarily emerges. As applications of the Theorem, we present three examples: i) land overvaluation emerges along the long-run transition from the Malthusian agricultural economy to the modern knowledge- and service-based economy; ii) with aggregate uncertainty, land prices exhibit recurrent stochastic fluctuations around the trend, with expansions and contractions in the size of land overvaluation; and iii) in modern economies, land use is also changing and urban land has high value. We present a model of urban land prices and show that land overvaluation emerges in the process of urban formation characterized by unbalanced growth.",

          "abstract": "The mature mammalian auditory sensory organ, the organ of Corti (OC), lacks the capacity for regenerating hair cells, leading to permanent hearing impairment. In contrast, the vestibular system has a limited capacity for hair cell regeneration, which we have shown to be further enhanced by inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Here, we demonstrate that, despite similar transcriptional responses, only vestibular and not auditory supporting cells proliferate as a result of Yap activation following Hippo inhibition. Mechanistically, we identify p27 Kip1 , a cell cycle kinase inhibitor encoded by Cdkn1b , as an additional barrier preventing cell cycle reentry specifically in the OC. We show that while in both systems Yap stimulates p27 Kip1 degradation through activation of its direct target gene Skp2 , this protein-level control is antagonized by an unusually high level of Cdkn1b transcription in the cochlea. Consequently, p27 Kip1 activity is maintained in the OC even in the presence of constitutively active Yap5SA, counteracting its mitogenic effects. Supporting this model, inactivation of the Hippo pathway in the Cdkn1b -deficient background is sufficient to induce adult auditory supporting cell proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the synergistic interaction between Hippo and p27 Kip1 is conserved in the retina where inhibition of both pathways potently induces Müller glia proliferation and initiates neuronal regeneration. Our work uncovers the molecular mechanism preventing quiescent adult sensory progenitor cells, supporting cells in the ear and Müller glia in the eye, from reentering the cell cycle after damage—the key step toward sensory receptor regeneration blocked in mammals.",

          "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently causes about one million infections and 240,000 deaths worldwide each year. To reach the goal set by the World Health Organization of global HCV elimination by 2030, it is critical to develop a prophylactic vaccine. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) target the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface, can neutralize a broad range of the highly diverse circulating HCV strains, and are essential tools to inform vaccine design. However, bNAbs targeting a single E1E2 epitope might be limited in neutralization breadth, which can be enhanced by using combinations of bNAbs that target different envelope epitopes. We have generated 60 immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that can simultaneously target two distinct epitopes on E1E2. We combine non- or partially overlapping E1E2 specificities into three types of bsAbs, each containing a different hinge length. The majority of bsAbs shows retained or increased potency and breadth against a diverse panel of HCV pseudoparticles and HCV produced in cell culture compared to monospecific and cocktail controls. Additionally, we demonstrate that changes in the hinge length of bsAbs can alter the binding stoichiometry to E1E2. These results provide insights into the binding modes and the role of avidity in bivalent targeting of diverse E1E2 epitopes.This study illustrates how potential cooperative effects of HCV bNAbs can be utilized by strategically designing bispecific constructs. These HCV bsAbs can guide vaccine development and unlock novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against HCV and other (flavi)viruses.",

          "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a commensal in the human oral cavity, is overrepresented in the colon microbiota of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and is linked to tumor chemoresistance, metastasis, and a poor therapeutic prognosis. Fn produces numerous adhesins that mediate tumor colonization and downregulation of the host’s antitumor immune response. One of these, the trimeric autotransporter adhesin (TAA) CEACAM binding protein of Fusobacterium (CbpF), targets CEACAM1 on T-cells and has been associated with immune evasion of Fn-colonized tumors. Whereas the role of CEACAM1 in homophilic and heterophilic cell interactions and immune evasion is well described, the mechanistic details of its interaction with fusobacterial CbpF remain unknown due to the lack of a high-resolution structure of the adhesin–receptor complex. Here, we present two structures of CbpF alone and in complex with CEACAM1, obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy and single particle analysis. They reveal that CbpF forms a stable homotrimeric complex whose N-terminal part of the extracellular domain comprises a 64 Å long β roll domain with a unique lateral loop extension. CEACAM1 binds to this loop with high affinity via its N-terminal IgV-like domain with a nanomolar dissociation constant as determined by surface plasmon resonance. This study provides a comprehensive structural description of a fusobacterial TAA, illustrates a yet undescribed CEACAM1 binding mode, and paves the way for rational drug design targeting Fn in CRC.",

          "abstract": "Seismic fault slip and rupture propagation often occur at crustal depths in the presence of hot and pressurized aqueous fluids (i.e., hydrothermal conditions). Previous experiments investigated fault frictional properties under hydrothermal conditions, but at imposed subseismic fault slip velocities ( V ~μm/s). Here, using a rotary-shear apparatus equipped with a hydrothermal pressure vessel, we study friction at seismic slip velocities ( V = 1.5 m/s) of gabbro- and marble-built faults under temperatures of 40 to 400 °C and pore water pressure of 30 MPa. We find that with increasing initial water temperature ( T amb ), the dynamic friction during initial slip acceleration and subsequent high-velocity sliding decreases for both gabbro- and marble-built faults, while the slip-weakening distance decreases for gabbro but increases for marble. Then, during rapid deceleration at the end of sliding, frictional strength recovery decreases for gabbro with increasing T amb and increases for marble independently of T amb . As in previous experiments performed at room T amb , the mechanical and microstructural data, plus numerical modeling, suggest that the seismic fault weakening mechanisms shift from flash heating to bulk melting for gabbro, and from flash heating to grain boundary sliding accommodated by diffusion creep for marble, with their activation processes depending on T amb . Our results demonstrate the effects of ambient temperature on seismic fault friction, which contribute to changes in fault strength and dynamic weakening processes at crustal depths and should be considered in earthquake rupture modeling.",

Yet, much remains unknown about how art is subjectively interpreted. In this study, we sought to elucidate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the subjective interpretation of art. Using brain imaging and written descriptions, we quantified individual variability in responses to paintings by the same artists, contrasting figurative and abstract paintings. Our findings revealed that abstract art elicited greater interindividual variability in activity within higher-order, associative brain areas, particularly those comprising the default-mode network. By contrast, no such differences were found in early visual areas, suggesting that subjective variability arises from higher cognitive processes rather than differences in sensory processing. These findings provide insight into how the brain engages with and perceives different forms of art and imbues it with subjective interpretation.",

In this study, we assessed the morphology and crystallinity of individually dispersed microfibrils isolated from the cell walls of wood, cotton, and ramie celluloses. It is well known that microfibrils in higher plants exhibit structural diversity, and these three plants, in particular, have distinct differences in the morphology and crystallinity of microfibrils. Our structural analyses combining atomic force microscopy (AFM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the uniformity in the cross-sectional dimensions and crystallinity of the dispersed microfibrils, irrespective of the plant species. The majority of the microfibrils were dispersed as structural units with widths of approximately 2 to 3 nm, and their crystallite sizes and crystallinity degrees were approximately 2 nm and 20%, respectively. These structural profiles were in agreement with the simulation results; here, the model assumed that a single microfibril consisted of 18 cellulose molecules. These results from the direct dimensional assessments support a recent hypothesis in biophysics that a single biosynthesis system of cellulose, referred to as the terminal complex (TC), consisted of 18 synthases. Some of the dispersed microfibrils had bundled sizes of two or three microfibrils. We also demonstrated that this bundling was stabilized by the fusion of several crystallites.",

We also assessed multivariate morphological terms that capture brain size, shape, and folding processes. The sample consisted of 345 typically developing infants, 73 preterm infants, and 107 infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) who underwent brain MRI. Our results show that typically developing neonates and those with CHD follow the cortical folding scaling law obtained from mammalian brains, children, and adults which captures the relationship between exposed SA, total SA, and CT. Cortical folding scaling was not affected by gestational age at birth, postmenstrual age at scan, sex, or multiple birth in these populations. CHD was characterized by a unique reduction in the multivariate morphological term capturing size, suggesting that CHD affects cortical growth overall but not cortical folding processes. In contrast, preterm birth was characterized by altered cortical folding scaling and altered shape, suggesting that the developmentally programmed processes of cortical folding are disrupted in this population. The degree of altered shape was associated with cognitive abilities in early childhood in preterm infants.",

We find that these eye movements are causally linked to activity in SC but not LIP, and that they occur following transient alignment of cognitive and saccadic population coding subspaces in SC. This behavioral signature of oculomotor engagement is absent during a similar task that does not require rule-based categorization, suggesting that abstract task behaviors recruit primate oculomotor networks more strongly than previously understood.",

We further perform tunneling magneto-conductance measurements on a model 2D antiferromagnetic insulator, CrCl 3 , exhibiting near-ideal easy-plane anisotropy. The magnetic field-controlled tunneling current at low temperature aligns well with simulated in-plane anisotropic spin-configuration, providing direct experimental evidence for detecting magnetic anisotropy field around 1 mT.

Here, we inoculated a symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) model cnidarian ( Exaiptasia diaphana : “Aiptasia”) with either its native symbiont Breviolum minutum or one of three non-native symbionts: Symbiodinium microadriaticum , Cladocopium goreaui, and Durusdinium trenchii . We then measured and compared host AP, host AU, symbiont EX, and symbiont cell-cycle phase for up to a year with these different symbionts and used these discrete measurements to inform comparative models of symbiont population regulation. Our models showed a general pattern, where regulation through AP and AU is reduced after onset, followed by an overshoot of the symbiont population that requires a strong regulatory response, dealt with by strong CC and increased EX. As colonization progresses into symbiosis maintenance, CC remains crucial for achieving steady-state symbiont populations, with our models estimating that CC regulates 10-fold more cells (60 to 90%) relative to the other mechanisms. Notably though, our models also revealed that D. trenchii is less tightly regulated than B. minutum , consistent with D. trenchii’s reputation as a suboptimal partner for this cnidarian. Overall, our models suggest that single regulatory mechanisms do not accurately replicate observed symbiont colonization patterns, reflecting the importance of all mechanisms working concomitantly. This ultimately sheds light on the cell biology underpinning the stability of this ecologically significant symbiosis.",

          "abstract": "Interest in the biological actions of alcohols, ethanol in particular, dates back to the earliest historical texts. Alcohol research is now a highly active field with roots in physiology, pharmacology, toxicology, and neuroscience. But at what point did interest and speculation evolve into bona fide science? Here, we set out to identify the earliest systematic empirical investigations into the biological actions of alcohols and unearthed a surprisingly rigorous literature which included a fundamental insight with significant implications for modern research and policy. Through manual backward citation mapping of archived texts, much of which was digitally inaccessible, we outline the origins of alcohol research beginning with a transcribed lecture from Benjamin Ward Richardson in 1869. In the years immediately following, the field of alcohol research was legitimized around what came to be briefly known as “Richardson’s law.” Richardson’s law states that the acute toxicity of straight-chain monohydroxy alcohols is directly proportional to the carbon chain length of the molecule. This law was recognized only briefly not because it was disproven, but rather because it was simply forgotten during the decades that passed between its inception and the advent of systematic bibliographic databases which paved the way for digital archiving. Quantitative analysis of studies spanning a century revealed that across monohydroxy alcohols with one (methanol) to thirteen (tridecanol) carbons, there is a near-deterministic relationship between chain-length and lethal dose (R 2 = 0.96). Richardson’s law of alcohol potency has silently stood the test of time and is among functional biology’s oldest and least challenged scientific laws.",

          "abstract": "Most members of the dynamin superfamily of large guanosine triphophatases (GTPases) have an ability to remodel membranes in response to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Ring Finger Protein 112 (RNF112) (ZNF179/neurolastin) is a recently identified brain-specific dynamin-like protein possessing a really interesting new gene (RING) finger domain. Despite its essential role as an E3 ligase in neuron development, the architecture of RNF112 and the exact role of its GTPase activity remain unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of truncated RNF112 (RNF112 T ) containing a GTPase domain (GD) and three-helical middle domain (MD) at different nucleotide-loading states. In the nucleotide-free (apo) state, the monomeric RNF112 T remained in a unique self-restraint conformation characterized by docking of the proximal end of the MD to a groove in the GD. At the transition state of GTP hydrolysis, the MD was released from the GD and stretched aside to form an intertwined RNF112 T homodimer. Engineered RNF112 equipped with the C-terminal elements of ATL1 or the two transmembrane domains of yeast Sac1p relocated to the endoplasmic reticulum and was capable of mediating membrane remodeling. Taken together, our results offer necessary understandings of RNF112 as a dynamin-like large GTPase in its cellular function and provide insights into the functional mechanisms of dynamin superfamily proteins.",

          "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a central signaling network that enables eukaryotic cells to respond to a variety of different environmental stresses. Such stresses cause ribosome collisions that lead to activation of the kinase Gcn2, resulting in the phosphorylation and inactivation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and thereby promoting selective translation of mRNAs to restore homeostasis. Despite the importance of the ISR and intensive study over the past decades, structural insight into how Gcn2 interacts with ribosomal particles has been lacking. Using ex vivo affinity purification approaches, we have obtained a cryoelectron microscopy structure of a yeast Gcn2 dimer in complex with the ribosomal 60S subunit. The Gcn2 dimer is formed by dimerization of the histidine tRNA synthetase-like domains, which establish extensive interactions with the stalk-base and sarcin–ricin loop of the 60S subunit. The C-terminal domain of Gcn2 is also dimerized and occupies the A- and P-site tRNA binding sites at the peptidyl-transferase center of the 60S subunit. Complementary functional studies indicate that binding of Gcn2 to the 60S subunit does not require the coactivators Gcn1 or Gcn20, nor does it lead to phosphorylation of eIF2α. Instead, upon stress, we observe a shift of Gcn2 from the 60S subunit into the colliding ribosome fraction, suggesting that the Gcn2–60S complex represents an inactive stand-by state to enable a rapid redistribution to collided ribosomes, and thereby facilitating a quick and efficient response to stress.",

Our study explores the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , a classic model system in biology and a species adept at microscale interaction, as a biological platform for microrobotics. Initially, we focus on remotely directing the walking paths of fruit flies in an experimental arena. We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies’ optomotor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of attraction-inducing mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight-carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Last, we demonstrate multiagent formation control, with flies alternating between distinct spatial patterns. Beyond expanding tools available for microrobotics, these behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.",

Conventional space-variant polarization manipulation in optical systems only results in broadband geometric phases. Recently emerged nonlocal metasurfaces show an ability to compress the operating bandwidth through modulations of wavelength-dependent amplitudes. However, their geometric phases are still broadband and not linear, posing severe challenges to realize ultra narrowband metadevices. Here, we propose and demonstrate the generation of ultra narrowband and spatially variable geometric phases in resonant metasurfaces. We find that an array of perturbed Mie resonators is able to simultaneously preserve its global symmetry and local transformation. Local transformation provides a pixel-level geometric phase, whereas global symmetry yields an ultranarrow operation bandwidth. We further reveal that this geometric phase can be well pinned to the resonant mode by introducing additional perturbations to individually define the phase at nonresonant wavelengths. Consequently, we realize experimentally pixelated phase-gradient metasurfaces and metalenses with record-breaking Q factors and high confidentiality. We believe that our general approach and demonstrated results will open a paradigm of multiplexed metasurfaces and information encryption.",

In contrast, basal expression at uninduced promoters is considered to be a dynamically inert mode of nonfunctional “promoter leakiness,” merely a byproduct of transcriptional regulation. Here, we investigate the basal expression mode of the mar operon, the main regulator of intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli , and link its dynamic properties to the noncanonical, yet highly conserved start codon of marR across Enterobacteriaceae . Real-time, single-cell measurements across tens of generations reveal that basal expression consists of rare stochastic gene expression pulses, which maximize variability in wildtype and, surprisingly, transiently accelerate cellular elongation rates. Competition experiments show that basal expression confers fitness advantages to wildtype across several transitions between exponential and stationary growth by shortening lag times. The dynamically rich basal expression of the mar operon has likely been evolutionarily maintained for its role in growth homeostasis of Enterobacteria within the gut environment, thereby allowing other ancillary gene regulatory roles to evolve, e.g., control of costly-to-induce multidrug efflux pumps. Understanding the complex selection forces governing genetic systems involved in intrinsic multidrug resistance is crucial for effective public health measures.",

          "abstract": "Influenza remains a significant public health threat. Both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors can target the influenza surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) for prevention and treatment of influenza. Here, we combine the strengths of anti-influenza antibodies and small molecules by site-specific conjugation of the NA inhibitor zanamivir to MEDI8852, an HA-specific fully human monoclonal antibody. MEDI8852 targets the conserved stem region of HA and inhibits HA-mediated fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Elimination of virus-infected cells involves Fcγ receptor–mediated effector functions. The efficacy of MEDI8852 is limited to influenza A viruses. Zanamivir, on the other hand, binds to the active site of NA in both influenza A and B viruses to inhibit NA activity and virus release. However, because of its small size, zanamivir has a short half-life and requires repeated dosing at high concentrations. We produced a MEDI8852–zanamivir antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) that engages Fc-mediated effector functions and benefits from neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling. The MEDI8852–zanamivir conjugate extends the circulatory half-life of zanamivir, targets both influenza HA and NA, and shows enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared to MEDI8852 alone. The MEDI8852–zanamivir conjugate protected mice from a lethal (10 × LD 50 ) challenge with influenza A and B viruses at a dose similar to that required for broadly neutralizing anti-NA antibodies, with the added advantage of simultaneously targeting NA (influenza A and B) and HA (influenza A).",

Ubiquitination of the microtubule-associated tau protein, an intrinsically disordered biomolecule, has been proposed to influence the formation of filamentous deposits in neurodegenerative conditions. Given the reported link between aggregation propensity and intrinsic structural preferences (e.g., transient extended structural motifs or tertiary contacts) in disordered proteins, we sought to explore the conformational landscape of ubiquitinated tau. Exploiting selective conjugation reactions, we produced single- and double-monoubiquitinated protein samples. Next, we examined the ubiquitinated species from different standpoints using NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering experiments, and native ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IM–MS). Moreover, we obtained atomistic representations of the conformational ensembles via scaled MD calculations, consistent with the experimental data. Modifying the repeat domain of tau with ubiquitin had a limited effect on secondary structure propensities and local mobility of distal regions. Instead, ubiquitination enhanced the compaction of the conformational ensemble, with the effect modulated by the site and the number of modifications. Native IM–MS patterns pinpointed similarities and differences between distinct tau proteoforms. It emerges that ubiquitination exerts a position-specific influence on the conformational distribution of tau molecules. This study reveals the unique conformational features of ubiquitinated forms of tau and points to their potential impact on aggregation and phase separation propensities, offering clues for a better understanding of disease-related structural alterations.",

          "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common cause of inherited retinal degeneration worldwide. It is characterized by the sequential death of rod and cone photoreceptors, the cells responsible for night and daylight vision, respectively. Although the expression of most RP genes occurs only in rods, there is a secondary degeneration of cones. One possible mechanism of cone death is metabolic dysregulation. Photoreceptors are highly metabolically active, consuming large quantities of glucose and producing substantial amounts of lactate. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mediates the transport of glucose from the blood to photoreceptors and, in turn, removes lactate, which can influence the rate of consumption of glucose by the RPE. One model for metabolic dysregulation in RP suggests that following the death of rods, lactate levels are substantially diminished causing the RPE to withhold glucose, resulting in nutrient deprivation for cones. Here, we present adeno-associated viral vector-mediated delivery of monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2, Slc16a7 ) into the eye, with expression limited to RPE cells, with the aim of promoting lactate uptake from the blood and encouraging the passage of glucose to cones. We demonstrate prolonged survival and function of cones in rat and mouse RP models, revealing a possible gene-agnostic therapy for preserving vision in RP. We also present the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging-based biosensors for lactate and glucose within the eye. Using this technology, we show changes to lactate and glucose levels within MCT2-expressing RPE, suggesting that cone survival is impacted by changes in RPE metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Increased differentiation or activity of osteoclasts is the key pathogenic factor of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). N4‐acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification, catalyzed by Nat10, is a novel posttranscriptional mRNA modification related to many diseases. However, its impact on regulating osteoclast activation in PMOP remains uncertain. Here, we initially observed that Nat10-mediated ac4C positively correlates with osteoclast differentiation of monocytes and low bone mass in PMOP. The specific knockout of Nat10 in monocytes and remodelin, a Nat10 inhibitor, alleviates ovariectomized (OVX)-induced bone loss by downregulating osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, epitranscriptomic analyses reveal that the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1) is the key downstream target of ac4C modification during osteoclast differentiation. Subsequently, translatomic results demonstrate that Nat10-mediated ac4C enhances the translation efficiency (TE) of Nfatc1, thereby inducing Nfatc1 expression and consequent osteoclast maturation. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the promotive role of Nat10 in osteoclast differentiation and PMOP from a novel field of RNA modifications and suggest that Nat10 can be a target of epigenetic therapy for preventing bone loss in PMOP.",

This system leverages a series of Transformer based models to generate high quality, meaningful embeddings for individual enzymes, biosynthetic domains, and metabolic pathways. These embedded representations enable rapid, large-scale comparisons of metabolic proteins and pathways, surpassing the capabilities of conventional methodologies. The examination of evolutionary and functionally conserved metabolites across diverse bacterial species is facilitated by integrating the predictive capabilities of IBIS into a graph database enriched with comprehensive metadata. The consideration of both primary and specialized metabolism, combined with an embedding logic for enzyme discovery, uniquely positions IBIS to identify potential novel metabolic pathways. With the expansion of genomic data necessitating transformative approaches to advance molecular metabolism research, IBIS delivers an AI-driven holistic investigation of bacterial metabolism.",

The invasion history of these translocations remains uncertain for most species, limiting our understanding of their future adaptive potential and historical roles as vectors for coinvaded species. We provide a framework for filling this gap in invasion biology using the widely transplanted Pacific oyster as a case study. A two-dimensional summary of population-level variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms in native Japan reflected the geographical map of Japan and allowed identification of the source regions for the worldwide expansion. Pacific oysters proliferate in nonnative areas with environmental temperatures similar to those areas where native lineages evolved. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we ranked the likelihood of historical oyster or shipping vectors to explain current-day distribution of genotypes in 14 coinvaded algal and animal species. Oyster transplants were a more likely vector than shipping for six species, shipping activity was more likely for five species, and a vector was ambiguous for three species. Applying this approach to other translocated species should reveal similar legacy effects, especially for economically important foundation species that also served as vectors for nonnative species.",

Applying this approach will generate testable predictions of insect biodiversity across space, time, and changing drivers.

          "abstract": "T cells have emerged as orchestrators of pain amplification, but the mechanism by which T cells control pain processing is unresolved. We found that regulatory T cells (T reg cells) could inhibit nociception through a mechanism that was not dependent on their ability to regulate immune activation and tissue repair. Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal T reg cells (mT reg cells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mT reg cells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD + sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for T reg cell–mediated immunosuppression. Thus, our findings uncovered a sexually dimorphic immunological circuit that restrains nociception, establishing T reg cells as sentinels of pain homeostasis.",

In two independent cohorts, we identified altered microbial bile acid metabolism with reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in osteoarthritis. Suppressing farnesoid X receptor (FXR)—the receptor of GUDCA—alleviated osteoarthritis through intestine-secreted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in mice. GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance of Clostridium bolteae , which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment with C. bolteae and Food and Drug Administration–approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR–joint GLP-1 axis in mice. UDCA use was associated with lower risk of osteoarthritis-related joint replacement in humans. These findings suggest that orchestrating the gut microbiota–GUDCA–intestinal FXR–GLP-1–joint pathway offers a potential strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.",

In this work, using methods borrowed from distributional semantics, we investigated compositionality in wild bonobos and found that not only does each call type of their repertoire occur in at least one compositional combination, but three of these compositional combinations also exhibit nontrivial compositionality.

In this work, we show that a prominent industrial process, palladium (Pd)–catalyzed vinyl acetate synthesis, proceeds via interconversion of heterogeneous Pd(0) and homogeneous Pd(II) during catalysis, with each species playing a complementary role. Using electrochemical probes, we found that heterogeneous, nanoparticulate Pd(0) serves as an active oxygen reduction electrocatalyst to furnish the high potential required for corrosion to form homogeneous Pd(II), which then catalyzes selective ethylene acetoxylation with reformation of heterogeneous Pd(0). Inhibiting the corrosion of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by galvanic protection results in reversible poisoning of catalysis, evincing the essential role of phase conversion in this catalytic cycle. These results highlight how dynamic phase interconversion can harness and couple complementary reactivity across molecular and material active sites.",

Both intact adaptive immunity and metabolic niche competition are necessary for efficient vaccine-enhanced competition.

Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types—peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells—with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns.

The DNA strands are distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* b and Apo* states. We also identify several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism.

          "abstract": "Cyclic creep, or ratcheting, is a severe form of fatigue deformation caused by cumulative unidirectional plastic strain under asymmetrical stress cycling with a nonzero mean stress. It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials.",

A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiative V OC limit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites.",

          "abstract": "Exogenous messenger RNAs (mRNAs) require cellular machinery for delivery and translation but also encounter inhibitory factors. To investigate their regulation, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens with in vitro–transcribed mRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) were identified as mediators of LNP uptake and endosomal escape, respectively. TRIM25—an RNA binding E3 ubiquitin ligase—emerged as a key suppressor inducing turnover of both linear and circular mRNAs. The endoribonucleases N4BP1 and KHNYN, along with the antiviral protein ZAP, act redundantly in TRIM25-dependent surveillance. TRIM25 specifically targets mRNAs delivered by endosomes, and its RNA affinity increases at acidic pH, suggesting activation by protons released from ruptured endosomes. N 1 -methylpseudouridine modification reduces TRIM25’s RNA binding, helping RNAs evade its suppressive effect. This study comprehensively maps cellular pathways regulating LNP-mRNAs, offering insights into RNA immunity and therapeutics.",

In general, this strategy necessitates a final protein-folding step, constraining the types of systems amenable to the approach. Here, we report a method that allows internal regions of target proteins to be replaced in a single operation. Conceptually, our system is analogous to a DNA transposition reaction but uses orthogonal pairs of engineered split inteins to mediate the editing process. This “protein transposition” reaction is applied to several systems, including folded protein complexes, allowing the efficient introduction of a variety of noncoded elements. By carrying out a molecular “cut and paste” under native protein-folding conditions, our approach substantially expands the scope of protein semisynthesis.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) significantly influence material properties upon isotopic substitution, particularly with light atoms such as hydrogen. While water is rich in hydrogen, its hydrogen-bonded structure exhibits only moderate NQEs. Simulations ascribe this to competing zero-point energies (ZPEs): Intermolecular ZPEs stabilize hydrogen-bonds, while intramolecular ZPEs destabilize them. However, experimental validation has been lacking due to the difficulty in quantifying NQEs. The air/water interface provides an ideal platform to quantify NQEs in liquid water using surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. By analyzing the excess/depletion of interfacial HOD, H 2 O, and D 2 O molecules with one free OH/OD group and the other H-bonded OH/OD group, we found that the intermolecular ZPE destabilizes the hydrogen-bonds by 0.74 ± 0.20 kilojoule per mole upon isotope substitution from H to D, while the intramolecular ZPE stabilizes them by 0.78 ± 0.33 kilojoule per mole. This near-complete cancellation explains the overall moderate NQE in liquid water. The interface thus allows for quantifying NQEs in water.",

How IFT subcomplexes reach the ciliary base and assemble into IFT trains is poorly understood. Here, we perform quantitative single-molecule imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans chemosensory cilia to uncover how IFT subcomplexes arrive at the base, organize in IFT trains, and enter the cilium. We find that BBSomes reach the base via diffusion where they either associate with assembling IFT trains or with the membrane surrounding the base. In contrast, IFT-B and IFT-A reach the base via directed transport most likely on vesicles that stop at distinct locations near the base. Individual subcomplexes detach from the vesicles into a diffusive pool and associate to assembling trains. Our results show that IFT-B is first incorporated into IFT trains, followed by IFT-A, and finally BBSomes, indicating that the assembly of IFT trains is a highly regulated, step-wise process.",

Upon mtDNA replication stress, the mitochondrial genome transfers to endosomes for degradation. Using proximity biotinylation, we found that mtDNA stress leads to the rewiring of the mitochondrial proximity proteome, increasing mitochondria’s association with lysosomal and vesicle-related proteins. Among these, the retromer complex, particularly VPS35, plays a pivotal role by extracting mitochondrial components. The retromer promotes the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles shuttled to lysosomes. The mtDNA, however, directly shuttles to a recycling organelle in a BAX-dependent manner. Moreover, using a Drosophila model carrying a long deletion on the mtDNA (ΔmtDNA), we found that ΔmtDNA activates a specific transcriptome profile to counteract mitochondrial damage. Here, Vps35 expression restores mtDNA homoplasmy and alleviates associated defects. Hence, we demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown quality control mechanism for the mitochondrial matrix and the essential role of lysosomes in mtDNA turnover to relieve mtDNA damage.",

Our continuous tree-ring δ 18 O record reveals a significant long-term drying trend over much of the Holocene ( P  &lt; 0.001), which is in line with orbital forcing and independent evidence from proxy reconstructions and model simulations. Wetter conditions in the early-to-mid Holocene coincide with the African Humid Period, whereas the most severe summer droughts of the past 9000 years are found during the Little Ice Age in the 18th and 19th centuries Common Era. We suggest that much of Europe was not only warmer but also wetter during most of the preindustrial Holocene, which implies a close relationship between insolation changes and long-term hydroclimate trends that likely affected natural and societal systems across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales.",

We also measure equations of state with tunable dipolar interactions. Our findings show a transition point shift due to dipole orientation, aligning with BKT transition with effective short-range interaction. However, we observe that in-plane tilted dipoles show nonlocal effects in the superfluid regime, preventing the effective short-range interaction from revealing universal behavior near the BKT critical point. We also measure anisotropic atom number fluctuations in the superfluid regime, highlighting its dipolar nature. Our results provide a foundation for understanding dipolar bosons in 2D and pave the way for investigating complex orders in dipolar superfluids.",

          "abstract": "Unpreferable vibrations and impacts pose substantial risks to sensitive devices, structures, and the human body, demanding materials capable of providing both high energy dissipation and impact protection across a broad temperature range. Traditional damping materials often fail to meet these demands because of a trade-off between damping and mechanical strength. We introduce an innovative strategy to fabricate armored polymer-fluid gels (APFGs) that combine high damping and high modulus for effective damping and impact protection under extreme conditions. By using a controlled surface cross-linking process through diffusion, we greatly enhance the mechanical strength of polymer-fluid gels without sacrificing their damping capabilities. This asymmetric design results in an unprecedented loss factor (tanδ &gt; 0.5 from −45 degrees to 135 degrees Celsius, peaking at tanδ = 2.2) while achieving a tensile modulus of 20 megapascals. This method resolves the long-standing damping-modulus trade-off, positioning APFGs as promising candidates for robust damping and impact protection in electronics and human motion applications.",

          "abstract": "The intratumoral mycobiome plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment, but its impact on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8 + T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis. Our findings suggest that the intratumoral mycobiome suppresses lipid catabolism and induces T cell exhaustion in RCC.",

However, CAR-T cells cause inflammatory toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is in contrast to T cell receptor (TCR)–engineered T cells against various antigens that historically have rarely been associated with CRS. To study whether and how differences in receptor types affect the propensity for eliciting inflammatory responses in a model system wherein TCR and CAR target equalized sources of clinically relevant antigen, we discovered a CD22-specific TCR and compared it to CD22 CAR. Both CD22 TCR-T and CD22 CAR-T cells eradicated leukemia in xenografts, but only CD22 CAR-T cells induced dose-dependent systemic inflammation. Compared to TCR-T cells, CAR-T cells disproportionately upregulated inflammatory pathways without concordant augmentation in pathways involved in direct cytotoxicity upon antigen engagement. These differences in antileukemia responses comparing TCR-T and CAR-T cells highlight the potential opportunity to improve therapeutic safety by using TCRs.",

We demonstrate that this domain binds internal N -acetylglucosamine on complex biantennary N-glycans with select preference for L1CAM and other N-glycoproteins with multiple N-glycans on host cell surfaces. This domain is also essential for V. vulnificus pathogenesis during intestinal infection.

In striate and extrastriate cortex, the gain of neural responses tracked the priority of memoranda. We decoded higher-priority memoranda with smaller error and lower uncertainty. Moreover, these neural differences predicted behavioral differences in memory prioritization between and within participants. Trial-wise variability in the magnitude of delay activity in the frontal cortex predicted differences in decoded precision between low- and high-priority items in visual cortex.

Expeditious assembly of the oligosaccharides derived from these glycans is challenging because β- d -idopyranosidic linkages are formidable to directly construct. Furthermore, whether the synthetic C. jejuni oligosaccharides could induce sufficient immunogenicity as the potential antigens remains unexplored. Here, we report a protocol for directly forming β- d -idopyranosidic bonds using α- d -6-deoxy- ido -heptopyranosyl, α- d -idopyranosyl, and d -/ l - glycero -α- d - ido -heptopyranosyl ortho -hexynylbenzoates as glycosylating agents under gold(I) catalysis.

Considering the high mental and metabolic effort discrete motor tasks impose, we used a forced-choice Bayesian Optimization approach that promotes sampling efficiency by leveraging domain knowledge about just noticeable differences between assistance settings. Optimizing over two control parameters, preferred settings were consistent within and uniquely different between participants. We discovered that overall, participants preferred asymmetric parameter configurations with more lifting than lowering assistance, and that preferences were sensitive to user anthropometrics.

MprF presents a promising target in multiresistant pathogens, but structural information is limited and both substrate specificity and energization of MprF-mediated lipid transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of MprF from P. aeruginosa ( Pa MprF) bound to a synthetic nanobody. Pa MprF adopts an “open” conformation with a wide, lipid-exposed groove on the periplasmic side that induces a local membrane deformation in molecular dynamics simulations.

Mechanistically, nuclear LKB1 lessens MAPK pathway–mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by increased histone 3 S10/28 phosphorylation-dependent cyclin O transcription. Moreover, myeloid Slc6a14 deficiency alleviates pulmonary inflammation via suppressing inflammatory macrophage responses.

Classical modeling of polystyrene depletant as penetrable spheres predicts depletion-induced phase boundaries, nanocrystal second osmotic virial coefficients, and colloidal structuring in agreement with experiments for polymer radii of gyration up to 80% of the nanocrystal radius.

Following and ongoing investigations of reversed Cherenkov radiation considered it impossible to occur from a homogeneous isotropic slab with a positive refractive index. Here, we break this long-held belief by finding the emergence of reversed Cherenkov radiation from a positive-index isotropic slab by exploiting optical gain. We find precise conditions under which the backward-propagating Cherenkov radiation is maintained while the forward-propagating one is suppressed. Counterintuitively, the intensity and the angular spread of reversed Cherenkov radiation can be made robust to the slab thickness. Under this scenario, increasing the optical gain could decrease the intensity and increase the radiation angular spread.",

Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then, the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings. By leveraging diverse data sources and multiple ML strategies, we demonstrate an efficient pathway for electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. This comprehensive, data-driven approach represents a paradigm shift and potentially benchmark in electrocatalysts research.",

          "abstract": "Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum are spin-dependent high- Q resonances in meta-photonic structures that are realized by perturbing symmetry-protected optical states by engineering in-plane and out-of-plane asymmetries, and they support chiral lasing in the vertical direction. Here, we explore the coupling between two resonances in a chiral metasurface and introduce a mechanism for high-purity chiral laser emission. We reveal that two resonances with nearly orthogonal polarizations become strongly coupled in an engineered chiral metasurface. The inherent phase difference of the resonances, associated with the coherent destruction on the decay channel, can endow high- Q factor and maximize chirality to one of the hybrid modes. We verify this approach experimentally by measuring transmission spectra, angle-resolved photoluminescence, and laser emission. We believe that this mechanism allows breaking restrictions on conventional chiral quasi-BIC lasing, enabling the realization of chiral emission at any designed direction.",

          "abstract": "Although an increased risk of the skin cancer melanoma in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been shown in multiple studies, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood, but increased expression of the PD-associated protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) in melanoma cells may be important. Our previous work suggests that αSyn can facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, promoting genomic stability. We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs. Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage. αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.",

The tPB is made entirely of pristine cellulose and compositionally identical to paper. A cup-shaped tPB can hold just-boiled water without an internal film coating because of its high wet tensile properties and anisotropic thermal properties. In addition, the spent tPB is material recyclable in a closed system, where all chemicals and water are also recyclable. Furthermore, the marine biodegradability of tPB across shallow to abyssal depths is confirmed by on-site degradation tests and metagenomic analyses.

Temperature-dependent Hall, Seebeck, and Nernst measurements consistently indicate the existence of ambipolar transport characteristics in CuBHT. A two-band analysis has been used to extract transport parameters for electron and hole carriers as a function of temperature.

Here, we present a computer vision–guided craniotomy robot (CV-Craniobot) that uses machine learning to accurately estimate the dorsal skull anatomy from optical coherence tomography images. Instantaneous information of skull morphology is used by a robotic mill to rapidly and precisely remove the skull from a desired craniotomy location. We show that the CV-Craniobot can perform small (2- to 4-millimeter diameter) craniotomies with near 100% success rates within 2 minutes and large craniotomies encompassing most of the dorsal cortex in less than 10 minutes.

In patients suffering from myocarditis, a vicious cycle of inflammation orchestrated by CD4 + T cells, neutrophils, and fibroblasts is the culprit that drives the deterioration of myocarditis into iDCM. This study designed composite microneedles and ion solutions using calcium silicate bioceramics, which deliver SiO 3 2− directly into myocardial tissue or indirectly via systemic circulation. These interventions modulate the cell microenvironment by regulating CD4 + T/T helper 17 (T H 17) cells and their interactions with neutrophils and fibroblasts through the forkhead box O (FOXO) signaling pathway. Specifically, SiO 3 2− inhibits the hyperdifferentiation of CD4 + T cells to T H 17 cells by regulating FOXO1 and neutrophils to neutrophil extracellular traps as well as fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by regulating FOXO3, thereby ultimately disrupting the vicious cycle of myocardial inflammation and subsequent fibrotic lesions in iDCM.

However, particular roles of rigid and flexible parts in layer formations remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate formation of an unprecedented superlayer cocrystal phase via a unique smectic LC phase in the equimolar melt mixture of symmetrically distinct molecules. The molecules used are a monoalkylated [(π-core)-C n ] using 2-octyl[1]benzothieno[3,2- b ][1]benzothiophene (mono-C 8 -BTBT) and a dialkylated [C n -(π-core)-C n ] using 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2- b ][1]benzothiophene (di-C 8 -BTBT). Thermal analyses show that the superlayer cocrystal is exclusively induced at the equimolar mixture via melt crystallization from the LC phase. X-ray structure analysis reveals a reversible C n -(π-core)-C n ···(π-core)-C n stacking arrangement in the superlayer cocrystal, where π-cores and alkyl chains form nearly independent layers. Notably, this melt crystallization allows solvent-free fabrication of semiconductive polycrystalline films for excellent thin-film transistors.

Fear extinction is considered to rely mostly on neuronal function. However, whether and how astrocytes contribute to fear extinction is largely unknown. Here, we show that hippocampal CA1 astrocytes exhibit de novo Ca 2+ dynamics during fear extinction. Inhibition of these astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics impairs, while their activation facilitates, fear extinction. In this regulation of fear extinction, the posterior basal forebrain (pBF) cholinergic input to hippocampus drives CA1 astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics through the activation of α4 and α7 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Clinically used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases CA1 astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics and facilitates fear extinction. Thus, our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized and crucial pathway from pBF cholinergic neurons to CA1 astrocytes that governs natural fear extinction. This neuron-glia signaling pathway may constitute a promising target for treatment of fear- and anxiety-related disorders.",

Taking the antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr bilayer as a prototype, we theoretically show that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a unique SHG with exceptional tunability but also promotes the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection techniques.",

Here we present cryo–electron microscopy reconstructions of Acinetobacter baumannii TolQ in apo and TolR-bound forms at atomic resolution. The apo TolQ configuration manifests as a symmetric pentameric pore, featuring a transmembrane funnel leading toward a cytoplasmic chamber. In contrast, the TolQ-TolR complex assumes a proton nonpermeable stance, characterized by the TolQ pentamer’s flexure to accommodate the TolR dimer, where two protomers undergo a translation-based relationship. Our structure-guided analysis and simulations support the rotor-stator mechanism of action, wherein the rotation of the TolQ pentamer harmonizes with the TolR protomers’ interplay. These findings broaden our mechanistic comprehension of molecular stator units empowering critical functions within the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope.",

Here, we report a modular protocol for short de novo synthesis of bis-α-chiral amines. This protocol uses commercially available Ellman sulfinamide, tert -butanesulfinamide ( t BS), as the exclusive chiral source to selectively produce all possible stereoisomers. Sequential formation of contiguous α-amino chiral carbons is achieved by chirality induction and transfer mechanisms that are both enabled by t BS, the stereoselective imine functionalization and alkyne-participated rearrangement reaction.

Incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles has profound effects on viral spread; however, the mechanisms promoting their incorporation were unknown. We found that depletion of cellular PIP 2 blocks incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles. Expansion microscopy revealed that PIP 2 depletion diminishes nanoscale coclustering between viral structural protein Gag and the three transmembrane proteins at the PM and that Gag induces PIP 2 enrichment at its vicinity. CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 also increased local PIP 2 density, revealing their PIP 2 affinity.

The fabricated B 4 C beams exhibit a high ductility (~26.8%) at room temperature, a characteristic previously unattained in covalent materials and comparable to metals. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that the formation of local amorphous regions after B 4 C lattice exceeded its elastic strain limit, causing plastic deformation. Atomistic simulations, using experimentally observed B 4 C models, reveal that the creation of carbon-carbon bonds in chains containing boron vacancies causes localized amorphization and contributes to the plastic deformation. This research highlights the significance of vacancies in facilitating plastic deformation in B 4 C and suggests a potential strategy to improve the ductility of strong covalent materials.",

          "abstract": "OxPhos inhibitors have struggled to show a clinical benefit because of their inability to distinguish healthy from cancerous mitochondria. Herein, we describe an actionable bioenergetic mechanism unique to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mitochondria. Unlike healthy cells that couple respiration to ATP synthesis, AML mitochondria support inner-membrane polarization by consuming ATP. Matrix ATP consumption allows cells to survive bioenergetic stress. Thus, we hypothesized AML cells may resist chemotherapy-induced cell death by reversing the ATP synthase reaction. In support, BCL-2 inhibition with venetoclax abolished OxPhos flux without affecting mitochondrial polarization. In surviving AML cells, sustained mitochondrial polarization depended on matrix ATP consumption. Mitochondrial ATP consumption was further enhanced in AML cells made refractory to venetoclax, consequential to down-regulations in the endogenous F 1 -ATPase inhibitor ATP5IF1. Knockdown of ATP5IF1 conferred venetoclax resistance, while ATP5IF1 overexpression impaired F 1 -ATPase activity and heightened sensitivity to venetoclax. These data identify matrix ATP consumption as a cancer cell–intrinsic bioenergetic vulnerability actionable in the context of BCL-2 targeted chemotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Mounting evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) are still largely unknown. In this study, we found an lncRNA, PCa-associated transcript 71 (PRCAT71), highly expressed in metastatic and primary PCa compared to benign prostate tissues. Silencing PRCAT71 inhibited cancerous properties of PCa cells and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Mechanistically, PRCAT71 acts as a scaffold to recruit K homology (KH)–type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) to AR messenger RNA (mRNA) and stabilize AR mRNA, leading to activated AR signaling. KHSRP plays a critical role in PCa progression. PRCAT71 is transcriptionally regulated by AR-driven enhancers, forming a positive regulatory loop between AR and PRCAT71 in PCa. Our study demonstrates a coordinated regulation of AR mRNA by lncRNA PRCAT71 and RNA binding protein KHSRP and provides insight that the PRCAT71-KHSRP-AR axis is a promising therapeutic target for treating PCa.",

Further, expression profiles of the identified gene clusters suggest that both cyanobacteria populations experience simultaneous nitrogen and iron stresses in a transition zone between North Pacific oceanic gyres.

Despite decades of research into muscle regeneration, the specific molecular factors that trigger the transition of MuSCs from a quiescent to an active state remain largely unidentified. Here, we identify transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), an Mg 2+ -permeable ion channel, as a critical regulator of MuSC activation. Trpm7 deletion in MuSCs reduced Mg 2+ influx, impairing myofiber regeneration and leading to decreased MuSC numbers and cell cycle arrest during regeneration. These changes were linked to disrupted mTOR signaling, which drives the transition of MuSCs from G 0 to G Alert phase. In addition, Trpm7 -deficient MuSCs exhibited impaired early responses, including quiescent projection retraction and AP-1 induction. Mg 2+ supplementation rescued these defects, restoring normal MuSC activation. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism where Mg 2+ permeation through TRPM7 is essential for MuSC activation and efficient skeletal muscle regeneration, highlighting TRPM7 as a critical regulator of muscle repair.",

Here, we present spectroscopic evidence for a magnonic SRPT in ErFeO 3 , where the role of the photonic mode (two-level atoms) in the photonic SRPT is played by an Fe 3+ magnon mode (Er 3+ spins). The absence of the diamagnetic term in the Fe 3+ -Er 3+ exchange coupling ensures that the no-go theorem does not apply. Ultrabroadband terahertz and gigahertz magnetospectroscopy experiments revealed the signatures of the SRPT in thermal equilibrium, a kink and a softening, respectively, of two spin-magnon hybridized modes at the critical point. Systems near this phase are expected to harbor large-scale squeezing, which will potentially provide a route to next-generation quantum technologies.",

It can also hop on a dynamically rotating plane, recover from strong collisions, and perform somersaults.

Pro-inflammatory [RLR (retinoic acid–inducible gene I–like receptor)–dependent pathway] and cell growth inhibitory mechanisms [oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/ribonuclease L (RNase L)– and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)–dependent pathways] can act independently. We found that the 5′ ends of dsRNA direct the onset of cellular inflammation, whereas the RNA duplex activates the OAS/RNase L and PKR pathways. Unexpectedly, three of the most common human RNA epitranscriptomic marks—i.e., N 6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and pseudouridine—had almost no influence on the immunogenicity of dsRNA; however, the presence of N 6-methyladenosine inhibited the OAS/RNase L pathway.

Directing attention toward translational regulation as a bridge between these events can yield additional insights into previously unexplained mechanisms. Our functional CRISPR interference screen–based approach revealed that EIF3D, a translation initiation factor, is crucial for maintaining primed pluripotency. Loss of EIF3D disrupted the balance of pluripotency-associated signaling pathways, thereby compromising primed pluripotency. Moreover, EIF3D ensured robust proliferation by controlling the translation of various p53 regulators, which maintain low p53 activity in the undifferentiated state. In this way, EIF3D-mediated translation contributes to tuning the homeostasis of the primed pluripotency networks, ensuring the maintenance of an undifferentiated state with high proliferative potential. This study provides further insights into the translation network in maintaining pluripotency.",

We determine the structure of the holo insertase complex, where SurA binds BAM for substrate delivery. High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of four different states and a three-dimensional variability analysis show that the holo insertase complex has a large motional spectrum. SurA bound to BAM can undergo a large swinging motion between two states. This motion is uncoupled from the conformational flexibility of the BamA barrel, which can open and close without affecting SurA binding. Notably, we observed conformational coupling of the SurA swing state and the carboxyl-terminal helix grip domain of BamC.

In one complex, the mitochondrial trafficking adaptor MIRO recruits ARMC1, which mediates the assembly of a mitochondrial fission regulator (MTFR). MTFR stability depends on ARMC1, and MIRO-MTFR complexes specifically antagonize retrograde mitochondrial movement. In another complex, DNAJC11 facilitates ARMC1 release from mitochondria. Disrupting MIRO-MTFR assembly fails to rescue aberrant mitochondrial distributions clustered in the perinuclear area observed with ARMC1 deletion, while disrupting ARMC1 interaction with DNAJC11 leads to excessive mitochondrially localized ARMC1 and distinct mitochondrial defects.

          "abstract": "Serine proteases have been proposed to dynamically sample inactive and active conformations, but direct evidence at atomic resolution has remained elusive. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we identified a single residue, D164, in exfoliative toxin A (ETA) that acts as a molecular “switch” to regulate global dynamic sampling. Mutations at this site shift the balance between inactive and active states, correlating directly with catalytic activity. Beyond identifying this dynamic switch, we demonstrate how it works in concert with other allosterically coupled sites to rationally control enzyme movements and catalytic function. This study provides a framework for linking conformational dynamics to function and paves the way for engineering enzymes, in particular, proteases, with tailored activities for applications in medicine and biotechnology.",

Here we report an autocatalytic assembly pathway that generates a chimeric, amino acid–bridged aminoacyl-RNA synthetase ribozyme. The noncovalent complex of ribozyme fragments initiates low-level aminoacylation of one of the fragments, which, after loop-closing ligation, generates a highly active covalently linked chimeric ribozyme. The generation of this ribozyme is increasingly efficient over time due to the autocatalytic assembly cycle that sustains the ribozyme over indefinite cycles of serial dilution. Because of its trans activity, this ribozyme also assembles ribozymes distinct from itself, such as the hammerhead, suggesting that RNA aminoacylation, coupled with nonenzymatic ligation, could have facilitated the emergence and propagation of ribozymes.",

To this end, cold (≈50 K) antihydrogen will traverse a two-grid moiré deflectometer before annihilating onto a position-sensitive detector, which shall determine the vertical position of the annihilation vertex relative to the grids with micrometric accuracy. Here, we introduce a vertexing detector based on a modified mobile camera sensor and experimentally demonstrate that it can measure the position of antiproton annihilations within 0.62 − 0.22 + 0.40 μm, a 35-fold improvement over the previous state of the art for real-time antiproton vertexing. These methods are directly applicable to antihydrogen. Moreover, the sensitivity to light of the sensor enables in situ calibration of the moiré deflectometer, substantially reducing systematic errors. This sensor emerges as a breakthrough technology toward the AEḡIS scientific goals and will constitute the basis for the development of a large-area detector for conducting antihydrogen gravity measurements.",

To achieve this, we needed five types of improvements: (i) optimization of AARS sequences for efficient translation, (ii) optimization of the composition of the translation system to enhance translation, (iii) employment of another bacterial AlaRS and SerRS to improve each aminoacylation activity, (iv) diminishing the translational inhibition caused by certain AARS sequences by codon optimization and EF-P addition, and (v) balancing the DNA concentrations of 20 AARS to match each requirement. After these improvements, we succeeded in the sustainable regeneration of all 20 AARS for up to 20 cycles of 2.5-fold serial dilutions.

          "abstract": "Despite 40 years of conservation of the critically endangered Chinese alligator ( Alligator sinensis ), the genomic underpinnings of its status remained uncharted. Genome sequencing data of 244 individuals uncovered relatively low overall genomic diversity/heterozygosity and long runs of homozygosity, with captive populations exhibiting higher heterozygosity and smaller inbreeding coefficients compared to wild individuals. The decreased level of inbreeding in the captive population demonstrates the contribution of the large captive breeding population. The estimated recent effective population size was around a few dozen. To combat challenges of inbreeding depression and reduced adaptability, we used genome-wide SNP-based kinship analysis on captive populations to enable a genome-informed breeding program that minimizes inbreeding. Long-term field monitoring revealed that the Chinese government greatly advanced the conservation of A. sinensis through conservation measures and reintroduction programs. Our research enriches the understanding of the Chinese alligator’s genetic landscape, offering invaluable genomic resources for breeding and conservation strategies.",

We developed a mouse model overexpressing a mutated transfer RNA synthetase in muscle fibers, enabling specific protein labeling using an artificial methionine substitute, which can be revealed through click chemistry. This model revealed that denervation increases protein labeling in oxidative muscle fibers through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, while deleting the mTORC1 scaffold protein Raptor reduces labeling in glycolytic fibers. On the other hand, increased muscle activity acutely decreases protein synthesis, accompanied by reduced mTORC1 signaling, glycogen depletion, and adenosine 5′-monophosphate kinase activation.

Using this approach, we are able to realistically reconstruct large and irregular areas of missing data and to reproduce known historical events, such as strong El Niño or La Niña events, with very little given information. Our method outperforms the widely used statistical kriging method, as well as other recent machine learning approaches.

Acid-rich concentration spikes matched the distribution of high-temperature fumaroles, whereas CO 2 is emitted broadly from high- and low-temperature fumaroles. The CO 2 flux was 15 to 41 kilograms per second from hot fumaroles and 61 to 131 kilograms per second for the overall plume. The typical CO 2 flux calculation of multiplying CO 2 /SO 2 ratio with SO 2 flux underestimates total CO 2 flux by at least threefold. We quantified substantial magmatic gas scrubbing by the hydrothermal system, with 56 to 79% of initial HCl and 33 to 68% of initial SO 2 lost. This study highlights the importance of precise acid-gas measurements for detecting heterogeneous degassing and suggests that traditional CO 2 flux measurements may substantially underestimate contributions from cold CO 2 degassing, leading to underestimated global volcanic fluxes.",

Dogs have acquired exquisite face processing abilities during domestication and may serve as an effective animal model for studying genetic associations of ASD-like atypical face processing. Here, we showed that dogs with Shank3 mutations exhibited behavioral and attentional avoidance of faces, contrasting with wild-type controls. Moreover, neural responses specific to faces (versus objects) recorded from the electrodes over the temporal cortex were significantly decreased and delayed in Shank3 mutants compared to wild-type controls. Cortical responses in the frontal/parietal region underlying categorization of faces by species/breeds were reduced in Shank3 mutants.

Previous research has provided several interpretations of this attraction, including potential drug abuse, or a self-medicating coping strategy after mate rejection. We posit that the ecologically adaptive value of alcohol attraction has not been fully explored. Here, we assert a simple yet vital biological rationale for this alcohol preference. Flies display attraction to fruits rich in alcohol, specifically ethanol and methanol, where contact results in a rapid amplification of fatty acid–derived pheromones that enhance courtship success. We also identify olfactory sensory neurons that detect these alcohols, where we reveal roles in both attraction and aversion, and show that valence is balanced around alcohol concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that methanol can be deadly, and adult flies must therefore accurately weigh the trade-off between benefits and costs for exposure within their naturally fermented and alcohol-rich environments.",

We use model-free reinforcement learning to compare the effect of curriculum (i.e., combinations of lift and rotation tasks) and haptic information (i.e., no-tactile versus 3D-force) on learning with a simulated three-finger robotic hand. In addition, a novel curriculum-based learning rate scheduler accelerates convergence. We demonstrate that the choice of curriculum biases the progression of learning for dexterous manipulation across objects with different weights, sizes, and shapes—underscoring the robustness of our learning approach. Unexpectedly, learning is achieved even in the absence of haptic information. This challenges conventional thinking about task “complexity” and the necessity of haptic information for dexterous manipulation for this task.

Here, we present a versatile denial-of-spread (DoS) strategy to target and eliminate specific conjugative plasmids. Our strategy exploits retrotransfer, whereby an engineered DoS plasmid is introduced into host cells containing a target plasmid. Acting as a predatory gene drive, DoS propagates itself at the expense of the target plasmid, through competition or active elimination. Once the target plasmid is eradicated, DoS is removed via induced plasmid suicide, resulting in a community containing neither plasmid. The strategy is tunable and scalable for various conjugative plasmids, different mechanisms of plasmid inheritance interruption, and diverse environmental contexts. DoS represents a new tool for precise control of gene persistence in microbial communities.",

This effect is explained by intra- and intervalley scattering processes mediated by E 2g and A ′ 1 phonon modes, which we directly observe via ultrafast electron diffraction and identify via ab initio calculations. Conversely, smaller electron-hole pockets (Δ q ≃0.7 Å −1 ) result in the renormalization of in-plane plasmons, which can only be partially explained by phonon-mediated scattering and thermal expansion.

To address these limitations, we synthesized over 10 fluorophore-labeled samples to probe the conformational changes of the riboswitch at the single-molecule level. By integrating these dynamic findings with steady-state fluorescence titration, mutagenesis, in vivo assays, and strand displacement strategy, we transformed the natural aptamer into a c-di-AMP biosensor. This engineered biosensor reversed its genetic output from \"OFF\" to \"ON\" upon c-di-AMP binding, exhibiting a 50-fold improvement in the c-di-AMP detection limit.

Here, we integrated 249,156 fibroblasts from 73 studies across 10 tissues to present a single-cell atlas of fibroblasts. We provided a high-resolution classification of 18 fibroblast subtypes. In particular, we revealed a previously undescribed cell population, TSPAN8 + chromatin remodeling fibroblasts, characterized by high expression of genes with functions related to histone modification and chromatin remodeling. Moreover, TSPAN8 + chromatin remodeling fibroblasts were detectable in spatial transcriptome data and multiplexed immunofluorescence assays. Compared with other fibroblast subtypes, TSPAN8 + chromatin remodeling fibroblasts exhibited higher scores in cell differentiation and resident fibroblast, mainly interacting with endothelial cells and T cells through ligand VEGFA and receptor F2R , and their presence was associated with poor prognosis. Our analyses comprehensively defined the shared and specific characteristics of fibroblast subtypes across tissues and provided a user-friendly data portal, Fibroblast Atlas.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain conditions frequently coexist and share common genetic vulnerabilities. Despite evidence showing associations between pain and depression, the additive effect of co-occurring pain conditions on depression risk and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Leveraging data from 431,038 UK Biobank participants with 14-year follow-up, we found a significantly increased risk of depression incidence in individuals reporting pain, irrespective of body site or duration (acute or chronic), compared with pain-free individuals. The depression risk increased with the number of co-occurring pain sites. Mendelian randomization supported potential causal inference. We constructed a composite pain score by combining individual effects of acute or chronic pain conditions across eight body sites in a weighted manner. We found that depression risks increased monotonically in parallel with composite pain scores. Moreover, some inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, partially mediated the association between composite pain scores and depression risk. Considering the high prevalence of comorbid depression and pain, pain screening may help identify high-risk individuals for depression.",

However, rational design of the catalyst support is challenged by a lack of clear property-activity relationships. Here, we uncover how the electronegativity of a support influences reaction pathways in electrochemical CO 2 reduction. This was achieved by creating a model system consisting of Cu nanoparticles hosted on a series of carbon supports, each with a different heteroatom dopant of varying electronegativity. Notably, we discovered that dopants with high electronegativity reduce the electron density on Cu and induce a selectivity shift toward multicarbon (C 2+ ) products. With this design principle, we built a composite Cu and F-doped carbon catalyst that achieves a C 2+ Faradaic efficiency of 82.5% at 400 mA cm −2 , with stable performance for 44 hours. Using simulated flue gas, the catalyst attains a C 2+ FE of 27.3%, which is a factor of 5.3 times higher than a reference Cu catalyst.",

However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying these remarkable abilities remain unclear due to the lack of high-resolution determination of DNA structures on SWCNTs. Here, we combine atomic force microscopy and single-particle cryo–electron microscopy to determine DNA structures on five different types of single-chirality SWCNTs, achieving unprecedented subnanometer resolution. This resolution enables the direct observation of left-handed helical DNA structures with pitches ranging from 1.59 to 2.20 nm, depending on the DNA sequence and nanotube chirality. These findings provide structural insights into the mechanisms by which DNA differentiates the chirality of SWCNTs, and governs the sensitivity, dynamic response range, and analyte differentiability of SWCNT sensors.

We introduce SHINE, the Self-supervised High-throughput Image denoising Neural network for Electron microscopy, accelerating minimally invasive low-dose EM of diverse material systems. SHINE uses only a single raw image dataset with intrinsic noise, which makes it suitable for limited-size datasets and eliminates the need for expensive ground-truth training datasets.

Following a prolonged withdrawal period, EtOH-exposed male rats exhibited deficits in adaptability and exploratory behavior, with aberrant outcome-driven value updating that heightened preference for chosen action. These behavioral changes were linked to altered neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), where EtOH increased outcome-related encoding and decreased choice-related encoding. In contrast, female rats showed minimal behavioral changes with distinct EtOH-evoked alterations of neural activity, revealing significant sex differences in the impact of chronic EtOH. Our findings underscore the impact of chronic EtOH exposure on adaptive decision-making, revealing enduring changes in neurocomputational processes in the striatum underlying cognitive deficits that differ by sex.",

First, we investigate neuronal timescale diversity, revealing that it disrupts intrinsic coherent spatiotemporal patterns, induces firing rate heterogeneity, enhances local responsive sensitivity, and aligns network activity closely with input. The system exhibits globally input-slaved transient dynamics, essential for reliable neural information processing. Other neural heterogeneities, such as nonuniform input connections, spike threshold heterogeneity, and network in-degree heterogeneity, play similar roles, highlighting the importance of neural heterogeneity in shaping consistent stimulus representation. This mechanism offers a potentially general framework for understanding neural heterogeneity in reliable computation and informs the design of reservoir computing models endowed with liquid wave reservoirs for neuromorphic computing.",

Herein, we proposed a hybrid microscale biomatter coassembly strategy that leverages the interactions between the inherent microarchitectures of waste cotton fiber and pollen particles. With minimal preprocessing, they form a castable slurry that can spontaneously organize into a dense fiber-laminate bioplastic network, exhibiting high mechanical properties (52.22 megapascals and 2.24 gigapascals) without using toxic organic chemicals or heavy machinery. The resulting bioplastic features controlled hydration-induced microstructural disassembly/reassembly, enabling water-based processability into complex, dynamic architectural systems. In addition, it demonstrates good biodegradability, closed-loop recyclability, and satisfactory environmental benefits, outperforming most common plastics. This study provides an instant nature-derived paradigm for bioplastics’ sustainable production, processing, and recycling, offering a promising solution for facilitating eco-friendly advanced applications.",

We report that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ligand spin immobilization demonstrate superior chemispintronic sensitivity and selectivity toward nitric oxide. Tetrathiafulvalene radical cations (TTF· + ) within the MOF lattice considerably enhance the nitric oxide recognition via spin exchange interactions, leading to a five–order of magnitude reduction in the limit of detection (LOD), as compared to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via carrier-doping mechanism.

Then, the prepared Dxm-loaded 3EVs (3EVs-Dxm) were membrane modified with ortho-dihydroxy groups (-2OH) and formed an EV-integrated hydrogel (3EVs-Dxm-Gel) via the cross-link with phenylboronic acid–modified hyaluronic acid and tannic acid. The phenylboronic acid ester in 3EVs-Dxm-Gel enabled effective immobilization and reactive oxygen species–responsive release of EVs.

By manipulating the viscosity of the reaction solution using various stable additives in both type and quantity, we identify a critical viscosity threshold of ~100 centipoise, which is essential for producing uniform faceted particles. With sodium hydroxide as an additive, a clear morphological evolution occurs as hydroxide concentration increases, shifting from regular cubes to edge-truncated, half-corner-truncated, and fully corner-truncated cube particles. Furthermore, the inclusion of additional sodium chloride and acetate substantially increases the viscosity, facilitating the formation of uniform faceted particles with reduced sizes ranging from ~2.0 micrometers to 200 nanometers. This method is successfully applied to synthesize other uniform perovskites, including Na 0.5 Y 0.395 Yb 0.1 Tm 0.005 TiO 3 , Na 0.5 Y 0.4 Eu 0.1 TiO 3 , Na 0.5 Y 0.39 Yb 0.1 Ho 0.01 TiO 3 , and Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO 3 .
